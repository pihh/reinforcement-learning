149190,370706,DLTR,Dollar General lifts profit forecast  tops third quarter expectations on sales,news," Reuters    Discount store operator  Dollar General Corp   N DG  raised its full year profit forecast on Thursday after reporting its best quarterly same store sales rise in nearly five years  benefiting from a wider selection of products and revamped stores 
Shares of the company rose about 5  in premarket trading as the retailer raised its adjusted profit for fiscal 2019 to the range of  6 55 to  6 65 per share from  6 45 to  6 60 
The retailer has been aggressively opening hundreds of new stores  creating private label and adding food  health and beauty products to its existing outlets as it tries to better compete with other retailers and grocers 
The efforts boosted same store sales growth to 4 6  in the third quarter ended Nov  1  above the average analyst estimate of 3 34  increase  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
The company now expects full year same store sales to grow in the mid to high 3  range compared with the prior low to mid 3  range 
The upbeat forecast comes in contrast to rival  Dollar Tree Inc   O DLTR   which cut its full year profit forecast last month  as the discount retailer fell short in its efforts to counter the impact of latest U S  tariffs on Chinese imports 
Dollar General s net sales rose 8 9  to  6 99 billion in the quarter  above the estimate of  6 92 billion 
Net income rose to  365 6 million  or  1 42 per share  from  334 1 million  or  1 26 per share  a year earlier 
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  1 38 per share ",2019-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dollar-general-lifts-profit-forecast-tops-thirdquarter-expectations-on-sales-2034479,2034479

149192,370708,DLTR,Dollar Tree Stock Is Down 20   But Investors Should Reject Mini Tender Offer,news,"Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  stock was pummeled in November after its earnings report resulted in the deep discounter reducing its sales outlook for the third consecutive quarter and lowering its profit forecast  
Shares trade at the same level now as they did a year ago  meaning investors have seen no benefit despite all the restructuring going on at the Family Dollar chain  So when private equity firm TRC Capital offered to buy their shares in a mini tender offer last month  investors might be tempted to leap at the chance of unloading their stock and getting out of a company that looks like it s going nowhere fast 
They should reconsider their position 

Not all tender offers are equal
Mini tender offers are not the same thing as tender offers  which many investors are likely more familiar with  In those cases  an investor or another company offers to buy an investor s shares  often at a premium  in order to take control of it or influence the direction it s taking  They are inviting investors to  tender   or sell their shares to them 
Last month  for example  Merck  NYSE MRK  launched a tender offer for ArQule  NASDAQ ARQL   offering to buy the company for  20 a share  or double the price ArQule was trading at before the tender was made  
That s not what is happening at Dollar Tree  and investors would do well to reject the offer 
Five top reasons to oppose the offer
Unlike Merck and ArQule  TRC Capital isn t looking to acquire Dollar Tree  but rather wants to buy 1 5 million shares of the discounter s stock  A mini tender offer is an effort to acquire less than 5  of a company s stock  Based on the 237 5 million shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter  TRC is looking to buy a measly 0 006  of the company  It s a sizable position TRC wants to have  to be sure  but it won t be able to direct or control where Dollar Tree is going  
Moreover  it wants to buy the stock at a discount  TRC offered to purchase Dollar Tree s stock from investors for  89 88 each  or 4 4  below where the retailer s stock was trading before the mini tender offer was made  Even though the stock has declined slightly since then  investors could still get more for their shares on the open market instead of selling to TRC 
Mini tender offers are something investors should generally dismiss out of hand if they receive one  Even though Dollar Tree says it s neutral on the offer  here are five reasons why investors should reject it 

It undervalues Dollar Tree s stock
Investors face numerous pitfalls in tendering their shares
The SEC urges caution about participating in them
They prey on new or uninformed investors
It s a way for a buyer to make a quick buck

Only one side wins
As noted before  TRC is offering to buy Dollar Tree s stock for less than what it s trading at on the open market  so for that reason alone  investors should ignore the offer  But they re also largely unregulated  and once investors agree to participate in one  they cannot withdraw 
Regular tender offers have strict SEC rules to follow  yet so long as the buyer doesn t outright lie  they typically fly under the regulatory agency s oversight  
The SEC even warns that mini tender offers  have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard  and reiterates that none of the protections investors have with regular tender offers exist with mini tender offers 
TRC Capital could also make a quick buck if it acquired all the shares it wanted to and then immediately turned around and sold them  But it s also just as likely the PE firm sees a good chance Dollar Tree s stock is a good value and will go up  and by acquiring shares at a discount  it can make even a bigger profit later on 
A surprise in the making 
A lot of Dollar Tree s more cautious sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year were predicated on the next round of tariffs being imposed on Chinese made goods  but with the lull in tensions as the two sides prepare to sign new trade agreements  the deep discounter could end up surprising Wall Street when it reports its results 
With much of the bad news already baked into Dollar Tree s stock price  this mini tender offer presents TRC Capital with a chance to make a decent profit if it hangs onto whatever shares it gains ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfhfs,2055117

Info tech  consumer services and industrials have been the strongest performers over the past 52 weeks  Yet measured from the December 2018 low  the clear winner is the real estate sector having racked up  17 3   In fact  over this period the only other sector to gain is the communications sector at  2 9  
The energy sector remains effectively rangebound  much like crude oil after its failure to break out of its 9 month high  It s also the only sector to trade lower over the past 52 weeks  and trail other sectors performance by a long shot 














1  Fortune Brand Home   Security  NYSE FBHS   A breakout to new highs has been supported by a strong trend structure  following a period of consolidation at the highs  Furthermore  the breakout was seen in higher than average volume but  The trend remains bullish above 66 34 but traders could seek bullish setups above 66 15 
Bulls could seek dips above 64 34  Although a direct break above yesterday s high could entice momentum traders  who could use 66 15 to aid with risk management In Feb 2018 a gap occurred between 67 84   69 76 but  given the strength of the trend  we re targeting the upside of the gap at 69 76 A break below 64 34 invalidates the bullish bias over the near term

A break above yesterday s high assumes direct gains  and the 155 79 resistance level can be used to aid risk management If prices consolidate  bulls could use the 152 swing low to maintain their bullish bias  as a break below it invalidates the setup  Bulls could use an open target with it being at record highs

Bulls could wait for a retracement and to see if either the 167 56 breakout level or bullish trendline holds as support Alternatively  if prices consolidate for several days and provide a shallow back  momentum traders could seek a break of the highs Bias remains bullish above 167 56

149409,370925,DLTR,Dollar Tree Chopped By Tariffs  Facing More Near Term Risk ,opinion,"Summary  Dollar Tree Inc   NASDAQ DLTR  fell 15  on Tuesday after the company posted earnings that missed Wall Street expectations  
Based on its market cycles  we believe the stock has further downside risk before a potential bounce 






The company reported earnings per share of  1 08 and total revenue of  5 75 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  1 13 and  5 74 billion  Looking forward  management lowered their earnings guidance to  1 70 to  1 80 per share  compared to the  2 02 consensus  
CEO Gary Philbin blamed tariffs imposed by the US government on Chinese imports and said the  expected the impact on earnings guidance is  0 06 per share for the current quarter  
Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  On the weekly chart above  we can see that DLTR is in the declining phase of its current cycle  with time still remaining  We also note the megaphone top in formation 




On the daily chart  we can clearly see the gap lower on significant volume  from which it will be hard for DLTR to recover fully  The timing for the next cycle low is between mid December and mid January  Our target is the  89 support level from the previous cycle

149476,370992,DLTR,Dollar Tree  DLTR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  39 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 72 billion  up 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree 
For Dollar Tree  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Dollar Tree will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 14  delivering a surprise of  0 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dollar Tree appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-tree-dltr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200457537,200457537

149523,371039,DLTR,U S  stocks mixed  falling sharply amid hawkish Fed stance on June hike,news,"Investing com    U S  stocks were mixed on Wednesday  as the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed territory late in the session after the Federal Reserve sent strong signals that it will raise interest rates at a closely watched meeting next month if economic data continues to improve as expected 
On Wednesday afternoon  the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  said in the minutes from its April meeting that it is leaving the possibility open for a June rate hike as the economy continues to strengthen and headwinds from global financial markets continue to recede  Since raising the Federal Funds Rate in December for the first time in seven years  the FOMC has left its benchmark interest rate steady in each of its three meetings this year  The FOMC cited a stable dollar  rising equity prices and a strong labor market as factors for tightening monetary policy  while noting that weak inflation and the potential of a U K  departure from the European Union could lead to a delay in the first rate hike of 2016  Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for equities  as investors pile into U S  Treasuries and the dollar in order to capitalize on higher yields

149525,371041,DLTR,Analysts Estimate Dollar Tree  DLTR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 80 billion  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree 
For Dollar Tree  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 44  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dollar Tree will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of  1 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  0 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dollar Tree doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-dollar-tree-dltr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200424432,200424432

149563,371079,DLTR,Wall Street faces toughest regulatory challenge yet on new loan review,news,"By Lynn Adler and Kristen Haunss NEW YORK  Reuters    Big investment banks are facing their toughest test yet in the current 2015 Shared National Credit  SNC  review  months after regulators warned the banks that the quality of U S  leveraged loans that they arranged was not as good as the banks claimed  sources said  Regulators met with banks earlier this year after monthly monitoring started in 2014 revealed that several deals that banks claimed were in  good standing  were riskier than recorded  four people with knowledge of the discussions said  Updated leveraged lending guidelines were introduced in March 2013 to curb risky lending that regulators deemed could pose a systemic threat if unchecked  Regulators followed up and issued Matters Requiring Attention  MRA  letters to banks in the third quarter of 2013 and took an even tougher line and sent at least one Matters Requiring Immediate Attention  MRIA  notice   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  received an MRIA in September 2014  sources said  Although the regulators  discovery that the quality of loans that banks were arranging was not as good as they claimed did not prompt regulatory action other than requests to improve  it raised the stakes for this year s SNC review  which is currently under way  The SNC review  which looks at the quality of bank loans  is now an annual exam with a single report  but starting next year there will be two exam periods with a single report  Banks identified in the SNC review that fail to meet regulators  standards may be fined or penalized  according to bankers and attorneys   The process of the SNC review and ultimately the report will be significant   Alan Avery  a partner in the corporate department at Latham   Watkins in New York  said in an interview   Either there are more satisfactory approaches being taken or there are not  and either way it s going to be a big deal   The guidelines  which took effect in May 2013  are designed to make the  840 billion U S  leveraged loan market  which extends credit to non investment grade rated companies  including pet retailer PetSmart Inc  NASDAQ PETM  and discount retailer  Dollar Tree Inc   NASDAQ DLTR   safer  Regulators found that certain lending characteristics were  aggressive  and flagged in the guidelines covenant lite loans and debt compared to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   or leverage  of more than 6 0 times  The guidelines also said loans should be able to pay back at least 50 percent of total debt within five to seven years  The regulatory crackdown helped push leverage ratios to 5 99 times earnings in the first three months of 2015  the lowest level since the same quarter in 2013  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data   It is important and interesting that the regulators are using the SNC process as a vehicle to deliver a coordinated view on how the leveraged lending guidance has been implemented   Avery said  The regulators  have tied SNC with implementation  so it becomes increasingly important each year as a tool to best judge how things are being implemented   2015 REVIEW The Federal Reserve  Fed   the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  OCC  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  FDIC  conduct the SNC to scrutinize the credit quality of large loan commitments made by the banks   It s really this SNC review that s going to be the opportunity for the regulators to give effective and meaningful guidance to banks   J  Paul Forrester  a partner focused on corporate finance at Mayer Brown in Chicago  said in an interview  Last year regulators put more emphasis on leveraged lending and released a supplement about implementation of the 2013 guidelines and answers to frequently asked questions after bankers complained about a lack of clarity and consistency  Regulators said last year that banks continued to  originate a large volume of non pass transactions at inception   and found that 31 percent of loans had weak underwriting structures  according to the leveraged lending supplement  Bankers and lawyers say that guidance  rather than rules  still leaves some lending practices unclear   In 2013 the regulators gave us the new guidance that said 6 0 times leverage was really bad   Forrester said   In 2014 they said 6 0 times was not necessarily a bright line test but it s still pretty bad  If they really want to curb excessive leverage  I think they ve got to be more granular and specific  and they can t leave it as vague as the current guidance is   Spokespeople for the Fed  OCC and FDIC declined to comment  AGGRESSIVE LENDING U S  leveraged loan volume has fallen since the guidelines were issued  with  41 billion of institutional loans arranged in the United States in the first quarter  77 percent lower than the same period of 2014  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data  and well below the pace that led to an annual record of  625 5 billion in 2013  Average total leverage ratios on large corporate buyouts were 6 11 times when the guidance went into effect in 2013  Leverage continued to climb after the guidelines were issued  rising as high of 6 96 times in the third quarter of 2014  and then falling the next two quarters  Debt levels have remained the same in the current quarter  with average leverage on large buyouts hitting 5 98 times as of June 23  according to the data  Total leverage remains well below the 7 1 times set in 2007  a 12 year peak based on LPC figures dating back to 2003  and below the 6 0 times regulatory hurdle that the guidelines said  raises concerns   Large corporate loans with ratios of more than 7 0 times accounted for 6 7 percent of buyout deals announced in the current quarter  down from 12 5 percent in the first three months of the year and sharply lower than the 42 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2014  according to the data  While leverage is falling  a perhaps unintended consequence of the regulatory pressure is that more debt is being arranged by lenders that are not overseen by the Fed  OCC or FDIC  
 The guidance is already having an impact   Brad Rogoff  a credit analyst at  Barclays   LONDON BARC   said in an interview   The average leverage for new LBOs has certainly come down and deals with high leverage are being done by non regulated entities    Editing By Tessa Walsh and Michelle Sierra ",2015-06-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/wall-street-faces-toughest-regulatory-challenge-yet-on-new-loan-review-347821,347821

The Quantumtrading volatility indicator triggers in real time and signals the price action has moved outside its average true range and confirming two aspects of volatility which can best be described as the compression of time  The first aspect is the market makers are participating and second  once volatility appears  congestion is likely to follow as the price action retraces within the spread of the candle  And it can also result in a full reversal from the primary trend higher to primary trend lower 
In this case  the first volatility candle appeared on March 6 which was accompanied with extreme volume  with the second candle triggered the following day on high volume  This was followed by congestion and consolidation  with a further sign of weakness on the two bar reversal of March 11 and 12  Since then we have seen rising volume and falling prices which confirm the weakness now building for this stock 
Below are two strong levels of price support and denoted with the red dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator  The second is at  94 20  If the first of these is breached  then the second is likely to be tested also  and should this fail we could see the stock move down to a third level of support at  87 80 in the longer term

149619,371135,DLTR,Exclusive  Icahn sells entire stake in Family Dollar   sources,news,"By Nadia Damouni NEW YORK  Reuters    Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has sold his entire stake in Family Dollar Stores Inc  N FDO   making a profit of about  200 million on the investment  according to sources familiar with the matter on Wednesday 
Dollar Tree Inc  O DLTR  agreed in July to buy Family Dollar for  8 5 billion  Since then  however  the deep discount retailer has drawn competing interest from Dollar General Corp  N DG   which has bid  9 1 billion for its smaller rival 
Icahn became Family Dollar s largest shareholder in June  when he disclosed a 9 4 percent stake in the struggling retailer and pushed the company to sell itself 
At the end of July  Icahn disclosed he had reduced his position to 3 61 percent 
It was not clear when Icahn sold the remaining stake  But his decision could indicate he did not expect a tussle for Family Dollar between its two suitors to lead to a substantial increase in the deal price  His decision also reduces some activist pressure on Family Dollar

149620,371136,DLTR,Family Dollar spurns Dollar General again,news,"By Siddharth Cavale  Reuters    Family Dollar Stores Inc rejected Dollar General Corp s sweetened takeover bid  saying the offer still did not address antitrust concerns  raising the prospect that the No  1 U S  deep discount chain will go  hostile  with its offer 
Dollar General raised its offer for Family Dollar Stores on Tuesday by 2 percent to  9 1 billion  or  80 per share  and said it was willing to sell up to 1 500 stores to clear any antitrust review 
Dollar General also offered to pay  500 million as break up fee and warned it may take the offer directly to Family Dollar s shareholders if it was spurned again 
 There is a very real and material risk that the transaction proposed by Dollar General would fail to close  after a lengthy and disruptive review process   Family Dollar Chief Executive Howard Levine said in a statement on Friday 
Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General s initial all cash offer on antitrust concerns and said it would stick with an  8 5 billion  or  74 50 per share  cash and stock offer from Dollar Tree Inc 
Dollar General said on Friday it would continue to pursue its smaller rival and was evaluating its next steps 
 While we are hard pressed at this point to predict the next chapter in this ongoing soap opera  we think Dollar General is likely to come back to the table with a revised proposal  which will probably contain its own  hell or highwater  provisions   BB T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note 
Dollar General s shares were down 2 9 percent at  62 55  while Family Dollar was down 1 6 percent at  78 80 in afternoon trading 
Dollar Tree said on Friday it amended its merger agreement with Family Dollar to include a commitment to divest as many stores as necessary to clear antitrust hurdles  It had previously agreed to divest 500 stores 
Family Dollar  the second largest U S  dollar store chain  said it expects the Federal Trade Commission to challenge a deal with Dollar General as it could lead to higher prices in areas where only the two are present 
Dollar General has played down antitrust concerns  saying that Wal Mart Stores Inc was the primary driver for its pricing decisions  not Family Dollar 
But Family Dollar said shedding just 1 500 stores was not enough 
 Dollar General and Family Dollar compete in thousands of local geographies  with more than 6 000 Family Dollar stores competing with a Dollar General store within three miles   the company said   Many of these stores   far more than 1 500   do not have a Wal Mart within the same distance  
Dollar Tree s bid is friendlier to Family Dollar s management  Under the agreement  Levine will remain CEO of Family Dollar if it was bought by Dollar Tree 
But he is widely expected to lose his job if Dollar General succeeds in buying Family Dollar  although this has not been confirmed 
Dollar Tree also said on Friday it expected the Federal Trade Commission to issue a  second request  for additional information on Sept  8  The company said it now expects the deal to close by November 2014  well before its earlier forecast of early 2015 

Dollar Tree shares were up 0 3 percent at  55 21

The deal  announced Monday  positions the company as the largest discount retailer in the United States by store count  with more than 13 000 stores to Dollar General s approximately 11 000 stores 
 They leap frog over Dollar General and at least for now are the biggest dollar store player  giving them bragging rights   said Stephen Hoch  professor emeritus of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania s Wharton School 
But bragging rights only get one s business so far  The bigger competitor to worry about is not so much other dollar store retailers  Hoch pointed out  as it is Wal Mart    which boasts  476 billion in annual revenue across 11 000 or so stores  compared to approximately  18 billion for a combined Dollar Tree and Family Dollar 
The real value  then  of the merger is that it creates  significantly greater clout with suppliers   Hoch said 
 Now Dollar Tree is not buying 8 million pencils  they re buying 16 million pencils   said analyst Laura Champine  managing director for retail and consumer products equity research Canaccord Genuity  With more volume comes more savings   and you can pass that on to the consumers   she said   

With the merger  the brands will continue to operate and expand under their respective banners  Dollar General with its  Everything s  1  mantra of bargain hunting fun  and Family Dollar with its multi price point discount strategy   4 for a package of Kraft cheese singles   12 for a 14 inch tabletop charcoal grill  
Family Dollar is already a competitor to Wal Mart for that  small  convenience  trip to the store  Champine said  But now the brand  and its customers  stands to gain from Dollar General s superior merchandising   Family Dollar is likely to have better looking product  better looking stores   and  potentially better prices   Champine said

149638,371154,DLTR,Dollar General enters race for Family Dollar with  8 95 billion bid,news,By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Devika Krishna Kumar   Reuters    Dollar General Corp offered to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc for  8 95 billion  trumping a bid by Dollar Tree Inc and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny pinching customers   Shares of Family Dollar  the No  2 U S  discount chain  rose as much as 5 2 percent to  80 00 in regular trading  above the offer price of  78 50 per share in cash  suggesting that investors anticipate a bidding war    Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree have some capacity to go a little bit higher with the offer price   said Joseph Feldman  analyst at Telsey Advisory Group   Dollar stores have been a popular choice for low  and middle income U S  consumers in a weak economy    At the same time  Wal Mart Stores Inc and other large retailers which serve a similar customer base have been struggling with weak sales amid a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home   The U S  market for dollar stores grew 45 7 percent to  48 2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years  according to Euromonitor International   But the growth has recently started slowing due to intense competition  Kahn said    We have a tremendous amount of strength in the rural communities and we have things to learn in the metro   Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said on a conference call   Family Dollar is just the reverse    The combined company would have nearly 20 000 stores across 46 U S  states and annual sales in excess of  28 billion   It would also allow Dollar General to retain its No  1 spot among U S  dollar stores  Dollar Tree s  8 5 billion bid for Family Dollar  announced on July 28  would have vaulted that merged company ahead of Dollar General   Combined  the three dollar chains  annual sales total about  35 billion   less than a tenth of Wal Mart s  473 billion   Dreiling  who will postpone a retirement planned for next year to stay on as CEO of the combined company through May 2016  said Dollar General had faced stiffer competition from new Family Dollar stores than from Wal Mart   Both Dollar General and Family Dollar offer goods at multiple price points  while Dollar Tree sticks rigidly to a  1 or less format  This   along with the location of Dollar General and Family Dollar stores   would make Dollar General a more likely buyer  analysts said   Family Dollar s presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States  Texas is also home to more Dollar General stores than any other state   more than 1 000 stores  or about a tenth of the total   Family Dollar said on Monday it was reviewing Dollar General s offer  but has not changed its recommendation in support for a merger with Dollar Tree   Family Dollar had agreed to a  74 50 per share cash and stock deal with Dollar Tree last month   Billionaire investor Carl Icahn  who in June took a 9 4 percent stake in Family Dollar  had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General   On Monday  Icahn said he was  surprised  by Family Dollar s deal with Dollar Tree   He questioned whether Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine s future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal   Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition   Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3 6 percent from 9 4 percent as of July 30   Activist investor Nelson Peltz led Trian Partners was Family Dollar s second largest shareholder as of July 27 with a 7 34 percent stake   Dollar Tree declined to comment   Dollar General s offer  made in a letter to Family Dollar s board  represents a premium of 3 2 percent to Family Dollar s Friday close   The enterprise value of the offer is  9 7 billion  higher than Dollar Tree s  9 2 billion   Dollar General s shares closed up 11 percent at  64 14  while Dollar Tree s shares closed down 2 4 percent at  54 26   ANTITRUST CONCERNS  Dreiling  who said he would not have announced his retirement had he known a deal between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree was under way  said antitrust approval for Dollar General s bid was not a concern   Dollar General is prepared to divest up to 700 retail stores to get regulatory approval for the deal  the same percentage that Dollar Tree had proposed   Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough  however  said that more closings or divestitures might be needed    Any market where they are dominant  and they are the only two players  is going to be questioned   he said    Antitrust lawyer Jared Bona of Bona Law  however  said the deal was likely to pass regulatory muster without much trouble    I would be surprised if this deal is challenged under the antitrust laws because Dollar General is apparently willing to divest up to 700 retail stores to obtain antitrust approval  Stating that up front means they probably don t want a fight   he said    A U S  Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman declined to comment  The FTC and the U S  Justice Department share the responsibility for federal antitrust review of corporate mergers and acquisitions   Dollar General said it expected annual synergies of  550 million  600 million three years after the deal closes

149639,371155,DLTR,Exclusive  Icahn says Family Dollar wasting over  300 million in breakup fees ,news,"By Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK  Reuters    Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn told Reuters late Monday that efforts by Family Dollar s  N FDO  board to fend off competing bids in favor of a deal with Dollar Tree  O DLTR  have resulted in more than  300 million being needlessly spent on breakup fees 
Icahn has pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General  N DG  and has been openly critical of Family Dollar Chief Executive Howard Levine  who would have retained his position after an acquisition by Dollar Tree 
On Monday  Dollar General offered to buy Family Dollar Stores for  8 9 billion  trumping an agreed to merger with its rival Dollar Tree and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny pinching customers 
Dollar General has also offered to pay the  305 million breakup fee that would be owed to Dollar Tree if its deal with Family Dollar were to fall apart 
 This is a quintessential example and a reflection of what is wrong with Corporate America   Icahn said   The Family Dollar board is wasting more than  300 million  in breakup fees to Dollar Tree  in an attempt to chill a competing bid from Dollar General  which would keep Howard Levine out of the company once and for all even though the Dollar General bid would enhance the value of Family Dollar stock  
Icahn  who in June took a 9 4 percent stake in Family Dollar  had encouraged Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General  On Monday  Icahn said he was  surprised  by Family Dollar s deal with Dollar Tree and questioned whether Levine s future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal 
Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition 
Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3 6 percent from 9 4 percent as of July 30 
In a regulatory filing in August  it was revealed that on June 6  Icahn telephoned Levine to discuss Icahn s stake in Family Dollar and to express an interest in additional communications with Family Dollar s management regarding the company s current operations and future plans  including potential strategic opportunities and business combination transactions 
According to the filing  Levine asked Icahn whether he would be willing to sign a non disclosure agreement and Icahn declined 
 It appears that Levine and Family Dollar wanted to neutralize me by getting me to sign a confidentiality agreement   Icahn said   If Levine and Family Dollar had gotten me to sign it  that would have kept me from doing a proxy fight and in my opinion this would have given Levine 2 3 more years to mismanage the company and keep a competing bid from materializing  I refused to sign the confidentiality agreement  
Icahn said   In my humble opinion  Family Dollar would still be in the hands of Levine and the board if it had not been for my activism  
Company officials at Family Dollar were not available for comment

149651,371167,DLTR,Quad Witching Today  Window Dressing Next Week,opinion,"China Turned Around This Morning
It s funny because everyone thinks they are  winning  the trade war  The Chinese Government is planning to cut tariffs on imports to their favored trading partners  which we assume will no longer include the US  This will disadvantage US exporters to China and encourage Chinese firms and consumers to buy goods and services from other trading partners but it s also a nice tax break so it s boosting the Shanghai this morning  up 2 5  for the day at the close 

Other than that  the news has been very quiet and we re expecting to drift along into the close today as it s a Quad Witching Day in which quarterly options and futures contracts expire  there are 4 kinds   which is often punctuated by high volume  what is that   moves and yesterday was already a busy day on SPY  NYSE SPY  as we punched in a new high at 2 945 and we would have liked to short 2 950 but we ll take a cross below 2 940 on ES to short that with tight stops 

Also at record highs are our Member Portfolios and our Money Talk Portfolio  which we only trade live on the show once each quarter  has finished it s first year  we started last Sept 6th with  50 000  up 81  at  90 495   that s incredible performance for a low touch portfolio and  despite the fact that we went to 90  CASH back in July  our remaining positions have gained another 10  over the summer   despite being completely untouched since I was on the show on July 18 

General Mills  NYSE GIS  was our new trade and  so far  it hasn t gone anywhere so still good for a new trade  As I did not expect to be on the show again until October  I wanted to have more cash to take advantage of the coming crash and so far  so wrong on my timing but we have another month   so we ll see how things go  
The remaining positions are indeed our  dogs  of the year  so far  as we ve cashed out our winners  but we still like the dogs enough to stick with them and we re also well hedged with the Nasdaq Ultra Shorts  ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ  NASDAQ SQQQ     just in case this rally ever does fade away  Mostly we re hedged with CASH and we have  85 740 of it on the sidelines  waiting for SOMETHING to go on sale 

We have found a few things to add this month with Top Trade Alerts going out on Hanesbrands  NYSE HBI   Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   VanEck Vectors Oil Services  NYSE OIH   ProShares UltraShort S P500  NYSE SDS   hedge  and ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF  NYSE MJ    and the longs are already gaining ground  Speaking of grounds  congratulations to those who followed our Tuesday morning Coffee   KCN9  Futures Trade as we got a nice spike yesterday and took half off the table with a  4 931 gain already for the week 
Today is likely to be very crazy so it s too dangerous to play the Futures  though it s tempting to short Gasoline  Gasoline RBOB Futures  as it tests  2 04 and Oil  Crude Oil WTI Futures  is at  71 again and also a tempting short but now we re at the front of the November contract cycle and there s not a lot of pressure forcing them to trade at realistic prices and also there s an OPEC meeting  small one  over the weekend and that s going to randomize the outcome   so safer not to play those we do have Oil Ultra Short  ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil  NYSE SCO   long positions in our Short Term Portfolio   to take advantage of the longer down trend 

What we have here is the Nov  15 18 bull call spread that we paid net  4 000 for but we then sold  4 000 worth of Sept puts and calls and the short calls will expire worthless and we ll have to pay the short puts back about  1 000 but that s still fantastic as we end up in the  12 000 spread for net  1 000ish  Notice we sold twice as many calls as puts as we figured SCO would still be down around  16 as of today   we re off by  1 but benefit from being more sure about it not being at  18 yet  That s how we make money Being the House with options   we sell the risk to other suckers who think they know what SCO will do month to month and now we can sell it again in October and make a profit   whether SCO hits our November target or not 
It s been a fairly quiet week in the markets but not so much next week as September draws to a close and the Fed will make a policy adjustment on Wednesday  2pm  and also will extend their economic projections out to 2021 for the first time   so that will be interesting  Ray Dalio  who founded Bridgewater Associates  the world s biggest hedge fund  this month predicted the U S  economy is about two years from a downturn  Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke shared that view of a possible decline in 2020  when fiscal stimulus wanes like  Wile E  Coyote is going to go off the cliff  

I ll be very surprised if the Fed doesn t raise rates at the upcoming meeting but it s also the end of the quarter and  THEY  want to keep the market at record highs   so they can print up pretty charts and graphs to show you how you need to put your money in the markets 
For our part   we continue to be  CASHY and CAUTIOUS  despite the rally and  with 80  gains in our portfolios already   I don t really think we re missing anything by being careful",2018-09-21,Philip Davis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tgif--quad-witching-today-window-dressing-next-week-200344974,200344974
149652,371168,DLTR,Dollar Tree  DLTR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 55 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree 
For Dollar Tree  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dollar Tree will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of  1 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of  0 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

149675,371191,DLTR,What To Expect When Dollar General And Dollar Tree Report Earnings,opinion,"Dollar General   NYSE DG   and Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR   are two of the largest discount stores in the country  and for many investors  hard to distinguish in terms of business structure and expectations  With both companies releasing their earning reports tomorrow  here is what investors need to know in order to stay ahead of the curve 
Comparative Metrics
Dollar General and Dollar Tree are sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold   respectively  Dollar General stock is currently priced at  95 54 per share  while Dollar Tree is priced at  94 76 per share  Both stocks have seen slight losses of no more than 1  on the month 
While broader share price movement has been nearly symbiotic  trading on the day seems to speak otherwise  Dollar Tree s price is currently level with its close yesterday  while Dollar General is down nearly 1  in early trading today  perhaps speaking to investor sentiment 
Forecast
While the two companies seem homogenous  looking at our Zacks Consensus Estimates  it is easy to see some key differential statistics 
Current quarter consensus revenue and earnings estimates for Dollar General stand at  6 2 billion   10 3  year over year growth  and  1 40 per share   35 9    Dollar Tree s estimates are substantially less in terms of growth  with revenue estimates at  5 6 billion   5 4   and earnings estimates of  1 23 per share   25 5   
Earnings estimates have trended slightly upwards for Dollar General  moving from  1 39 to  1 40 per share over the course of the past two months  In the same time frame  Dollar Tree s EPS estimates have dropped from  1 24 to  1 23 per share 
Bottom Line
While Dollar Tree has not seen negative share price movement on the day thus far  its lower Zacks Rank and diminished revenue and earnings estimates combine to provide potentially better prospects for Dollar General heading into the release of their earnings reports

DG provided guidance for this fiscal year of  5 95 to  6 15  compared to the average analyst estimate of  6 06  Management blamed weather for this quarter s performance shortfall 
In analyzing the market cycles on the DG chart  we can see that the stock is in the middle of its current market cycle  Our analysis is that it has now begun the declining phase for this cycle  but there may some chopping around first  Nonetheless  our target by August of this year is  81  
Dollar Tree reported earnings per share of  1 19 and total revenue of  5 55 billion  compared to analyst expectations of  1 23 and  5 56 billion  Same store sales grew by 1 4   below the 2 6  average estimate 
DLTR lowered guidance for this fiscal year to  4 80 to  5 10  compared to its previous estimate of  5 25 to  5 60  Management also blamed weather for its performance 
The Dollar Tree chart is much worse that of DG  This is no surprise as DLTR has been on our  Riskiest for 2018  list  While this stock is also trading in the middle of the current market cycle  it has broken the low from which it began the cycle  This is a negative indicator that puts it firmly in the declining phase of this cycle  Our target for the July August time frame is  77 ",2018-05-31,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors-exit-dollar-stores-as-earnings-disappoint-200320992,200320992

For myself  I had a good day  Having survived Wednesday  which was absolutely god awful  I was pleased to make some good profits on Thursday  particularly from the likes of Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  which was by far the biggest winner  I am in 70 positions  all of them short 
To catch up on a few major indexes  the bulls are still in the driver s seat on almost everything  There have been hardly any bearish crossovers at all  Not on the Dow Jones Composite 

    or the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite  

   and certainly not on the Russell 2000 small caps 

The S P 500 cash index is likewise steadfastly bullish  We need to take out Tuesday s lows to turn the tide  folks 

The Dow Jones Utilities remain the odd man out  The moving averages are in full on bear mode  and the prices have been hugging those same lines beautifully  Indeed  the explosive move higher we ve seen over the past two weeks has tagged the underside of the slowest moving of these lines  the 200 day exponential moving average ",2018-06-01,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/upsidaisium-200321181,200321181

Altaba   AABA  the former Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA   started a move higher in the beginning of 2017  It slowed into the end of the year and then got mixed up in the volatility over the last 2 months  It pulled back to the 100 day SMA in February and bounced to a lower higher  only to fall back to the 100 day SMA against the beginning of March  a higher low  Not it making a higher high and near the all tie high  The RSI is rising and bullish with the MACD rising and positive  Look for a push to a new high to participate   
Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR 
Dollar Tree   DLTR  started to move higher in July 2017  reaching atop in January this year  It had a mild pullback near the 100 day SMA to start February  but then fell again following its earnings report with a gap down to the 200 day SMA  Since then it has been moving back up with a RSI that i pushing higher and a MACD moving to cross up  Look for continuation to participate higher   
LPL Financial Holdings Inc  NASDAQ LPLA 
LPL Financial   LPLA  has had a better than 2 year trend to the upside  It has paused and regrouped along the way  the latest time in November  With the market pullback it had just a minor hiccup and is now back at resistance  The RSI is in the bullish zone with the MACD trying to cross up but positive  Look for a push higher to participate   
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX 
Phillips 66   PSX  rounded out of a bottom last spring  moving higher to a top in January  It pulled back from there to the 200 day SMA and then bounced  A smaller pullback reversed at the end of last week and it is back at resistance  The RSI is pushing higher toward the bullish zone with the MACD rising and about to turn positive  Look for a push through resistance to continue higher

Visa   V  ran higher through 2017 and accelerated into January of this year  It pulled back with the market  finding support at the 100 day SMA and bouncing  It has been riding the 50 day SMA higher ever since  Now it is at resistance with the RSI bullish and rising and the MACD positive and moving higher  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with March Options Expiration done and spring around the corner sees the Equity Index ETF s looking mixed but positive 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil consolidates in a tight range  The US Dollar Index is also consolidating in a downtrend  trying hard to reverse it  while US Treasuries are showing signs of a potential reversal to the upside  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets continue to consolidate  the former around long term support and resistance  and the latter at the highs 
Volatility looks to continue to drift lower easing the pressure on the equity markets  Their charts all show retrenchment in the short term  with the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  trying to reverse and lead them all higher  On the longer picture the IWM and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  look strong with the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  stuck in broad consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

149725,371241,DLTR,3 Key Reasons Why Dollar Tree  DLTR  Stock Crashed After Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR   crashed more than 15  in early morning trading Wednesday  shortly after the discount retailer posted its latest quarterly financial report  Prior to the earnings announcement  Dollar Tree shares were up 40  within the past year  and the company was looking like one of the strongest in the retail sector  So what went wrong  Let s take a closer look 
Earnings   Revenue Miss
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  Dollar Tree reported adjusted earnings of  1 89 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  That result did represent a 36  improvement from the year ago period  but the miss broke Dollar Tree s streak of two consecutive positive surprises  also read    
Meanwhile  consolidated net sales of  6 36 billion also missed our consensus estimate of  6 40 billion  Quarterly revenues were up nearly 13  on a year over year basis  but investors were clearly disappointed by the company s top line performance 
Disappointing Comps
Same store sales in the quarter improved 2 4  in constant currency  with comps growth at Dollar Tree stores increasing 3 8  and Family Dollar comps moving just 1  higher  According to  by Reuters  comps growth was expected to come in at 1 5  at Family Dollar and 4  at Dollar Tree  Analysts also expected total same store sales to gain 2 7  
Weak Guidance 
Dollar Tree said that it expects consolidated net sales to fall in the range of  5 53 billion to  5 63 billion for the first quarter  Before today s report  our consensus estimate was calling for revenues of  5 6 billion in the quarter  Management also expects adjusted Q1 earnings of  1 18 to  1 25 per share  which is well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 32 per share 
The company s full year guidance was also disappointing  Dollar Tree now expects net sales in the range of  22 70 billion to  23 12 billion for fiscal 2018  with adjusted earnings expected to come in at  5 25 to  5 60 per share  Our consensus estimates were calling for full year revenues of  23 10 billion and earnings of  5 85 per share 
Bottom Line
Dollar Tree was showing signs of strength  especially over the last six months  Analysts were expecting that its core customer base lower income families in suburban and rural areas would continue driving its growth in the holiday quarter  Today s disappointing results have taken the wind out of the company s sails 
Looking ahead  Dollar Tree s sluggish guidance does not spell good news for fiscal 2018  However  the company said that it will use its new tax benefit to raise wages and increase employee benefits  which is typically a positive sign  Moreover  its core customers should have more money to spend this year

149803,371319,DLTR,3 Growth Stocks To Watch This Earnings Season ,opinion,"It s perhaps the only downside to an eight year bull market that s still hitting new highs with no end in sight  How do you find growth in an environment like this  You could wait for one of those healthy pullbacks  but this market is so strong that they are usually pretty tame and short lived 
Another possibility is to use a screen that finds the growth regardless of what the market does  Fortunately  that s exactly what the  screen is all about  It finds stocks that have a minimum historical growth rate of at least 20  and  more importantly  a projected growth rate of 20   On top of all that  it only picks Strong Buys 
Below are three stocks that have been on the list recently  but it s only a fraction of the full list  Click the link above to discover all the names that passed this screen s criteria 
The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW    
Things were going just fine for The Charles Schwab Corporation  SCHW  before tax reform passed  as the famed financial services company was enjoying an increase in retail investors amid this strong economy  But then the corporate tax rate plunged from 35  to 21   sending earnings estimates soaring by double digits over the past month  And just for good measure  SCHW recently reported strong quarterly numbers 
The company is part of the financial   investment bank space  which puts it in the top 13  of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 32nd spot out of 256  The industry has advanced approximately 25  over the past year  but SCHW easily has that beat with nearly 31  improvement in that time 
Earnings estimates had been loitering around prior to the big news out of Washington  Afterwards  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year  ending December 2018  jumped to  2 39 per share  marking an improvement of 18 9  from one month ago  Now analysts expect earnings for next year  ending December 2019  to jump a further 17 2  to  2 80  That guidance has advanced 23 9  in 30 days 
Part of that improvement should be attributed to SCHW s fourth quarter report from earlier this month  Earnings per share of 44 cents improved 22  from last year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 3   The company hasn t missed estimates in 3 years now  its last 11 quarters included 6 beats and 5 meets  Net revenues jumped 14  year over year to  2 24 billion  which was in line with Zacks Estimates  New retail brokerage accounts rose 36  to 248 000  while total accounts were up 4  to 7 4 million  In the past 7 days  earnings estimates for this year and next are up 2 6  and 3 7   respectively 
 The Charles Schwab Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   Inc    
Even with a strong economy and historic bull market  consumers just can t pass up a good deal at the register  That s why the retail discount stores industry is in the top 21  of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 53rd spot out of 256  Dollar Tree  Inc   DLTR  is one of the biggest reasons why this space has taken off  The discount retailer is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates and has jumped by nearly 53 4  in the past 12 months  Who says brick and mortar retailers are dead 
Retailers generally bring up the rear of earnings season  so we still have a few weeks before DLTR reports again in early March  At the time  it will be going for a third straight positive surprise  The company posted earnings per share of  1 01 in its fiscal third quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 2  and jumping more than 40  from last year  It now has a four quarter average of 7 4  and has topped expectations in five of the last seven quarters 
Consolidated net sales also beat our expectations  rising 6 3  to  5 32 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was at  5 28 billion  Same store sales increased 3 2  thanks to improved customer count and average ticket  Most impressive  though  at a time when e commerce is fundamentally shifting the retail landscape and closing many traditional store concepts  DLTR actually opened 169 outlets during the quarter and shuttered only 6 
The company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 and expects fiscal fourth quarter sales between  6 32 billion and  6 43 billion  Earnings are seen at  1 80 to  1 89 for the quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending this month  is  4 85 per share  which has gained 4  in the past three months  Earnings estimates haven t moved much in the past 60 days  but analysts are expecting a lot more improvement next year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year  ending January 2019  is currently  5 70  marking a 17 5  improvement from the previous year  Earnings estimates are up 9  in just the past 30 days 
 Dollar Tree  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Marriott International   
At a time with low unemployment  a hot market and a strong economy  why not take a trip  And if you have a few extra bucks to spend  then you might as well stay with a company that really knows what it s doing  Marriott International  MAR  is the world s largest hotel company with brands like Ritz Carlton  Renaissance Hotels and Fairfield Inn   Suites  among many others  The hotels and motels industry has gained more than 50  in the past year  leaving it a space in the top 28  of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 71st spot out of 256  But MAR has jumped nearly 75  in that time 
The biggest news for Marriot in the past couple of years was its acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide  which was a huge hotelier in its own right  The merger was finalized in September 2016  giving MAR even more brands such as Westin  Sheraton and W  among many others  It intends to keep Starwood s expansion rate at the same level  which means those brands aren t going anywhere 
MAR will report again on February 14  The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 15 straight quarters  and its positive Earnings ESP suggests that analysts believe this trend will continue  Last time  earnings per share came to  1 10 for the third quarter  The result was 26  better than last year and more than 12  atop of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents  The four quarter average is now 9 1   Total revenue jumped 46  to  5 66 billion  which was also ahead of our expectations  But perhaps more importantly  revenue per available room for worldwide same system wide properties were up 2 4  
Earnings estimates for 2017 hadn t moved in the past 2 months  but are up 2 7  from three months earlier  But 2018 is a different story  The Zacks Consensus Estimate expects earnings for this calendar year to jump more than 21  to  5 16 from the previous year s  4 24  The estimates has climbed 7 7  in just the past month 
 Marriott International Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This
The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 
Zacks  has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly ",2018-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-growth-stocks-to-watch-this-earnings-season-200284737,200284737
149828,371344,DLTR,4 Of The Best Stocks To Buy On Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Since we are in the thick of the earnings season  investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement Future OutperformersSo  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two

149989,371505,DLTR,Biotech Vs  Oil ,opinion,"After weeks of the NASDAQ straggling behind its counterparts  the tech heavy index was the only member of the Big 3 to finish on the plus side in Wednesday s session  It was helped by a strong performance from biotech  Meanwhile  oil slipped again by more than 2  to around  42 50  which really took a bite out of the Dow and S P  
Specifically  the NASDAQ had a solid session with an advance of 0 74  to 6234  However  the Dow was off by 0 27  to 21410 and the S P slipped 0 06  to 2435 6  
The portfolios included three new picks from Large Cap Trader today  while Insider Trader also added  Give these new buys a look in the highlights section below  along with some analysis on biotech and oil  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Insider Trader  Shares of Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  have plunged 14 5  in the last month due to worries about the retail industry in general  It is now near its 52 week lows  But not ALL retail is in trouble  and a closer look at DLTR shows a company that is expected to grow earnings by 16 7  this year and recently raised the lower end of its full year EPS guidance  But what really captured Tracey s attention was when two directors bought shares of their own company  This vote of confidence convinced the editor to add DLTR to the portfolio on Wednesday with a 10  allocation  The full commentary has a lot more on this new pick  Healthcare Innovators  Thanks to the strong performance from biotech on Wednesday  this porfolio had an impressive day with four of the top five movers amongst all Zacks services  The biggest winner was Immune Design Corp   IMDZ   which was up by nearly 19 4    but that wasn t all  HI also had positive performances from Incyte Corp   INCY   7 55    Juno Therapeutics  JUNO   7 2   and BioMarin Pharma  BMRN   7    Large Cap Trader  The portfolio had 20  in cash heading into today s session  so John decided to put most of that to work with three new additions  Each of these defensive picks will have an approximate allocation of 4   12  in total   leaving enough left over for a long term pick down the road  The three new buys are  
  Wellcare Health Plans  WCG   This provider of managed care services has a Zacks VGM Score of A and is part of a space in the top 25  of the Zacks Industry Rank  It reports again on August 1  
  Hitachi  HTHIY   This diversified electronics giant is based in Japan  but much of its potential comes from all the business it does in faster growing Asia  It has a Zacks VGM Score of A and is in the top 31  of the Zacks Industry Rank  It reports again on August 4  
  SKF AB  SKFRY  is a Swedish industrial conglomerate  which means its part of a space in the top 13  of the Zacks Industry Rank  It has a Zacks VGM Score of B and will report on July 20  
Read the editor s full commentary for a lot more on each of these new picks  Surprise Trader   U S  stocks slipped again in Wednesday trading as the negative impact of the commodity slide continues to reverberate throughout the stock market  Both the S P 500 and the Dow finished in the red as a result  while the Nasdaq was able to post decent gains thanks to its low exposure to the commodity side of the market   Things really weren t that bad for the EIA Petroleum Report this week  as we actually saw a decline in crude oil inventories  and gasoline too  However  the sentiment remains incredibly bearish and weekly domestic production rose yet again  hitting 9 35 million barrels a day   Despite the lower prices  producers here in the U S  seem in no rush to cut their production levels  Oil below  40 seems like a real possibility now  and I will look to dial back crude exposure in the next earnings season so long as this sluggish trend continues      Eric Dutram Zacks Counterstrike   The last couple days I ve been talking about the biotech sector and how it seems to be breaking out  Well today that move became ridiculous as biotech moved another 4  plus higher  causing leveraged biotech EFT LABU to shoot up more than 10  today  The breakout has been forming naturally  but today s move was primarily due to a report that Trump will ease industry regulations   Trump has said that he will lower prices  which has hurt biotech in the past  However  with regulations eased  more drugs might hit the market  which would negate the pricing issue for some companies   Whatever Trump does  the market looks like it s getting ready to applaud it  The XBI has officially broken out and the Fibs tell me  120 is a price target to shoot for  This would of course be a longer term goal  For those looking to really leverage up  LABU would see a massive move if this trend continues  If you missed this biotech move I wouldn t chase it  the sector is very volatile and should give a dip to buy  In fact  if LABU pulls back  I think Counterstrike might try to scoop that one up      Jeremy Mullin

150004,371520,DLTR,Dollar Tree  DLTR  Cuts View As Q1 Earnings Miss  Stock Dips,opinion,Dollar Tree Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   posted first quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both the top line and bottom line improved year over year  and sales almost met our estimate  However  the company failed to meet the earnings estimates this time  after delivering back to back positive surprises in the last two quarters   Further  management lowered its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017  while adjusting its sales view The company s shares declined about 2  in the pre market trading session following the announcement  Moreover  shares of Dollar Tree have slumped 11 6  in the past one year  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry  which has showcased growth of nearly 2 4  Quarter in DetailThe company s quarterly adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share jumped 10 1  year over year  though it fell a penny short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents  Nonetheless  earnings met the higher end of company s guidance range of 91 98 cents per share Dollar Tree  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Including one time items like the receivable impairment charge associated with Dollar Express  the company s earnings slumped 13 3  to 85 cents per share  Notably  Dollar Tree had divested stores to Dollar Express  as part of its efforts to gain FTC s approval on its merger with Family Dollar  However  Dollar Express is currently on liquidation track  thus failing to repay Dollar Tree its receivables from the former  Consequently  Dollar Tree evaluated its divestiture related receivables in the first quarter  which will be written down eventually  with its impairment charges being recorded in the income statement Consolidated net sales jumped 4  to  5 287 1 million in the quarter  almost meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 293 million Comparable store sales  comps  for the quarter inched up 0 5   backed by improved customer count and average ticket  While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 2 5   comps at the Family Dollar banner declined 1 2  The company s quarterly gross profit advanced 4 7  year over year to  1 627 million  with the gross margin expanding 20 basis points  bps  to 30 8   The margin enhancement was driven by reduced merchandise and freight expenses  somewhat negated by greater markdowns Selling  general and administrative expenses escalated 110 bps to 23 4  of sales  primarily due to impairment related charges  higher payroll and advertising costs  partly compensated by reduced depreciation Balance SheetDollar Tree ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 154 9 million  net merchandise inventories of  2 878 4 million  net long term debt of  6 131 7 million and shareholders  equity of  5 609 million Store UpdateDollar Tree opened 164 outlets  expanded or relocated 51 outlets  and shuttered 16 outlets during the quarter Looking AheadManagement remains pleased with its quarterly performance  which witnessed improved margins and comps  with efficient cost management  Also  adjusted earnings met the higher end of the company s predicted range  with sales coming near the mid point of its projected band  Further  the company is progressing quite well with Family Dollar s integration  The company further revealed that it is well on track with its expansion efforts for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar  and is set to initiate renovation efforts for the latter in the second quarter However  the company trimmed its fiscal 2017 sales guidance  alongside curtailing its earnings forecast Management now forecasts net sales for fiscal 2017  which will contain an additional week  in the band of  21 95  22 25 billion  compared with the old projection of  21 94  22 33 billion  The guidance stems from square footage growth  and comps improvement in the range of slightly positive to low single digit rise  as compared with flat to low single digit increase expected earlier Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are now expected to be in the range of  4 17  4 43  which includes an impairment charge of 13 cents recorded in the first quarter  Earlier  management projected earnings in a band of  4 20  4 56 per share in fiscal 2017  The impact on sales and earnings from the 53rd week is included in management s outlook  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is pegged at  4 48 For the fiscal second quarter  consolidated sales are projected in the range of  5 18  5 28 billion  driven by comps growth in a slightly positive to low single digit rise range for the combined entity  Earnings are anticipated in the range of 80 88 cents per share  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is pegged at 90 cents  thus hinting at downward revisions Zacks Rank

150010,371526,DLTR,Will Soft May Retail Sales Make Investors Revisit Portfolio ,opinion,Two things will catch investor attention today and may lead to conflicting sentiments  While soft May retail sales data may ring alarm bells  the Fed s decision to lift benchmark interest rate to a range of 1 1 25  may serve as a reassurance that all s well with the economy  The policy makers  who advocated one more hike before the end of the year  also chalked out a detailed plan to shrink  4 5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities in a phased manner We believe the Fed chair  Janet Yellen  will steadily raise interest rate after taking into account underlying inflation and the condition of the labor market  But  for now  soft retail sales may compel investors to revisit their portfolio Retail Sales FallU S  retail sales in May recorded the steepest drop in 16 months  reflecting a scenario where consumers are curtailing their spending  This raises doubts as to whether economic growth has somewhat tempered in the current quarter  at a time when things have just started to look up under the Trump regime with major markets scaling new highs  The dismal sales report comes on the heels of the soft job addition witnessed last month The Commerce Department stated that U S  retail and food services sales in May declined 0 3  to  473 8 billion   following an unrevised reading of 0 4  growth registered in April   as people refrained from buying motor vehicles and spent less at gasoline stations  department stores and electronics shops   However  retail sales increased 3 8  from May 2016 The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers declined 0 2   while receipts at gasoline stations fell 2 4   Sales at electronics   appliance stores dropped 2 8   Department store sales decreased 1   Sales at non store retailers however inched up 0 8  in May and increased 10 2  from the prior year period How is the Retail Sector Placed The  sector  which is at the bottom 19  of the Zacks Sector Rank  13 out of 16   has been undergoing a fundamental change  With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online  store and mall traffic has been hit hard  As a result  most retailers  including big box  are struggling to compete with e commerce channels and are being forced to trim their store count to focus more on an online model Nevertheless  the sector still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  We note that so far in the year  the sector has registered an increase of 15 2  compared with the S P 500 that was up roughly 9 3   The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  decelerating unemployment rate  and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  These factors are playing a crucial role in raising consumers  confidence  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending Strategies to Counter the ChallengesThe sector  which is grappling with multiple challenges as mentioned above  has compelled retailers to reconsider their strategies  They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni channel capabilities  optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities Retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings  developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers  renovating stores  developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery  implementing an enterprise wide inventory management system as well as enhancing their relationship with existing and new customers The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR    Staples  Inc    NASDAQ SPLS    Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   and other renowned retailers are trying all means to reach their target customers Zacks RankAmong the aforementioned stocks  The Children s Place and Best Buy sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while the remaining stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue ExplosionAt Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold   By last year  it was already generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ,2017-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-soft-may-retail-sales-make-investors-revisit-portfolio-200195439,200195439

150012,371528,DLTR,Is Dollar Tree  DLTR  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Dollar Tree has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 68  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Dollar Tree s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its historical levels Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail Discount   Variety industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Dollar Tree has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 51  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Dollar Tree has a P S ratio of 0 78  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now If anything  DLTR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Dollar Tree currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DLTR a good choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Dollar Tree is just 0 95  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 72  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DLTR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Dollar Tree might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  b   This gives DLTR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to four downward  while the next year estimate has seen three upward and four downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the current year consensus estimate has moved down by 0 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dollar Tree  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDollar Tree is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a good industry rank  among the Top 41   instills investor confidence  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company  Also  over the past one year  the Zacks Retail Discount   Variety industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many

150038,371554,DLTR,TJX Companies  TJX  Continues To Impress  Time To Buy ,opinion,"While most of the retailers are losing their market share to the online buying craze  discount retailer The TJX Companies Inc    NYSE TJX   is one of the few retailers which have managed to stay afloat amid troubled waters of the retail sector  Although the shares of TJX Companies have declined 0 5  in the past three months  underperforming the Zacks categorized  sector which has witnessed a gain of 3  in the same time frame  we expect the trend to reverse in the near future driven by the company s solid fundamentals and strategic initiatives 

Solid Earnings Trend
The company has shown an uptrend even in terms of earnings  as evident from its earnings beat in the trailing four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 5 9   Further earnings are anticipated to grow by 11  in the next five years 
In the recently concluded fourth quarter fiscal 2017  net sales  comparable store sales  comps  and earnings exceeded expectations  Earnings of  1 03 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and year ago results by 4   driven by higher sales  Further  earnings exceeded management s guidance of 96 98 cents per share 
Net sales increased 6  year over year to  9 5 billion on the back of higher comps in almost all the segments 
Analysts are also optimistic about the company s performance as evident from the fact that estimates have been rising for the past seven days  While estimates for the first quarter fiscal 2018 went up 1  to 92 cents that of fiscal 2018 went up 3 2  to  3 90 per share  
Optimistic Guidance
For fiscal 2018  TJX Companies projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  3 80  3 89  up 5 7  from fiscal 2017 results  The earnings guidance assumes a sales growth of 6 7  during fiscal 2018 and comps are also expected to grow 1 2  during the upcoming year 
Initiatives to Boost Sales
The TJX Companies has reported positive comparable store sales  comps  growth in the past 30 quarters  Further  its several initiatives to boost sales along with an aggressive store opening strategy in the pipeline holds it in good stead 
TJX Companies plans to grow more than 50  to 5 600 stores over the next few years which includes addition of over 1 400 stores in North America  doubling Marmaxx to 3 000 stores in the U S  and also plans to expand HomeGoods chain to at least 1 000 stores  almost twice its existing base  Moreover  the company plans to build about 500 stores over the long term in Canada  and nearly double its current base in Europe by expanding to 975 outlets 
Further  the company has undertaken several initiatives to augment online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team  Additionally  it intends to add more categories to the online shopping site  tjxmaxx com and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from its brick and mortar stores 
The TJX Companies is also taking steps to rejuvenate its loyalty program for 2017  The program has been a huge success with approximately 8 million members enrolled already  Moreover  the company has added special rewards for key segments of the program  Notably  the loyalty program is unique among off price retailers 
However  TJX Companies has been struggling with lower margins in the past few quarters  mainly due to wages increments announced in 2016  Furthermore  the off price nature of the company prevents it from raising prices in order to maintain margins 
Although it is facing headwinds  these difficulties are transitory and TJX Companies might offset lower margins in 2017  if the above mentioned initiatives are effective  Taking the pros and cons into regard  we feel it will be a prudent decision to buy the stock for now 
Stocks to Consider
TJX Companies carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Some better ranked stocks in the retail sector are Zumiez  Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ    Dollar Tree Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   and Genesco Inc    NYSE GCO    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   While Zumiez has an expected long term earnings growth of 15 0   Genesco and Dollar Tree has an expected earnings growth of 9 5  and 16 7   respectively  for the next three to five years

150039,371555,DLTR,Major Retail Stocks  Q4 Earnings On Mar 1  LOW  DLTR   BBY,opinion,We are in the last leg of the fourth quarter earnings season with focus mainly shifting on to the Retail sector  The earnings scenario in the quarter has been pretty impressive than the past few quarters  Further  investors are impressed as the quarter is set to break the past quarterly records  marking the best performance in the last two years Per the  as of Feb 17  2017  earnings for the total S P 500 companies will improve 7 4  from the year ago period  with total revenue rising 3 9  As per the report  out of the 411 S P 500 companies that have come up with their quarterly numbers  approximately 68 9  posted positive earnings surprises  while 54 7  beat top line expectations  Total earnings for these index members were up 8  from the year ago quarter  while revenues increased 4 9  According to the report  total earnings for the  sector are expected to decline marginally by 1 2   while revenues are projected to improve 4 7   As of Feb 17  46 5  of the S P 500 companies in this sector have reported their results  Out of these  55 0  companies posted an earnings beat  while 20 0  surpassed revenue estimates   Let s see what awaits the following major retail stocks that are queued up for earnings release on Mar 1 Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW    the world s second largest home improvement retailer  is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  before the market opens  The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters  Further  it has posted an average miss of 2 4  in the trailing four quarters Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lowe s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Lowe s Companies  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Lowe s has an Earnings ESP of  1 27   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 78 cents stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents  However  the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  but we need to have a positive ESP in order to be confident about earnings surprise Lowe s has been posting lower than expected top and bottom lines for the past two consecutive quarters  We believe that an improving job scenario  gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives bode well for Lowe s over the long run  Additionally  the Canadian business has been performing quite well  with strong comps growth  in local currency  recorded in the last three years  However  analysts state that the company s expansion into regions where it already operates could cannibalize its sales performance and lower traffic count at existing stores   Read more   Now  let s take a sneak peek at Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR    the discount store chain operator  which is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 5  in the third quarter  Further  it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 2 4  Dollar Tree  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Dollar Tree has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 33  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  While a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Dollar Tree is progressing well with its growth initiatives  which include store expansion strategies  enhancing store productivity  tapping new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels  Notably  the company had also displayed remarkable comparable store sales  comps  performance  thereby recording its 35th straight quarter of comps growth in the third quarter While the incorporation of Family Dollar is expected to generate synergies in the long run  the increased costs and cannibalization will likely continue  affecting results throughout the integration and re banner process  Additionally  foreign currency headwinds remain a concern   Read more   Finally  let s see what s in store for Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    a multinational specialty retailer  which is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  We note that the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings beat of 25 7  Best Buy Co   Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Best Buy has an Earnings ESP of  1 81  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 69  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 66  Further  the company carries a Zacks Rank  3  The above combination makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  You can see   Best Buy has been posting better than expected results in the last 16 quarters and the trend is expected to continue in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 as well  In fact  in the past few quarters  the company had also reported massive gain in online comparable sales on the back of improved traffic  conversion rates and higher average order values  which is in turn expected to boost the company s results in the

Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   Shares of the home improvement retailer increased nearly 12 percent from a year earlier but over the past 6 months it dropped by nearly 2 5 percent owing to back to back weaker than expected quarterly reports  In each of the past 2 quarters financial performance missed Estimize s target top and bottom line projections by a significant margin  Expectations for the upcoming report have rebounded however  thanks to a steadily improving labor market  recovering housing market and several new initiatives undertook during the quarter  Meanwhile  business in Canada continues to grow at a rapid clip with strong comps in the past three year  To the downside  Lowe s must wrestle market share back from Home Depot  NYSE HD   which made greater gains in recent quarter  while also dealing with Amazon s growing presence in the retail space 
Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   The current consumer spending environment favors deep discounters like dollar stores but after a huge runup following the financial crisis  Dollar Tree faces a new uphill climb  The unrealistic expectations placed on Dollar Tree in recent quarters contributed to weak results over the past 2 quarters  Beyond that  a slight pickup in consumer spending shifted demand back to traditional value channels like Walmart  To offset the recent volatility Dollar Tree remains committed to integrating Family Dollar stores  remodeling preexisting stores  opening new ones and sticking to an aggressive pricing strategy  Of course rapid expansion puts the company at risk of cannibalizing its own business and further hampering growth

150085,371601,DLTR,Chicago PMI  From Euphoria To Despair And Getting Nowhere,opinion,"For October 2014  the ISM estimated that its Chicago Business Barometer was a blistering 66 2  Encompassing much of the Midwest and a good deal of auto and parts production  that level seemed to make sense 
As any economist would say then  the US economy was on the verge of a breakout and according to the labor statistics maybe even one of unusually good strength and duration 
Two months later  however  the Chicago BB was down almost eight points to 58 3  just two months after that  for February 2015  the PMI was shockingly below 50 and quite far below at 45 8 
Since then  the index has been all over the place  It almost counts more as entertainment than actual meaningful interpretation from month to month  but there is  I think  something useful to the overall sawtooth of the past two years 
It is emblematic of the unevenness of this economy as it swings from very real recession fears to almost pure elation of seeming to skate by  only to see such jubilation ruined in short order all over again  There is information in the schizophrenia 

After falling below 50 again in summer 2015  the PMI was above 54 in July and August  only to drop to 48 7 in September in the aftermath of  global turmoil    and then rebound to 56 2 by October as the FOMC assured the world there was nothing lasting about it 
Of course  the Chicago BB instead fell to a  cycle  low of 42 9 in December before jumping almost 13 points in January alone  to 55 6   and then dropping back below 50 again in February 
It seems rather clear from that volatility that nobody can make sense of this economy during the  rising dollar   It certainly is nothing like what was expected in the orthodox mainstream version of  overheating   but it also time and again stops short of full recession 
There is never any breakout in either direction  As I wrote earlier today with regard to the eerie similarity  

There is no getting away from the  rising dollar  and its effects on the global economy  It s not recession  at least not yet  but as always that is actually worse  Any economy that shrinks and then doesn t actually recover from it is a disaster in good part because nobody seems able to recognize what is truly happening  It results in this increasing wedge of mistrust where economists say the economy is growing yet the people know it really isn t  Positive numbers are not the goal nor even close to any reasonable  rational standard for success 

Recognizing instability for what it is is the only way out of this global mess 
The Chicago PMI was 50 4 in April and 49 3 in May 2016 before spiking to 56 8 in June  and now back to 51 5 all over again  If the last two years aren t an indication of such instability then nothing is  
The trend doesn t follow the textbook definitions for how an economy is supposed to progress   in linear fashion toward either recession or its more welcomed opposite  Nothing about this economy here or everywhere else is textbook  except of course if you factor global money as an exercise in bank balance sheet constraints

The rare disappointment in the two chains  financial results took a toll on their stocks  Shares of Dollar General fell 16  to  77 40  while Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  shares declined 9 4  to  86

As Dollar General s CEO Todd Vasos said on his company s quarterly earnings conference call   I know that when we look at globally the overall U S  population  it seems like things are getting better  things have not gotten any better for her  the core shopper   And arguably they are worse  
For industrial Chicago as one global proxy  it seems as if businesses swing between those two extremes  going nowhere in the process  In that volatility is the ethos of this  rising dollar  phase of the slowdown depression ",2016-09-01,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/from-euphoria-to-despair-and-getting-nowhere-200151212,200151212

150134,371650,DLTR,Will Q2 Earnings Hold A Surprise For SeaDrill  SDRL  Stock ,opinion,"Leading contract driller SeaDrill Limited   NYSE SDRL   is expected to report second quarter 2016 earnings on Thursday  Aug 25 In the last quarter  the company s earnings of 26 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents  In fact  the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 8 60  in the last four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Factors Likely to Influence This QuarterSeaDrill is one of the leading offshore drilling contractors in the world with one of the youngest but most advanced fleets  The company has a strong backlog of  4 3 billion  which not only reflects steady demand from its customers but also offers an unmatched level of earnings and cash flow visibility  Moreover  SeaDrill has high economic utilization for its floaters  which is expected to help it maintain a steady flow of income SEADRILL LTD Price and EPS Surprise

150135,371651,DLTR,Dollar Store Stock Earnings Preview  DG Vs  DLTR ,opinion,"Today s video takes a closer look at the discount store segment of the retail world  a segment which has been on fire as of late 
This industry actually has a top 13  rank so it is looking to keep up its momentum heading into a new stretch of earnings reports  And with a host of retail names offering up good reports  the expectations are likely high for this group too

150157,371673,DLTR,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Goodyear Tire   Rubber  Home Depot  Dollar Tree  Tahoe Resources And Fortune Brands Home   Security,opinion,"For Immediate Release 

Chicago  IL   August 17  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company    Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD       Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   Inc      Tahoe Resources Inc     and Fortune Brands Home   Security  Inc      

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

5 Large Cap Stocks Poised to Provide Big Returns

On Monday  all of the three benchmark indexes ended on record highs  This was the second such occurrence within a period lesser than a week  On this occasion  a jump in oil prices was the catalyst for the benchmarks to end on such a positive note  Another reason for the surge in stocks was news that Hillary Clinton was leading GOP nominee Donald Trump by a decisive margin 

However  the absence of fundamental reasons for these gains means that the cause for such a rally is difficult to identify  As a more than seven year long Bull Run continues  it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to place their bets 

At the same time  it is important to remain invested in a market offering such strong gains  Picking large cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea in such an environment 

 Sell in May and Go Away  Refuted

This old saying has been strongly refuted by markets this year  The logic behind this adage is that the summer vacation season hampers sales and negatively affects business  This in turn leads to weak earnings during the July to September quarter 

Following from this logic  the second half of October generally witnesses disappointing numbers  which in turn pulls down markets  This is why it may be a good idea to cash in on May Day and return to the bourses on Halloween  read    

However  after traversing a relatively subdued May and ending mixed in June  markets performed strongly in July  Over the last month  the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq gained 3 6   2 8  and 6 6   respectively 

As of now  the Dow is up nearly 0 8  month to date  while the S P 500 and the Nasdaq have gained 1  and 3 2  over the same period  This may not seem to be much at first glance  but works out to be quite considerable when one extrapolates for the full year s returns  well in excess of 20  

Low Interest Rates  Absence of Alternatives Boosting Stocks 

Analysts and market watchers believe that stocks are being driven higher by an old theme  This is essentially a regime of low interest rates where investors are constantly searching for higher returns  As of now  the Fed seems to be unwilling to hike rates higher  Meanwhile  the rest of the world s central banks are intent on providing more and more monetary stimulus 

It is almost as if markets do not have any alternative but to keep on moving higher  Here  it is essential to understand that there is an absence of any strong positive or negative market related or economy driven developments  In such a situation  the rally feeds on itself and stocks create fresh records on a regular basis 

Our Choices

In an environment where stocks are creating fresh records every day  investors are being presented with an unusual dilemma  In the absence of a sell off  they can only hold onto their positions or buy into an ever rising market 

This is why it is important to seek out relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns  Large cap stocks are relatively safer bets  At the same time  it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short term benefits and the prospect of good long term performance  However  it may be difficult to pick winning stocks 

This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 

The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  NASDAQ GT      is one of the world s largest tire manufacturing companies  selling under Goodyear  Dunlop and various other  house  brands as well as private label brands

150159,371675,DLTR,Best Buy  BBY  Q2 Earnings Awaited  What To Anticipate ,opinion,"Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23  In the previous quarter  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25 7   Notably  the company has surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 24 1   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Likely Earnings Beat in the Cards
Our proven model shows that Best Buy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  The Most Accurate estimate stands at 44 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents  So the ensuing difference   the Earnings ESP   is of  4 76   A positive ESP combined with the company s Zacks Rank  3  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Factors at Play
Best Buy has been posting better than expected results over the last 14 quarters and the trend is expected to continue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  Improvement in online comparable sales  driven by higher traffic and conversion rates  is driving the company s top line and bottom line 
In the previous quarter  the company reported a 23 9  surge in online comparable sales  driven by improved traffic and conversion rates  The company is investing extensively to upgrade its operations with special focus on developing omni channel capacities and cementing its relationship with vendors 
Management had earlier projected  Enterprise revenues between  8 35 billion and  8 45 billion for the fiscal second quarter  Comparable sales are expected to remain flat year over year  Management expects earnings in the range of 38 cents 42 cents per share 
On the flip side  International revenues had declined 22 1   25 6   29 2  and 26 2  in the first  second  third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  respectively  In the first quarter  International segmental revenues declined 8 1  to  614 million due to brand consolidation and soft performance in Canada along with sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
Also  in the fiscal second quarter  the company expects international revenues to decline 5 10   SG A is expected to increase in the quarter primarily due to advertising expenses associated with the back to school season BEST BUY Price and EPS Surprise

   Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates
Here are some stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Sanderson Farms  Inc    NASDAQ SAFM   currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has an Earnings ESP of  4 96  Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   currently sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has an Earnings ESP of  4 11  GameStop Corp    NYSE GME   currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has an Earnings ESP of  3 70  ",2016-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-buy-(bby)-q2-earnings-awaited:-what-to-anticipate-200149067,200149067
150160,371676,DLTR,Nimble Storage  NMBL   What s In The Cards In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Nimble Storage  Inc    NYSE NMBL   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 77   However  the company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 3 98  in the last four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to ConsiderNimble Storage is positioning itself to benefit from the ongoing shift to flash centric architectures from the conventional disk centric architectures with its Adaptive Flash platform  Meanwhile  it is acquiring large enterprise customers and equally concentrating on growing its mid size customer base In the first quarter  its customer base grew 48  while AFA bookings constituted 12  of total bookings in the quarter 
The company launched AF series All Flash Arrays storage equipment that relies solely on flash memory chips  Analysts view this as a big positive for the company that will allow it to gain traction in the all flash segment  However  they remain wary of the stiff competition from existing players like EMC  NYSE EMC  and Pure Storage  which might weigh on Nimble s margins 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the company expects revenues in a range of  93 million to  96 million  Non GAAP operating loss is expected to be  16 million to  18 million  Non GAAP loss per share is projected in the range of 19 cents to 21 cents 
Earnings WhispersNIMBLE STORAGE Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nimble is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Nimble s Earnings ESP is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 49 cents 
Zacks Rank  Nimble s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

150162,371678,DLTR,Best Buy  Tiffany  Dollar Tree  Dollar General And Amazon Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 22  2016   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes  Best Buy     Tiffany     Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR      Dollar General      and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN

    Looking Beyond Q2 Earnings Season

	The Q2 earnings season is now effectively behind us  as even Retail sector earnings reports are mostly out now  With results from 480 S P 500 already out and another 13 index reports reporting results this week  we will have seen Q1 results from 493 index members by the end of this week Best Buy    Tiffany     Dollar Tree    and Dollar General     are this week s notable earnings releases 

	Our overall commentary on the Q2 earning season has been less negative compared to the last few reporting cycles  This reflects an ever so modest improvement in the growth picture  both for Q2 as well as the current period  Growth has been in negative territory for a while now  with Q2 as the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S P 500 index  The Energy sector has been  and continues to be  a big drag on the overall growth picture  But we can t blame Energy alone for all the growth challenge  there is simply not much momentum from the other major sectors either 
	Estimates for the current period  2016 Q3  have started coming down as well  in line with the trend that we have become used to seeing over the last few years  Earnings growth for the index is now expected to be in negative territory in Q3 as well  with the last quarter of the year as the only period this year expected to have positive growth 

	As negative as this revisions trend looks  it is nevertheless an improvement over what we have become used to seeing by this stage in other recent reporting cycles  The improved commodity price backdrop and the reduced dollar drag are some of the more plausible explanations for this development Expectations Beyond Q3
	Q3 is now in negative territory as well  with the last quarter of the year as the only one that is currently expected to be in positive territory 

	The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4  We will see if those estimates will hold up as we reach the last quarter of the year  But given what we have seen over the last few quarters  the odds don t look that favorable Retail Sector s Q2 Results
	As of Friday August 19th  we have seen Q2 results from 37 retailers in the S P 500 index  out of the 44 total  that combined account for 93 6  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these 37 retails are up  3 9  from the same period last year  on  4 3  higher revenues  with a relatively low 59 5  beating EPS estimates and a very low 43 2  coming ahead of top line expectations 

	The growth comparisons  left hand chart  don t stand out   Q2 earnings growth rate is above the 4 quarter average  but about in line with 12 quarter average  But the right hand chart  which is tracking the proportion of Retail sector stocks coming out with positive EPS and revenue surprises  shows that Q2 is notably weaker relative to the recent past 
	The fact is that the 59 5  EPS beat   for the Retail sector is the second lowest for the entire S P 500 index  behind only the Construction sector  The revenue beat   of 24  for the sector is the third lowest  Construction is the lowest at 38 5   of all 16 sectors at this stage 
	With respect to the growth picture  which appears to be in line with the recent past  we have to dig a bit deeper to adjust the sector s growth picture for Amazon s    blockbuster Q2 earnings report  Q2 is tracking way below what we have been seeing from these same retailers in the recent past The Q2 Earnings Scorecard  as of August 19th 
	We now have Q2 results from 480 S P 500 members that combined account for 97 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 480 companies are down  3 2  from the same period last year on  0 1  higher revenues  with 72 1  beating EPS estimates and 54  coming ahead of top line expectations

150192,371708,DLTR,Is Retail Signaling Recession ,opinion,"I recently went through my chart book of about 300 stocks and a number of retail plays stood out  I found that retailers of low priced goods are doing very well compared to those focused more toward the high end  And that s not surprising due to a general slowing of economic activity  Indeed  consumer preferences generally shift as a direct result of their financial well being 
To visualize this phenomenon I decided to look at the ratio between Dollar Tree s  NASDAQ DLTR  stock price    one of the country s largest low priced retailers    and Macy s  NYSE M   which carries higher end merchandise  I also put a 5 year Bollinger  Band on the ratio to distinguish between extreme ratio movements and those that are more mundane  During the past 20 years  a surge outside the bands like we have recently seen has either coincided with past recession  2008  or warned of looming recession  2000  

While this is by no means a sure sign of recession  it s interesting to note that consumers seem to be acting as if we have already entered one ",2016-08-10,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-retail-signaling-recession-200147255,200147255

For retailers  this is a highly competitive time of the year and the next month could make or break the quarter  Many retail companies will be ready and willing to offer parents all kinds of different incentives and discounts to get the parents inside the door or on the website 
According to the National Retail Federation  NRF   the average family is expected to spend more freely on school supplies this year  In fact  they estimate the spending for K 12 and college is expected to reach  75 8 billion  up 11  from  68 billion 
 75 billion is a lot of revenue to go around  but where are consumers actually going to spend that money  Looking at the figure below  we see that 60 5  plan to shop at discount stores  59  at department stores  51  at clothing stores  46  online  and 38 5  at offices supply stores 

Now let s take a look at companies that are drawing in consumers and benefiting from their back to school needs and wants  Below I list five stocks that will profit from an increase in back to school sales  These stocks are either Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Investors responded positively as the stock jumped over 10  in a day and is up 15  since EPS  Wal Mart reports on August 18th  so look for some earnings momentum from last quarter  Looking at the figure below you can see estimates ticking higher for both fiscal year 2016 and 2017  This early report should give investors a preview into how consumers are responding to back to school sales 

Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   DLTR  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that is an operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at a fixed price point of  1 00 or less  The company offers a wide range of quality everyday general merchandise in many categories  including housewares  seasonal goods  toys  gifts  party goods  books  personal accessories  and other consumer items  Dollar Tree was founded in 1986  employs over 55 000 and is based in Chesapeake  Virginia

In late May the company reported a downside EPS surprise of  13 04   Shares took a hit  but have since recovered  The company will report August 30th  which will give investors enough time to see if the back to school shoes are jumping off the shelves  If the company sees an EPS beat  expect a significant rally as a lot of negativity has been priced in over the last three years 

Best Buy  BBY  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that operates in a single business segment  selling personal computers and other home office products  consumer electronics  entertainment software  major appliances and related accessories principally through its retail stores  The Minnesota company employs 125 000 and was founded in 1966

150195,371711,DLTR,5 Large Cap Stocks Poised To Provide Big Returns,opinion,"On Monday  all of the three benchmark indexes ended on record highs  This was the second such occurrence within a period lesser than a week  On this occasion  a jump in oil prices was the catalyst for the benchmarks to end on such a positive note  Another reason for the surge in stocks was news that Hillary Clinton was leading GOP nominee Donald Trump by a decisive margin 
However  the absence of fundamental reasons for these gains means that the cause for such a rally is difficult to identify  As a more than seven year long Bull Run continues  it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to place their bets 
At the same time  it is important to remain invested in a market offering such strong gains  Picking large cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea in such an environment  
 Sell in May and Go Away  Refuted
This old saying has been strongly refuted by markets this year  The logic behind this adage is that the summer vacation season hampers sales and negatively affects business  This in turn leads to weak earnings during the July to September quarter 
Following from this logic  the second half of October generally witnesses disappointing numbers  which in turn pulls down markets  This is why it may be a good idea to cash in on May Day and return to the bourses on Halloween  read    
However  after traversing a relatively subdued May and ending mixed in June  markets performed strongly in July  Over the last month  the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq gained 3 6   2 8  and 6 6   respectively 
As of now  the Dow is up nearly 0 8  month to date  while the S P 500 and the Nasdaq have gained 1  and 3 2  over the same period  This may not seem to be much at first glance  but works out to be quite considerable when one extrapolates for the full year s returns  well in excess of 20  
Low Interest Rates  Absence of Alternatives Boosting Stocks 
Analysts and market watchers believe that stocks are being driven higher by an old theme  This is essentially a regime of low interest rates where investors are constantly searching for higher returns  As of now  the Fed seems to be unwilling to hike rates higher  Meanwhile  the rest of the world s central banks are intent on providing more and more monetary stimulus 
It is almost as if markets do not have any alternative but to keep on moving higher  Here  it is essential to understand that there is an absence of any strong positive or negative market related or economy driven developments  In such a situation  the rally feeds on itself and stocks create fresh records on a regular basis 
Our Choices
In an environment where stocks are creating fresh records every day  investors are being presented with an unusual dilemma  In the absence of a sell off  they can only hold onto their positions or buy into an ever rising market 
This is why it is important to seek out relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns  Large cap stocks are relatively safer bets  At the same time  it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short term benefits and the prospect of good long term performance  However  it may be difficult to pick winning stocks 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 
The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   is one of the world s largest tire manufacturing companies  selling under Goodyear  Dunlop and various other  house  brands as well as private label brands

150219,371735,DLTR,O  The Best Monthly Dividend Stock For Retirement Income,opinion,"The best monthly dividend stocks provide predictable  growing income  With 550 consecutive monthly dividends paid and 74 consecutive quarterly increases  Realty Income  NYSE O  is one of the most dependable dividend paying stocks in the market 
If the valuation is reasonable  these are the types of companies I like to own in our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio 
Let s take a closer look at Realty Income to see if it can make the cut Business OverviewRealty Income was founded in 1969 and is a real estate investment trust  REIT  with more than 4 600 properties located across 49 states 
Almost all of the company s properties are single tenant and are leased to 243 different commercial tenants doing business in nearly 50 different industries 
Retail properties account for close to 80  of Realty Income s total rent  and all of its properties are under long term triple net lease agreements  which provide solid cash flow visibility and shift property operating expenses such as maintenance  utilities  insurance and taxes to the tenant 
In other words  the rental revenue received by Realty Income has substantially fewer expenses and more stable net cash flow compared to REITs with a smaller mix of triple net leases Business AnalysisIt s no secret that few companies have maintained as strong of a dividend growth track record as Realty Income 
The company s success is driven by its diversified portfolio  disciplined capital allocation  focused business strategy  and strong financial health  These factors have combined to create an extremely resilient business 
Realty Income s long term growth has been nothing short of outstanding  Since 1994  the company has grown its real estate assets  at cost  from  451 million to  12 6 billion  expanded the number of industries served by its portfolio from 23 to 243  increased its number of commercial tenants from 23 to 243  and boosted its annual revenue from  49 million to over  1 billion 
Management s growth strategy over this time has been very focused  The company leverages its relationships with tenants  property developers  brokers  investment banks  and other parties to source acquisition opportunities with strong initial cap rates and built in rent growth 
Realty Income will only purchase freestanding  single tenant properties located in big markets and or key locations that it can lease to tenants with superior credit ratings and cash flows 
The retail business is very much driven by location  and Realty Income s portfolio clearly plays to this critical success factor 
As seen below  Realty Income s occupancy rate has never dipped below 96 6  going all the way back to 1992 
Source  Realty Income
Sustained high occupancy rates signal the high quality locations of Realty Income s properties and the financial strength of its tenants 
High occupancy rates are also indicative of the switching costs faced by consumer focused retailers  who don t want to risk disrupting their established customer base by moving to a new location to save a bit on rent 
Equally important  Realty Income is not betting on any one client or industry for its future success 
After all  a high occupancy rate is of little value if a single tenant accounts for a major portion of rent  e g  15   of total rent  and goes under or decides to walk away after its leases expire 
Realty Income s largest tenants by rent are Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA   6 8    FedEx  NYSE FDX   5 3    Dollar General  NYSE DG   4 5    LA Fitness  4 2    and Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   4 1   
Its largest industries by rent are drug stores  11    convenience stores  9    dollar stores  8 8    health and fitness  8 3    and theatres  5 2   
By geography  no state accounts for more than 10  of total rent 
Importantly  Realty Income focuses on leasing to tenants that have a service  non discretionary  and or low price point element to their business 
Over 90  of the company s retail tenants possess at least one of these components  which help them survive a variety of economic conditions and better compete with internet retailers 
Investment grade rated tenants also account for more than 40  of Realty Income s total annualized rental revenue 
All of these characteristics combine to create a durable and stable stream of rental revenue 
Realty Income s lease renewal schedule is also favorable  Less than 20  of its rental revenue is up for renewal over the next five years  and no more than 9  of its total rent is up for renewal any single year through 2030  The company s weighted average remaining lease term is also 10 years 
By staggering lease renewals  Realty Income avoids the risk of needing to renew a substantial amount of its leases at potentially less attractive rates during a down economy 
A final strength of Realty Income s business is its financial health  REITs are required to pay out almost all of their taxable income in the form of dividends  leaving very little capital for reinvestment  As a result  REITs primarily rely on external financing to fund their property acquisitions 
You can see that Realty Income s share count has nearly tripled since fiscal year 2005 to help fund its property acquisitions Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Realty Income targets a conservative capital structure with about two thirds equity and one third long term debt  Nearly 90  of the company s debt has a fixed interest rate  which protects near term earnings from rising interest rates  Its debt maturity schedule is also well laddered 
The company s debt ratios are also healthy  Realty Income maintains a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4 1 and an interest coverage ratio of 4 6 
Each of the major credit agencies has assigned Realty Income s senior unsecured notes and bonds an investment grade credit rating  too  Strong credit ratings help the company secure low cost funding to finance property acquisitions 
As long as Realty Income continues to have access to external financing for growth  there should be no shortage of properties for the company to acquire 
According to National Retail s 2014 annual report  the total size of the single tenant retail property market is estimated to be approximately  1 trillion  Realty Income s revenue last fiscal year was just over  1 billion  leaving plenty of room for future growth 
Overall  it s hard not to like Realty Income s business  The company owns thousands of extremely valuable retail locations  is diversified by tenant  industry  and geography  maintains a conservative capital structure  has plenty of opportunities for future growth  and has a long track record of creating value for shareholders 
These are many of the same factors possessed by Warren Buffett s best dividend stocks  and Realty Income will likely remain a force for many years to come Realty Income s Key RisksIt s challenging to identify many risks that could impair the long term earnings potential of Realty Income 
The company s diversification  financial conservatism  and focus on quality tenants and recession resistant industries eliminate many fundamental risks faced by other REITs 
Realty Income is significantly exposed to the consumer retail sector  80  of total rent   which is constantly evolving due to changing consumer preferences and the continued rise of e commerce 
However  Realty Income is not overly exposed to any single industry and derives the majority of its retail rent from tenants with business models that are less susceptible to online spending  e g  dollar stores  services  
Simply put  it seems unlikely that the continued rise of e commerce would materially impact demand across many of Realty Income s tenants  much less jeopardize their ability to continue making rent payments 
Aside from analyzing the health of a REIT s tenants  it s always worth mentioning that REITs face higher capital market risk than most other types of business models 
REITs are required to pay out at least 90  of their taxable income as dividends  which means they have less capital at their disposal to grow their businesses 
As a result  they need to issue shares and raise debt to finance property acquisitions and grow their cash flow 
If capital markets freeze up and or business fundamentals deteriorate  dividend cuts can become a real risk depending on the REIT 
Realty Income is conservatively financed and focuses on high quality tenants with less economy sensitive businesses  helping mitigate this risk  Realty Income s revenue declined by just 1  in fiscal year 2009  and the company recorded a 96  occupancy rate   However  it s an important risk to remain aware of for other REITs 
Overall  Realty Income seems to have low fundamental risk Dividend Analysis  Realty IncomeWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Realty Income has a Dividend Safety Score of 72  which suggests the company s current dividend payment is very safe 
One of the most important financial ratios for dividend investing is the payout ratio  While net income is used for most companies to compute the calculation  REITs face several complications 
Since REITs own a lot of property  they record substantial non cash depreciation charges each year  reducing their net income  However  the value of real estate tends to rise over time  creating a mismatch between accounting and reality 
For this reason and others  real estate businesses use a supplemental measure called  adjusted funds from operation   AFFO  in place of net income to get a better sense of their true dividend payout ratios 
AFFO measures cash flow by removing the non cash impact of real estate depreciation along with several other adjustments to give a truer look at a company s actual operating performance 
Realty Income expects AFFO per share of  2 85 to  2 90 in 2016  resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83  
I generally prefer companies with lower payout ratios to provide a greater margin of safety  but I will make exceptions for companies with extremely dependable earnings 
Realty Income seems to fit the bill  The company s long term leases  consistently strong occupancy rates  quality real estate locations  business diversification  and financially healthy tenants alleviate most of the concerns associated with a high payout ratio 
As seen below  the company has consistently grown its revenue and fared well throughout the last recession  seeing sales dip by just 1  in fiscal year 2009  A high payout ratio isn t as much of a concern if a company s results are stable throughout most economic environments Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Realty Income s solid Dividend Safety Score is further supported by its conservative capital structure and diversified mix of rent revenue Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Realty Income s Dividend Growth Score of 17 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is below average 
Despite management s solid track record of paying dividends for 47 years and increasing the dividend 85 times since 1994  dividend growth has averaged around 4 5  per year over most time periods Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While that is not bad growth  it is below the S P 500 s long term historical dividend growth rate 
Regardless  Realty Income s commitment to its dividend is unwavering  and I expect the company to eventually join the dividend aristocrats list once it is qualified to do so in the next five years 
Going forward  I expect Realty Income s dividend growth to average 3 5  per year   roughly in line with earnings growth 
REITs pay out almost all of their income as a dividend and are generally mature  capital intensive businesses  so dividend growth is often relatively low but reliable ValuationO s stock trades at approximately 20 times estimated 2016 AFFO per share and has a dividend yield of 4 0   which is lower than its five year average dividend yield of 4 9  
Going forward  I expect Realty Income s AFFO per share growth to average 4 6  per year  The company s organic sales only grow 1 2  per year  driven by rent increases  so it will need to continue tapping external financing and acquiring new properties to grow AFFO per share beyond that rate 
Under my AFFO per share growth assumptions  Realty Income s stock appears to offer total return potential of 8 10  per year 
Realty Income has performed very well recently  returning over 36  over the past year alone  Considering the stock s relatively high cash flow multiple and relatively low dividend yield  I would prefer to wait for a better entry point   perhaps caused by Fed induced volatility across higher yielding stocks if additional interest rate hikes are announced later this year 
REITs can be great income producing investments and Realty Income is certainly a high quality business  but that doesn t mean the stock is an attractively priced investment today ConclusionRealty Income is arguably the most reliable monthly dividend stock in the market and certainly possesses many of the qualities I look for in a high quality dividend stock 
I like the company s disciplined approach to acquiring properties  focus on leasing to high quality tenants  conservative capital structure  and thorough diversification by tenant  industry  and geography 
Realty Income should continue to enjoy consistent  albeit mild  dividend growth for many years to come  On a pullback  the stock will look really interesting as a potential investment opportunity ",2016-05-31,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/o:-the-best-monthly-dividend-stock-for-retirement-income-200133193,200133193

150237,371753,DLTR,What s Next For Dollar General ,opinion,"Dollar General Corp  NYSE DG  s last earnings release had quite a bit for investors to process  though most of it was pretty solid

At the top of the list was the company s plan to open 730 new stores and relocate or remodel another 875 this year to keep pressure on rival discounter Dollar Tree Inc  NASDAQ DLTR   Next year  DG plans to open another 900 

Dollar General currently has 11 800 stores nationwide  so you re talking about a 14  jump in the number of open stores in just two years  That s an ambitious plan  and Wall Street took the news well  DG stock was up about 4  on the announcement and is up a good 5  year to date 

The company needed to do something  Dollar General lost out in its attempt to buy a third dollar store rival  Family Dollar Stores  NYSE FDO   Inc  to Dollar Tree Inc  NASDAQ DLTR   So to make up for lost market share to the new combined Dollar Tree Family Dollar  Dollar General is going on the offensive with the expansion blitz 

Dollar stores have come to fill an important retail niche  particularly since the Great Recession hit seven years ago  With wage growth stagnant  dollar stores have helped working class and middle class Americans keep their budgets manageable 

Even Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT   Inc   yes  the mighty  invincible Walmart   has acknowledged the competitive threat that the deep discounters pose to its business   When Walmart isn t even cheap enough  you know that times are tough  

However  I question the wisdom of going on an expansion blitz when there is seemingly already a dollar store on every corner  And yes  I m also trying really hard to avoid making a cheesy reference to Clint Eastwood s A Fistful of Dollars 
But for now  Dollar General is wildly profitable  In its earnings announcement this week  earnings per share rose 16  and revenues rose a stellar 10   Some of this was due to expansion  but the crucial same store sales metric rose 4 9  

Guidance for the next quarter was a little lower than Wall Street had expected  but still very solid  Dollar General expects revenue growth of 8  to 9  for the full year 



Dollar General s margins have also remained stable  see chart   indicating that management has done a decent job of managing its growth and keeping rivals in check  If the dollar store niche is starting to get saturated  it certainly isn t showing up in DG s results yet 

So  where does Dollar General go from here 

The stock is not  cheap   per se   trading at 22 times trailing earnings and 1 2 times sales  To put that in perspective  Walmart trades for 16 2 times earnings and 0 5 times sales  But I have every reason to believe that DG stock has further to run  at least in the short term 

To start  despite its break neck expansion efforts  Dollar General is taking its responsibilities to shareholders seriously  It s adding  1 billion to its existing share repurchase program  and   even better   it s initiating a quarterly dividend of 22 cents starting next month  That s only a 1 2  dividend yield at current prices  but it s an important start  And once Dollar General slows its store expansion  it will have more cash on hand to boost its payout 

Another thing to keep in mind is that Dollar General is a counter cyclical stock  If you buy the argument that the U S  economy is reaching  escape velocity  from the Fed s accommodative policy  then you probably don t want to own Dollar General 

But if you share my view   that times remain quite challenging for most of Dollar General s working and middle class customers in this era of stagnant wage growth   then Dollar General s outlook is bright for at least the next several quarters 

Its shoppers may eventually tire of pinching pennies and may want to trade up  But we re not quite there yet  and we might not be for another couple years 

In the meantime  Dollar General offers a growing business that just initiated a dividend ",2015-03-16,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what’s-next-for-dollar-general-245064,245064

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  1 06  3 cents higher than Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  5 430 billion  roughly  12 million greater than the Street
Dollar Tree s acquisition of Family Dollar  N FDO  is expected to propel the company to one of the largest discount retailer in the U S 
Despite extraordinary revenue growth in the past 2 years  Dollar Tree has had trouble making a profit
Discount retailer  Dollar Tree  DLTR   is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings tomorrow  before the market opens  The company is coming off a solid third quarter driven by better than expected sales and comp growth  Shares  on the other hand  have been on a roller coaster ride after reaching 52 week lows in November  only to rebound in the past 3 months  This quarter expectations predict sales will continue their upward trend while profitability will remain flat 
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  1 06  3 cents higher than Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  5 430 billion  roughly  12 million greater than the Street  However our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a more modest beat of 1 cents  Compared to the same period last year  this projects as an 8  decline on the bottom line while sales are looking to grow a resounding 119   The Estimize community has been quite bearish on the company s profitability as of late  revising EPS estimates down 8   That said  Dollar Tree perineally beats Wall Street  trumping EPS and sales estimates  79  and 66  of quarters  respectively 

Dollar Tree s growth strategy is progressing well with a number of new stores expected to open this year and the recent acquisition of rival Family Dollar  The combined company is primed to make Dollar Tree one of the largest discount retailers in the United States  As the two companies become fully integrated  Family Dollar will generate synergies and further propel Dollar Tree s financial performance in the long run  Meanwhile  Dollar Tree s emphasis on new store openings and bolstering its current stores should continue to drive revenue growth 
On the downside  continued investments into growth and expansion have weighed heavily on the company s profitability  Last quarter  Dollar Tree posted a negative EPS surprise of  9 26  due to increasing costs  competitive pressure from Wal Mart  N WMT  and macroeconomic headwinds  With the integration of Family Dollar almost complete  this upcoming earnings call will paint a clearer picture of Dollar Tree s financial performance moving forward

150260,371776,DLTR,S P 1900  Not Far Off,opinion,"A rally late in the trading day Wednesday pushed the S P 500 futures higher as the FOMC minutes were released with an overall positive assessment of the economy  The major risk highlighted in the Fed meeting was that of a  persistent slowdown  in the housing sector   the sector that started the whole financial crisis 
The S P 500 spent the morning retracing Tuesday s drop and then consolidating in a tight  choppy range  Overall the day was marked by low volume and choppy  range bound price action 

Where has all the money gone 
The ongoing lack of volume raises the question   Where is the money   One answer may be that investors are reluctant to get into another round of fresh buying into a market less than 1  from all time highs and with two years since the last 10  correction 
Another answer may be dark pools  private exchanges that have  up to now  provided a largely hidden place to buy and sell stocks  Recent rule changes have opened up those dark pools to greater scrutiny  By the SEC s own estimates  dark pools now account for 14  of all stock trading volume  or over  20 trillion 
Some  dark pool  exchanges provide a place for HFT traders to apply their methods  MrTopStep has been very clear in our opinion that much of it is computerized front running  If there are venues outside the established exchanges that allow high frequency traders to access exchange data  but not have to show their own trades  that makes the front running even easier to get away with

Add to that 14  the 19  of volume contributed by wholesale market makers  They pay brokerages to send orders directly to them  not to the exchanges  The market makers then fill the orders in house  Together  dark pools and wholesale market makers may account for one third of stock trading 
Whatever positive role market making firms may play  they also remain unregulated  until now  Michael Lewis s book  Flash Boys  seems to have finally given the SEC enough political cover to demand more transparency  It s no surprise that Bank of America has just announced it is closing its market making unit rather than submit to the scrutiny 
Keep calm and trade on
Let s be clear  however  None of this means the average retail investor cannot trade profitably  Our professionals do it day after day in the MrTopStep Trading Room  Sure  some aspects of the game are rigged   but they always have been  But there are still price patterns and clear trends for those willing to look for them

Our View
From today s high  a 10 handle move would put the S P back at the all time high just below 1900  On Wednesday we said the ES had to go down before going up  Well  it s done that  both last Thursday and in this week s Turnaround Tuesday that never happened 
Now we have a positive FOMC minutes behind us and if the jobless claims and existing home sales numbers aren t surprisingly negative  we expect a push to the big number  The bullishness in Asia and Europe reinforce the optimistic tone 
We also expect it to be  as it has been for a while  choppy and low volume  An additional factor is the U S  Memorial Day holiday  Exchanges will close Monday  May 26  but many traders may simply start their weekends today  We lean to buying weakness and taking profits quickly rather than waiting for big moves 
If the low volume does anything  it may just set us up for a  thin to win  trade that pushes the market up  After that  watch for a selloff as longs look to take profits ahead of the holiday weekend 
As always  please keep an eye on the 10 handle rule and please use stops when trading futures and options

150261,371777,DLTR,Which Company Owns The Dollar Store Space ,opinion,"Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   Dollar General  NYSE DG  and Family Dollar Stores  NYSE FDO  all compete in the 99c discount arena  a  54B segment of the multi line retail sector  Retail sales have been lackluster over the past 2 quarters  but the dollar stores have been doing quite well on average comparably  During the holiday season it seemed as if every retail CEO got together and decided to blame the poor weather for their weak sales numbers  There was resounding solidarity in blaming snowstorms and the extreme cold and the excuse seemed to make plenty of sense  But when conditions in the retail environment failed to improve for many stores in the first quarter of 2014  the weather story was getting old  The dollar store industry was one of the few pockets of retail they didn t need to rely on the lame weather scapegoat to rationalize declining revenue figures  Here s a look at which dollar store is performing the best right now 


Dollar Tree  which reported its FQ1 of 2014 earnings on May 22nd posted earnings growth of 8c per share compared to last year and year over year revenue growth of 7   Compared to Dollar Tree s 14  increase in year over year profit  some of the bigger names in multiline retail which compete with the dollars stores like Walmart and Target didn t do quite so hot  In May Walmart  WMT  reported a 4  quarterly decline in EPS while Target  TGT  saw its FQ1 earnings fall 7c per share  or 9   


On the opposite side of the spectrum from Dollar Tree s strong recent performance  we have Family Dollar Stores  Family Dollar Stores reported the weakest quarter of the 3 chains  relative to its own earnings 1 year prior with earnings falling 41c  or 34   Last quarter Family Dollar Stores missed the Wall Street consensus by 10c per share and the Estimize consensus by 12c  While the dollar stores are generally outperforming the broader retail industry  Family Dollar is undergoing a restructuring and is the clear weak link among the 3 big dollar store chains at the moment  In the current quarter the Street is expecting Family Dollar s earnings to fall 16c compared to FQ3 of last year and for sales to come in 8  lower 


Dollar General reported its latest quarterly results before the market opened on Tuesday  June 3rd  After showing solid earnings gains in each of the past 8 quarters  DG only reported a 1c gain in EPS compared to the same quarter of last year  Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform expected more from Dollar General on the bottom line  but were not surprised by revenue coming in well below the Wall Street consensus  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
Over a 6 month stretch of general retail weakness  the dollar stores have been holding their own  Consumers may be spending less in stores across the board  but they appear to have stepped up their shopping for discount goods  Even Dollar General who missed the Estimize consensus on both EPS and revenue still managed to report a quarter of marginal growth with year over year gains of 1  on earnings and 7  in sales  After examining the most recent fundamental financial performances from the 3 dollar stores  it s clear that Dollar Tree is growing the fastest and for the moment is the dollar store to watch ",2014-06-03,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/which-company-owns-the-dollar-store-space-214866,214866

150263,371779,DLTR,A Look At The  Dollar  War,opinion,"In a statement Friday  Family Dollar s  NYSE FDO  board unanimously rejected Dollar General s  NYSE DG   9 1 billion takeover bid   That was somewhat of a surprise since Dollar General offered a juicier  9 1 billion bid for Family Dollar  which was higher than the recent acquisition offer from Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   which came at a price of  8 5 billion  As a result  Dollar Tree shares were up  31   Family Dollar shares were down 1 4  and Dollar General was down 3 14  in Friday s session  That move marks the second time that Family Dollar rejected an unsolicited offer from Dollar General  the top U S  dollar store chain due to supposedly antitrust concerns 
Certain Comfort  There is a very real and material risk that the transaction proposed by Dollar General would fail to close  after a lengthy and disruptive review process   Family Dollar Chief Executive Officer Howard Levine said in the statement  The Dollar Tree merger  he said  offers  closing certainty   With Family dollar s rejection  it reaffirms its plans to complete the previously announced  8 5 billion cash and stock deal with Dollar Tree  The transaction was valued at  74 50 per share  which was lower than Dollar General s offer of  78 50 per share  The announcement by Matthews  N C  based Family Dollar cited the  substantial risk  the Federal Trade Commission could assert that the proposed takeover would mean higher prices for U S  consumers Icahn s View On Thursday  the largest stakeholder of Family Dollar  Carl Icahn  finished selling his entire stake in Family Dollar  raking in  200 million   In the midst of the bidding war with Dollar Tree and Dollar General for Family Dollar  there were reports that Mr  Icahn criticized the company s performance and leadership  On paper  the deal from Dollar General was a better deal for investors and maybe the rejection from Family Dollar tipped Mr  Icahn over the edge and pushed him to get out fast   It seems obvious that in a Dollar General Family Dollar merger  Family Dollar CEO  Levine  would not have any future role   Icahn said on his  in August Higher OfferAfter Family Dollar rejected Dollar General s offer for a second time  Dollar General increased its price this week to  80 a share in cash  pushing its offer far above DLTR   Along with the sweetened bid  Dollar General said it would sell as many as 1 500 locations to placate regulators  up from 700 in its earlier offer  It also would pay Family Dollar  500 million if the deal failed to garner approval   The reaction from investors were not good as Family Dollar s share price fell to  79  indicating that investors thought Family Dollar passed up a juicy deal  If this sweetened offer from Dollar General does not convince Family Dollar s board  then Dollar General could turn hostile and go directly to the shareholders   Earlier this week  Dollar General threatened the company with such action if it was rejected again Bottom Line The increased offer by Dollar General    now rejected twice    is a strong indicator that Dollar General will do whatever it takes to acquire Family Dollar   Investors should watch what moves Dollar General make to position itself to acquire or create a hostile takeover for Family Dollar   We currently have Dollar General as a Zacks rank  3  hold   Family Dollar as a Zacks rank  3  hold  and Dollar Tree as a Zacks rank 4  sell    This bidding war seems far from over and investors should watch how this trio performs in the near term ",2014-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-look-at-the-'dollar'-war-224921,224921

150294,371810,DLTR,Gasoline  2008 Highs In Site ,opinion,Everyone knows that the price of gasoline has been surging higher at the pump  The average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States is now  3 86  In many other parts of the country such as California  Hawaii  New York  Illinois  Washington  Michigan  Maine  Oregon  and Connecticut the price is over  4 00 a gallon for regular unleaded  As many of you all know  gasoline is a direct tax on the U S  consumer  Consumer spending in the United States accounts for roughly 70 0 percent of the gross domestic product in the United States High gasoline prices will certainly restrict consumer spending at many leading retailers  The high price of gasoline will usually hurt the lower income families first  This is very evident if you look at stocks such as Family Dollar Stores Inc  NYSE FDO   Dollar Tree Inc  NASDAQ DLTR   and Dollar General Corp  NYSE DG   All of these leading stocks that cater to the lower income consumer have been selling off lately  Remember  higher gasoline prices are a direct tax on everyone in the country  Consumers need gasoline as much as we need food these days to survive Traders can easily look at a chart of the United States Gasoline Fund  NYSEARCA UGA  to see the dramatic rise since June 21  2012 when the UGA traded as low as  43 13 a share  Today  the UGA is trading at  61 88 a share which is a new three year high  The all time high for the UGA was  65 33 a share made in 2008  This old high is now in the sites of many traders speculating in the gasoline market What is the cause of the high gasoline price  The first cause of high gasoline is the recent weakness in the U S  Dollar Index futures  DX U2   The U S  Dollar Index has tumbled lower by more than 5 0 percent since July 24  2012  This is a dramatic decline for the U S  Dollar Index which is the world s reserve currency  You see  if you want to buy a barrel of oil in Japan  or some other country you must buy that barrel of oil in U S  Dollars  The Japanese cannot buy oil in Japanese Yen or some other currency  it must be U S  Dollars  This is why the price of gasoline will inflate when the U S  Dollar declines  Traders that do not have a chart of the U S  Dollar Index can easily follow a chart of the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish  NYSEARCA UUP  Later today  the Federal Reserve Bank  central bank of the U S   is going to announce its interest rate policy decision  Many traders and investors are also waiting to hear if there s a plan for the central bank s next stimulus program  called QE 3  When more stimulus is put into the system it weakens and dilutes the strength of the U S  Dollar  This act will simply push gasoline and other commodity prices higher  If there is bad weather  or a conflict in an oil producing country  that will create higher energy costs for all consumers  Here is the bright side  while gasoline prices continue to surge so do stock prices  However  let s see how everyone feels when gasoline is over  5 00 a gallon very soon ,2012-09-13,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gasoline:-2008-highs-in-site-136196,136196
