15014,236529,WHR,Whirlpool to close Italian plant amid protests,news,"ROME  Reuters    U S  listed white goods maker Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  said on Tuesday it would close its plant in Naples on Nov  1  despite a final attempt by the Italian government to keep the site open 
Whirlpool said in May that production of high end washing machines in Naples was no longer profitable and that it intended to sell the factory  which employs 450 workers in a region with some of the highest unemployment levels in Italy 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli held a last ditch meeting with company managers on Tuesday but failed to win any concessions 
 The talks were not positive     the company continues to offer as a single solution  a sale of the business branch   Patuanelli said after the meeting in Rome 
Metalworkers union FIOM CGIL called for a two hour strike at the company s six plants in Italy and some 300 workers blocked a highway outside Naples in protest at the decision 
Whirlpool  which employs around 5 500 people in Italy  said it had failed to make any progress in months of negotiations about a reorganization of the site and confirmed the plant would be shut down at the start of next month 
In June  the Italian government threatened to scrap all incentives it had granted to the company to keep investing in Italy  estimated at some 50 million euros since 2014 ",2019-10-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/whirlpool-to-close-italian-plant-amid-protests-1996580,1996580

15088,236603,WHR,Trump s latest tariffs undercut his first trade salvo in solar,news,"By Nichola Groom LOS ANGELES  Reuters    In January  President Donald Trump fired the opening shot of his trade war  slapping tariffs on solar panel imports to boost U S  manufacturing of a product long dominated by cheap foreign competition  But other duties his administration has imposed since then are making the solar panel components more expensive   dampening the domestic panel manufacturing sector s initial hopes for expansion  The conflicting impacts of his tariffs illustrate the pitfalls the administration faces in using broad protections for economic development   because tariffs meant to help one industry often undermine those shielding another  Other examples include a levy on imported washing machines to help domestic manufacturers such as Whirlpool  N WHR   the effect of which has since been undercut by separate tariffs on the imported steel and aluminum used to make them  For the solar industry  the impact of Trump s tariffs for companies and jobs gets even more complex   The United States currently accounts for just a fraction of the fast growing global panel manufacturing industry  a key reason why Trump moved to protect the U S  sector   While the January tariff on panels initially boosted the U S  manufacturing outlook  it dented the prospects for the panel installation business by making panels more expensive for consumers  Now solar manufacturers   including four that said they would expand U S  production after Trump s January announcement   are also taking a hit  this time from newer tariffs covering a range of Chinese made components used in panel production   Two companies with U S  operations   China s Jinko Solar  N JKS  and Silicon Valley startup Solaria   told Reuters they have scaled back initial growth plans as a result    The impacts are generally very  very negative   Suvi Sharma  the chief executive of Solaria  told Reuters  Jinko slashed a planned  410 million investment at a manufacturing facility in Florida to just  50 million  costing the city of Jacksonville some 600 prospective jobs  according to public disclosures filed by the city council  Solaria abandoned its hopes of boosting production this year at its plant in Fremont  California and adding 20 jobs  Finished solar panels require scores of components  ranging from aluminum framing to transformers  solar glass and power inverters  Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum early this year  and many of the other materials used in panels now also face duties as part of Trump s 10 percent levy on about  200 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect in September  The tax on those imports will rise to 25 percent on Jan  1  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the solar tariffs were designed with other duties in mind and that domestic solar panel manufacturers should consider buying their components from places other than China  That could be difficult because China is the top source of cheap components  But some panel manufacturers say they are already sourcing panel components from countries other than China  including Korea s LG  which is starting panel production in Alabama next year  and Canada s Heliene  which started production in Minnesota in October  Some component makers are also shifting production out of China to serve U S  manufacturers  Enphase Energy  O ENPH   for example  said it will start making microinverters for the U S  market in Mexico  Its rival  SolarEdge  O SEDG   has said it would move some production to Romania and Hungary  The  17 billion U S  solar industry employs more than 250 000 people  most of them in installation and development and only about a fifth in manufacturing  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  The Commerce Department s senior renewable energy specialist  Cora Dickson  acknowledged at a September solar industry trade show that the tariffs impacting components pose a challenge for domestic panel manufacturers  but added they will be lifted once the U S  and China come to better terms on trade    It s not designed to cut off trade from China forever   she said at the Solar Power International conference in Anaheim  California   PULLING BACK ON INVESTMENTS Solaria s Sharma estimated that U S  tariffs this year have increased the company s U S  production costs by about 30 percent   an amount equal to the original U S  solar panel import duty  That means that  instead of ramping up its Fremont  California factory to its full 40 MW of capacity as Solaria had planned this year  it has kept production constant at an unspecified level  Jinko has seen its growth plans constrained by Trump administration tariffs on steel for factory construction  Chinese made manufacturing equipment  said U S  General Manager Nigel Cockroft  Certain parts for panel assembly are also  limiting factors   he said  The public documents filed by Jacksonville s city council in January and March show Jinko s original  410 million investment plan for the Jacksonville facility would have produced some 800 jobs  The  50 million plan that replaced it will create 200  Jinko declined to elaborate on the documents  Sunpower  O SPWR    a major U S  based solar company that bought a manufacturing plant in Oregon after Trump s initial panel import tariff   is another company feeling the pinch   We are certainly concerned   Suzanne Leta  the head of global market strategy at SunPower  said at the Solar Power International conference   The new tariffs are discouraging the kind of manufacturing expansion the original tariffs on imported panels were meant to encourage  she said  Leta did not say specifically how the component tariffs might affect SunPower s domestic output  and the company declined further comment  Other solar panel producers with U S  operations contacted by Reuters   including Korea s LG  and Canada s Heliene   said they expected the impact of the new rounds of tariffs to be limited because of their particular supply chain dynamics  Another Canadian firm  Silfab Solar  expects  slightly elevated costs  at the U S  factory in Bellingham  Washington it took over from Itek Energy LLC in October  according to spokesman Geoff Atkins  For  First Solar Inc   O FSLR   which mostly manufactures panels in Asia but is expanding a factory in Ohio  tariffs pose a  headwind  for U S  operations  Chief Executive Mark Widmar said on a conference call with analysts  citing higher costs for steel parts and aluminum frames  COMPLAINTS FROM TESLA Solar and electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc  O TSLA  complained about the tariffs in a September letter to the U S  Trade Representative  saying they  will hinder American innovation  expansion of companies  and the creation of more American jobs   The company declined to comment on the specific impact of the tariffs on its U S  operations  including its solar manufacturing plant in Buffalo  New York  where it is already facing technical challenges to increasing output   The Solar Energy Industry Association  SEIA   the solar industry s primary trade group  said it had opposed the initial solar panel tariff in January to begin with because it expected the benefit for domestic manufacturing would fail to compensate for damage to the solar installation industry   
Now  the impact of additional tariffs on components used in manufacturing are  slowing down something we had pretty low expectations for to begin with  ",2018-11-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trumps-latest-tariffs-undercut-his-first-trade-salvo-in-solar-1671689,1671689
15089,236604,WHR,Another Warning Sign That the U S  Economy Will Slow Next Year,news," Bloomberg     Juiced by President Donald Trump s tax cuts  business investment helped deliver a robust U S  economy in the first half of 2018  but signs have multiplied that the growth driver is faltering 
Companies face tariff related uncertainty  cooling global demand and rising borrowing costs  while plunging oil prices are menacing the energy sector  Meanwhile  the U S  and China are settling in for a protracted trade war  the boost from lower taxes is projected to fade next year and a politically divided Congress will probably shirk from additional stimulus 
These challenges will test corporate America s appetite to invest in the kind of faster growth  higher productivity future the Trump administration has promised  While such spending picked up in early 2018 after plodding along for years  a string of weak reports raises questions about the outlook  With firms using tax savings for buybacks and dividends rather than investment  the best gains may already be over 
 Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI    Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR     Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   and Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK   recently cited higher costs from the trade war  The strength of capital expenditures    or capex    may be the key to determining whether U S  growth can continue outpacing peers  how much higher the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates  and whether the dollar s value will keep rising 
 Capex is the No  1 story   said David Woo  head of global rates and foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC    There are hundreds of data points coming out every month but that s the one that I watch   and bond traders should too 
The trade war and likely political gridlock after the midterm elections pose  the biggest uncertainty for capex and therefore U S  rates and the U S  dollar   said Woo  who s analyzed the economy and markets for almost a quarter century 
Trump and Republicans sold the corporate tax cut and full and immediate expensing    which gives companies an immediate tax break for investing    as a way to rev up the economy and pay for the  1 5 trillion cost of the new tax law 
While few expect capex to collapse  there s a growing debate over business investment  which encompasses spending on equipment  on structures such as factories and offices  and on intellectual property and software 
Before the recent plunge in oil prices  the energy sector rebound helped pump up capex and manufacturing  Then  deregulation and corporate tax cuts added a sugar high  until recently  Nonresidential investment slowed to a crawl last quarter  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged as much  but said last week business spending is booming again 
Yet orders at U S  factories for non military capital goods  excluding aircraft  were weak in October for a third straight month  The Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index fell to a six month low in October  and regional Fed gauges cooled  The economy is projected to expand at a more moderate pace this quarter and soften further in early 2019 
On Jan  1  tariffs go up to 25 percent on  200 billion of imports from China  a critical player in manufacturing supply chains  and Trump has threatened to impose levies on everything imported from the Asian nation    which would further elevate materials costs and worsen supply disruptions 
 I don t count business investment as down and out   said Ellen Zentner  chief U S  economist at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    But there are a lot of uncertainties about next year   so the expansion  could slow more than anyone is expecting  
The escalation in tariffs could set off a chain of negative events  including reduced forecasts from companies and a hit to margins  she said  The biggest unknown is whether investors sour on the growth story and cause financial conditions to tighten 
The latest ISM manufacturing survey showed more than 40 percent of the comments from respondents in recent months were related to tariffs  with trade uncertainty continuing to push companies to evaluate whether to invest or adopt a wait and see approach  or even consider expansion outside the U S 
Recent market jitters reflect concern about trade  A business investment slowdown also would have implications for the economy s long term speed limit and inflation 
Without investment growth at an adequate pace  productivity is likely to stay mired in the rut of the past decade  That means less room for wage gains  which have been the missing piece of the strengthening job market throughout this expansion 
Stephen Stanley  chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC  is optimistic  arguing the recent capital spending weakness reflects  more of a breather than the end of the line  for the tax cut boost  He said investment should stay elevated and the impact may pay off over several years with higher productivity 
For now  the question is whether demand is steady enough to encourage executives to increase investments in buildings  machines and software 
 The biggest tax levied by Washington is the uncertainty tax   said David Kelly  chief global strategist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Asset Management   You need a capex boom going on now if you are going to get a meaningful impact on the capital labor ratio and therefore productivity  And we don t see that right now  And uncertainty related to trade has a lot to do with this  ",2018-11-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/another-warning-sign-that-the-us-economy-will-slow-next-year-1701208,1701208
15092,236607,WHR,GM Layoffs Show Even President Trump Can t Stop Market Forces,news," Bloomberg     Donald Trump can fret over General Motors Co  NYSE GM   s plan to close plants  slash jobs and ditch models  He can even threaten  as he did Tuesday 
But market forces are tough to beat  even if you re president 
Trump captured the White House thanks in large part to the story he told    that he could reverse America s industrial decline  He promised to bring back manufacturing and fossil fuel jobs written off as casualties of global trade and over regulation 
But almost halfway through Trump s first term  divergences from his  Make America Great Again  story line continue to pile up  pushed along by technology  globalization and a changing climate 
Trump is fighting back  On Tuesday  the day after GM s announcement  he tweeted out threats to cut all the subsidies GM receives  including tax breaks for electric vehicles  Larry Kudlow  director of the White House National Economic Council  also piled on   There s great disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build its electric cars in China rather than the United States   Kudlow told reporters at a briefing just before Trump s tweets 
It s unclear whether Trump has authority to revoke subsidies without action by Congress  It s also difficult  if not impossible  for Trump to overcome the dynamics that are driving companies to choose robots over humans  discontinue brands and close plants  Some are choosing to build nearer to their consumers and supply chains  including China  while others are moving production lines to lower cost countries  like Mexico 
Trade Deficit
Consumers  too  are increasingly switching to alternative energy for cars and homes  As wages finally rise  people are also buying more imported goods  which pushes up the U S  trade deficit  one metric by which Trump assesses the economy 
 The market is a tsunami   said Seth Kaplowitz  a finance lecturer at San Diego State University   If you surf it  you ll be fine  but if you push back  it s too strong  
Trump has gone to great lengths to revive once storied industries  America s steel and aluminum companies won levies to hamper foreign competitors  He hit Whirlpool s biggest rival  South Korea s Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   with tariffs on washing machines  For coal miners  Trump is proposing to reduce Obama era environmental regulations  He also billed his corporate tax cut as an elixir for capital spending and job creation 
Quid Pro Quo
Sometimes  Trump has offered an explicit quid pro quo  For GM and other automakers  he pledged to lower fuel economy standards in return for jobs  His administration is also considering tariffs on imported autos and parts on national security grounds 
All of this is on top of the president s biggest push to revive industry  starting a trade war with China  America s largest commercial partner 
Market forces  however  have proved too powerful  For Mary Barra  GM s chief executive  the plan to close a handful of older plants and dismiss more than 14 000 employees came down to basic economics  Consumers are expected to shift to electric and autonomous vehicles  They re also shunning small cars  like GM s Chevy Cruze  in favor of pickups and SUVs  With some factories down to one shift a day  GM said it needed to cut its capacity to make traditional passenger cars  while keeping lower cost production in Mexico 
These moves drew the ire of the president  who said   We have a lot of pressure on them  to maintain operations in places like Lordstown  Ohio    a state key to his re election   You better get back in there soon    that s Ohio

GM s restructuring comes less than two years after Trump praised the company for promising to invest  1 billion in its U S  operations  It was one of many such pledges by large companies    even though some were reiterating existing plans    meant to gain favor with the new administration  The jobs GM promised  however  have largely gone to Silicon Valley  where it s developing autonomous vehicles 
Like GM  Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  said it will exit much of the passenger car market to focus on SUVs and trucks  It also has said it will lay off workers as part of an  11 billion restructuring 
Public Scolding
Jawboning aside  Trump was unable to stop job losses at a Carrier Corp  air conditioning plant in Indianapolis  Soon after winning office  he made a highly publicized visit to the factory in a bid to stop Carrier from moving positions to Monterrey  Mexico  The company kept the plant open after receiving millions in state subsidies  But about 600 workers ended up losing their jobs anyway 
The U S  still is a manufacturing heavyweight  but companies increasingly are choosing automation over human labor  Some forces buffeting manufacturers are the result of other Trump policies  He has worked to lower oil prices by cutting environmental rules and pressuring petrostates  U S  consumers have responded by purchasing yet more SUVs and trucks  which accounted for about 65 percent of new vehicle sales in September  Tariffs have also raised prices on aluminum and steel  forcing up production costs 
Harley Davidson
The decision by Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG    once Trump s model of a patriotic American manufacturer  to shift motorcycle production to Europe came in direct response to Trump s tariffs  which prompted the European Union to retaliate with duties of its own  damaging sales there 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  at first welcomed Trump s tariffs by adding 200 jobs in the U S  It was hurt months later by levies on steel and aluminum  which raised the cost of raw materials  The company said it was forced to pass those costs to customers by raising prices  a move that battered sales and resulted in a profit warning and a steep slide in shares 
Just hours after GM s announcement Monday  Trump told supporters at a rally in Biloxi  Mississippi  that they shouldn t worry   Under my administration  we ve created 600 000 brand new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country  
Not quite  Since Trump took office  the U S  Department of Labor reports  companies have added just over 400 000 manufacturing jobs    tiny compared with 150 million non farm positions  Coal mining jobs have also increased  but by fewer than 2 000 slots 
Tax Cuts
Early on  Trump s corporate tax cut appeared to boost capital spending  but that may have been short lived  Companies are reacting more to market conditions than the tax law  such as by paying more because labor is tight  One measure of U S  business investment shows it at the same level as before the tax cuts  In the end  Kaplowitz said  companies are concerned with profitability and survival over allegiance to a country or politician 
Trade deficit numbers are telling  The gap between what the U S  sells abroad and what it buys from other countries has ballooned under Trump  In September  the deficit was  54 billion  up  700 million from August and a seven month high  In the year to date  the deficit has increased by  40 7 billion  or 10 percent  from the same period in 2017

15093,236608,WHR,GM Layoffs Show How Even Trump Can t Stop Market Forces,news," Bloomberg     Donald Trump can fret over General Motors Co  NYSE GM   s plan to close plants  slash jobs and ditch models  He can even threaten  as he did Tuesday 
But market forces are tough to beat  even if you re president 
Trump captured the White House thanks in large part to the story he told    that he could reverse America s industrial decline  He promised to bring back manufacturing and fossil fuel jobs written off as casualties of global trade and over regulation 
But almost halfway through Trump s first term  divergences from his  Make America Great Again  story line continue to pile up  pushed along by technology  globalization and a changing climate 
Trump is fighting back  On Tuesday  the day after GM s announcement  he tweeted out threats to cut all the subsidies GM receives  including tax breaks for electric vehicles  Larry Kudlow  director of the White House National Economic Council  also piled on   There s great disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build its electric cars in China rather than the United States   Kudlow told reporters at a briefing just before Trump s tweets 
It s unclear whether Trump has authority to revoke subsidies without action by Congress  It s also difficult  if not impossible  for Trump to overcome the dynamics that are driving companies to choose robots over humans  discontinue brands and close plants  Some are choosing to build nearer to their consumers and supply chains  including in China  while others are moving production lines to lower cost countries  like Mexico 
Trade Deficit
Consumers  too  are increasingly switching to alternative energy for cars and homes  As wages finally rise  people are also buying more imported goods  which pushes up the U S  trade deficit  one metric by which Trump assesses the economy 
 The market is a tsunami   said Seth Kaplowitz  a finance lecturer at San Diego State University   If you surf it  you ll be fine  but if you push back  it s too strong  
Trump has gone to great lengths to revive once storied industries  America s steel and aluminum companies won levies to hamper foreign competitors  He hit Whirlpool s biggest rival  South Korea s Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   with tariffs on washing machines  For coal miners  Trump is proposing to reduce Obama era environmental regulations  He also billed his corporate tax cut as an elixir for capital spending and job creation 
Quid Pro Quo
Sometimes  Trump has offered an explicit quid pro quo  For GM and other automakers  he pledged to lower fuel economy standards in return for jobs  His administration is also considering tariffs on imported autos and parts on national security grounds 
All of this is on top of the president s biggest push to revive industry  starting a trade war with China  America s largest commercial partner 
Market forces  however  have proved too powerful  For Mary Barra  GM s chief executive  the plan to close a handful of older plants and dismiss more than 14 000 employees came down to basic economics  Consumers are shunning sedans like GM s Chevrolet Cruze in favor of pickups and SUVs  With some factories down to one shift a day  GM said it needed to cut its capacity to make traditional passenger cars and free up resources to invest in autonomous and electric vehicles  It s keeping lower cost production in Mexico 
These moves drew the ire of the president  who said his administration has put  a lot of pressure  on GM to maintain operations in places like Ohio    a state key to his re election  Trump referred to a plant there where he urged Barra to  get back in  soon 
GM s restructuring comes less than two years after Trump praised the company for promising to invest  1 billion in its U S  operations  It was one of many such pledges by large companies    even though some were reiterating existing plans    meant to gain favor with the new administration  The jobs GM promised  however  have largely gone to Silicon Valley  where it s developing autonomous vehicles 
GM shares are down 10 percent this year  compared with the S P 500 Index s 0 3 percent gain  The carmaker was up 0 4 percent to  36 85 in early New York trading on Wednesday 
Like GM  Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  said it will exit much of the passenger car market to focus on SUVs and trucks  It also has said it will lay off workers as part of an  11 billion restructuring 
Public Scolding
Jawboning aside  Trump was unable to stop job losses at a Carrier Corp  air conditioning plant in Indianapolis  Soon after winning office  he made a highly publicized visit to the factory in a bid to stop Carrier from moving positions to Monterrey  Mexico  The company kept the plant open after receiving millions in state subsidies  But about 600 workers ended up losing their jobs anyway 
The U S  still is a manufacturing heavyweight  but companies increasingly are choosing automation over human labor  Some forces buffeting manufacturers are the result of other Trump policies  He has worked to lower oil prices by cutting environmental rules and pressuring petrostates  U S  consumers have responded by purchasing yet more SUVs and trucks  which accounted for about 65 percent of new vehicle sales in September  Tariffs have also raised prices on aluminum and steel  forcing up production costs 
Harley Davidson
The decision by Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG    once Trump s model of a patriotic American manufacturer  to shift motorcycle production came in direct response to Trump s tariffs  which prompted the European Union to retaliate with duties of its own  damaging sales there 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  at first welcomed Trump s tariffs by adding 200 jobs in the U S  It was hurt months later by levies on steel and aluminum  which raised the cost of raw materials  The company said it was forced to pass those costs to customers by raising prices  a move that battered sales and resulted in a profit warning and a steep slide in shares 
Just hours after GM s announcement Monday  Trump told supporters at a rally in Biloxi  Mississippi  that they shouldn t worry   Under my administration  we ve created 600 000 brand new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country  
Not quite  Since Trump took office  the U S  Department of Labor reports  companies have added just over 400 000 manufacturing jobs    tiny compared with 150 million non farm positions  Coal mining jobs have also increased  but by fewer than 2 000 slots 
Tax Cuts
Early on  Trump s corporate tax cut appeared to boost capital spending  but that may have been short lived  Companies are reacting more to market conditions than the tax law  such as by paying more because labor is tight  One measure of U S  business investment shows it at the same level as before the tax cuts  In the end  Kaplowitz said  companies are concerned with profitability and survival over allegiance to a country or politician 
Trade deficit numbers are telling  The gap between what the U S  sells abroad and what it buys from other countries has ballooned under Trump  In September  the deficit was  54 billion  up  700 million from August and a seven month high  In the year to date  the deficit has increased by  40 7 billion  or 10 percent  from the same period in 2017 
Trump isn t deterred  at least publicly   They said manufacturing jobs would never come back  you d need a magic wand   he said in Biloxi   Well  we found the magic wand

15114,236629,WHR,Tariffs threaten market leading tech  consumer stocks,news,"By April Joyner NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  technology and consumer discretionary stocks have been insulated from global trade tensions  but if another round of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods goes into effect  even those high flying sectors could come down to earth  The United States and China have already imposed tariffs on  50 billion worth of each other s goods  The White House has proposed tariffs on an additional  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  including furniture  handbags and some computer parts   U S  President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to move forward with levies on an additional  267 billion   in essence  all Chinese imports into the United States  The inclusion of consumer goods is a shift from previous rounds of U S  tariffs  which have primarily hit the industrial sector  Shares of companies such as Boeing  NYSE BA  Co and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  have risen and fallen in tandem with trade sentiment  On Wednesday  the Trump administration said that it invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks  which has been welcomed by Beijing  U S  stocks have perked up on the news  but that optimism could be fleeting   Investors in general are too predisposed to react too positively to any signs of improvement in the situation   said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York   I don t expect the  Trump  administration to back down   Companies in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors have begun sounding alarm bells  A broad array of U S  industry groups  representing companies such as  Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT   Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc and  Mattel Inc   NASDAQ MAT   has voiced opposition to the new tariffs  Even Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   whose stock has contributed heavily to the S P 500 s gains  has warned that the proposed tariffs would affect several of its products  including the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones  though it did not mention the iPhone  In part because of trade issues  shares of tech companies have gotten off to a rocky start in September  As of Thursday s close  the S P 500 tech sector had fallen 1 2 percent this month  versus a 0 1 percent rise for the S P 500 as a whole  S P 500 consumer discretionary stocks had risen 0 2 percent  less than the 2 percent advance in industrial stocks   The next round of escalation really does impact the leadership of the market   said Lisa Shalett  head of investment and portfolio strategies at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  Wealth Management  In anticipation of heightened trade tensions  companies have built up inventory  which could have an adverse effect on supply chains later on  Shalett said  Inventory pile ups have already pushed down pricing in the semiconductor industry  The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index had fallen 2 8 percent in September as of Thursday s close   Consumer oriented companies face a catch 22 in their response to tariffs  Those that compete on price  such as Walmart  will likely have to absorb the cost of levies  which will cut into their margins  But companies that pass costs onto consumers  as Apple has indicated it will do  risk dampening demand for their products   Invesco s Hooper pointed to washing machines as an example  Tariffs on steel and aluminum caused Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR  to raise prices on its appliances  and its second quarter earnings slumped as a result  To be sure  consumer electronics are flashier products than a washer dryer set  And U S  tech companies can skirt some tariffs by shipping Chinese made parts directly to other countries for assembly and then importing the finished items into the United States  said Scott Yuschak  equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta  The list of targeted items in the next round of tariffs excludes cell phones  for instance  With such mitigating factors  many investors are reluctant to make sweeping changes to their portfolios  though Morgan Stanley s Shalett has recommended a rotation into defensive sectors   Many are likely waiting for third quarter earnings for more details on the impact of trade  said David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston  But further signs of escalation in the U S  China trade war could quickly raise the stakes for the S P s leading sectors  The final round of levies would include consumer electronic products imported from China  Some market watchers fear that China  which cannot match the United States in tit for tat tariffs  would respond by restricting U S  companies  ability to sell products in the country

might be draped with shirts  pants or pyjamas   It depends on how exhausted from work I am and if I plan to wear them again   said the 35 year old retail clerk       Marketers at consumer goods giant  Unilever   L ULVR   AS UNc  are calling it the  chairdrobe    the heap of lightly worn clothes that often ends up crumpling one s go to garments   It s a familiar sight in the bedrooms of some 60 percent of millennials   22  to 37 year olds earning more than a quarter of the world s income   who approach laundry differently from other age groups  Unilever s market research shows  That s a pain point for the company  maker of the world s second biggest detergent  Omo  For decades  Unilever and Procter   Gamble  N PG   the industry leader that created the best selling brand  Tide  have pitched new and improved laundry detergents and fabric softeners  primarily to women using washing machines  But millennials are less loyal to traditional brands and have new demands  including that products save time and be environmentally sustainable   Many  like 36 year old Olivia Tusinski  want to spend as little time as possible on laundry  Plus  washing too often wears your clothes out faster  she says   I don t like to waste water or energy   said Tusinski  a government employee in London   P G tested a line to woo the wash weary a decade ago after discovering how common re wearing clothes was  The Swash brand was parlayed into a  499 de wrinkling appliance in partnership with Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  but two products made it to market as Downy Wrinkle Releaser spray and Tide Stain Pen   Now  Unilever is having a go with Day 2  an aerosol spray that went on sale online only last week that it says refreshes  reshapes and dewrinkles clothes on the chairdrobe  There are versions for denim and delicates  in addition to the original  Denim jeans are by far the most reworn garment  Unilever says    That s a high pride point for a lot of millennials  you know  ensuring that their denim is as pristine as possible   said Day 2 s co founder and marketing head Nathan Olivieri  Indeed  denim aficionados have warned for years against washing jeans  Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh  a 28 year veteran of P G  told a conference in 2014 that the jeans he was wearing that day were a year old and had never been washed  LIKE A START UP Unilever s home care president Kees Kruythoff calls catering to millennials  mindset a way of  future proofing  the portfolio  In addition to Day 2 in the United Kingdom  Unilever is testing a portion controlled detergent in the Netherlands called Less  Both projects have been structured as if the developers were small and agile start ups  not a multinational   The global laundry detergent market is expected to reach  205 2 billion by 2025  up from  133 3 billion in 2016  according to Grand View Research  which predicts 4 9 percent annual growth fueled by the rising penetration of washing machines in developing countries  In more developed markets  growth is being helped by eco friendly brands like Seventh Generation  now owned by Unilever  and Method  Grand View said   These upstart brands  which boast fewer chemicals and packaging with recycled plastic  are part of the wave of disruption that earlier slammed food and personal care and has finally shaken up home care  Laundry leaders P G  Unilever and Henkel  DE HNKG p  are aiming to save consumers time with pre measured or all in one offerings  Meanwhile  start up subscription brands deliver soap to consumers  homes  while new mobile apps offer laundry services on demand   Unilever s detergent Skip has partnered in Paris with the mobile app Cowash to connect people with neighbors willing to wash and iron their laundry for a fee   Cowash says about 80 percent of its customers have washing machines and wash some of their clothes  but use the service to avoid time consuming items like shirts that need ironing   They don t do it because they don t have washing machines  they do it because they don t have time   Cowash founder Adrien Hugon said  Indeed  the project brief Unilever handed down to Olivieri some 10 months ago was to create a product that would give millennials more confidence to rewear worn clothes  since there was nothing on the market that explicitly targeted the issue and addressed smell  wrinkles and shape  the 25 year old told Reuters  While P G s Febreze spray can be used to remove odors from clothes  for example  it more often focuses on hard to clean fabrics in the home or car such as upholstery and curtains  Olivieri aimed to create a premium all in one product in an attractive can that could be displayed in a bedroom   Over the course of one month last autumn  Olivieri s ten person team developed the brand away from corporate headquarters in a rented house in a village outside Liverpool  frequently inviting consumers in for real time feedback    We know the chairdrobe is a universal concept     but as we move

15131,236646,WHR,It s Getting Real  World Economy Feels the Bite From Trade War,news," Bloomberg     Protectionism is slowly starting to weigh on the global economy 
From demand at factories to company profits and prices consumers are paying  the tit for tat trade battle U S  President Donald Trump started with China and the European Union is starting to show up in numbers  And it s still early days  with Trump saying Tuesday that  tariffs are the greatest   a warning that he may not let up until he gets what he wants 
The latest signs of the fallout came in activity reports from Japan  Europe and the U S   as well as anxious words from companies facing an additional uncertainty and having to decide between taking a hit to their profit margins or jacking up prices  Many manufacturers are also facing higher raw material costs  another squeeze on earnings 
Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   on Tuesday cut its profit margin forecast  citing tariffs  The iconic motorcycle maker was caught in the crossfire of the trade war last month when it announced plans to shift some U S  production overseas  prompting attacks from Trump 
Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV Chief Executive Frans van Houten says an escalation of tariffs may mean it has to pass on costs to customers  and Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   said rising raw material costs hurt results in some of its markets in the second quarter 
For the global economy  which was enjoying its best spell in years  there s a sense that the period of synchronized global growth is at an end  The U S  has got a temporary shot in the arm from tax cuts  but growth is cooling in China  a number of emerging markets are dealing with a currency sell off  and Europe has been slow to recover from a winter battered start to the year 
According to Abby Joseph Cohen  advisory director at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   global growth will continue into 2019  but it s moving into a slower phase  A trade war on top of that would be a further weight 
 Very Uncomfortable 
 What is so hard to quantify is the impact not just on demand but on costs and on supply chain disruption   she said on Bloomberg Television   What we have now are anecdotes more than anything but this is what we need to be watching  Clearly if there were an all out trade war  it would be very difficult for investors to focus very directly just on the fundamentals  the geopolitical environment would be very uncomfortable  
In the 19 nation euro area  IHS Markit s monthly survey showed growth softened in July on weaker new orders and deteriorating confidence  Factory activity in Japan grew at the weakest pace since 2016 and  in the U K   where Brexit is another complication  manufacturing output expectations weakened  as have investment intentions 
The Markit reports come just days after central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies said that trade tensions are threatening global growth  echoing multiple warnings from around the world 
In China  concern has reached such a level that authorities on Monday unveiled a package of policies to boost domestic demand to cushion the economy from the fallout from the trade dispute 
The euro area composite Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing and services fell to 54 3 from 54 9 in June  a sharper drop than economists had forecast  A measure of expectations fell to a 20 month low

15134,236649,WHR,U S  Companies Feel the Pain From Surging Metal Prices,news," Bloomberg     U S  tariffs on metal imports are playing havoc with earnings at some of the most recognizable industrial companies in America  and a look at steel and aluminum prices shows why 
Surging demand and a 25 percent U S  tariff have combined to send the benchmark domestic steel price surging more than 40 percent this year  Premiums added to the price of aluminum for delivery in the U S  Midwest have more than doubled this year  In March  the U S  announced a 10 percent tariff on imports of the metal 
Companies lowering profit forecasts or citing rising metals costs as a concern when they reported earnings this month include 

General Motors Co  NYSE GM    The automaker cut its forecast for profit this year on Wednesday  in part because of the rising metals prices  Raw material costs probably will be a  1 billion headwind to GM s profit this year    roughly double its previous expectation  the company said 
Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG    The motorcycle maker cut its forecast for profit margin this year  Operating margin will drop to between 9 percent and 10 percent this year due to the expected impact of tariffs  the Milwaukee based company said in a statement Tuesday 
Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR    The maker of home appliances said rising raw materials costs hurt results in three out of four of its regional markets in the second quarter  Whirlpool said raw material inflation will cost the company about  350 million in 2018  That s up from the  250 million to  300 million it predicted in April 
Lincoln Electric Holdings Inc   The Cleveland based maker of welding equipment and supplies is applying a surcharge to products affected by the levies  giving customers a degree of transparency into how much the tariffs are adding to their costs 
Plains All American Pipeline LP  The company s request for an exemption from steel import tariffs was rejected by the U S  government  The ultimate cost of the rejection  Roughly  40 million  said Willie Chiang  the company s chief operating officer  who called it a   tax  in comments to Congress on Tuesday 
Sonoco Products Co   The packaging company projected tariff costs in the second half that could be in the range of  7 million to  9 million  primarily for steel and aluminum  including foil laminates and labels 
Electrolux AB  The Swedish maker of vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances said the latest U S  trade tariffs could cost some  10 million during the second half of this year  The 10 percent tariffs on a raft of Chinese made goods announced this month will drive up expenses  said the company  which imports components from China 
 Alcoa   NYSE AA  Corp   The biggest U S  aluminum producer lowered its 2018 profit projection last week  citing headwinds from tariffs on the lightweight metal as one reason  The company has been hit with  15 million in costs so far on material it made mostly in Canada and shipped to the U S 

The outlooks lend urgency to warnings from economists that the tariffs could weaken economic growth  The International Monetary Fund said this month that the trade frictions threaten to derail a global upswing that s already showing signs of losing momentum  Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey called tariffs on imported aluminum a  significant  headwind ",2018-07-25,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-companies-feel-the-pain-from-surging-metal-prices-1545271,1545271

15137,236652,WHR,Haier sees costs spike at GE arm amid steel tariffs  U S  China trade spat,news,"SHANGHAI  Reuters    China s Haier Group said rising steel prices amid hefty U S  import tariffs was driving up costs for its business in America  and warned that consumers stood most to lose from a mounting trade spat between the world s top two economies 
Louisville  Kentucky headquartered GE Appliances  which Haier bought in 2016 from  General Electric   NYSE GE   has already raised its prices twice this year to cope with rising costs  said Haier s overseas managing director  Li Pan 
 Currently  the challenge is inflation  not only from steel but also the other commodities   he told Reuters 
 It has hit our bottom line  not only inflation but also the whole environment is getting tougher and tougher  so to mitigate that impact  actually  GE Appliances increased their retail price twice this year  
Haier s comments add to a growing clamor of voices from companies worldwide warning about the impact of U S  metal tariffs  Home appliance maker Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  and automakers such as General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford have all flagged that steel costs have hit  or could impact  their bottom lines 
U S  steel prices have leapt after President Donald Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports of the metal in March in a bid to protect domestic producers 
Trump has rattled the world trade order this year by seeking to renegotiate the terms of some of the United States  trading relationships  in particular with China 
Washington has recently proposed to slap a 25 percent tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  following an earlier  initial round  China late on Friday unveiled retaliatory tariffs on  60 billion of U S  goods 
Haier s Li said 5 percent of GE Appliances  products sold in the United States were imported from China and added that these items  which include window air conditioners  could face U S tariffs  The company is hopeful these products could be removed from the U S  tariff list  Li added 
But consumers would  in the end  have to pay for any tariffs imposed  he said   If the tariff is 20 percent we need to increase the price by 20 percent  no other choice  
GE Appliances accounts for about 30 percent of Haier s revenue  which was 159 2 billion yuan   23 32 billion  in 2017 
The Chinese firm  which also owns New Zealand s Fisher   Paykel  is ranked by Euromonitor to have the largest share of the global major appliances market 
Haier is also considering acquisitions in Europe where it currently only has a 2 3 percent market share  Li said  adding that the company had already shortlisted some names  He declined to provide any details but said the targets were high end brands which could include manufacturers of built in kitchens

15140,236655,WHR,Whirlpool Sinks With Raw Material Costs Climbing Around the World,news," Bloomberg     As the Trump administration s global trade war heats up  Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   is feeling the burn 
The maker of home appliances said rising raw material costs hurt results in three out of four of its regional markets in the second quarter  including North America  Asia and its struggling Europe  Middle East and Africa division  The only region where it didn t cite input cost inflation was in Latin America  which faced its own problems in the second quarter  including a Brazilian trucker strike 
 Our annual steel contracts and hedging contracts with our base metals give us some protection but do not insulate us from these more material trends   Chief Executive Officer Marc Robert Bitzer said on a Tuesday morning conference call 
Whirlpool shares fell as much as 14 percent Tuesday to  128 91  the biggest intraday drop in almost 10 years  They had already lost 11 percent this year through Monday s close 
The higher raw material costs  paired with lower sales volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts  contributed to Whirlpool s weaker than expected quarterly results  Net sales and ongoing earnings per share both missed analysts  estimates in the three months ended June 30  The company s ongoing full year profit forecast missed the lowest estimate 
Rising Risk
The cost of protecting Whirlpool s debt against default for five years jumped to the highest since November 2016  climbing 15 basis points to 98 basis points since the results were announced  according to data provider CMA 
Whirlpool disclosed in its second quarter presentation that raw material inflation will cost the company about  350 million in 2018  That s up from the  250 million to  300 million it predicted in April  and even that was  50 million higher than what it was forecasting back in January 
The company cited steel and resin costs as particular concerns in the second quarter  President Donald Trump in March placed a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from most countries  The U S  allowed some exemptions for South Korea  Brazil  Australia and Argentina  After initially exempting Canada  Mexico and the E U   Trump extended the Section 232 tariffs in June to include those key trade allies 
Whirlpool implemented price increases in several markets over the past year as input costs rise 
 We are standing firm in our price increases and because we are committed it s the right thing to do with the cost inflation environment   Bitzer said   Now our job is to hold firm on these price increases and rebound some of the volume and some of the volume losses in the second half

15161,236676,WHR,Trump metals tariffs make Granite City great again  but at what cost ,news,"By Nick Carey GRANITE CITY  Ill   Reuters    After Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 on a pledge to  Make America Great Again  and revive the country s old industrial heartland  Dave Chrusciel hoped someday to return to his previous job at the steel mill here in this southern corner of Illinois  That day has arrived  Chrusciel  61  is one of around 500 workers United States Steel Corp  N X  is re hiring or recruiting as it readies for production in mid June at a blast furnace it idled in 2015    I d been waiting for that phone call asking me to come back for more than two years   he said   Chrusciel and Granite City are among the winners as the Trump administration fights a multi front war to reshape U S  trade policy  City officials say the well paid jobs at the Granite City Works  which traces its roots to the late 19th century  are the heart of this town of 29 000 people   These are jobs you can raise a family on   said Granite City Mayor Ed Hagnauer   Those are the jobs we ve seen disappear   Trump imposed the tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum in March  They are popular in Granite City  but problematic in other communities   Major U S  manufacturers as diverse as  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT    Ford Motor Co   N F   Whirlpool Corp  N WHR    Campbell Soup  Co  N CPB  and Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  have said rising steel and aluminum prices will have to be passed on to consumers  offset with cost cutting measures  or hurt profits  Bill Hickey  chairman of Chicago based Lapham Hickey Steel  which has half a dozen U S  steel processing plants  said he wants to help U S  steelmakers  but is concerned rising prices will push manufacturers to duck tariffs by purchasing steel parts overseas    The main beneficiary would be China  which has plenty of surplus steel   he said  The tariffs are in effect for some countries  and a temporary exemption for Canada  Mexico and the European Union is supposed to expire on June 1   Uncertainty over the tariffs  future has left U S  steel producers  shares in limbo  U S  Steel shares surged earlier this year but are now up just 1 6 percent in the year to date   Nucor  Corp  N NUE  is also up just 1 6 percent for the year  COMPANY TOWN  Tariffs created Granite City   The 1890 McKinley Tariff Act  which increased protective duties  acted as a catalyst for the nascent U S  domestic steel industry and created Granite City in 1896   Dominated by steel since  the city s fortunes have mirrored the industry s  Its population peaked at around 40 000 in the 1970s  U S  steel making s decline is reflected in the faded glory of formerly grand brick buildings  like those in many Rust Belt cities  Across the Mississippi from St Louis  Granite City sits in Madison County  which voted for Trump by a 15 point margin  U S  Steel has not disclosed its investment in restarting the blast furnace  which will have an annual capacity of 1 5 million tons of raw steel  but said in March the furnace would  support anticipated increased demand for steel  from Trump s tariffs   People say tariffs could start a trade war   said Dan Simmons  president of United Steelworkers  Local 1899  which represents workers at the plant   But we ve been in a trade war for 15 years and we ve been losing   Nucor has announced two investments since Trump s tariff announcement  which a spokeswoman said were part of a long term growth strategy   The impact should be even greater when the remaining tariff exemptions expire on June 1st   the spokeswoman said   Granite City business owners say the 500 new jobs   bringing U S  Steel s local workforce up to 1 300   are a much needed boost   Joe Jones owns Joe s Hog Doc opposite the plant  His business repairing and customizing Harley Davidson bikes has more than doubled since Trump took office last year and continues to rise   The Trump effect is really working   he said   It s making Granite City great again   To view a graphic on Iron and steel manufacturing employment  click   WHERE JOBS ARE AT RISK Elsewhere  steel and aluminum price volatility following Trump s tariff actions puts jobs at risk  company executives said  Tim Chimera  director of metal procurement for North America at Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro  OL NHY   said aluminum consumers have been whipsawed by tariffs and by U S  sanctions on the major shareholder of Russian aluminum producer United Company Rusal Plc  HK 0486   Norsk Hydro has warned those sanctions could lead to global supply shortages    The big risk I see is the threat to the business overall because of extremely volatile pricing   Chimera said   In March  Bob Miller  who heads U S  operations at top Russian steelmaker Novolipetsk Steel PAO  NLMK   MM NLMK   said the unit halted planned U S  investments of more than  600 million and warned that its 1 200 U S  workers  jobs are at risk   Miller now says his stocks of pre tariff steel are dwindling  while Canadian rivals have exploited the tariff exemption   Like many other companies  NLMK s U S  unit has applied for an exemption from the tariffs so it can import Russian steel slabs  Miller says the Trump administration s response will likely determine whether he has to lay off workers  For Granite City steelworker Dave Chrusciel  Trump s commitment to steel tariffs is crucial  He calls himself a  hard headed  Democrat  but voted for the Republican Trump because he believed the businessman could revive steel jobs   Although only a year from retirement himself  Chrusciel says his future vote for Trump depends on the president  seeing it through  and keeping the tariffs in place   Many people here have a lot riding on the tariffs   Chrusciel said   Without them  this would be a ghost town

15200,236715,WHR,Hung out to dry twice  Tennessee city stumped by Trump s washer tariffs,news,"By David Lawder CLARKSVILLE  Tenn   Reuters    When President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on imported washing machines last week it was a  Not Again  moment for officials in this north Tennessee city that has lost jobs to an international trade dispute before  The move threatens to stunt the launch of a new LG Electronics  KS 066570  washing machine factory under construction in Clarksville  just four years after the U S  China trade fight over solar panels scuttled a nearby  1 2 billion Hemlock Semiconductor polysilicon plant   It s like d j  vu for Clarksville  to say  how can this be happening twice to us    the city s mayor  Kim McMillan  told Reuters  She said that the city government was scrambling to help the South Korean manufacturer accelerate its production launch by ensuring that utilities and infrastructure are quickly put in place at the factory site and expediting approvals   We ve got to do whatever we can to make sure that LG is able to still open their facility and hire people   McMillan added   We don t want to see a repeat of what happened with Hemlock where they can t open the plant   At stake is an appliance manufacturing complex that could eventually employ thousands of workers and which the state of Tennessee and the local community supported with some  23 million in grants  The 310 acre  1 25 square kilometer  site an hour north of Nashville has room for three additional buildings identical to the plant s  250 million  600 job first phase  Trump s decision to impose 20 percent to 50 percent tariffs on washer imports and parts has local officials asking what his  America First  stands for  supporting all U S  manufacturing jobs or just favoring traditional American brands over foreign rivals  Labor statistics show that foreign companies have been the source of the majority of new manufacturing jobs since the 2009 recession  LG told U S  retailers on Wednesday it would raise prices in response to the tariffs  That could dent its market share  reducing initial output and employment  said company spokesman John Taylor   If you lose floor space at retail  it can take years to get it back   Taylor said   Construction crews were working 24 hours a day on the site last week  still only a partial steel skeleton  after LG said earlier this month it would bring forward its production launch a second time again to the fourth quarter of 2018  LG s rival Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   whose imported washers also will be hit by the tariffs  has more breathing room  It has already started production at a  380 million washer plant in Newberry  South Carolina  in a former  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  generator set factory  The washer tariffs are the culmination of a decade long campaign by Whirlpool Inc  N WHR  against what it saw as unfair pricing and  country hopping  by LG and Samsung to avoid anti dumping duties  HEMLOCK FLASHBACKS The tariffs on washers and solar panels triggered memories of a 2014 U S  China trade spat over solar panels  which made Hemlock abandon its just completed Clarksville plant at a loss of 500 initial jobs and dashing hopes for more to come  Hemlock s main market for polysilicon  a core ingredient in solar cells  dried up after Beijing responded to U S  anti dumping duties on Chinese solar panels with duties on U S  polysilicon  While beyond its control  the Hemlock pullout has affected the region s efforts to attract other firms  said Jim Durrett  mayor of Montgomery County  which has its seat in Clarksville   The closure  kind of gave our community a black eye from a recruitment standpoint   Durrett said  With the help of competitive state and local grants and tax incentives  low living costs and a steady supply of well trained workers retiring from a nearby U S  Army base  this city of about 150 000 managed to regain some traction  A year after Hemlock left and razed its plant to protect its technology  Google  O GOOGL  acquired it for a data center  though the tech giant has only committed to 70 jobs and has yet to detail its plans   Hankook Tire

arrived with the rise of the mid South s manufacturing base  local officials and residents interviewed by Reuters saw no distinction between foreign owned and American owned firms    Once they re here and once they ve embarked on the investment  those are local jobs  LG s a continuation of that   said Jeff Robinson  owner of the Blackhorse Pub and Brewery in Clarksville  And in a region where support for Trump runs deep  they are wondering why he would use tariffs to favor Whirlpool and GE Appliances  now owned by China s Haier Electronics Group  HK 1165   over a competitor moving

15201,236716,WHR,U S  washer tariffs put Samsung  LG supply chains through the wringer,news,"By Ju min Park SEOUL  Reuters    When South Korea s Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and LG Electronics last year announced plans to build home appliance factories in the United States  they hoped to sidestep any fallout from President Donald Trump s  America First  manufacturing and jobs mantra  Last week s decision by the U S  government to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports of washing machines and key components showed that wasn t to be   The inclusion of hefty tariffs on components in particular had moved the goal posts in a long running trade dispute  upending supply chains and threatening investment across other industries  officials from the companies and the South Korean government said    It s unprecedented and excessive  and will set alarm bells ringing for other companies doing businesses in the United States   said one Samsung official  declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media   After committing hundreds of millions of dollars to build the plants and bring jobs to South Carolina and Tennessee  the ruling caught the companies by surprise and was a  worst case  scenario  according to one executive  Samsung says it will use imported parts until its factory runs at full capacity and becomes ready to produce key parts  expected to be by the end of the year  Samsung  which relies on a sprawling manufacturing base in low cost countries such as Vietnam has argued that a tight quota on overseas made parts could deny it the supply chain flexibility it may need as its new U S  production lines set up   The ruling on a quota for foreign components is also making other manufacturers and suppliers jittery   Even if you bring your tier 1 supplier with you to     the U S  manufacturing facilities  your tier 1 suppliers will have tier 2 and 3 suppliers which would source components from abroad  It makes it very complicated to calculate   a senior executive at Korean automaker Hyundai Motor told Reuters   You ve got to find a way to adapt or circumvent somehow   An executive at South Korean battery to chemicals conglomerate SK Group said the news was also bad news for producers of intermediary goods such as SK  which supplies big manufacturers with thousands of components that will now be caught up in the spat  Privately owned Dongjin Techwin  which supplies LG Electronics Inc  is already bracing for contract losses  as LG moves to produce components in house   There d be little point on trying to figure out how to export components from Korea to the United States  and then build a washing machine there   Jung Hyun mo  a senior executive at Dongjin  told Reuters   There just isn t the export import supply chain in place for that    CUT OFF AT THE KNEES The decision by Trump in the  Section 201  safeguard case came after the U S  International Trade Commission found last year imports were  a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers  including Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   The tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members  with a 20 percent tariff set on the first 1 2 million imported large residential washers in the first year  and a 50 percent tariff on additional imports  Washington also imposed a 50 percent tariff on imported key parts in excess of 50 000 units in the first year  a move Samsung s South Carolina plant manager fears could  cut us off at the knees    Although we are installing production equipment and we are committed to producing the major parts in house  there will be a transition period during which importing parts will be necessary to successfully launch this facility   Tony Fraley  Samsung s plant manager  told the commission in October  When asked if there were any plan for price hikes to counter the tariffs  Samsung said it would discuss any changes with its business partners  Consultancy firm Euromonitor estimates South Korean washing machine makers would need to raise prices by  50 to  400 to cushion the impact of tariffs   LG was set to start production at its new plant in the third quarter at the earliest and is now working to accelerate its launch with officials in Clarksville  Tennessee who are eager for the jobs the new factory will bring   We had several scenarios    this safeguard measure turned out to be the worst case one   Kim Gun tai  head of LG s home appliance division told a conference call last week  LG  which announced a plan to raise prices on its washing machines sold in the United States last week  said in a separate statement to Reuters it was absorbing a significant portion of the tariff on parts  Once its U S  plant s operation began it would produce key parts on site  it added  The safeguard issue is set to top the agenda when government officials from the two countries meet later this week to discuss trade issues

15202,236717,WHR,Trump slaps steep U S  tariffs on imported washers  solar panels,news,"By David Lawder and Nichola Groom WASHINGTON LOS ANGELES  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday  giving a boost to Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR  and dealing a setback to the renewable energy industry in the first of several potential trade restrictions  The decisions in the two  Section 201  safeguard cases followed findings by the U S  International Trade Commission that both imported products  are a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers   U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement  The washer tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members  while the solar tariffs were lower than domestic producers had hoped for  The restrictions aim to help domestic manufacturers but drew complaints that consumer costs for new washers and solar installations will rise   Trump will impose a 20 percent tariff on the first 1 2 million imported large residential washers in the first year  and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number  The tariffs decline to 16 percent and 40 percent respectively in the third year  A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells and modules in the first year  with the tariffs declining to 15 percent by the fourth year  The tariff allows 2 5 gigawatts of unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff free in each year  Whirlpool  which sought the washers  safeguard  action against rivals Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and LG Electronics after years of anti dumping cases  saw its shares rise 1 8 percent in after hours trade   By enforcing our existing trade laws  President Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts   Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement  The move punishes Samsung  which recently began washer production in South Carolina  and LG  which is building a washer factory in Tennessee    This tariff is a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine  Everyone will pay more  with fewer choices   Samsung said in a statement  LG Electronics said that the decision will hinder the ramp up and employment prospects of its new plant  which will not begin production until late 2018 or early 2019  Trump ignored a recommendation from the ITC to exclude South Korean produced washers from LG from the tariffs  as prior anti dumping duties on these machines have been dropped  The decision could also hurt retailer Sears Holdings  whose Kenmore brand sources its larger washers from LG s overseas factories  LG shares fell as much as 5 percent in Seoul trading against the wider market s 0 4 percent gain  Shares in Samsung Elec were up 0 83 percent  BLOW TO RENEWABLE ENERGY  The tariffs are expected to slow a shift to renewable energy in the United States  just as solar was becoming cost competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels like coal  an industry that Trump has pledged to protect  MJ Shiao  head of renewable energy research for Wood Mackenzie  said the tariffs would likely reduce projected U S  solar installations by 10 to 15 percent over the next five years   It is a significant impact  but certainly not destructive to the end market   Shiao told Reuters  The domestic solar panel producers who sought the trade remedies wanted tariffs of 50 percent   the highest allowed under law  Petitioners Suniva and SolarWorld have said they cannot compete with the influx of cheap imports  mostly from Chinese producers  which has caused solar panel prices to drop more than 30 percent since early 2016  The U S  solar trade group  the Solar Energy Industries Association  campaigned against the tariffs and estimated the decision would create a  crisis  for the burgeoning industry and result in the loss of 23 000 U S  jobs this year as billions of dollars in solar investments are canceled  Suniva  majority owned by Hong Kong listed Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd  applauded the decision  saying that Trump  is sending a message that American innovation and manufacturing will not be bullied out of existence without a fight   FIRST OF SEVERAL POTENTIAL ACTIONS The decisions were the first of several potential tariff actions that Trump may take in the coming weeks and months  He is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminum on national security grounds under a 1962 trade law and tariffs or other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices

15216,236731,WHR,Asia Wakes to Trump s Big Trade Move With Tariffs Aimed at Them,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines  his first major trade move after repeated threats to crack down on what he sees as unfair foreign competition 
The U S  will impose new duties of as much as 30 percent on foreign made solar equipment  the U S  Trade Representative s office said Monday  The president  who took office a year ago  also approved tariffs starting as high as 50 percent on imported washing machines  according to USTR 
The moves come as Trump prepares to travel to Davos for the World Economic Forum  where the world s business and political elite are meeting to discuss topics including the backlash against globalization  The new tariffs will add teeth to the president s  America First  foreign policy after months of threatening to get tough on what Trump sees as the unfair trade practices of nations such as China and South Korea 
 The president s action makes clear again that the Trump administration will always defend American workers  farmers  ranchers and businesses in this regard   U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement 
LG Electronics  a maker of domestic appliances  and South Korean solar panel makers fell in Seoul trading on the news while Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   which was little changed  said the tariff on washing machines is a  great loss  for U S  workers and consumers 
South Korea s trade ministry said Tuesday it has asked the World Trade Organization to suspend concessions on U S  imports  seeking to re instate tariffs  It didn t specify on which products  and said the timing was coincidental as the move is part of a longer running dispute 
The two cases were filed under the seldom used Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974  which gives the president broad authority to impose tariffs to protect domestic industries  
Trade Action
More U S  trade action could be on the way  Negotiators from the U S   Canada and Mexico are meeting this week in Montreal for the latest round of negotiations on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement  Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal if Canada and Mexico don t bend to U S  demands 
The solar tariffs are lower than the 35 percent the U S  International Trade Commission recommended in October after finding that imported panels were harming American manufacturers  The ITC was responding to a complaint by Suniva Inc   a bankrupt U S  panel maker that sought duties on solar cells and panels 
The president approved four years of tariffs that start at 30 percent in the first year and gradually drop to 15 percent  The first 2 5 gigawatts of imported solar cells will be exempt from the tariffs  USTR said in a statement Monday 
U S  panel maker  First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR   jumped 9 percent to  75 20 in after hours trading in New York  The Tempe  Arizona based manufacturer stands to gain as costs for competing  foreign panels rise 
In the washing machine case  Trump was responding to an ITC recommendation in November of tariffs following a complaint by Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR    which accused Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics Inc  of selling washing machines in the U S  below fair market value 
Trump opted for the most punitive recommendation by ITC judges for residential washers  He ordered a 20 percent tariff on imports under 1 2 million units  and 50 percent on all subsequent imports in the first year  with duties lowering in the next two years

15268,236783,WHR,Damages for Grenfell fire victims may total just  5 million  Reuters analysis,news,"By Tom Bergin LONDON  Reuters    The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds   5 million   according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England  The blaze engulfed a 24 storey social housing block in west London on June 14  killing an estimated 80 people in the country s deadliest fire since World War Two  While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts  any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don t allow punitive claims  even if companies are found criminally responsible  said Brett Dixon  president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers  APIL   The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire   U S  companies Arconic Inc  and Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   and Britain s Harley Facades and Rydon Group   declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts  The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976  precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far  Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable  If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved  victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations  personal injury lawyers said   The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous   said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis  which is representing some victims  families   It s not about money for the families   said Tim Murphy  whose brother Denis  a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor  died in the fire   Nothing can ease our pain   but  I think it s quite insulting   The U S  legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully  but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system  businesses  insurers and state bodies that might be liable  some legal experts say  While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims  Duncan Fairgrieve  who has advised the UK government on compensation rules  said more generous payouts could also harm society  They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police  he said   There is an affordability issue   said Fairgrieve  a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law  FEW DEPENDENTS If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed  the claim categories are a flat 12 980 pounds per victim for bereavement  costs such as funeral bills  dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind  and property damage   all to be paid by the party found responsible  Under the 1976 law  only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages  Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages   on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased  Daniel Machover  a lawyer at Hickman and Rose  which is representing some victims  families  also said he didn t expect there to be many claims  Most of the others who died in the fire were minors  single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them  The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents  said lawyers representing some of the victims  One six year old girl  Tasnim Belkadi  lost her mother  father and all her siblings in the fire  Lawyers said she could get 300 000 pounds  based on a share of her parents  income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday  Her aunt  with whom she now lives  declined to comment on the Reuters calculation  Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death  such as the cost of a modest funeral  Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire  The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three bedroom home at 55 000 pounds  However  Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30 000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value  and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms  Based on the victims  circumstances  Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1 2 million pounds  for property it could be 1 4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1 0 million  Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds  TENS OF MILLIONS Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U S  company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower s cladding  made by U S  firm Arconic Inc   played a role in the spread of the blaze  Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly  Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire  Rydon Group  the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added  said it had complied with all regulations  Sub contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding  Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares  Whirlpool s market value fell about  250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint  a brand owned by Indesit  which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy  More than  1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc  s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels  knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non combustible panels should be used on tall buildings  Arconic s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period  Awards against companies in U S  courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases  In 1980  a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds  The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims  families and survivors more than  200 million  Foreigners have often tried to sue U S  corporations in U S  courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad  However  judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases  saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States  Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U S  case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there  But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U S  courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U S  companies were involved through European registered subsidiaries   I can t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States   said Thomas

Their recommendations involve options trades on single stocks that are designed to capture potential gains in share prices 

We all know the old adage  buy low and sell high 
That s exactly what Goldman Sachs recommends for stock traders heading into earnings season   except their suggested method involves options 
The focal point of their strategy involves identifying downtrodden stocks with strong fundamentals since they ll be the most likely to spring higher in the event of a better than expected report 
The firm says to buy calls   or bets a stock will rise   on companies with either buy or neutral ratings that have underperformed the S P 500 by 3  or more in the two weeks ahead of earnings  Dating back to 1996  implementing this strategy would ve yielded a 17  return  Goldman finds 
Getting further into the mechanics of the strategy  Goldman recommends buying one month call contracts with exercise prices that are higher than where the stock is currently trading 
The bank s analysts have constructed a list of the 19 companies that best fit these criteria 
But the firm s suggestions don t stop there  They also offer up three specific options strategies for stocks they think could be more volatile than is presently priced

15270,236785,WHR,Whirlpool s washer war is balancing act for Trump,news,"By Timothy Aeppel Clyde  Ohio Reuters    In the middle of Whirlpool Corp s bustling washer factory in northern Ohio there is an empty patch of concrete floor   a reminder of a  60 million expansion plan the appliance maker says fell victim to unfair foreign competition   We cleared that out to hold more plastic molding machines   says Daniel O Brien  the factory s vice president of operations  Whirlpool  N WHR  halted the upgrade two years ago blaming South Korea s  LG Electronics Inc   KS 066570  and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930  for the setback  In a string of trade cases the Benton Harbor  Michigan based manufacturer has argued the Koreans have undercut its U S  business by exporting washers at unfairly low prices  Since the Nov  8 presidential election  Whirlpool has been fighting with renewed vigor  seeking more protection  President Donald Trump s administration is the first one in decades that openly says it is searching for ways to hit back at foreign producers it finds are hurting domestic manufacturers  But the washer case has a twist  Since the election  both Korean producers have announced plans for big U S  factories and that confronts the administration with a dilemma  how do you weigh interests of a U S  manufacturer against investment plans of foreign competitors and which jobs are more important   Whirlpool s sprawling complex in Clyde   stretching nearly a mile from corner to corner   employs 3 200 well paid union workers  Now  LG is spending  250 million to build a 600 worker factory in Tennessee  while Samsung is investing  380 million to renovate an old  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   factory in South Carolina that will employ 950  Both states are dominated by Republicans   POLITICAL BACKING The investment in Tennessee has attracted support from local  state and federal officials  many of whom attended a groundbreaking ceremony in August  LG spokesman John Taylor said   We got terrific feedback from Commerce Secretary  Wilbur  Ross when he was at the groundbreaking   Both LG and Samsung said their investments followed years of preparations  though Taylor said the timing of the announcement was  opportune  given Trump s focus on manufacturing jobs  Whirlpool remains the leader in the  7 5 billion U S  washer market  but the rivals are closing in  The company s brands  which include Maytag and Amana  account for just under 35 percent of domestic sales  down from over 38 percent in 2013  according to Stevenson Co s TraQline  a market research company  Over the same period  Samsung s share doubled to just under 20 percent  while LG s held steady around 16 percent  The Korean producers argue innovation and more choice for the consumers rather than prices have driven their growth and say Whirlpool s five straight years of record results weaken its case  Both companies deny they have violated U S  trade laws   Whirlpool s stock price more than tripled from 2012 to 2015  It is hard to see how such an industry is suffering material injury   LG lead outside counsel Daniel Porter told the International Trade Commission  a federal agency that investigates trade issues  in a meeting earlier this year  The Commerce Department declined to comment for this story because of the pending ITC case brought by Whirlpool  Nevertheless  the Korean manufacturers are nervous  At the groundbreaking for the LG plant in August  the company pulled forward the date for completion by six months to the first quarter of 2019   an extremely fast construction window for such a factory  Whirlpool  which won two anti dumping cases against the Korean firms in the past four years  took its fight one step further and filed a  safeguard petition  in May  seeking broader protection than anti dumping measures provide   A safeguard targets imports from any country and the petitioner does not need to prove that the goods are being sold at unfairly low prices just that the influx of products is disrupting the U S  market and causing  serious injury  to domestic producers  The ITC is due to vote on Thursday whether washing machine imports cause harm to U S  producers  If it rules in Whirlpool s favor  the commission will recommend remedies  such tariffs  import quotas or other measures  to Trump in early December   RARE SAFEGUARDS U S  producers have seldom sought such protections  in part because they are often challenged at the World Trade Organization  The last case was in 2002  when President George W  Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain imported steel products  Clark Packard  a policy analyst at the R Street Institute  a libertarian think tank  says the safeguards should be reserved for rare instances of unforeseen surges in imports  but that the  atmosphere is ripe in Washington  for these cases   Whirlpool says it is seeking broader protection because the Korean producers were able to avoid anti dumping tariffs by moving production from country to country  After the ITC imposed anti dumping tariffs against South Korean washers made in South Korea and Mexico in 2013  the production moved to China and when the ITC slapped tariffs on those washers  LG and Samsung began making them in Vietnam and Thailand   The only plausible explanation for these moves was to dodge the U S  anti dumping orders and avoid duties   said Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig  in testimony before the ITC in September   As part of the safeguard petition  Whirlpool also wants curbs on the import of large washing machine components  arguing otherwise the Korean companies could merely set up assembly plants running primarily on foreign parts  While the case has worked its way through the system  the mood in Clyde has darkened as investment plans were scaled back   Leading the way up to a cluster of idle machines  O Brien  the plant vice president  says   This is  3 million worth of machinery   and it only runs two or three hours a day    The equipment was installed in 2015 before the other investments were put on hold  he notes  Elsewhere in the plant  a giant poster  painted by a worker  shows an anthropomorphic Whirlpool washing machine  pushing past stumbling washers labeled LG and Samsung   a far more upbeat take on the rivalry than the mood on the factory floor   Everyone here feels the frustration   says Lori Frasure  a 30 year old factory worker   it s a frustration that we re not all playing by the same rules   The only other large domestic manufacturer of washing machines is GE Appliances  now owned by China s Haier Group  HK 1169   Earl Jones  the company s senior counsel  says GE is not party in the Whirlpool case  but it has also cut investments and reassigned workers inside their appliance manufacturing complex in Louisville  Kentucky   We re on the record of supporting their petition

which is a xenophobic party    HAPPY EUROPE Both contenders redoubled their attempts to paint the other as the candidate of the political establishment on Thursday and appealed for support from across the political spectrum after an election race that has alienated some voters   As the final vote on May 7 approaches  the candidates have plenty of scope   but little time   to pick up support  In the first round  they won less than half of the votes between them and have fewer than 10 days to convince the other 55 percent  Macron  decrying Le Pen as a  political heiress  and defending his experience in the private sector as a banker  urged people who had backed rivals such as conservative Francois Fillon or leftist Jean Luc Melenchon to give him a chance    I will not consider a vote in my favor as a blank cheque   Macron told French television on Thursday night   Eurosceptic Le Pen   simultaneously holding a rally in the southern city of Nice  where she described Macron as a  product of the system    also sought to lure potential Fillon voters as she struck a more conciliatory tone on the European Union  She said she wanted to replace the  grey  EU with a  happy  one and omitted any mention of her anti euro stance  But she also pressed home her central message on putting the brakes on immigration and reinstating border checks in France  asking the 3 000 strong crowd   Mass immigration   more  or stop   and drawing chants of  Stop   from supporters   FAR LEFT FACTOR One group that will be key is the 20 percent who chose far left candidate Melenchon in the first round of voting on April 23   Unlike the other main candidates who said they would vote for Macron to block the far right  Melenchon has declined to give his view  His campaign has instead launched a survey of its members to see if they will vote for Macron or abstain  though voting for Le Pen is not an option  Melenchon s  France Unbowed  movement had a similar anti globalization  pro worker protection message to Le Pen s  but is sharply opposed to her position that immigration and radical Islam are at the roots of France s problems  In Paris and the western city of Rennes on Thursday  riot police clashed with youths demonstrating against both candidates  Students have been holding  neither Le Pen  nor Macron  protests at high schools since Sunday s vote  In an interview with Reuters  Christian Estrosi  the right wing president of the southeastern region  said it was a mistake to take Le Pen s victory chances lightly    She can win  In my political family  some are wrong to neglect the risk and not to take the second round more seriously   he said  Former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls also echoed that message  telling BFM TV that Le Pen could win if people did not unite behind Macron   Campaigning took a spectacular turn on Wednesday when Le Pen paid a surprise visit to a doomed Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  appliance plant in her opponent s home town and promised to save it  just as Macron was meeting labor representatives behind closed doors nearby

15312,236827,WHR,Macron s win adds to Poland s worries about its place in EU,news,"By Lidia Kelly and Krisztina Than WARSAW BUDAPEST  Reuters    While the election of Emmanuel Macron as French president with a vision of closer European Union integration was a relief to much of Europe  for Poland and Hungary it fanned fears of losing influence  Poland has been the most vocal among eastern EU members fearing that their wealthier western neighbors  keen to deepen cooperation among themselves  will erode the single market that has been the biggest benefit of membership in the east and  in shifting power westward  reduce financial support for less wealthy countries  Macron s arrival  and his support for the  multi speed  Europe idea that has been gaining support in Germany and other EU countries since Britain s decision to quit the bloc  make it more likely that a key decision making circle could exclude the former communist capitals of Budapest and Warsaw  It would also thwart their efforts to shift power from Brussels back to member states   Underlining their concerns  Polish officials have accused Macron of double standards and of contravening the spirit of the single market by calling for reforms of rules on moving workers within the bloc   It is understandable that politicians  thinkers  are looking for solutions   Poland s deputy foreign minister  Konrad Szymanski  told an economic forum in Katowice on Wednesday   But an EU division  a lasting division  is the worst of possible prescriptions  because the first victim of such division would be the single market    A decision by Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  to shift a tumble drier factory from France to Poland took center stage in France s presidential campaign last month  with Macron s far right opponent Marine Le Pen saying she would nationalise the plant    Macron  an ardent defender of globalization as well as European integration  refused to be drawn into promising the workers he would prevent the company moving its production  But he did say Warsaw was exploiting differences in labor costs  which could not be tolerated  He alluded to the problem of social dumping   a hot button issue in France   which refers to companies employing cheaper labor from other EU countries or moving production to lower wage countries   DISCRIMINATION  Polish Finance Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Poland s state broadcaster that this amounted to  discrimination   and others said Macron was undermining the principles of the single market   It cannot be that when Poland is an export market then it is good  but when it attracts foreign investment  including from France     that s not good any more   Morawiecki said this week  Szymanski said that Macron s win could be good for Poland but that Warsaw wondered  whether we are not being excluded from a debate on protectionism and the single market    We may want to change it  but we do not want to abandon it   he said  Macron s enthusiasm for a common euro zone budget and finance ministry   although  crucially  viewed with scepticism in Berlin   has also raised fears among eastern countries that they could lose out on EU funds  Neither Poland nor Hungary is in any hurry to adopt the euro  both say they need the flexibility of a national exchange rate in difficult times    If in the end there is a euro zone budget  that means there will be less money for countries that are not euro zone members   Dariusz Rosati  a member of the European Parliament member for Poland s opposition Civic Platform  told Polish radio this month  Poland is the largest beneficiary of EU funds and is due to receive 77 6 billion euros   84 4 billion  in the current 2014 20 budgetary period for infrastructure projects  its poorer regions and improving the competitiveness of its economy  While a common fiscal policy may still be some way off  the notion of a Union of countries  acting at different paces and intensity where necessary  was mentioned in the EU s 60th anniversary Rome Declaration  reflecting the desire of the six founding members  including France and Germany  for faster integration  Hendrik Hansen  head of International and European Politics department at Andrassy University in Budapest  said a two speed Europe was becoming more likely   and with Macron  the Franco German  tandem  as a driving force of the EU will probably become more important    END OF THE EU  Poland s closest ally on the issue is Prime Minister Viktor Orban s Hungary   Hungary s stance on a two speed Europe has been consistent     this would basically mean the end of the EU   Szabolcs Takacs  Hungarian state secretary for European affairs  told Reuters this week  A source close to Macron told Reuters on Wednesday that the idea behind reforming the euro zone was not to exclude countries from joining    It is to make sure that those who will join  and there will be others  join a functioning euro zone   the source said    Their  Eastern European countries   worry in general is that it would fragment the single market  but that s not the aim  The aim is to say that the euro zone is not properly equipped to face a possible future crisis   Poland and Hungary  have  however  also fallen foul of western EU countries with their own policies  which Macron has chosen to highlight  Both have come under fire along with other eastern member states for refusing to host refugees under an EU wide plan  Separately  the European Commission accuses Poland s government of undermining democracy  especially through an overhaul of its top court and moves to bring the public broadcaster and judiciary under more direct control  Hungary has most recently been criticized over draft bills to tighten rules on non governmental organizations and foreign universities  In his campaign  Macron said the EU should be as tough on infringement of civil liberties as it was on excessive budget deficits  although the sanctions that he called for against Poland would be unlikely to secure the unanimous backing they need  In congratulating Macron on his election  both Poland and Hungary stressed the need to talk about the future of the EU

15313,236828,WHR,Whirlpool CEO Fettig to step down  COO Bitzer named as successor,news,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters    Whirlpool Corp  N WHR   the world s largest maker of home appliances  said on Tuesday that Jeff Fettig will step down on Oct  1 after 13 years as chief executive and will be replaced by the firm s current chief operating officer  Marc Bitzer 
Whirlpool shares rose more than 0 7 percent in after market trading following the news 
Fettig  60  has served as CEO since 2004 and will remain as chairman of the board of the Benton Harbor  Michigan based company 
 Jeff has done an exceptional job over a long and successful career   said Robert Wetenhall  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets   He leaves the company in great shape with a strong management team in place  
Wetenhall said this was a  natural transition  to a new CEO and was to be expected after Fettig s 13 years at the helm of Whirlpool 
The move comes after a number of mixed quarters for the appliance maker 
Whirlpool reported a rise in sales in the fourth and first quarter   after reporting a decline in sales for the previous four quarters   but missed estimates in both quarters and lowered its earnings forecast for 2017 when reporting first quarter results on April 24 
Fettig steered the company through the Great Recession and oversaw the acquisition of Italian appliance maker Indesit for  1 billion in 2014 and Chinese appliance maker Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co Ltd  which it announced it would acquire in late 2013 for  552 million 
Whirlpool has had problems recently with integrating Indesit and has been fighting a trade case against South Korean firms  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930  and  LG Corp   KS 003550   The U S  government recently determined those firms were selling their washers in the U S  market at dumping prices 
Keith Snyder  an equity analyst at CFRA Research  said Bitzer was  probably the best pick to take over  at Whirlpool  as he has lead two of the company s four regions  North America and Europe  Middle East and Africa 
 Fettig has the company moving in the right direction and as an insider with years of experience  Bitzer is an excellent choice   Snyder said 
Whirlpool s stock is up 7 percent year to date 
In after market trading  the company s shares were trading up 0 7 percent from their official closing price  at  196 ",2017-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/whirlpool-ceo-fettig-to-step-down-497531,497531
15314,236829,WHR,At EU summit  Macron pleads for limits to foreign takeovers,news,"By Robin Emmott and Michel Rose BRUSSELS PARIS  Reuters    French President Emmanuel Macron vowed on Thursday to convince China s closest allies in Europe that curbing foreign takeovers in strategic industries was in their interest  warning EU governments not to be naive in global trade  Smaller eastern and southern European economies that are dependent on Chinese investment have rejected any steps against Beijing  even going as far as to block EU statements criticizing China s human rights record  But Macron  at his first EU summit  said being an attractive destination for investment did not mean exposing Europe to what he termed  the disorder of globalisation   as he seeks to make good on a campaign pledge with a so called protective Europe   Things are changing because we see the disorder of globalisation and the consequences in your own country  I want to build an alliance around this idea   Macron told a news conference during the summit of EU leaders   I am for free trade     but I am not for naivety   State owned ChemChina s  43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta  Beijing s biggest overseas sale to date  has deepened concerns in Europe that the bloc is ceding control of its advanced technology  EU diplomats said  Macron  who defeated the anti Europe  far right leader Marine Le Pen last month  said that he had always been a defender of globalisation and free trade during his time as minister but that leaders should hear from workers hit by globalisation  The issues of globalisation and  social dumping  took center stage in France s campaign after Le Pen used the relocation of a Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  factory in northern France to Poland to paint Macron as a globalist who did not care about workers   A free trade advocate  Macron let several national corporate champions be taken over by foreign firms as a minister  But since his election he has sought to drum up support in Europe for what he calls a  protection agenda   He has found some support from Germany and Italy  EU leaders will agree on Friday to allow the European Commission to explore ways to limit foreign takeovers in areas such as energy  banking and technology  where China seeks Europe s know how  In a statement  leaders will ask the Commission  to examine the need and ways to screen investments from third countries in strategic sectors  while fully respecting members states  competences   a reference to national sovereignty on the issue  Berlin  Paris and Rome are upset that the Commission  the bloc s competition regulator  approved ChemChina s purchase of Syngenta while China maintains restrictions on EU investment  Chinese direct investment in the European Union jumped by 77 percent last year to more than 35 billion euros   38 billion   compared with 2015  while EU acquisitions in China fell for the second consecutive year  according to the Rhodium Group  But free trade advocates such as Sweden want to avoid any measures that might contradict the bloc s rejection of the protectionism promoted by U S  President Donald Trump  Frits Bolkestein  a former Dutch European Commissioner  poured scorn on Macron s ideas on Thursday   This Colbertist instinct   that French wealth should serve the French state   runs deep among its elite   he said in a column in Politico  referring to Jean Baptiste Colbert  French king Louis XIV s minister of finance and industry

15317,236832,WHR,Police consider manslaughter charges over London blaze as thousands evacuated,news,"By Michael Holden and Jamillah Knowles LONDON  Reuters    British investigators said on Friday they would consider manslaughter charges over the London tower block fire that killed at least 79 people  as thousands of apartment dwellers a few miles away were told to leave their homes due to fire risk  The outside cladding engulfed in June 14 s deadly blaze has since been shown to fail all safety tests  police said  They have already seized material from a number of undisclosed organizations  Fire safety checks are now taking place on public buildings across Britain  Late on Friday  one municipal authority in north London began to evacuate nearly 4 000 people from five tower blocks after firefighters said it was unsafe for them to stay  Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said experts had now concluded that the earlier fire  the mostly deadly blaze in London since World War Two  had started in a fridge freezer  The blaze has provoked anger and heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May  who is fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election at a time when Britain is beginning divorce talks with the European Union  The speed at which the fire engulfed the 24 storey Grenfell Tower raised questions about the external cladding on the block  Asked if the insulation and aluminum tiles used were acceptable for such buildings  McCormack told reporters   No they re not    All I can say at the moment is they don t pass any of the safety tests  So that will form part of what is a manslaughter investigation   As well as possible manslaughter  police will consider health and safety offences and breaches of other building regulations  McCormack said all companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the building would be reviewed  Britain also ordered an immediate technical examination of the Hotpoint  N WHR  fridge model FF175BP  which had not been subject to any recall to establish whether further action should be taken  but said there was no need for owners to switch off their appliances  Whirlpool s shared closed down 3 3 percent on Friday  wiping almost  500 million off the company s value  Whirlpool owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions  In the United States  the Hotpoint brand now belongs to Haier  following the Chinese group s purchase of  General Electric  Co s  N GE  appliance business    We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations   said Whirlpool  the world s largest maker of home appliances   Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy   Whirlpool said in a statement  The company said 64 000 such fridge freezers were made by Indesit between 2006 and 2009 when the model was discontinued  some years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit   FOCUS OF ANGER The fire has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts and  if more buildings are deemed unsafe  the government faces the task of rehousing people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched  The government said it was urgently conducting tests on some 600 high rise buildings in England which have exterior cladding  often added to insulate them or improve the external appearance of ageing blocks  Some councils have begun removing the panels  May  who faced criticism for slow public reaction to the fire  said on Twitter that her thoughts were with the 800 households being evacuated from a group of tower blocks in north London on Friday evening  Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door to door   It was farcical communication  You don t get everyone to leave this quickly   21 year old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds for people for whom they could not find hotels  Broadcaster Sky News showed one resident  Abdul  who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair  who said he had been told there was no hotel for him and he had to stay on an air bed  The council s leader  Georgia Gould  said in a statement outside the council s offices that it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated and later added in a radio interview that nearly 4 000 residents were affected  Ed Miliband  the former leader of the opposition Labour Party  said on Twitter that May should have convened a central government emergency committee to assist the local council  Grenfell Tower  in west London  had undergone an 8 7 million pound   11 million  refurbishment that was completed in 2016  but residents of the more than 120 apartments had complained about its fire safety   McCormack said the police investigation would look at the entire facade of the building  how the building was constructed and the refurbishment work  She said it would examine all aspects of the cladding  the aluminum tiles  the insulation behind it  how it was fitted to building and the installation  In addition to the criminal investigation  police and firefighters were continuing painstaking efforts to locate the victims  So far only nine people have been formally identified and police said the remains of some might never be found  the blaze having been so fierce  Some residents believe the official number of the dead or missing presumed dead was lower than the true figure  McCormack acknowledged they might not know everyone who was in the building as some people might fear coming forward because they were in the country illegally   She said the government had given assurances they were not interested in anyone s immigration status  
 I remain really concerned though that we do not have a complete picture   she said   I fear that there are more  ",2017-06-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/deadly-london-tower-blaze-began-in-a-hotpoint-fridge-freezer:-police-498610,498610

 The chamber is concerned about the U S  use of trade remedy measures to protect its own market  and hopes to solve the issue through negotiations to gain win win results  
The investigation followed a petition by Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  over imports of washers manufactured in China by two South Korean companies   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930 and  LG Electronics Inc   KS 066570  
The ITC decision imposed of final duties of up to 52 5 percent

15373,236888,WHR,A flawed visionary  McClendon ignited shale revolution  courted controversy,news,"By Jessica Resnick Ault and Ernest Scheyder  Reuters    Aubrey McClendon  the oil and gas entrepreneur whose outsized ambition and high tolerance for risk made him a leading figure in the American energy revolution  died after crashing his car into a concrete wall on Wednesday in Oklahoma City  He was 56  McClendon was considered one of the most influential energy executives of his generation  revered by oilmen but criticized by environmentalists for championing the extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  that ushered in U S  energy independence  He was often compared to the titans of American commerce   an Andrew Mellon or John Rockefeller of his time  But his final years  and hours  were marked by controversy  and some investors had begun to view him warily for his reported lavish spending and mingling of personal and corporate investments  The day before his death  the U S  Department of Justice indicted him for allegedly rigging bids on land for oil and gas development while he was CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK   the company he founded in 1989 and turned into the No  2 U S  natural gas producer before being ousted in 2013  He denied the charges  His abrupt death   the official cause of which has yet to be determined   triggered an outpouring of condolences and tributes from across the U S  energy industry  including figures such as activist investor Carl Icahn  who had pressed for changes at Chesapeake prior to McClendon s departure  McClendon was  one of the brightest men I ve ever dealt with   Icahn said in a message on Twitter  NYSE TWTR    I personally always found him to be a gentleman in our interactions   Fellow wildcatter T  Boone Pickens  with whom McClendon championed the use of natural gas in place of oil  called him a  charismatic  entrepreneur   No individual is without flaws  but his impact on American energy will be long lasting   he said  And he was mourned across Oklahoma  where he was revered for helping revive a moribund economy and revitalizing its largest city with investments in restaurants  cultural venues and  in particular  the state s first major sports franchise  which he landed by convincing the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team to move in 2008  The team  renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder  has thrived   He played an instrumental role in America s energy renaissance   Oklahoma based  Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN  said in a statement   His philanthropic efforts and other contributions have helped countless people   McClendon himself held a nearly 20 percent stake in the Thunder  and one of his last public appearances was in his regular courtside seats at Saturday s game   Every day was a day that Aub rey  was going to make the best of it  He was a guy who could always find a way to make something positive out of something negative   said Tom Price  a retired executive who worked alongside McClendon for decades at Chesapeake  who exchanged emails with him on Tuesday  On Thursday morning in Oklahoma City  employees quietly filed into the suburban office park that houses his latest ventures   including the multibillion dollar oil and gas producer American Energy Partners and Pops Deli  an Americana filled diner   Police said they were investigating why his 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe slammed into an overpass  where it burst into flames  They said the car was traveling above the 40 miles per hour  64 kph  speed limit  and that he was not wearing a seat belt  By Thursday morning  several wooden crosses  bunches of flowers and a white oil worker hardhat had been placed at the site of the crash  a remote stretch of road on city s outskirts  McClendon is survived by his wife  Katie  an heiress of the family that founded washing machine maker Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   and their three children  Jack  Callie and Will   DESTINED TO WORK IN OIL Born in 1959  McClendon seemed destined to work in oil and gas  He was a great nephew of former Oklahoma Governor Robert Kerr  co founder of U S  oil and gas pioneer Kerr McGee Corp  Despite the appearance of privilege  friends said he worked long hours and weekends  and was fiercely competitive  After attending Duke University  he returned home to Oklahoma and later became a  landman   an oil field real estate broker that puts together crucial but arcane leasing and royalty contracts between ranchers and crude producers   At age 29  he co founded Chesapeake with his young friend Tom Ward  who called McClendon s death  heartbreaking    Tall and thin with a thick head of white hair  McClendon was a tireless booster who often sported a tie printed with tiny drilling rigs   His leveraged deals and stirring speeches attracted followers and a long list of investors from whom he raised billions of dollars  His unrivaled drive to acquire and develop natural gas reserves across the country meant that by 2012  Chesapeake owned the drilling rights on more than 15 million acres  an area about the size of West Virginia  Chesapeake called its rapid and expensive accrual of leases a  land grab   making McClendon the main character in the biggest resource driven land rush the country had experienced since the 1800s Gold Rush  His bold moves generated plenty of headlines  Forbes magazine went so far as to call McClendon  America s Most Reckless Billionaire  in a 2011 cover story  CONTROVERSY McClendon s final years at Chesapeake were marked by frequent controversy  He helped cause Chesapeake s stock to plummet amid the financial crisis when he sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock to raise cash for himself  In April 2012  Reuters reported that a series of previously undisclosed loans to McClendon could once again put him and Chesapeake s shareholders at odds  McClendon had borrowed more than  1 3 billion by pledging his stake in the company s oil and natural gas wells   a controversial perk known as the Founder Well Participation Plan   as collateral   He used that money  in part  to fund his share of the drilling costs of those wells  Some of the loans came from an investor that also did business with Chesapeake  That report  as well as the company s mounting debt at a time of falling energy prices  helped turn the board of directors against him  and he was stripped of his role as chairman  The next year  he was out as CEO  After leaving Chesapeake  McClendon quickly set up American Energy Partners to make his comeback  raising billions of dollars in new investments to acquire land for oil and gas development in the United States  Argentina and Australia  On Tuesday  McClendon was in the headlines again  as the Justice Department s Antitrust Division charged him with conspiring to rig bids to buy oil and natural gas leases in Oklahoma  The indictment followed a nearly four year federal antitrust probe that began after Reuters reported that Chesapeake had discussed with a rival how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan during a shale drilling boom   In a statement on Tuesday evening  McClendon vowed to fight   The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented   McClendon said  CHARITY While McClendon s energy deals made him one of America s highest paid men and he bought fancy houses and wines  he was also generous and funded athletic  academic and philanthropic ventures around the nation  Duke University and the University of Oklahoma have received more than  25 million for sports facilities and dormitories  Using his own cash and revenue from his firms  McClendon helped rebrand Oklahoma City through philanthropy and real estate development  The state capital is now an emerging center of sports and culture   
As part of his efforts to attract top talent to Chesapeake and its 50 acre red brick campus  McClendon had the company built a 72 000 square foot fitness center and a health center that offered teeth whitening ",2016-03-03,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/a-flawed-visionary,-mcclendon-ignited-shale-revolution,-courted-controversy-387827",387827
15374,236889,WHR,South Korea scores partial win in washer trade dispute with U S  ,news,"By Tom Miles and David Lawder
GENEVA WASHINGTON  Reuters    South Korea won a partial victory against the United States in a World Trade Organization ruling on Friday that found fault with the method used to calculate U S  duties imposed on Korean made washing machines that are deemed to be subsidized and unfairly priced 
The ruling will not immediately alter the countervailing duties of up to 82 percent imposed by the U S  Commerce Department in 2013 on washers made by Samsung Electronics Co  KS 005930    LG Electronics Inc   KS 066570  and Daewoo Electronics Co after a complaint brought by Michigan based Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  
South Korea in August 2014 brought its objections to the WTO about the U S  calculation methods  which are also the subject of a wide ranging dispute brought by China against the United States 
A WTO panel of three adjudicators rejected several of South Korea s claims  including objections to the Commerce Department s findings that tax credit subsidies were not tied to specific products  But it upheld South Korea s objection to calculations of duties for  targeted dumping  of products into the U S  market aimed at regions  time periods or customers with price cuts 
William Perry  an international trade lawyer in Seattle with Dorsey   Whitney LLP  said the decision  if upheld  could ultimately make it more difficult for U S  manufacturers to bring similar cases involving targeted dumping by Chinese companies 
A spokesman for the U S  Trade Representative in Washington said   We are carefully reviewing the report and considering next steps  
Both countries have 60 days to appeal 
 Today s WTO decision will not affect the application of the 2013 antidumping and countervailing duties orders on clothes washers from Korea   Whirlpool said in a statement   This 2013 order followed a U S  government ruling that washers imported from South Korea were unlawfully priced and subsidized  ",2016-03-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/south-korea-scores-partial-win-in-washer-trade-dispute-with-u.s.-389542,389542

15396,236911,WHR,With global outlook weak  many U S  companies tighten belts,news,By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015  And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth   In the first three weeks of October  165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue  That is up from 108 in the same period last year  and 97 in the year earlier quarter  according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters   Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are  challenging macroeconomic environment   or  global headwinds   Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar  economic weakness in China and Brazil  and tumbling oil and commodities prices   The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars  possibly making American exports less competitive   The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U S  multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy  metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them  The problems are clearly not across the board  as shown by better than expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   Google owner Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL   and  Microsoft Corp   O MSFT   They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud based computing   But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  N UTX  and  General Electric  Co  N GE   technology giant Hewlett Packard Co   N HPQ   and the world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger  N SLB    Even social media company  Twitter Inc   N TWTR   and biotechnology group Biogen Inc  O BIIB  have said they are cutting jobs  Large employers announced 205 759 U S  job cuts in the third quarter  the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009  according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas    Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   meanwhile  told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be  less than half of what it was in 2012   while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between  700 million and  750 million  down from a previous forecast of  750 million to  800 million   Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2 8 percent from this time last year  So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates  according to Thomson Reuters data   And expectations for 2016 are falling as well   in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9 2 percent and 13 7 percent  respectively  those figures now are down to 4 7 percent for the first quarter and 6 2 percent for the second   The companies own forecasts  meanwhile  are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014  according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report  Companies  have a reason to be worried  This isn t a major economic slowdown  but a meaningful one  and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth   said Paul Hoffmeister  a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds   REBOUND POSSIBLE  Few expect the economy to go into a free fall  of course  Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize  the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations  setting the stage for a stock rally   Some consumer driven companies also continue to do well  both in the U S  and even in China  where both  Nike  Inc  N NKE  and toy maker Mattel  O MAT  have said they still see high rates of growth  Apple Inc  O AAPL   which reports its quarterly results Tuesday  has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans   And some multinationals who have taken a pounding  such as household products giant Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   have signaled they may be turning a corner  P G said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year  as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent   Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines   For example  International Business Machines Corp  N IBM   which cut its full year profit forecast  said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter   Alan Gayle  a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments  said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U S  based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets    I ve pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing   he said  adding that he expects that top line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U S  companies there   Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom  and that consumer spending in the U S  and Europe should remain steady   We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low   he said

15397,236912,WHR,U S  government  Electrolux argue at trial over GE appliance deal,news,"By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The government argued Monday that U S  consumers would pay 5 percent more for ranges and wall ovens if AB Electrolux  ST ELUXb  was allowed to buy General Electric s  N GE  appliance business but the companies accused antitrust enforcers of failing to acknowledge powerful and growing competition from overseas manufacturers  The Department of Justice asked a federal court in July to stop Sweden s Electrolux  which makes Frigidaire  Kenmore and Tappan appliances  from buying GE s appliance business for  3 3 billion  Trial in the case began Monday  with the government asking the judge for an injunction to stop the deal  Justice Department lawyer Ethan Glass said that in one main channel   contract sales to developers and other professional buyers   GE had 28 percent of sales for ranges  Whirlpool  N WHR  had 26 percent  Electrolux 23 percent  Kenmore  which is made by Electrolux  11 percent  Samsung  KS 005930  6 percent and LG 3 percent   If this merger isn t stopped  two thirds of the ranges sold in the United States will be made by Electrolux   Glass told Judge Emmet Sullivan  who will decide the case   If this merger isn t stopped  the daily competition between GE and Electrolux will end   The Justice Department is focusing on lower end kitchen appliances  the type that home builders put in new houses and apartments or that consumers buy at big box stores  But Electrolux lawyer John Majoras argued that Samsung and LG had started selling appliances in a small way recently but were growing fast   This is a highly competitive marketplace and will continue to be so if this deal goes forward   Majoras said  Speaking for GE  Paul Denis argued that the government approved a similar deal  Whirlpool s purchase of Maytag  in 2006 without triggering higher prices  In that case  the Justice Department cited competition from Samsung and LG as a rationale to approve the deal  Denis said   Denis argued that market concentration in washers and dryers was actually higher in that deal    The government got it right in the Whirlpool Maytag merger  approving that transaction   he said  The two sides have held settlement talks but failed to find agreement on which assets Electrolux could sell in order to make its deal for GE s appliance business palatable to the Justice Department

15398,236913,WHR,Best Buy focuses on growth  bets on appliances,news,"By Nandita Bose
CHICAGO  Reuters     Best Buy  Co Inc  N BBY  is betting that appliance sales will drive significant revenue growth in the future  a strategy that is likely to benefit the biggest U S  electronics chain when it reports earnings on Thursday 
The Minneapolis based retailer  which operates 1 400 stores in the United States  is focusing on growth again after some analysts feared it was flirting with bankruptcy just a few years ago  hurt by the rise of Amazon com Inc  O AMZN   It is now in the third phase of a turnaround plan engineered by Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly  who took over in August 2012 
 The first phase was  Don t die    Joly told Reuters in a recent interview   Phase two was improve what we have  and we have clearly done that  Now we are in a position where we look to the future and say   How do we grow   
Analysts expect third quarter earnings per share to rise 16 percent to 34 9 cents on sales of  8 83 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 Target  Corp  N TGT   Macy s Inc  N M  and other retailers have indicated consumer caution going into the last quarter of the year  but home improvement chains have bucked the trend  in a potentially positive sign for Best Buy 
Appliances have emerged as one the fastest growing segments within the company  with 19 quarters of comparable sales growth 
As of the fiscal quarter ended on Aug  1  appliances contributed 10 percent of Best Buy s domestic revenue  That is up from 4 7 percent in fiscal 2010 
The company raised sales per square foot from  780 in 2010 to  870 in 2014  according to analysts  in part by changing the mix and presentation of appliances 
 It is a growing market and it is a market also where  our  market share has been lower historically     so there is a significant growth opportunity   Joly said 
GAINING SHARE
Best Buy wants to capture the higher end segment of the appliance market with products from existing brands including Samsung  KS 005930   LG and Whirlpool  N WHR   Joly said 
Stumbles by Sears Holdings Inc   whose Kenmore brand is an appliance titan  are also helping Best Buy gain market share  he said 
Ken Murphy  senior vice president and portfolio manager at  Standard Life   L SL  Investments  which holds Best Buy shares  believes appliances will raise revenue generated per square foot within a store 
Demand for laptops and revenue from services have been under pressure and electronics are not expected to perform strongly  as reflected by Target s disappointing results on Wednesday 
 The only question here is whether growth in appliances can offset the other pieces of their business that are not growing  or growing slowly   said Murphy  referring to Best Buy 
Kevin Balon  senior vice president of appliances at Best Buy  said the recovery of the U S  housing market is helping 
 People who are coming in now want to make changes to their kitchen  they want to make a planned purchase instead of just coming in to replace something that broke or needs repair  
As part of its turnaround strategy  Best Buy has created stores within stores that focus on certain product categories  including the Pacific Kitchen and Home appliance store  which has been key to improving sales  Balon said 
Best Buy s average selling price in appliances jumps between 10 and 20 percent when it adds an appliance store within an existing store  largely due to a wider assortment of premium products and customers who are willing to spend more 
About 50 percent of customers who walk into a Best Buy appliance section end up making a purchase  compared with 32 percent five years ago 
This is partly due to more dedicated spaces like branded store in stores for Samsung  for example 
 It has opened up the possibility of striking similar partnerships with other vendors   Balon said ",2015-11-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/best-buy-focuses-on-growth,-bets-on-appliances-371969",371969

15400,236915,WHR,From spies to smartphones  Britain s Aga set for another new chapter  ,news,By Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    The sale of oven maker Aga Rangemaster to a U S  owner with global ambitions caps the transformation of a quintessential English country brand created by some of the biggest names in global design  advertising   and espionage  The acquisition of Aga for  202 million by Middleby Corporation follows a brief bidding war with U S  rival Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  for the maker of the colorful cast iron stoves that can weigh as much as a male polar bear  cost  18 000 and  in older versions  take two days to heat   The deal  set to be completed this week  marks the latest in a list of premium British brands to fall under foreign ownership in recent years  to the dismay of some business commentators who want to see it kept in British hands   But the sale to a U S  company is also testament to the enduring appeal of a product invented in 1922  the year James Joyce s  Ulysses  was published and radio took off  In Britain  it has become synonymous with aspirational middle class country living and inspires huge loyalty in owners  including members of the royal family and Prime Minister David Cameron   It struggled as demand was hit during the global financial crisis  but has recently returned to form with modern  more efficient versions of the cooker  and hopes to build on its heritage by exploiting Middleby s global network   The fundamental design of the Aga has always been its virtue but behind the front and the look is now a completely different product   Aga Rangemaster CEO William McGrath told Reuters  before he steps down as part of the sale    The design makes it iconic  the radiant heat makes it iconic but how it is delivered is something that has changed from generation to generation  from solid fuel  through oil and gas to electric and now programmable electric    The heat  created by the continuously burning stove  made the old Aga distinctive  but it also drew its critics  Great in winter when it could heat half the house  one owner complained that you  sweat buckets while boiling an egg  in summer  For many the cost of fuel can also prove prohibitive while environmental groups criticized the impact of the traditional stoves   Modern versions can be easily switched on and off  including with a smartphone  while smaller models have been created to appeal to city dwellers   Around 80 percent of those sold today are the newer  more efficient designs that have been launched since 2011  and are offered in a variety of colors from rose  pewter and lemon to pistachio and aubergine   You can get all the virtues of an Aga in a 60 centimeter package  which is something we d expect over the next five to 10 years to become a more and more appreciable part of the business   said McGrath  The largest version of the stove can be 2 5 times that size   ASPIRATIONAL LIVING  McGrath said the new owner was also drawn to its heritage   a company with a history that reads like a spy novel   Created in 1922  the first Aga was invented by Swedish Nobel Prize winning physicist Gustaf Dalen who  confined to his home after being blinded in an accident  witnessed his wife struggling to cook on their old range   By 1929 manufacturing had begun in central England  with early sales driven by David Ogilvy  a salesman who went on to become one of the most famous advertising men in the world  the original  Mad Men  and founder of the Ogilvy   Mather ad agency  Newer versions were designed by Raymond Loewy   who produced some of the most famous product designs in history  including Greyhound Scenicruiser buses  Coca cola vending machines  Lucky Strike boxes and the livery of Air Force One  He worked with Douglas Scott  who later designed London s famous red buses  A written history of the company notes however that several of the leading protagonists including Ogilvy  his brother Francis and W T  Wren  an early Aga boss  also played important roles for Britain in World War Two  either as spies  writing for Winston Churchill or in aircraft manufacturing  Britain is still Aga s biggest market but they can now be found in the United States  Europe and China  and Middleby aims to take the brand further afield  The sale adds to concern among some Britons about the number of prominent companies that have been bought by foreign owners  including department store Harrods  toy brand Hamleys and chocolate maker Cadbury  They fear that such sales could ultimately put UK jobs at risk and dilute much of the brand s appeal   its intrinsic Britishness   McGrath is more positive  saying his firm hopes to mirror the success of another luxury British brand  Jaguar Land Rover  which has flourished under the ownership of India s Tata Group    We d love to get in the wheel tracks of Jaguar Land Rover   said McGrath   Now the product has evolved  the potential can be immense because the brand is much loved

15416,236931,WHR,Autos lift U S  factory goods orders in July,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for U S  factory goods rose for a second straight month in July on strong demand for automobiles  which could help to keep manufacturing supported as it deals with a strong dollar and softening global demand 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 0 4 percent after an upwardly revised 2 2 percent rise in June 
Factory activity has been hobbled by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year s sharp plunge in crude oil prices  Tepid global demand is also hurting manufacturing  which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy 
A report on Tuesday showed the manufacturing industry braked to a more than two year low in August  with some economists blaming the slowdown on the recent global stock market sell off 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0 9 percent in July after a previously reported 1 8 percent increase in June 
The dollar has gained 16 8 percent against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners since June 2014  which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinationals 
Orders for transportation equipment rose 5 5 percent in July as bookings for motor vehicles and parts increased 4 0 percent  the largest gain in a year  Orders for automobiles are likely to remain strong after sales surged in August 
In July  there were increases in orders for machinery  electrical equipment  appliances and components  and computers and electronic products 
The Commerce Department also said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft   seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans   increased 2 1 percent instead of the 2 2 percent rise reported last month 
Shipments of these so called core capital goods  which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report  increased 0 6 percent in July  unchanged from last month s estimate 
Inventories of factory goods slipped 0 1 percent after three straight months of gains  That left the inventories to shipments ratio at a lofty 1 35  unchanged from June 

That suggests manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods  which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters  Unfilled orders at factories rose 0 2 percent  increasing for a second straight month ",2015-09-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/autos-lift-u.s.-factory-goods-orders-in-july-359737,359737

15442,236957,WHR,Many U S  boards lack vision  just tick boxes in search for women directors,news,"By Nadia Damouni NEW YORK  Reuters    Linda Hudson  former CEO of the U S  arm of British defense company BAE Systems  LONDON BAES  Plc  is among the women that boards call on when they are looking for a female director  In the past two years  she has been approached about 18 times  but the retired executive turns down most of the approaches  she said   The demand for the 64 year old Hudson underscores an issue women directors are noticing  companies may be talking about how they want to have more diverse boards but a lot aren t putting in the effort needed to make it happen  This is reflected in the many requests women already on boards get to join more  while those who are qualified but haven t yet tasted life as a director get none    You often don t get the enlightened thinking of reaching beyond the obvious candidates   said Hudson  who sits on the boards of Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC  and utility Southern Co   and is thinking of joining a third   The narrowness of the net being thrown may be reflected in the recruitment numbers  Of the 478 new directors appointed to Fortune 500 boards in 2014  only 27 percent were women  according to research firm BoardEx  While those numbers are improving   in 2010 the number was 20 percent   they only represent gradual progress toward parity with men    Boards that are slow in adding women may dent shareholders  returns  A 2014 Thomson Reuters study of 1 843 public companies around the world estimated that an index of companies with women directors on average slightly outperformed an index of those with no women directors between 2009 2013  with the difference only becoming clear in the last two of those years  One reason boards may be slow to add women is that they often restrict their focus to current and former CEOs of big companies  In the Fortune 500  only 25 companies have women CEOs  and given the impenetrable nature of glass ceilings in previous eras there aren t so many former women CEOs to turn to either   The women who fit that criteria are essentially tapped out already   said Jane Stevenson  vice chairman of board and CEO services at executive search firm Korn Ferry  At least some boards now are willing to look at women who ran business units at major companies  said Eugenia Ulasewicz  who previously ran the Americas business for British luxury fashion house  Burberry  Group  LONDON BRBY  Plc and now sits on three corporate boards   The pool is opening up   she said    Examples of female non CEO executives becoming directors in the past few months include Linda Sanford  who led the internal transformation strategy for  IBM   NYSE IBM  Canada Limited and IBM United Kingdon Limited and joined the board of power utility Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED   and Myrna Soto  chief infrastructure and information security officer for cable and broadcasting company Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   who joined the board of utility CMS Energy  NYSE CMS    Still  though  only 18 percent of all S P 500 company directors are women right now  according to PricewaterhouseCoopers And in interviews with more than a dozen female directors for major U S  companies  a majority agreed progress in moving toward gender parity is painfully slow  Apart from the obsession with recruiting CEOs  they cited slow turnover due to a lack of term limits and increases in director retirement ages at many companies  According to executive search firm Spencer Stuart  45 percent of S P 500 company boards had an average age of 64 or older in 2014  up from 16 percent in 2004  while 30 percent of companies who specify a retirement age for directors set it at 75 or older  against only 5 percent a decade earlier  Older directors  want to hang on  they want to stay in the game   one woman director said   Women directors who have not had CEO experience said getting noticed wasn t easy  Carol Tome  chief financial officer at home improvement retailer  Home Depot   NYSE HD   who is also on the board of  United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS  said she worked extensively for nonprofits and that helped her meet CEOs and others who eventually invited her to join boards        LOCKED INTO THE DARK PAST  Several directors who spoke to Reuters said they are careful to only join boards of companies that seem to have a commitment to achieving diversity    You can pretty much tell when a board just wants to tick off a quota  and I think a lot of  women are not interested in being the female token   said Mary Cranston  who is the chair emeritus of law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP  and is on the boards of  Visa Inc   NYSE V  and telecom equipment company Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR    Some female directors said they would turn down an invitation to join a board if they were the first and only female director  Hudson said she declined to join one board that seemed like it was  locked into the dark past   She declined to name the company  Others told Reuters they would be open to the idea of joining an all male board  but only after extensive due diligence on the company s culture  management  performance and the other directors   Women who are willing to be pioneers say the experience can be satisfying  A female director  who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the discussions  said the CEO of one company told her that there was a difference in the board room after she joined  He told her that  if you were not in the room  it would be like a frat party   she said   One opportunity for adding women to boards may come from an unlikely source  more companies are looking to add directors with expertise in technology  including tackling cybercrime and Internet sales   According to a survey by Korn Ferry for Reuters  28 percent of the women appointed to Fortune 500 boards for the 12 months ending February 2015 had technology experience  including digital  big data and cybersecurity skills  The equivalent figure for men with technology expertise in that time was only 6 percent  
And that is despite  the tech sector s reputation for being unfriendly to women  which suggests the pool of potential female directors with a tech background may not be deep but it is big enough to be a viable source  recruiters said  Some companies who have added women directors with a tech background in the past two years are McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD   Hertz Global Holdings Inc   Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   and Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  Inc  ",2015-03-20,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/many-u.s.-boards-lack-vision,-just-tick-boxes-in-search-for-women-directors-333432",333432

15445,236960,WHR,With iceman on the way  U S  plants and suppliers get ready ,news,"By James B  Kelleher CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  Steel is stockpiling extra iron ore ahead of what could be another record long freeze up of the Great Lakes 
General Motors has built up inventories of critical parts at its plants and established a supply chain  crisis room  that will swing into action in the event of a major winter storm 
Con way Freight is issuing strap on cleats to its drivers and dock workers 
The blast of unseasonably frosty air gripping much of the United States has served as a reminder of the polar vortex that sent a chill through the U S  manufacturing sector last winter  causing part shortages and plant closures and triggering a 2 1 percent drop in first quarter gross domestic product 
Manufacturers and their suppliers are scrambling to avoid a costly repeat if this frigid autumn morphs into Polar Vortex II  Companies are stockpiling parts at factories  increasing the amount of goods in transit  reviewing weather contingencies with their freight carriers and booking extra trucks and trailers so shipments do not get sidelined by nasty storms 
The precautions will add hundreds of millions of dollars in cost  supply chain experts estimate  and could temporarily depress the sector s profits  But Whirlpool  N WHR   General Motors  N GM   Ford Motor Co  N F  and Con way  N CNW   and other companies contacted by Reuters said they aimed to avoid the even more costly disruptions  like those that hit in early 2014 
 It s an insurance policy   said Chad Moutray  the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers 
Companies such as U S  Steel  N X  believe they have little choice  The country s No  2 steel producer is moving a key raw material  iron pellets  south and increasing the volume of semi finished product at steel works around the country 
Last winter  locks on the Great Lakes froze for 145 days  more than double the usual 62  and at one point in March more than 90 percent of the lakes  surface was under ice 
That stranded raw materials and cut production and shipments of flat rolled steel alone by 344 000 tons during the first quarter  a six percent drop compared with the same period of 2013  according to U S  Steel 
WINTER FLOAT
CEO Mario Longhi says the Pittsburgh based company is  definitely preparing operations for a longer period of shutdown of the locks  this winter  which  will consume an additional level of cash  
Freezing weather forced Ford to idle several facilities last winter just as the company was kicking off the biggest year of new model launches in its history

CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  Steel is stockpiling extra iron ore ahead of what could be another record long freeze up of the Great Lakes 
General Motors has built up inventories of critical parts at its plants and established a supply chain  crisis room  that will swing into action in the event of a major winter storm 
Con way Freight is issuing strap on cleats to its drivers and dock workers 
The blast of unseasonably frosty air gripping much of the United States has served as a reminder of the polar vortex that sent a chill through the U S  manufacturing sector last winter  causing part shortages and plant closures and triggering a 2 1 percent drop in first quarter gross domestic product 
Manufacturers and their suppliers are scrambling to avoid a costly repeat if this frigid autumn morphs into Polar Vortex II  Companies are stockpiling parts at factories  increasing the amount of goods in transit  reviewing weather contingencies with their freight carriers and booking extra trucks and trailers so shipments do not get sidelined by nasty storms 
The precautions will add hundreds of millions of dollars in cost  supply chain experts estimate  and could temporarily depress the sector s profits  But Whirlpool  N WHR   General Motors  N GM   Ford Motor Co  N F  and Con way  N CNW   and other companies contacted by Reuters said they aimed to avoid the even more costly disruptions  like those that hit in early 2014 
 It s an insurance policy   said Chad Moutray  the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers 
Companies such as U S  Steel  N X  believe they have little choice  The country s No  2 steel producer is moving a key raw material  iron pellets  south and increasing the volume of semi finished product at steel works around the country 
Last winter  locks on the Great Lakes froze for 145 days  more than double the usual 62  and at one point in March more than 90 percent of the lakes  surface was under ice 
That stranded raw materials and cut production and shipments of flat rolled steel alone by 344 000 tons during the first quarter  a six percent drop compared with the same period of 2013  according to U S  Steel 
WINTER FLOAT
CEO Mario Longhi says the Pittsburgh based company is  definitely preparing operations for a longer period of shutdown of the locks  this winter  which  will consume an additional level of cash  
Freezing weather forced Ford to idle several facilities last winter just as the company was kicking off the biggest year of new model launches in its history 
This year  Ford has added what company planners call a  winter float  to its just in time production plans  The approach puts extra parts in transit and allows additional time for the parts to arrive at plants 
GM has identified high risk regions  in terms of supplier locations and logistics routes  and is monitoring them round the clock from a crisis center for any weather related disruptions  It has also added extra snow removal equipment at its distribution centers

15450,236965,WHR,Anemic U S  factory data points to moderate growth bounce,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months  but stronger than expected vehicle sales suggested the economy was finding some momentum after almost stalling in the first quarter 
Still  the sluggishness in the manufacturing sector and other data on Friday showing construction spending hit a six month low in March indicated that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint 
That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year 
The economy expanded at a 0 2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year  slammed by bad weather  a strong dollar and a now resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports  as well as lower oil prices  which have undercut domestic energy production 
 The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many  especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner   said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York 
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51 5 in April  matching the March reading  which had been the lowest since May 2013 
The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector 
While new orders rose last month  a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009 
Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar s 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners since June 
The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations  including Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   the world s largest household products maker  and prompted Colgate Palmolive  N CL  and healthcare conglomerate Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  to cut their profit forecasts for the full year 
Whirlpool Corp  N WHR   the world s largest maker of home appliances  lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015 
Manufacturing  which accounts for about 12 percent of the U S  economy  is also being pressured by the lower oil prices  which have caused oil field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling 
 Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year 
U S  stocks were trading higher  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury debt prices fell 
REGAINING FOOTING
Despite the economy s struggles  there is no doubt it is starting to regain its footing  General Motors Co  N GM  and  Ford Motor Co   N F  reported stronger than expected U S  auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks and crossover and sports utility vehicles 
Demand for autos is likely to remain solid in the months ahead  In a separate report  the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95 9 this month  the second highest level since 2007  from 93 0 in March 
Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future  More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle  There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house  which should support home sales 
 This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter     and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead   said Mark Vitner  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina 
Separately  the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0 6 percent to an annual rate of  966 6 billion in March  the lowest level since September 
Construction spending was weighed down by a 1 6 percent decline in private residential construction spending  the biggest such decline since June  Public construction outlays were also weak 
 We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York ",2015-05-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-factory-activity-growth-slows-in-april:-markit-339864,339864

15465,236980,WHR,Sluggish Latin American results show risks for U S  companies ,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf  Reuters    U S  companies are reporting sluggish financial results in Latin America  showing the risks they face in relying on Brazil and other emerging markets in the region for growth 
Companies ranging from Ford Motor Co to 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc reported second quarter earnings that highlighted weakness in their Latin or South American operations 
While Venezuela s weak currency valuation previously weighed on U S  corporate finances  the latest results indicate broader struggles  Several companies reported tepid performance in Brazil  the biggest economy in Latin America  where some economists fear the country is on the verge of a recession 
 The place where we see a little bit more of a challenge is Latin America   3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts on the company s quarterly conference call on Thursday  The diversified manufacturer  whose products include office supplies and industrial adhesives  cut its full year revenue forecast for the region  the worst performing in the quarter  hurt by a sales decline in Brazil 
U S  companies that have looked to emerging Latin American economies for growth have seen those expectations dented in recent months by Brazil s political and economic turmoil  Venezuela s currency woes and Argentina s renewed battle with major creditors 
 This is kind of the up and down of emerging markets   said J  Bryant Evans  who manages an international equity income portfolio at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign  Illinois 
 NOT HAPPENING 
A poll of more than 60 economists from earlier this month found that Latin American economies will probably grow at a slower pace than previously thought this year  Economies in Brazil  Argentina and Chile are expected to be weaker this year than in 2013  while Mexico is far from achieving the fast growth promised by sweeping economic reforms  the poll found 
U S  corporate prospects in Latin America have also been dampened by competition  lack of expected growth among the middle class and fluctuations in commodity prices  said Rafael Amiel  director for Latin America economics at research firm IHS 
 For multinational companies  the growth they were expecting in many Latin American markets is not happening   Amiel said 
South America was the only region in the world where Ford posted a quarterly loss     295 million  compared with a  151 million profit a year earlier 
South American countries  remain largely closed markets that have trade barriers up across many sectors of their economies  so they are actually pretty uncompetitive on a global basis  and that includes the automotive industry   Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters   Now that that capital is flowing out  those economies are suffering  
The importance of the Brazilian market to U S  companies has been rising over the past few years  Though South America has held steady at about 1 6 percent of sales at S P 500 companies over the past three years  Brazil s portion of sales within the region more than doubled between the start of 2010 and 2014  according to Thomson Reuters data 
Earlier this week  the Brazilian government lowered its economic growth forecast for 2014 to 1 8 percent from 2 5 percent  Economists think the growth could be even more tepid    0 97 percent  according to a weekly survey 
MEXICAN CRACKS
Caterpillar  which reported a 16 percent decline in second quarter Latin American sales  lowered its overall sales outlook in part because of worries over Brazil  Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson told Reuters in an interview 
 We are concerned about Brazil   Halverson said   They raised interest rates last year  The economy is slowing  Consumer confidence is plunging along with business confidence  
Whirlpool Corp reported a lower operating profit in Latin America and downgraded its forecast for appliance market sales in the region for 2014  Still  company executives said weakness in Brazil was more of a short term concern and expressed optimism about the economy 

 We continue to believe that the macroeconomic indicators in Brazil point to long term healthy demand growth   Mike Rodman  president of Whirlpool International  told analysts 
Some cracks also emerged in Mexico  the region s second largest economy  For example  a new tax in Mexico has put pressure on U S  food companies such as PepsiCo Inc  n Pep   which blamed the tax for sales declines in its food business 
While companies such as 3M reported solid results from the country  the Mexican economy grew by only 0 3 percent in the first quarter  John Gerspach  the chief financial officer of Citigroup  n C   which has about  11 7 billion of credit card loans in Latin America  told analysts last week that  as the Mexico economy continues to struggle to really regain the momentum that everyone thought that it would have  consumer spending has not been robust

15468,236983,WHR,Electrolux in talks to buy GE s appliances business ,news,"STOCKHOLM  Reuters    World number two home appliances maker Electrolux said on Thursday it was in talks to buy General Electric s household appliances business 
People familiar with the matter had said earlier in the day that GE was in talks with the Swedish group and other parties to sell the unit 
 AB Electrolux today confirmed that it is in discussions regarding a possible acquisition of the appliances business of GE  No agreement has been reached   Electrolux  a smaller rival to Whirlpool  said in a statement 
GE s home appliances business  which sells products under the GE Monogram  GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands  could be worth between  2 billion and  2 5 billion  the sources said 
The U S  diversified conglomerate is trying to sell its home appliances unit as Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt seeks to allocate resources to higher growth businesses 
Bloomberg News earlier reported that GE s appliances unit had drawn interest from Electrolux and consumer development startup Quirky 
Electrolux  which sells under brands such as Frigidaire  AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name  declined to comment further 
Representatives for GE did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Electrolux last month posted better quarterly profits than expected and stuck to forecasts for growth in its home region Europe  after years of gloom  and in the United States

15469,236984,WHR,Exclusive  Electrolux near  2 5 billion plus deal to buy GE unit   sources,news,"By Soyoung Kim and Sven Nordenstam NEW YORK STOCKHOLM  Reuters    Sweden s Electrolux AB  ST ELUXb  is near a deal to buy General Electric Co s  N GE  iconic appliance business for more than  2 5 billion  in a move that would significantly expand its reach in North America  people familiar with the matter said 
The companies are hammering out final terms of a deal and could announce their agreement as soon as next week  the people said on Thursday  asking not to be named because the matter is not public 
Shares of Electrolux turned higher on news of a possible deal  rising 3 6 percent to 188 40 Swedish crowns and giving it a market capitalization of more than  8 billion 
Discussions are ongoing and could still take longer to finalize  the people cautioned  Representatives for GE and Electrolux declined to comment 
GE s century old household appliance business  which along with lighting generated  8 3 billion in 2013 revenue  could help the Swedish appliance manufacturer expand beyond its core European market where growth has trailed that of North America 
Electrolux  which sells under brands such as Frigidaire  AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name  is already the world s second largest home appliance maker after Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  
GE had confirmed in August that it was evaluating strategic options for the home appliance business  including discussions with Electrolux and other interested parties 
With a price tag of more than  2 5 billion  Electrolux appears to be paying top dollar to win the asset  The GE business  which sells products under the GE Monogram  GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands  could be worth between  2 billion and  2 5 billion  people familiar with the matter have previously said 
The U S  diversified conglomerate has revived efforts to divest the profitable  but low margin unit as Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt seeks to exit businesses where it is not a global leader and allocate resources to higher growth businesses 
Fairfield  Connecticut based GE put the business up for sale in 2008 but talks fizzled out in the face of the global recession  Immelt instead opted to invest  1 billion in new factories and products to make the business more competitive 

Still  the unit is almost exclusively focused on the U S  market and lacks global scale  and GE believes it could be more valuable when being part of a global appliances group such as Electrolux  said one person familiar with the divestiture plan

Monday it would double U S  sales by paying  3 3 billion in cash for General Electric Co s  N GE  appliances business in its biggest ever deal  giving it the scale to go head to head with larger rival Whirlpool  N WHR    GE s century old household appliance business  which had  5 7 billion in 2013 revenue  could help the Swedish company expand beyond its core European market  where growth has

McLoughlin told Reuters   While the price tag is higher than the  2 billion to  2 5 billion figure that some people familiar with the business had estimated  analysts said the company was not overpaying  The deal includes GE s 48 4 percent stake in Mexican appliance maker Mabe   Reuters reported last week that Electrolux was near a deal to buy the GE business for more than  2 5 billion   The deal is likely to clear antitrust hurdles in the United States  with some asset sales possible to ensure that it complies with antitrust law  according to three experts    The ultimate question is whether it  the proposed deal  will affect the cost of refrigerators  I suspect the answer is no   said Evan Stewart of the law firm Cohen   Gresser LLP   Electrolux said the price was 7 0 7 3 times GE Appliance s estimated 2014 earnings before tax  interest  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   based on an enterprise value  including debt  of  3 45 billion  according to ThomsonReuters data   Including expected annual cost savings of around  300 million  the multiple paid for GE would be much lower at around five times EBITDA  Electrolux Chief Financial Officer Tomas Eliasson told a conference call    If they manage to realize the synergies  it s clearly a good multiple   said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Johan Eliason  adding that the inclusion of the Mabe stake would strengthen Electrolux s position in Latin America on top of the clout it is gaining in North America    They re getting access to both North and South America in a very good way  and will become very strong in all of the Americas   Eliason said   The deal will be financed by a bridge facility  and the company plans a rights issue to raise about 25 percent of the price after the deal s expected closing next year  Electrolux said   Investor  ST INVEb   the investment company founded by Sweden s Wallenberg family and owner of 15 5 percent of Electrolux s capital  gave the deal and the right issue its stamp of approval    As the leading owner  with a long term ownership horizon  we find Electrolux s acquisition of GE Appliances industrially attractive and fully support it   Investor Chief Executive B rje

15644,237159,WHR,Trump tariffs cause headaches for S P 500 manufacturers,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum from China are leading to higher costs for major U S  manufacturers and causing concerns at other companies  according to executives who spoke to investors in recent days  The topic has arisen on a fifth of conference calls for S P 500 companies reporting quarterly results so far this month  as of Wednesday  according to a Reuters analysis of transcripts  Executives at Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG    Ford Motor Co   N F  and Whirlpool Corp  N WHR  were among those warning investors about higher materials costs stemming from the U S  tariffs on steel and aluminum   Goldman Sachs  N GS  and Fifth Third Bancorp  O FITB  said their banking clients were also concerned about protectionism and trade tensions  Corporate executives and investors are worried the row over tariffs  particularly with China  will escalate into a full blown trade war  The 2018 first quarter marked the first reporting period for companies since Trump in March imposed the 25 percent duty on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum   Not all companies that discussed tariffs on calls said they expected to be hurt by them  Some said they hedged against volatile metals prices or that such costs were a small part of their overall businesses  Harley Davidson Chief Financial Officer John Olin warned that he expects extra costs stemming from the tariffs  on top of already rising raw materials that we expected at the start of the year     That s going to provide quite a headwind for the company over the next several quarters   Olin said on the motorcycle maker s conference call with analysts  Whirlpool appeared to be a beneficiary of Trump s initial wave of tariffs  which included steep tariffs on imported washing machines  But the appliance maker s chief executive  Marc Bitzer  told analysts this week the company was raising its raw material inflation guidance for the year by about  50 million to as much as  300 million   primarily due to previously announced U S  tariffs on steel and aluminum    Over the last few months  raw material costs have risen substantially   Bitzer said  NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION  Affirming the United States  top notch credit rating on Wednesday  Moody s said it believes a negotiated resolution between Washington and Beijing is more likely than a destructive tariff tit for tat  Beijing has responded to Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs with levies on U S  aluminum as well as agricultural products such as fruit and nuts  Both sides are threatening more tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in goods  with Washington targeting Chinese televisions and machinery components while Beijing is eyeing U S  soybeans  aircraft and cars   Ford CFO Robert Shanks pointed to an increase in commodity costs which was  largely metals driven  in part  by the market s reaction to potential increases in U S  tariffs   Manufacturers  quarterly reports echoed a survey this month from the Institute for Supply Management  which showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries about the impact of steel and aluminum import tariffs  On its quarterly conference call on Tuesday   Caterpillar   N CAT  said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter  The heavy equipment maker s shares tumbled 6 2 percent on concerns that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins  Some companies said they planned to manage any cost increases for materials by controlling expenses through their supply chains or by raising prices for their products  Homebuilder PulteGroup Inc  N PHM  pointed to inflation pressure on construction materials it depends on    You hear about tariff related increases on steel and aluminum  So having said that  there is inflationary pressure on commodities   said Chief Financial Officer Robert O Shaughnessy   The good news is that we ve seen a market that s allowed us to price to cover most of that     Boeing Co   N BA  CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company had yet to see a significant impact on costs from the tariffs  but was  keeping a very close eye  on the broad trade environment

15645,237160,WHR,Corporate America Is Saving Boatloads on Trump Tax Cut Windfall,news," Bloomberg     America s companies are swimming in cash thanks to the big cut in the corporate tax rate 
The roughly 180 companies in the S P 500 Index that have reported results saw their effective tax rate drop by 6 percent on average in the first quarter  That saved them a total of almost  13 billion in taxes  an analysis by Bloomberg shows  About a third of that went to 44 financial firms 
What companies are doing with that boatload of money is a bit muddy  Some analysis shows spending on capital expenditures is surging  That would confirm President Donald Trump s insistence that the cut would boost investment 
But lots of cash is also still going to buybacks that have anchored the U S  stock market s unprecedented run since the recession  Many firms also need more dough to pay for increasing labor and transportation costs 
Here are some of the early winners of the tax law  which reduced the federal corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent  To measure how much money a company saved  Bloomberg applied the 2017 tax rate to this year s first quarter pretax income  and then compared the number to 2018 results 

Among financial firms  Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC   s IRS bill in the first quarter fell the most  plummeting by  709 million from a year ago  No surprise  the firm posted record profits of  6 92 billion  a 30 percent jump  The funds could help the bank open more branches and expand into states like Ohio 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc   parent of Google  is embarking on a spending binge to catch up to rivals in areas including artificial intelligence and home assistants  In the first quarter  capital expenditures tripled as its tax rate was slashed almost in half to 10 8 percent  The tech giant has  so far  had the biggest dollar windfall  seeing its tax bill plummet by  1 billion 
Consumer discretionary firms  like appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR   and Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG    have seen their rates fall  The iconic motorcycle maker is in the midst of a turnaround plan aimed at reversing sagging interest from younger shoppers  In the first quarter  it saved  24 million on a tax rate that fell by 1 000 basis points  Capex rose by 18 percent  But the company remained focused on cutting costs  while also boosting buybacks and its dividend 
Many companies have already realized the tax law would be more beneficial than they figured just a few months ago  One is Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  Inc   which in January projected a 23 percent rate for this year  Last week it reduced that to 20 percent 
Among the largest drops in tax rate  Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX   s sank to 3 percent from 20 percent  Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  saw its decline by two thirds to 9 percent 
 AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV    maker of top selling drug Humira  had already projected a 9 percent adjusted rate for this year  and posted a minuscule 0 5 percent levy last quarter  The drugmaker says it plans to spend more on research and development and capital projects 

 We view the passage of U S  tax reform as an important business driver for companies like ours   AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said last week in a conference call   Tax reform is having the intended impact  ",2018-04-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/corporate-america-is-saving-boatloads-on-trump-taxcut-windfall-1421516,1421516

15676,237191,WHR,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Market participants are bracing for heightened volatility as the coming week will be dominated by several market moving events 
The Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year on Tuesday and Wednesday  with investors hoping for more clues on how patient it will be before raising interest rates again 
There is also the January jobs report on Friday  with the effects of furloughed government workers potentially impacting the unemployment rate 
In earnings  results from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  on Tuesday  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  on Wednesday and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  on Thursday will be high on the agenda 
Meanwhile  markets will be keeping abreast of the next round of trade talks between the U S  and China to see if any more news materializes amid recent signs the world s two biggest economies are working to resolve their differences 
Elsewhere  Brexit will also occupy minds as British Prime Minister Theresa May attempts to win support for her tweaked divorce deal in parliament 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Federal Reserve Rate Decision
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two day policy meeting at 2 00PM ET  19 00 GMT  on Wednesday  keeping it in a range between 2 25  2 5  
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold what will be a closely watched press conference 30 minutes after the release of the Fed s statement  as investors look for greater signs of the central bank s likely rate hike trajectory through the rest of the year 
Any hint that the central bank is closer to ending its balance sheet runoff will also be in focus 
The Fed raised interest rates four times last year and has signaled it will probably lift borrowing costs twice in 2019  though some central bank officials have said they will be patient and cautious in raising rates as risks to the U S  economy mount 
2  U S  Jobs Report
The U S  Labor Department will release the nonfarm payrolls report for January at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT  on Friday 
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 165 000  after adding 312 000 positions in December  while the unemployment rate is seen dipping to 3 8  from 3 9  
However  most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures  which are expected to rise 3 2  from a year earlier  the same gain reported in December 
This week s calendar also features data on U S  personal income and spending  which includes personal consumption expenditures  PCE  inflation figures  the Fed s preferred metric for inflation 
Other top tier economic data due this week includes the CB consumer confidence report  ADP  NASDAQ ADP  private sector payrolls  as well as the ISM surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity

4  U S  China Trade Talks
The United States and China will have in depth discussions on economic and trade issues during Chinese Vice Premier Liu He s U S  visit on Wednesday and Thursday 
That follows lower level negotiations held in Beijing earlier this month to resolve the bitter dispute between the world s two largest economies by March 2  when the Trump administration is scheduled to increase tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods 
Washington and Beijing have been engaged in a trade spat for more than a year  with both countries slapping tariffs on several of each other s products  The standoff has raised concern in the market about a potential slowdown in global economic growth 
5  Brexit  Plan B  Debate
Investors will keep a watchful eye on the British parliament s debate on Prime Minister Theresa May s proposed next Brexit steps  as well as alternative plans put forward by lawmakers  including some that seek to delay Britain s March 29 exit from the European Union 
The opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine month extension to Brexit should a deal not be agreed by Feb  26 
Deliberations are set for Tuesday

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Sunday  Trump said there is a less than 50  chance such a deal could be reached before the next government funding lapse on Feb  15  which is less than three weeks away 
His comments followed a bill on Friday to end a 35 day partial shutdown of the U S  government  which was the longest in history 
Building a wall along the border with Mexico to keep migrants from entering the country illegally was a central plank of Trump s presidential campaign  but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request of  5 7 billion

15721,237236,WHR,Day Ahead   Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a look at three things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  It s Fed Day and Suddenly a Rate Cut Is in Doubt
The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision on interest rates tomorrow and what looked like a foregone conclusion at the start of the month has turned into a dead heat 
There is now just a 53  chance that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 1 75  to 2   according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
Chances had been well above 90  for most of the time after the Fed s last cut 
A few things changed in the landscape  such as a slight thaw in trade relations between the U S  and China  a sharp rebound in Treasury yields  upbeat economic data and a move back to risk assets by investors 
That would usually be enough to for the FOMC to keep rates on hold  But now there s political pressure on the rate setting committee and especially Fed Chairman Jerome Powell 
President Donald Trump has called for negative rates from the Fed  who are  boneheads  according to the president  so that the U S  can refinance its debt obligations  something easier tweeted than done  
The FOMC statement arrives at 2 PM ET  18 00 GMT   and Powell will hold his press conference at 2 30 PM ET 
2  Housing Starts  Permits for August on the Calendar
Ahead of the Fed the market will get some more insight into the state of the U S  housing market 
The Commerce Department will report numbers on August housing starts and building permits at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT  
Housing starts are predicted to show 4 5  rise to an annual rate of 1 25 million  according to economists  forecast compiled by Investing com 
Building permits  an indication of future demand  are seen ticking down slightly to an annual rate of 1 31 million

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation s fourth quarter 2019 earnings release call  Today s call will be recorded  For opening remarks and introductions  I would like to turn the call over to senior director of investor relations  Roxanne Warner  Please go ahead Roxanne Warner    Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you  and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call  Joining me today are Marc Bitzer  our chairman and chief executive officer  and Jim Peters  our chief financial officer  Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp com  Before we begin  I ll remind you that as we conduct this call  we will be making forward looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation s future expectations  Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10 K and other periodic reports  We want to remind you that today s presentation includes non GAAP measures  We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations  We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the investor relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  Following our prepared remarks  the call will be open for analyst questions  As a reminder  we ask that participants ask no more than two questions  With that  I ll turn the call over to Marc  Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  and good morning  everyone  On Slide 3  we show our fourth quarter 2019 highlights  We delivered very strong results  organic net sales growth of 1 2  and ongoing EBIT margin expansion to 7 2   a 100 basis point increase  We demonstrated a strong performance across the globe as all regions delivered positive EBIT  North America led with record EBIT margins of 13 3  despite industry demand softness in the U S  and Canada  In our Europe  Middle East and Africa region  we continued to realize the full benefits of our strategic actions  This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential EBIT improvement in the European region  providing a strong confidence in our ability to drive a region to profitability in 2020  Additionally  we delivered strong free cash flow of over  900 million  with positive contributions from all regions  This result was driven by working capital improvements and capital spend efficiencies  Lastly  we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and made strong progress toward our long term gross debt to EBITDA target of approximately two  Turning to Slide 4  I will discuss our full year highlights  We delivered record ongoing earnings per share of  16  above our  14 75 to  15 50 guidance  with a very strong ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 60 basis points and free cash flow of over  900 million compared to guidance of approximately  800 million  We took decisive actions in a challenging environment by announcing and successfully executing on our global cost based pricing initiatives and driving positive mix through product innovation  Additionally  we remain disciplined in our approach to cost takeout and continue to optimize our overall value chain while overcoming significant headwinds from tariffs and material cost inflation  Despite significant trade and macroeconomic challenges  we fully funded our business investment needs and returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through continued share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 7th consecutive year  These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business and provide us confidence that we have the right strategy in place to deliver our long term goals  Turning to Slide 5  We show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin expansion  In the fourth quarter  price mix delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion as we realize the benefits of pricing actions and mix benefits from our product launches  Additionally  we delivered positive net cost takeouts in the quarter  Further  improving trends in raw materials more than offset continued tariff headwinds in North America  resulting in a favorable impact of 25 basis points  These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency  Over full year  very strong margin expansion from price mix was partially offset by the impact of tariffs  increased brand investments and currency  Overall  we re very pleased to deliver and even slightly overdeliver on our margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive strong results in 2020  Now I ll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Marc  and good morning  everyone  Turning to Slide 7  I ll review the fourth quarter results for our North America region  We delivered stable revenue despite industry softness in the U S  and Canada  highlighting the agility and underlying strength of our business  Additionally  we delivered record EBIT with margin expansion to 13 3  as strong price mix execution and disciplined cost takeout offset headwinds from fixed cost leverage and continued cost inflation  The region drove margin improvement of 150 basis points in the quarter  making it the ninth consecutive quarter of consistent margin expansion  Turning to Slide 8  We review the fourth quarter results for our Europe  Middle East and Africa region  Excluding business exits  unit volumes were approximately flat  with growth in Italy  France and Eastern Europe  which was offset by soft Middle East and Africa demand  We are pleased to see strong top line exit rates in December across the region  including year over year growth in Middle East and Africa  Momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives delivered positive EBIT with margin expansion of 210 basis points  These initiatives remain fully on track and delivered in line with our guidance of approximately  100 million EBIT benefit on an annual basis  with approximately  75 million to be realized in 2019  This sustained improvement provides us confidence in our ability to return the region to profitability in 2020  Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region  Unit volumes significantly increased alongside a rebound in Brazil industry demand  offsetting continued weakness in Mexico  Organic net sales  which excludes 2018 Embraco sales  increased approximately 17  driven by Brazil share gains and very strong direct to consumer sales  EBIT margins contracted in the quarter as cost productivity benefits and favorable raw material inflation were more than offset by currency devaluation in Brazil and Argentina  Finally  as a reminder  our fourth quarter 2018 results include the impact of the Embraco compressor business in its consolidated results  We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region  which are shown on Slide 10  Excluding the impact of currency  net sales were approximately flat as strong top line growth in India was offset by negative industry demand in China  India delivered double digit EBIT and continued share gains  which was offset by brand transition investments in China  These investments remain on track with Whirlpool brand share increasing sequentially and year over year  Now  I d like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance and operational priorities Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Jim  Turning to Slide 12  We ll review our guidance assumption for 2020  In line with our long term goals  we expected to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3   We expect to deliver approximately 7 5  ongoing EBIT margin  an increase of about 60 basis points  Lastly  our free cash flow guidance is  800 million to  900 million  which includes a net unfavorable impact of  140 million from onetime items  Turning to Slide 13  We show the drivers of our approximately seven and a half ongoing EBIT margin guidance in 2020  We expect approximately 25 basis points of improvement related to price mix as we deliver new and innovative products and services to our customers  We expect net cost to drive approximately 50 basis points of improvements as we realize the benefits of our global standardization and complexity reduction initiatives  Additionally  based on what has been announced to date  we do not expect tariffs to have a year over year impact on 2020 results  A favorable trend in raw materials are expected to drive approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion  Further  we expect a negative margin impact of approximately 50 basis points as we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and an unfavorable impact from currency of approximately 25 basis points  Moving to Slides 14 and 15  We want to highlight just a few of our innovative products which allow us to drive positive price mix during 2020  The first slide shows how we will achieve product leadership in the North America premium top load laundry segment  These products will launch throughout the first quarter of this year  replacing our entire premium top load laundry segment  These connected capable products have purposeful innovation to meet customer needs such as load and go dispenser  a new pretreat station and an extra power function  Second example on Slide 15 highlights our new dishwasher built in our first ever true global architecture  which is set to launch in North America and Asia in the first quarter and at a later stage in Europe  By leveraging our architecture globally  we are able to drive significant improvement in part and complexity reduction  therefore driving cost efficiencies  Even more importantly  this innovative product features a new full sized third rack with a fully functioning spray arm  the largest third rack available in the market  We fully expect to see major growth in our mass and premium segments as a result of these innovative consumer relevant features  Again  these are just a few examples of exciting innovations that we expect to launch this year that will continue to drive positive price mix  Now  I ll turn it back to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Marc  Turning to Slide 16  We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of  16 to  17 in 2020  Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20  to 25  compared to 15 3  in 2019  resulting in a year over year headwind of approximately  1 55  A European tax law change in late 2019 favorably impacted our effective tax rate  Excluding this benefit  our tax rate would have been near the midpoint of our previous guidance  Additionally  several of our tax reform benefits and strategies from prior years are no longer effective in 2020  further increasing our rate to our current 20  to 25  range  Secondly  as we mentioned earlier  we expect to drive EBIT margin expansion in all regions totaling approximately 60 basis points  resulting in strong earnings accretion  Our earnings per share guidance includes a headwind of  0 60 as 2019 EBIT includes approximately  50 million related to Embraco  Additionally  we expect moderately lower interest expense after the repayment of our  1 billion term loan in 2019  Lastly  we highlight the carryover benefit from our 2019 share buybacks  While we expect to continue to repurchase shares at a moderate level  we do not provide specific guidance for 2020 and do not reflect that as a driver  On Slide 17  we show our regional guidance for the year  Starting with industry demand  we maintain our cautious demand outlook for North America while U S  housing starts show positive signs of strengthening that has not yet translated into higher appliance demand  In EMEA  we expect a continuation of modest growth  while in Latin America  we expect growth of 3  to 4  as improvements in Brazil are offset by continued weakness in Mexico  Asia industry is expected to be approximately flat as growth in India is offset by continued demand pressure in China  In total  we expect the global appliance industry to be approximately flat for 2020  Regarding our EBIT guidance  we expect continued margin expansion in North America  driven by focused cost discipline and favorable price mix related to new product introductions  In EMEA  we fully expect to continue to realize the benefits of our strategic actions to restore EMEA to profitability  resulting in EBIT margin expansion of over 170 basis points  As a reminder  we executed several strategic actions  including our business exits in the first half of 2019  driving benefits primarily in the second half  In Latin America  we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6  as demand improvements and accelerating direct to consumer sales in Brazil are offset by demand weakness in Mexico and currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil  Lastly  we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 3  to 4  in Asia as strong India operations are partially offset by weak demand expectations in China  In total  we expect to deliver approximately 60 basis points of margin improvement and are confident that our operational priorities and initiatives will deliver continued progress toward our long term goals  Turning to Slide 18  I will discuss the drivers of our 2020 free cash flow  We expect to deliver approximately  1 7 billion in cash earnings  primarily driven by margin expansion  offset by the sale of Embraco  We expect  550 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our business  Additionally  we expect to deliver approximately  50 million of working capital improvement  primarily through inventory reduction initiatives as we fully transition key product launches across the globe  And we expect  200 million of restructuring cash outlays  which includes the reindustrialization of our Naples  Italy manufacturing facility  Lastly  free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately  140 million related to several onetime items  Further details of these items can be found in the appendix of this presentation  In total  we expect to deliver  800 million to  900 million of free cash flow  Turning to Slide 19  We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year  We remain fully committed to funding the business for growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders  Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation  we repurchased approximately  50 million of shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue repurchasing shares at moderate levels in 2020  In line with guidance at Investor Day  our gross debt to EBITDA is on track toward our long term target of approximately two  Lastly  I d like to announce that starting in April  we will no longer report units sold in our earnings materials  including our 10 K and 10 Q  As we continue to redefine what product is  this will lead to an increase in revenue from products not reported as units  such as the KitchenAid Smart Oven plus baking stone and the upcoming launch of Yummly s wireless smart thermometer  Further  we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and unlock long term value creation through incremental revenue from digital products and services such as our Yummly Pro subscription service  As a result  units are becoming less of an indicator of our overall sales performance  Consequently  we will eliminate units reporting in our earnings materials  including our 10 Q and 10 K  Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead Mike Dahl    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning  Thanks for taking my questions  I wanted to start out just a couple of questions around North American volumes and maybe a follow up about your last comment on  Jim  around units  But just in the quarter  with volumes a bit weak  it seems like on the major appliance side  a little below what AHAM said  And then I think we all were expecting some rebound in small appliance shipments just given the timing shifts you had indicated last quarter  Can you talk us through just the inventory dynamics potentially at your trade partners  both in major appliances and small appliances and how we should be thinking about what happened in the quarter and maybe how that s progressing into 2020 Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So Mike  it s Marc Bitzer  Let me comment on then our volume Q4  which  as you know  in total we reported a 3 8  unit decline for North America  Now keep in mind  first of all  on the pure majors business  and if you want to take one indication  the AHAM numbers were minus 1 8 for the quarter  which  just to remind everybody  does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell  So that s  of course  one part of that  If you look at the pure majors business  we approximately held market share in Q4  So we feel pretty good about where we are from a market share  in particular  during the promotional period  On the other parts of the business  keep in mind  Canada is in there  Canada continues to have a market decline  and the Canadian market is soft and that has an impact  On the SDA volume  frankly  coming into the quarter  we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the year  and they did  So the trade inventories on the SDA side are lower than the year before  But we feel very good about the set up proof of KitchenAid SDA  which is pretty solid and pretty stable  So these are pretty much the major components  And maybe  Jim  you want to comment again on the units reporting Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Mike  And then on the units reporting  as I mentioned  as we look at our business globally  there are a lot of parts of the world where services and other consumables  products that aren t normally included in our unit count or an increasing part of our sales  So we typically look at a unit as something that has a power cord attached to it  And a lot more of the stuff that we sell now today  whether it be stand mixer attachments  it be licensed products  it be  as I mentioned  consumables or services just don t fall into there  And so we felt it was a much less relevant indicator  while revenues is a better indicator of how we re doing on a global basis Mike Dahl    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst OK  thanks  And that was actually going to be my second question  Just    is there any way you can size up those components just before you kind of transition to the new reporting  Just give us a sense of what those represent today by either in aggregate or by a major region Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I d say right now that we don t disclose those specifically by region and all that  As we said  it s becoming more a part of our ongoing sales  And I think as we switch to this new model  we ll look at what relevant measures we think we should be communicating Mike Dahl    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst OK  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  everyone Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Mike Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Good morning  Mike Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst First question I had was just on the competitive backdrop in North America  There s been a lot of chatter and concern  as there always is perpetually  But given the past year with the ramp of the LG and Samsung lines  we ve gotten a lot of questions around how that may or may not have affected the competitive dynamics  I was hoping you could comment on your view of the promotional environment in the fourth quarter  Seasonally  there s always  I think  a lift in the fourth quarter  But if you could comment on how that trend has been maybe year over year  and if you view anything related to the ramp up of those plants as having contributed to that at all Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So Mike  it s Marc  As you mentioned already  with question around the competitive background in North America  they are almost a perennial question  so i e   they have been around for the last 10 years  And in the last 10 years  we expanded our margin on a consistent basis in North America  So we    of course  it s an intense competitive environment  But I think we ve also impressively demonstrated that we can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment  In particular  when it comes to the onshoring of the two washing machine factories  as we always said  we welcome that because it s mainly a level playing field  and we feel very confident that we can compete in that environment  So as such  no  we did not see a negative impact on the broader competitive environment from the onshoring of their production  I would say it s pretty much the same intense environment  Particularly  as it relates to your question around the promotional environment  yes  in Q4  we saw a slight uptick on promotional intensity  particularly from two competitors but not the entire marketplace  And that doesn t entirely surprise us  But we ve also seen that despite a broader market contraction  we delivered 13 3  EBIT margin in North America  which demonstrates that even in a promotional environment  even with the declining markets  we are able to deliver very  very strong margins Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Right  So no  I appreciate that  Marc  And maybe just to dive in a little bit more as my second question on the North American margins  which obviously is very  very impressive  If you could give us any sense of the    perhaps just being a little more granular around the drivers of that 150 basis point year over year improvement  In particular  obviously  you have the price mix component  And I m also curious about cost productivity  What s driving that bucket  And what was the contributor there particularly as  obviously  you don t have any additional volume leverage to take advantage of  So really  what was driving that other bucket Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Michael  This is Jim  Let me maybe start a little bit with that  I d say for North America  the margin expansion was driven by similar levers to what we said globally  And so there s not a significant difference there  We did obviously have positive price and mix within North America within the quarter  From a net cost perspective  we also began to see some cost progression there  And what we re seeing is  one  as we talked about going into 2020  a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we re seeing on materials  Tariffs were very stable within the quarter  So that was positive for us  And then we did make some investments similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter  So there s nothing unusual within North America outside of what we demonstrated globally  that it was really pricing and mix and then a positive cost environment that offset some of the cost headwinds we had to deal with Michael Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  Thank you Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Mike OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Thank you  Good morning Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Just start off with can you talk a little bit about inflation  and how you re seeing steel prices and other kind of key inputs as we think about 2020 Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Susan  So when it comes to inflation  and let me first repeat what we said several times  we    coming into 2019  we basically had a cumulative inflation of around  700 million in our business  That is the result of raw materials  tariffs  cost inflation throughout the entire value chain  in particular  in logistics  That was still in total headwind pretty much throughout mid year 2019  And as of Q3  and in particular Q4  we saw that slowly coming around in terms of a total net cost takeout  If you break it down more in terms of the external factors on this one  yes  we saw globally a turn of the raw materials pretty much around Q3 and then more impact in Q4  And as you ve seen in our guidance for 2020  we also expect another improvement on the raw material side  What has changed since our last earnings call is our outlook on the tariffs because in the last outlook  we had to work with what was announced at that time  And based on what we know today now  the tariffs will not have a negative year over year impact  And as a result of that  we basically see this 0 5  margin expansion just coming from better raw materials  The other inflation elements like logistics or other cost elements  so far  we don t see yet turning around  So that is still working against us  and that s what we re trying to address  But again summarizing  I would describe 2020  we will see less of an inflationary environment  but it s not completely gone and it s certainly not reversed  And it s obviously our key operational priority to kind of double down and really improve our cost takeout throughout the entire system Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  That s helpful  Thank you  And then just turning to your EMEA business  Can you talk to how much of the improvement in the margin this quarter came from kind of the core business and maybe your improving position within that relative to some of the benefits of the restructuring actions that you ve taken there Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Susan  I think it s pretty balanced  I mean at the end of the day  it s the combination of all these measures  Keep in mind  the biggest actions which we drove pretty much for the last several quarters is the fixed cost takeout  the kind of exit of certain non core businesses like Turkey  like South Africa and Hotpoint  small domestic appliances  and the refocus of investments and driving growth in our core markets  And frankly  I would say we delivered on all three of these levers  So I think it s a combination of these ones which drove the year over year improvement  But in particular  when it comes to the core markets  and this may be    is embedded in our overall unit number which we have for Europe  we had in our core markets growth in Q4  And that s a good thing  So we stabilized or regained market share in most of our core markets  And again  that s a very encouraging sign as we look into 2020 Susan Maklari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  Great  Thank you Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Susan OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James  Your line is open Sam Darkatsh    Raymond James    Analyst Good morning  Marc  Good morning  Jim  How are you Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Sam  good Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sam  good morning Sam Darkatsh    Raymond James    Analyst A couple of questions  if I could  First  you re mentioning expectations for flat industry units globally and also a 3  organic sales growth expectations  I m trying to figure out the rank or the reasons for the outperformance in sales dollars you expected in fiscal  20 versus the flat industry shipments  I m guessing some of that s the DR Horton win  I m guessing some of that s price mix  But if you could help rank what are the drivers of that gap  Jim Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Sam  here s what I d probably start with is  if you look at it  what we would say is demand being flat globally  Obviously  we do believe we ll have some share win in certain markets around the world  and you pointed to some of the specific examples in North America  But I think also  as Marc just talked about  within EMEA  we also expect to gain back some of the share we lost there  So that will help drive us from a revenue perspective despite an industry being flat globally  The second thing is  as we mentioned  there s an incremental amount of price mix in there  which also does help us on a revenue base  We assume that to be slightly positive for the year  So both of those  that would probably be the second biggest driver that I would say Sam Darkatsh    Raymond James    Analyst And then my second question  the net cost benefit of 50 basis points in 2020  that s obviously constructive  But I think it s still below where you d like to be ideally  at least from a productivity standpoint  Are you still anticipating having production below shipments in fiscal  20  I know you mentioned inventories maybe being down a little bit  but that sounded more like efficiencies than it did production cuts  So if you could talk about production expectations versus shipments  please Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I can take that  Sam  First of all  on a full year basis  as you pointed out  we re certainly not planning on a net cost takeout to have benefit from volume leverage  Or put it differently  we re not going to increase production beyond the sales forecast  We re actually    contrary  we re planning to take out further inventory when we have some opportunity  However  I would say that is not a huge item in there  It s a small negative in the cost takeout efforts  But the other element is we still have logistics costs which are elevated throughout the world  That is still a factor  The good news is we re making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other parts  We see some benefits from our global product architecture  so it s all coming to materialize  And yes  internally  our job over time is to tackle it more  in particular with the supply chain and logistics costs Sam Darkatsh    Raymond James    Analyst So long term  what should that net cost number be as opposed to the 50 basis points Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mean    and again it s    Sam  I would come back to what we said at the global investor conference  Our aspiration will be  yeah  half a point to a point should be the net cost takeout  absent of raw material impact  And that s kind of the long term expectation we should have of a business of our size Sam Darkatsh    Raymond James    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America  Your line is open Curtis Nagle    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Good morning  Thanks very much for taking my question  So the first one would be just trying to understand what is driving the view that North America demand or unit demand will be higher this year versus last  given things like the replacement cycle and housing obviously being late stage and then I think your commentary that we haven t seen much of a push up from that  So I m just trying to reconcile  yeah  again how to think about this year versus last Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So Curtis  let me    again  on North America  first of all  to repeat the numbers  we expect North America industry to be somewhere between minus 1  and plus 1   so pretty much flat year over year  As you know  they are basically simplified by two major components in the industry demand  one is the replacement demand  We have one which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling  On the replacement  and that s a little bit the same like last year  We re now comping against the low years post recession  And that had been around us for the last one or two years and probably will be around us for another year or so  just because you re comping against these low years  And that was already a factor in 2019  Coming into 2019  frankly  we expected more momentum coming out of housing  And of course  the    and then again  we re now    going back in time  Q4  18  the weak housing impacted what we sold in the housing related market in 2019  So the housing was  I would say  a little bit on the softer side compared to what we originally expected coming into 2019  As you turn the page in 2020  I would say we re reasonably optimistic on housing  but we just want to wait and see  What I mean with that is the initial data points which we got in December from housing were  in fact  very encouraging  But it s the first positive data points  and we want to see that stabilizing  I would also add when you look at the news from homebuilders  these were  in fact  very strong and very encouraging signs  But I also want to remind everybody  between an order of a new house and the actual appliance shipment  you typically have 9 to 12 months  So the good signs which we see now on the order side  it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line  So    but I would say  if housing stabilizes and sees more positive trends that we ve seen in December  I would say that spells good news for our industry in first Curtis Nagle    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  Understood  And then just as my follow up  yes    I mean  I guess  how should we think about restructuring costs  and I guess  kind of the path going forward  A commentary from you guys is    for a few years from now is we should expect that to kind of tick down  This year  it s going to be elevated  and I understand for  I guess  what I ll call a onetime item  But past 2020  do you guys still think we will see a tick down  Or how should we think about it Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Curtis  this is Jim  And what I d say is we expect to be  from a P L perspective  at  100 million of restructuring costs this year  And most of that is related to the already announced action we re taking around our Naples factory within EMEA  So that s also    the  100 million is about the run rate you should expect better or less on a go forward basis  What we do have within this year is we still have assumed  200 million of cash outlays for restructuring  And that s just some of the ongoing projects that we have  including Naples  That s the finalization of those  but we ve already taken the P L charge for those  But somewhere  100 million or less than that is what you really should think about on an ongoing basis that we ll see Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Curtis  it s Marc  and let me also echo what Jim is saying  And again stepping back in time  post the acquisitions which we did and also post recession  we had several years where we had restructuring  150 million to  200 million or over  200 million  And rightfully  many of you asked  when is that coming down  So I would say 2020 is now the first significant year where we basically take it down to  100 million  And again  to Jim s point  the cash is following it over time  but the charge  as such  will be  100 million  And I would say 2020 is the first significant year where you see a significant reduction in restructuring and that  I think  should be a trend going forward Curtis Nagle    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  Understood  Thanks very much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research  Your line is open David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst Yes  good morning  Congratulations on the quarter  I thought it was a good quarter overall  I guess just on Europe  just to go back to an earlier caller s question on Europe and just looking at your 2020 EBIT guide of 100 to 150 basis points  How much of the expected improvement is related to a full year of the savings that you ve delivered so far versus how much is related to top line drivers like listing growth and favorable mix Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I d say  David  if you start off    what we said that actions we took deliver about  100 million on a run rate basis  And we really realized about  75 million of that so far  so there s about an incremental  25 million that will come within next year from those actions we ve already planned  And then additionally  we ve got other continuing cost takeout initiatives that we ve entered into there and we continue to drive  We have  as I mentioned  the action around the Naples factory that at some point in time    well  we don t expect it to be a significant benefit within 2020  It will be from an ongoing perspective  And then as I mentioned earlier  really  volume lift or regaining some of the market share in some of our key markets is what we see as the opportunity that will then close the gap in terms of that margin progression there David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst I don t want to get cut off because I ve got a second question  But if I could just add    ask you to elaborate on the answer you just provided in just how much of a drag on the segment EBIT was the EMEA business Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David  the EMEA business was a drag throughout pretty much Q3  As you know  we had some issues around recertification against the new industry standards  But EMEA in Q4 was pretty much in line with where we historically had and where we should be  But it was a drag pretty much until September  So it s about a little bit drag on a full year basis  So yes  I would say that is a further leverage of    a lever for further operation and organic improvements in 2020 because you re just now comping against our three quarters David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst Right  Right  OK  And then my follow up question  I guess  with respect to the North American business  I guess  there s a lot of questions in the market today regarding    you ve got negative North American units  The working capital certainly was below the guide that you discussed on your October call  You had    revenues were generally flat  and you put up some pretty impressive margins  I guess within the revenue growth math  can you talk about how strong is the mix  And just how confident are you that the mix will remain strong through 2020  And I guess  you ve got a lot of innovation in the market right now  Is this a matter of just we had a good year in mix and then we ended up against some pretty tough mix comps  Or are we in the beginning of maybe a two  three  four year stretch driven by innovation of very strong mix contribution to the P L Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So David  I m    overall  I would say in Q4  first of all  it was driven    the pricing was driven by  yes  our continued discipline in line with our established policy around promotional participation would create the value  But second of all  to your point  it s product mix where we started  I emphasize  started leveraging some of the product innovation  And that s also the reason why we showed earlier in the script there are kind of two major new product ones because they re both impacting North America  So    and that s why we re confident we will have good mix  solid mix across brands  across products  also on a go forward basis  And that is our big opportunity David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst Thanks very much Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  David OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Seldon Clarke    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Hey  thanks for the question  Just given all the moving pieces in free cash flow  what do you think the right way to think about long term EBITDA to free cash conversion is Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Well  as we ve always said  we see our long term free cash flow goal around 5  to 6  of sales  So as we begin to exit this year  I think you start to look at a conversion that begins to get into the 85  plus area  And again  I think 2020  as we mentioned  we still have some key onetime items that we need to do such as some legal settlements and other things  But once you get beyond that  we do expect to be in that 5  to 6  of sales as a free cash flow percentage Seldon Clarke    Deutsche Bank    Analyst And that s  you think  starting in 2021 Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer In 2021  I d say we re going to get    we will get much closer to there  and there will be a progression as you go through over the next few years  But most of these items  as we mentioned  coming out of 2020  our restructuring cash outflows will be less and we ll have some of these  whether they re legal settlements or product actions that we had to take behind us  And so we do feel confident that our free cash flows will begin to reflect that stronger performance Seldon Clarke    Deutsche Bank    Analyst That s helpful  And then I know you manufacture the majority of your appliances in the U S   but do you anticipate any major impacts to production stemming from this coronavirus outbreak  whether it be related to Whirlpool specifically or just the industry more broadly Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Seldon  it s Marc  I would say at this point  the answer is no  we don t expect a major impact  So to elaborate a little bit on this one  and first of all  it s kind of    our biggest concern is right now around our people  But so far  it looks like all our 10 000 people are safe and healthy  Beyond this one is    of this coronavirus  from what you can see today  it may have three potential impacts  One is the China domestic market  Obviously  when people don t go into stores  the market will decline  You all know that our exposure to the China domestic market is limited  So yes  that s not going to hurt us a whole lot  Two is then on production and three is on components  Production  China production is largely serving Asia and to only a lesser extent  Europe  and to almost a very small extent  North America  As you know  North America  80  of what we sell in North America or in U S  is produced in U S  So the bad exposure is somewhat limited  in particular with one factory where we export from China  It s almost a thousand miles away from Wuhan  So we re a little bit  I won t say protected  but it s a little bit further way  The third element is components  Keep in mind  this whole thing happens around the Chinese New Year  Every year around Chinese New Year  you plan with your supplier inventory levels  when they stop production  when they start production  I would say we re pretty well covered  We re also well covered for this three or four days of extension for Chinese New Year  And beyond this one  we got to see  And the other thing which you also need to keep in mind  throughout the last couple of years  the most critical components  we went aggressively for dual sourcing  So we re not    we re single sourced only in very  very few components  We re largely dual sourced  which gives you a little bit of a hedging Seldon Clarke    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  That s helpful  Appreciate the questions Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Seldon OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research  Your line is open Eric Bosshard    Cleveland Research    Analyst Good morning Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Good mornign Eric Bosshard    Cleveland Research    Analyst Two things in the U S  market to be curious about  First of all  your expectation of share  it looks like you ve got some key new product launches  Interested in how you think about your major appliance market share performance in  20  And then secondly  curious how you re seeing retailers managing their business in what looks to be a sustained  somewhat slower growth environment and also an environment where it appears Sears is probably giving up less share funding their growth Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So Eric  it s Marc  I mean  as you ve seen in our outlook  so for North America  we have a lot of new product innovations where we do believe we have some share growth opportunities  Certainly  on the two products which we ve just shown  our top load and dishwasher  the dishwasher platform or architecture which we have was almost 10 years old  So I mean bringing in such an architecture with great features  that should open opportunities for some share growth  And I m not talking about promotional share growth  I m talking about structural share growth in a healthy business  So yes  we have certain ambition for share growth in North America  Related to your question about retailers  yes  it s obvious that the kind of windfall which came out of a serious decline for many other retailers  that has diminished  I mean that s basing on existing  But right now  I would say it s a reasonably stable retail environment  The home improvement    having a strong growth in home appliances  Best Buy being very well established  but also some other good regional players  So I think it s    right now we don t see a dramatic move across the retail landscape  We ve seen some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers  And I think you all have seen that in the AHAM shipment data in October and then subsequent in December  So there s been some moves  which  of course  impact us and our entire supply chain  But beyond this one  we don t see dramatic moves across the different retailers Eric Bosshard    Cleveland Research    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc  Your line is open Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning  everybody Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Good morning Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Jim  I just have a quick question  So look  the EPS mix  given your expansion in margins that you guys are giving in guidance  should we basically expect kind of a normal EPS cadence  meaning front half  a little under half the earnings  first quarter kind of that 21   22  range  just given the strength and the different moving parts  I just want to make sure we re kind of thinking about if your business balance is shifting this year Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Ken  I think you should expect within this year a similar seasonality  And I mean  even in the first quarter  we tend to be pretty close to 20  is what is we look at historically  But a similar 45 55 type of split that you ve seen in other years is a safe assumption Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  And then given the kind of    in North America  and I understand you re moving to    away from the volume price mix discussion given AHAM and a long history there  I understand  I m wondering if you might be able to anticipate  I mean  if the result    if the revenue is down  I mean  how are you guys going to go about kind of explaining this  Or what type of communication could we expect to hear from you  absent that    those data points just so none of us get caught by surprise  you  all or us  in terms of if results are better or worse just so we can properly interpret it  I mean do you think you ll be able to talk about volume even though you re not reporting it or the price mix  How will that dialogue change Jim Peters    Chief Financial Officer Well  Ken  I would expect  first thing  is there ll still be obviously industry data out there that will give an indication of which direction the industry is going  and especially from a North America perspective now that it s really two key markets and the biggest one being the U S  Currency also doesn t play a big difference within there  So as I said  I don t think that whether we disclose units or not within the North America business will make a significant difference because of a couple of big variables that already drive it are out there  Obviously  we will talk about how we believe we re doing from a share perspective and then what the benefits of price and mix are  We ll continue to talk about that on a go forward basis  which also is an indicator of revenues versus what unit performance is doing Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  And then I guess this is    just looking at AHAM  and it s kind of interesting  right  I mean you had for the year  laundry was up 1 to 2 points  kitchen and fridge was down I think 3 to 4  How do you think about    or what does that say to you about kind of the market that we re seeing some of these categories in a sustained growth challenging environment relative to  Marc  the fixed cost  Because this global architecture that you mentioned in the laundry seems to be a really important factor for Whirlpool given your global platform to kind of extract leverage from categories that really are challenged in terms of growth Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So Ken  I mean  on a go forward basis  to be honest  we don t see dramatic differences across the different product groups in terms of where we would see the industry growth or development  Given what I said before  it s kind of    there is at least the early indication that the housing may strengthen  The housing strengthening  that typically translates in kitchen suites  So that should help the cooking  the dishwasher  refrigeration business  but I would not get    read too much into this one  So I wouldn t break down the pieces too much  I would say  right now our guidance for next year industry is pretty much flat  But very frankly  I think the uncertain factor to the upside could be the housing and how housing now develops  if that s stabilized and if we see the growth trends extending beyond the December number  But again  don t read too much into the different subcategories Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Thank you  And I enjoyed your interview yesterday Marc Bitzer    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK  Appreciate it  Ken  First of all  thank you for joining us all  And let me  given that we just came to the last question  let me just quickly wrap up and summarize  First of all  I want to start out    with all the numbers in and out  I want to remind everybody  we had an all time record year last year  We feel very good about it  And we closed an all time record year with the best quarter ever in our history  which I think is more remarkable given that we did not have a lot of tailwinds throughout the year  Industry demand didn t help us  We still saw cost inflation throughout most parts of the year  So we feel very good about what we ve achieved last year  But now we re in January 2020  The most important thing about last year is that it gave us a good momentum as we exited the year  So we feel very good about momentum  which we ll carry into 2020  and I hope you heard also that confidence throughout the earnings call  As we look into 2020  and we laid that out  we have three operational priorities  We are very focused on getting the cost out of the system  we are focused on executing the product launches  which we talked about  and obviously  there s a lot more launches beyond those two ones  which we highlighted  And from a regional perspective  of course  we have a key focus not only in maintaining strong margins in North America  but particularly turning    continue to turn around Europe and China  That is a key focus  But then in a broader perspective  and this comes back to our Investor Day  I want to remind everybody  our strategy has not changed  Beyond the operational priorities and delivering on our commitments  we have a very strong focus on continuing to execute along our strategic imperatives  which is not only about product leadership  but it s our entire digital transformation  be it on redefining what the product is  be it on winning digital consumer journey  So there s a strong focus in our company around the strategic transformation  and we feel very good about where we are  And we will kind of increase our efforts throughout the year to kind of create a long term  strong and sustainable business  With that in mind  I just want to thank you for joining us today  and talk to you next quarter Operator Operator signoff

122633,344148,WHR,What You Need to Know About Whirlpool s Earnings,news,"Appliance manufacturer Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  reported its fourth quarter results after the market closed on Monday  It was a mixed report relative to analyst expectations  but investors found enough good news to send the stock sharply higher on Tuesday  Here s what you need to know 
1  Revenue was down  but it s complicated
Whirlpool produced total revenue of  5 4 billion in the fourth quarter  down 4 9  year over year and missing analyst estimates by  140 million  However  the details are important 
In North America  Whirlpool recorded a sales decline of just 0 3  to  3 1 billion  The situation was helped by improved pricing and product mix  Other geographies didn t perform as well  Sales were down 5 5  in Europe  Middle East  and Africa  down 21  in Latin America  and down 4 3  in Asia 
Currency and the divestiture of Embraco contributed significantly to the revenue declines  On an organic basis  which excludes both factors  total net sales rose 1 2   In Latin America  organic net sales rose 16 7  

2  The bottom line was up
Despite the revenue decline  Whirlpool managed to produce higher earnings in the fourth quarter than it did in the same period last year 
Non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share came in at  4 91  up from  4 75 in the prior year period and a whopping  0 64 higher than analysts were expecting  Pricing  product mix  and cost discipline contributed to the bottom line beat 
Globally  adjusted operating margin was 7 2   up a full percentage point year over year  Pricing  product mix  and cost inflation from raw materials  tariffs  and other sources were all positive factors compared to the prior year period  while marketing and technology investments and currency had a negative impact 
For the full year  Whirlpool reported adjusted EPS of  16 00  up from  15 16 in 2018 
3  Sales and earnings growth expected in 2020
Whirlpool expects to grow organic net sales by roughly 3  in 2020  in line with its long term goals  On a reported basis  revenue is expected to be approximately flat 
The company sees its adjusted operating margin rising further in 2020 to 7 5   That s well below its long term goal of 10   but an improvement over 2019 
Adjusted earnings per share is expected in the range of  16 00 to  17 00  driven higher by margin expansion  the impact of share repurchases  and lower interest and other expenses  A higher expected tax rate will work in the opposite direction 
Whirlpool expects to generate free cash flow between  800 million and  900 million this year  down from  912 million in 2019  Restructuring costs and other one time items will be responsible for the decline 
4  Whirlpool will stop reporting unit sales figures
Whirlpool s practice of including unit sales figures in its quarterly and annual filings with the SEC will come to an end in April  CFO Jim Peters explained in the earnings call that a few factors led to the decision  First  revenue from products not reported as units  such as an upcoming wireless smart thermometer  is increasing  Second  revenue from digital products and services is expected to rise 
The company concluded that unit volume is no longer a good indicator of overall sales performance  and thus will stop reporting it  Investors should always be suspicious when a company stops reporting an important metric  because sometimes  the real reason for the change is to hide deteriorating performance 
A solid report
While Whirlpool s fourth quarter results were mixed  the profit improvement despite slumping revenue provided some indication that the company has been able to pass off higher prices to consumers without hurting the bottom line 
Earnings growth in 2020 is another positive  especially with a higher tax rate expected  With the stock trading for less than 10 times the low end of the company s 2020 earnings guidance  there s still a lot of pessimism baked into the stock price  An economic downturn could certainly derail Whirlpool s long term goals  so some of that pessimism is warranted  But for now  Whirlpool s earnings are holding up well ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/podq2,2070427

122782,344297,WHR,Earnings Preview  Whirlpool  WHR  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Whirlpool  WHR  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 27  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 53 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Whirlpool 
For Whirlpool  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Whirlpool will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Whirlpool would post earnings of  3 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 97  delivering a surprise of  0 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Whirlpool doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-whirlpool-whr-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200500081,200500081
122783,344298,WHR,Whirlpool  WHR  Tops Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Whirlpool  WHR  came out with quarterly earnings of  4 91 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 30 per share  This compares to earnings of  4 75 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14 19   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances would post earnings of  3 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 97  delivering a surprise of 0 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Whirlpool  which belongs to the Zacks Household Appliances industry  posted revenues of  5 38 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 69   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 66 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Whirlpool shares have added about 1 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2  
What s Next for Whirlpool 
While Whirlpool has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Whirlpool was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 21 on  4 49 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  16 19 on  20 27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Whirlpool in Focus

Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 80 is up 1 1  from last year  Whirlpool has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8 46   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Whirlpool s current payout ratio is 30   meaning it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  WHR expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  16 29 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 1 81  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that WHR is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whirlpool-whr-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200503336,200503336

From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that WHR is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-whirlpool-whr-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200474555,200474555

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 22  2019  Whirlpool reported EPS of  4 01 versus consensus estimate of  3 8 
For the current fiscal year  Whirlpool is expected to post earnings of  15 25 per share on  20 53 billion in revenues  This represents a 0 59  change in EPS on a  2 41  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  16 73 per share on  20 32 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 73  and  1 02   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Whirlpool may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Whirlpool has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 4 3X versus its peer group s average of 8 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 01  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Whirlpool currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts

122828,344343,WHR,Household Appliances Industry Outlook Dampened By High Costs,opinion,The  industry comprises companies that manufacture and market home appliances and other related products  Household or domestic appliances include electrical and mechanical devices that facilitate chores like cooking  cleaning  laundry or food preservation Companies in this industry make refrigerators  washing machines  water coolers and heaters  microwave ovens  toasters and coffee makers  among other devices  These companies sell products through a network of mass merchandisers  retailers  distributors  dealers  and other builders and outlets  In an era of automation  players in the industry are committed to constant technological enhancements to offer smart home appliances  for instance  voice activated and hands free devices Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Although regular technological upgrade is a major survival strategy in the industry  higher spending on technology and innovation has been eating into companies  margins and profits  Freight cost inflation is an added concern  Prices for raw materials like steel and aluminum  which form the base metals for these companies  remain volatile due to tariff related headwinds  Also  volatility of oil  plastic or other secondary raw material prices is a bother  The material costs have been bumping up operational expenses  eroding companies  profits  Apart from high costs  economic uncertainties on the domestic and international fronts are deterrents to growth  One of the major brunt being borne by the U S  economy is the 15 month trade war between the United States and China  Despite low mortgage rates  we note that U S  buyers remain apprehensive owing to global economic uncertainties  Quite apparent  sales of new U S  single family homes dropped 0 7  in September  Moreover  sales of existing homes fell 2 2  in the same period  Softness in housing and construction activities might lead to lower demand for home appliances  Apart from these  adverse currency translations are a major threat to these companies  top and bottom lines  Still  analysts expect the Global Household Appliances Market to reach a worth of  763 45 billion  at a CAGR of 5 4  in the 2018 2025 period  On a positive note  demand for fast accessible and remotely monitored home appliances has been consistently rising  thanks to tech savvy consumers  These requirements are compelling industry players to make investments in innovation and Research   Development  R D  to make differentiated and handy products  These companies are also committed toward manufacturing appliances that are a one stop solution for major household tasks  Additionally  appliance makers are installing smart grids  thermostats  digital inverter compressors and other monitoring sensors to make devices more energy efficient  As a result  household appliances are becoming more high tech  embedded with smart sensors and the Internet of things  IoT  enabled technology  These innovations can significantly boost the companies  top lines  Meanwhile  the industry players are resorting to higher pricing actions and cost productivity programs to boost margins and profitability Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Household Appliances industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  222  which places it at the bottom 13  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy prospects in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 4 1  Before we

122830,344345,WHR,Is Whirlpool  WHR  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Whirlpool has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 31  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 15  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Whirlpool s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Whirlpool has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 57  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Whirlpool has a P S ratio of about 0 46  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 48 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  WHR is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Whirlpool currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Whirlpool a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Whirlpool is just 2 35  a level that is lower than the industry average of 6 86  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  WHR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles      What About the Stock Overall    Though Whirlpool might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives WHR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 0 5  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has declined by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus
 

   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Whirlpool is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 24  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Household Appliances industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops  Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 6  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-whirlpool-whr-a-profitable-pick-for-value-investors-200495967,200495967

122862,344377,WHR,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Whirlpool  WHR ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Whirlpool  WHR   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Whirlpool currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for WHR that show why this maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For WHR  shares are up 4 65  over the past week while the Zacks Household Appliances industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 11 08  compares favorably with the industry s 5 51  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Whirlpool have increased 7 64  over the past quarter  and have gained 33 72  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  2 39  and 0 8   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to WHR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  WHR is currently averaging 668 135 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with WHR 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost WHR s consensus estimate  increasing from  15 12 to  15 20 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that WHR is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Whirlpool on your short list ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-whirlpool-whr-200470286,200470286

122907,344422,WHR,Household Appliances Industry s Near Term Outlook Lacks Spark,opinion,The  industry covers companies that manufacture and market home appliances and other related products  Household or domestic appliances include electrical and mechanical devices that support household functions like cooking  laundry or food preservation Companies in this industry manufacture refrigerators  washing machines  water coolers and heaters  microwave ovens  toasters and coffee makers  to name a few  These companies sell products through a network of mass merchandisers  retailers  distributors  dealers  and other retail outlets Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes      Higher spending on technology and innovation dents margins of companies operating in this space  Raw material cost inflation is another concern  Volatility in prices of raw materials  particularly steel  oil  plastic  resin  aluminum among others  is affecting the companies  performances  Additionally  higher tariffs on steel  which is a key raw material  have been bumping up operational costs  These factors have been eating into margins and overall profitability  For instance  leading home appliances maker  Whirlpool Corporation  NYSE WHR  expects 2019 results to be hurt by lower industry demand coupled with raw material and tariff inflation      In addition  softness in housing and construction activities might lead to lower demand for home appliances  Apparently  sales of new single family homes in the United States dropped 6 9  in April from the prior month  Moreover  sales of existing homes fell in the same period  However  analysts expect the Household Appliances Market to reach a worth of  763 45 billion globally by 2025  representing a CAGR of 5 4  in the 2018 2025 period      On the positive front  household appliances are gradually becoming more high tech  embedded with smart sensors and the Internet of things  IoT  enabled technology  In fact  technology is playing a major role in the field of electronics  As a result  industry players are largely investing in product innovation and Research   Development  R D  to make differentiated and convenient products  These companies are also committed toward manufacturing appliances that are a one stop solution for major household tasks  Additionally  appliance makers are installing smart grids  thermostats  digital inverter compressors and other monitoring sensors to make devices more energy efficient  These innovations can contribute significantly in boosting the top lines of these companies  Meanwhile  companies are resorting to higher pricing actions and cost productivity programs to boost margins and profitability Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Household Appliances industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  223  which places it at the bottom 13  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy prospects in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 16 5  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Household Appliances industry has underperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector and the S P 500 index over the

with upgraded technologies act as key catalysts for the industry  higher raw material costs are a major deterrent  Moreover  higher investments and tariff inflation might show on companies  margins and profitability  Furthermore  a slowdown in housing and construction activities will probably affect demand for household appliances  An unimpressive Zacks Industry Rank also signifies bleak

122908,344423,WHR,Whirlpool  WHR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Whirlpool  WHR  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 1  
Revenues are expected to be  4 90 billion  down 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Whirlpool 
For Whirlpool  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Whirlpool will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Whirlpool would post earnings of  3 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 11  delivering a surprise of  2 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Whirlpool doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whirlpool-whr-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200439818,200439818

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Whirlpool  which belongs to the Zacks Household Appliances industry  posted revenues of  5 19 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 17   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 14 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Whirlpool shares have added about 38 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 7  
What s Next for Whirlpool 
While Whirlpool has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Whirlpool was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 72 on  4 99 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 75 on  20 09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

122986,344501,WHR,Whirlpool  WHR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Whirlpool  WHR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 74 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Whirlpool 
For Whirlpool  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Whirlpool will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Whirlpool would post earnings of  3 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 55  delivering a surprise of  23 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Whirlpool doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whirlpool-whr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200377667,200377667
122987,344502,WHR,Why Whirlpool  WHR  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Whirlpool in Focus
Based in Benton Harbor  Whirlpool  WHR  is in the Consumer Discretionary sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 16 46   The maker of Maytag  KitchenAid and other appliances is currently shelling out a dividend of  1 15 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 7   This compares to the Household Appliances industry s yield of 1 26  and the S P 500 s yield of 2  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 60 is up 1 1  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Whirlpool has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 28   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Whirlpool s payout ratio is 31   which means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  WHR expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  16 18 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 6 73  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  WHR is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-whirlpool-whr-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200380502,200380502

In addition to mortgage rates  housing markets are also being dented by land and labor shortages  These are leading to higher house prices and tighter inventories  Also  the lag in wage growth is affecting home buyers  On an annual basis  wages rose by 3 1  in the month of October in comparison to trailing housing inflation of 5 5   Per Danielle Hale  chief economist for Realtor com  recently released data point toward continued softness in homes sales ahead

123059,344574,WHR,Whirlpool  WHR  Up 9 7  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR    Shares have added about 9 7  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is WHR due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Whirlpool Q1 Earnings   Sales Miss  GAAP View TrimmedWhirlpool reported dismal first quarter 2018 results as both earnings and sales missed estimates  However  top and bottom lines improved year over year driven by progress on its global cost based price increases and fixed cost reduction initiatives  With this  the company reported negative earnings in six of the last seven quarters  Moreover  this marked its fourth straight quarter of top line miss Q1 HighlightsWhirlpool delivered adjusted earnings per share of  2 81  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 92  However  its bottom line rose 12  from  2 50 per share earned in the year ago quarter  Bottom line results gained from smooth progress on its global cost based price increases and fixed cost reduction initiatives  which also boosted adjusted EBIT On a GAAP basis  the company reported earnings of  1 30 per share  down 35 3  from  2 01 in the prior year quarter Revenues of  4 911 million rose nearly 2 6  from the comparable year ago quarter revenues of  4 786 million  However  the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 003 million  On a currency neutral basis  sales declined 0 7  Further  adjusted operating profit  EBIT  improved 3 5  to  295 million from  285 million in the year ago quarter  However  operating margin remained flat with last year at 6   Apart from the aforementioned gains  operating margin was aided by favorable product price mix and restructuring benefits  partly negated by raw material inflation  unit volume declines and unfavorable currency Regional PerformanceRevenues from North America rose 4 2  to  2 5 billion while it increased 2 5  on a currency neutral basis  Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 bps to 11 4   In dollar terms  operating profit grew 4 7  to  288 million  Notably  operating profit gains reflected from favorable product price mix and unit volume growth  which mitigated the negative impact of raw material inflation Revenues from Latin America declined 2 5  year over year to  898 million  Excluding currency translations  it dipped 3 2   Adjusted operating margin of 6 3  contracted 90 bps  mainly due to raw material inflation and unfavorable cost productivity  partly neutralized by favorable product price mix and restructuring benefits  In dollar terms  operating income declined 13 6  to  57 million Meanwhile  revenues from EMEA increased 10  to  1 1 billion  On a currency neutral basis  it dropped 8 1   Whirlpool reported adjusted operating loss of  27 million in the first quarter compared with an operating loss of  23 million in the year ago quarter  The decline can be attributed to raw material inflation  unit volume declines and unfavorable currency  offset by favorable product price mix and cost productivity gains Revenues from Asia improved nearly 3  to  448 million from  435 million in the prior year quarter  Excluding currency effects  revenues decreased 1 9   Moreover  the segment reported adjusted operating profit of  19 million  down 20 8  from the year ago quarter  Further  adjusted operating margin contracted 140 bps to 4 2   Raw material inflation and negative currency movements were the main culprits for the decline  partly offset by the favorable impact from cost productivity Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of  1 041 million as of Mar 31  2018  and long term debt of  4 190 million The company used  713 million cash in operating activities in first quarter 2018 and reported negative free cash flow of  756 million  Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled  66 million Going ahead  the company remains committed to its balanced capital allocation approach  Consequently  it expects to continue buying back shares in 2018 while hoping to return more value to shareholders through its recently raised quarterly dividend On Apr 16  Whirlpool declared a quarterly cash dividend of  1 15 per share  marking an increase of 5 cents from the previous rate of  1 10 per share  This dividend is payable on Jun 15  to shareholders with record as of May 18 GuidanceFollowing the not so impressive first quarter  Whirlpool slightly lowered its GAAP earnings per share forecast while retaining adjusted earnings view for 2018  It continues to envision adjusted earnings per share of  14 50  15 50  On a GAAP basis  it now anticipates earnings in the range of  12 30  13 30 per share compared with  12 45  13 45 per share projected earlier Further  the company revised its full year tax rate expectation to nearly 20   which along with favorable product price mix is likely to aid earnings  However  this will be partly offset by lower global revenue growth and increased raw material inflation The company reiterated its forecast of generating free cash flow of  1  1 1 billion in 2018 while operating cash flows are projected to be  1 7  1 8 billion  This guidance includes restructured cash outlays of approximately  300 million  pension contributions of  35 million and capital expenditures of  675 million related to free cash flows 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
It turns out  fresh estimates flatlined during the past month  There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower

123061,344576,WHR,Is Whirlpool  WHR  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Whirlpool has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Whirlpool s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Whirlpool has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Mohawk stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Whirlpool has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  WHR is roughly in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Whirlpool currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Whirlpool a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Whirlpool might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F  This gives WHR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and two down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWhirlpool is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 25  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana      Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-06-03,Zacks Investment

123063,344578,WHR,Wild And Unprecedented Price Fluctuations Are Causing Financial Chaos,opinion,"In every war there is a high price to pay  and this trade war will not be any different  The normal flow of goods and services around the globe is being severely disrupted  and even though this trade war has barely just begun  it is already having an enormous impact on the U S  economy  Even if we ultimately win this trade war and the Trump administration is able to achieve all of the goals that it is targeting  there will still be a great cost in the short term  We are going to see businesses fail  we are going to see workers get laid off  and global economic activity will inevitably contract  Heck  at this point even Fox News is calling this trade war  economic suicide   We live at a time when a delicately balanced formula of economic factors allows us to live a debt fueled standard of living that is far beyond what we actually deserve  Now we are messing with that formula  and the consequences are likely to be far more severe than most Americans are anticipating 
Let s start by talking about steel and aluminum  One of the chief goals of the tariffs was to help the steel and aluminum industries  and thanks to those tariffs we have seen the price of U S  steel rise 36 percent since the beginning of 2018 

For instance  US steel and aluminum prices have soared since the imposition of tariffs  US midwest hot rolled coil steel price  the US steel price benchmark  soared 36  between the start of the year and the start of July  This in turn causes prices of goods made with the metal to rise 

That is good news for the U S  economy  right 
Actually  it isn t 
Every product that uses steel and aluminum is now going to cost more 
In many cases  a lot more 
For instance  one grill company is reporting that they have had to raise prices  by almost  350 per grill  

Middleby Residential  a California based company that makes Lynx grills   told the Dallas Morning News that even though the company uses US steel  the recent price pressures have driven up costs by almost  350 per grill 

Do you want to pay an extra  350 for your next grill 
Retail prices for washer and dryers are surging as well  They have increased by 20 percent compared to a year ago  and that is because prices for raw materials are skyrocketing 

Whirlpool Corp  NYSE WHR  trimmed its full year profit outlook as it booked a large charge on its European operations and said it wouldn t be able to offset the effect of steel tariffs with higher prices for consumers 
The company said Monday it now expects to pay about  350 million more this year from rising raw material costs as it faces  a very challenging cost environment  

Anybody that purchases any products that contain steel and or aluminum will be feeling these prices increases 
And any business that uses steel and or aluminum on a regular basis is going to be feeling an enormous amount of pain  For example  the largest nail company in America is already laying off workers 

When President Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports last month  America s largest nail manufacturer had little choice but to raise its prices  Mid Continent Nail Corporation quickly lost 50 percent of its orders as customers opted for cheaper suppliers  Within weeks  the firm had to lay off 60 workers  Up to 200 more might lose their jobs by the end of this month 

All over the country  companies are going to be forced to either raise prices  fire workers or move production facilities out of the United States 
Meanwhile  farmers all over America are facing a different problem  Thanks to a massive decline in demand from China  thanks to tariffs that they have hit us with   prices are plummeting and warehouses are filling up with food that doesn t have anywhere to go 
Every year  the U S  usually imports about 14 billion dollars worth of soybeans to China  and I covered the plight of soybean farmers in a previous article  But of course soybean farmers are far from alone  It is being reported that more than 2 5 billion pounds of meat and poultry products that has been produced by our farmers is being stockpiled in cold storage warehouses  To help the agricultural community  President Trump announced 12 billion dollars in aid to farmers on Tuesday 

As President Donald Trump embarks on a multistate tour through parts of the country hit heavily by trade battles  his administration said Tuesday it will direct  12 billion to farmers whose harvests have been hurt by tariffs 
But the idea faced immediate criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill 
Responding to farm groups and the Republican discontent  administration officials said they have been working since April on a short term plan to shore up slipping prices for soybeans  pork and other crops hit with retaliatory tariffs from China 

Sure  this will help farmers get through the trade war in the short term  but isn t this exactly the kind of big government socialism that we are always railing against 
And who is going to bail out the real estate industry 
CNBC is reporting that home sales fell a whopping 11 8 percent year over year in southern California last month 

Southern California home sales hit the brakes in June  falling to the lowest reading for the month in four years  Sales of both new and existing houses and condominiums dropped 11 8 percent year over year  as prices shot up to a record high  according to CoreLogic  The report covers Los Angeles  Riverside  San Diego  Ventura  San Bernardino and Orange counties 

And do you know who has been fueling the extremely hot real estate market on the west coast 
The Chinese 
At one time they were buying up everything in sight  but now they have become net sellers of U S  real estate 
And there are rumblings that we could soon see some sort of  national boycott  of American goods in China  The following comes from Zero Hedge 

The survey found that 54 percent of 2 000 respondents in 300 cities across China would  probably  or  definitely  stop buying US branded goods  in the event of a trade war   Just 13 percent said they would not 
The remaining 33 percent said they were unsure or did not at present buy US branded goods  according to the survey  conducted for FT Confidential Research  FTCR   a research unit at the Financial Times 
The survey was carried out between June 27 and July 10  mostly before the US imposed 25 percent tariffs on  34bn of Chinese goods on July 6  The move elicited an immediate tit for tat response from Beijing 

Of course something similar could be tried in the United States  but most Americans simply do not care if a product comes from China or not  They are simply going to buy the cheapest stuff no matter what anyone tells them to do 
Look  I very much understand that we have been sending businesses and jobs overseas for a very long time  I have been writing about this for years  and something had to be done 
But trying to fight trade wars with virtually everyone else on the planet simultaneously is madness  and the consequences for the U S  economy are going to cause all of us an immense amount of pain ",2018-07-25,Michael T.

123064,344579,WHR,Reading The Fed Tea Leaves Is Futile,opinion,"Reading the tea leaves is getting tougher under Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  Its assessment of the balance of risks between unemployment and inflation offer little guidance about the forces that will be acting on policy makers this fall and beyond 
The impulse from lower taxes on consumer spending and gross domestic product growth could peter out next year  Or as supply siders in the White House predict  a lower cost of capital could set off a permanently accelerated pace of capital formation and GDP growth 
The outlook for inflation has never been more uncertain  And we have a chairman who is a lawyer with little rigorous training in economics a tinker in a land of physicists 
The unemployment inflation tradeoff has become unglued from the Phillips curve  and it s important to bear in mind what this means  To dilettantes  the hypothesized inverse association between rates of inflation and unemployment is an empirical relationship that tells us too much economic activity causes prices to rise 
More fundamentally  it s about the elasticity of the supply of labor  and the latter appears to be very close to zero these days  As headline unemployment falls  the pace of real wage gains hardly seems to budge  because the adult labor force participation rate remains woefully low 
Hence the headline unemployment rate  the U3  is not the relevant measure of slack in the labor market  The appropriate metric would include the  unemployed  counted in U3 plus those adults on the sidelines not currently looking for work but who could be inspired by higher wages to give up welfare benefits   a very difficult number to estimate 
Also  overseas workers and international labor arbitrage are increasingly important  and a stronger dollar BUXX   0 13  could easily erase the effects of many Trump tariffs 
For other reasons  the ultimate effects of tariffs on prices of many goods may not sort as initially anticipated  For example  the management at Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   0 20  is blaming the steel tariffs for declining profits   even with a recently imposed protective tariff on washing machines but LG  KS 066570  is expanding capacity 
The Korean company appears to understand the lesson of Bush era steel tariffs   the initial steel price spike should subside to about half as mothballed and new capacity come on line  Then LG  KS 066570    1 05    with a superior product  can undercut Whirlpool by producing here and prices should fall 
When asked about the juxtaposition of the 4 5  Fed estimate of the non inflationary rate of unemployment and the observed U3 at about 4   Powell attributed the absence of an inflationary surge mostly to market expectations 
Geez that sounds like the stuff we got on Louis Rukeyser s  Wall Street Week  
Over the next several months  the financial editors will continue to give space to stories making alarmist comparisons between monthly consumer prices this year and last  However  remember oil and gas prices fluctuate a lot  and those were depressed last year  The fact is core CPI inflation is very tame over the last three months the annualized monthly change averaged just 1 8  
Sorting all the competing forces on inflation in the oil market  sanctions on Iran and state entropy in Venezuela vs  booming Saudi Arabian and U S shale production  and the supply chain consequences of tariffs vs  a stronger dollar   it s very tough for the trained macroeconomists who advise Chairman Powell to tell him what he should tell us about the outlook 
Those macroeconomists tend to view folks who specialize in industry economics as the intellectually less fortunate who should to be banished from prestige positions at the Fed to the bowels of the Commerce Department  And Powell  unlike his predecessors  spends a lot of his energy on Capitol Hill massaging the expectations of politicians who could become his critics if he stumbles 
The chairman is like the history professor pressed into service to teach a 20th century American novel class by an unforeseen absence in the English Department  He may remember Booth Tarkington wrote  The Magnificent Ambersons    I bet Powell even has his very own copy of Keynes s  General Theory   but he relies on Masterplots or the yellowed lecture notes of an overworked colleague to get through the semester 
With all this going on  looking to Fed statements for the outlook about inflation and interest rates six months from now is like reading the Las Vegas betting line for the 2019 Super Bowl Champion in January

about 0 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Whirlpool Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WHR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Whirlpool Corporation is just 0 9  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 2  which is slightly better than the industry average of 8 8  Clearly  WHR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Whirlpool Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives WHR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Whirlpool Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWhirlpool Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 26  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 Zacks has just released a

123094,344609,WHR,Trump Plays With Fire On Trade ,opinion,"With his announcement last week of broad tariffs on imported steel and aluminum  President Trump launched what could be the first salvo of an all out global trade war  Seemingly itching for a fight  he gleefully tweeted that  Trade wars are good  and easy to win   It seems like Trump thinks the conflict will play out much like Ronald Reagan s 1983 week long invasion of Grenada rather than the more telling quagmires that unfolded in Vietnam  Afghanistan and Iraq  He s wrong 
Apart from overestimating America s bargaining position  Trump and his supporters grossly misunderstand the nature of international trade and how Americans have benefited from a system that has allowed us to continually consume foreign goods on credit  While this  benefit  has also placed a cost on domestic industries  I don t believe that Trump has any idea how a trade war can reduce current American living standards 
As justification for his surprise offensive  Trump likes to highlight how America s gargantuan annual trade deficit  which has grown to more than  600 billion during his presidency  is simply the yardstick by which  stupid  American trade policies are subsidizing foreign economies  In his mind tariffs are just a means to take back what we have foolishly given away  As Trump explained via Twitter   When we are down  100 billion with a certain country and they get cute  don t trade anymore   we win big   But does a country with a trade deficit really subsidize the country with the surplus  Or is it the other way around 
Let s suppose you keep chickens at home  and your neighbor has a cow  Everyday you trade a half dozen eggs for a quart of milk  This is the nature of trade  You offer something that you have in abundance  that other people don t  for something that someone else has in abundance  that you don t   But let s suppose you eat a few of your chickens and your egg production drops to four per day  You continue to get your quart of milk  but everyday your neighbor adds two eggs to the account that you owe  Theoretically  you will one day owe your neighbor a whole bunch of eggs  But  in the meantime  does that two egg deficit represent a benefit to you or your neighbor  Remember your neighbor still has to deliver the same amount of milk for less of a current payoff  He MAY get that deferred compensation down the road  but he s not getting it now  And with every egg you go into the hole  the greater the chances that your neighbor may ultimately get stiffed 
Who is likely to be worse off if this trade were to suddenly stop  Remember  you are not the only potential trading partner available to your neighbor  Maybe the house across the street will give him six eggs for his milk 
The eggs milk deficit that you have with your neighbor allows you to consume more than your production capacity would typically allow  While this is a definite benefit to you now  it does dissuade you from making the sacrifices necessary to increase your egg production  Your own industry atrophies while your neighbor s doesn t  But so what  You still get all the milk you need 
The point of an economy is to maximize consumption  Since goods cannot be consumed that have not been produced  it goes without saying that production is a necessary precondition to consuming  But  if given the choice  most people would be happy to outsource the production to someone else and concentrate solely on the consumption  But in the real world such an arrangement is untenable over the long term 
Of course your milk eggs trade arrangement will be a problem if your neighbor cuts off your credit and demands full payment  Then you are stuck with a big debt  reduced egg production  and no milk  But  for America  that day has yet to come  For now  our trading partners are happy to take our debt rather than our goods  But if Trump starts making more unreasonable demands  they may not be so willing 
It s helpful to remember that a tariff is essentially a tax that will be paid by domestic consumers  It s not like American producers will keep prices where they are and simply manufacture more steel to make up for the lost imports  Instead  prices will likely rise to almost the same level as the taxed imported products  Profits at American steel companies will increase  but production probably won t 
The manufacturers will know that the artificial political barrier protecting them could be removed at any time  Will they take the risk in investing in plant and equipment capacity when they know that removal of the tariffs would instantly eliminate their advantages and expose them to losses  Given the thin support that such tariffs will have beyond the narrow steel industry  it s safe to assume that current manufacturers will stand pat and use the extra profits to issue dividends and buy back shares  To a lesser extent  they may increase wages for the nation s 140 000 steel workers  But this industry specific benefit will come at a great cost to the overall economy 
Raising the cost of steel would also raise the cost of every American product manufactured with steel  Right now the discussion is focused on beer cans  with people arguing about how many cents per soup can the tariffs will add  But this is just the tip of the iceberg  The real impact will be seen for metal intensive items that are manufactured both here and abroad 
While the Trump tariffs will directly raise the price of imported steel  and indirectly the price of domestic steel   it does nothing about the price of goods made FROM steel  So a domestic manufacturer of home appliances  such as Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   will have to pay more for steel used to make a refrigerator  But its foreign competitors will be able make refrigerators with untaxed steel and then ship the finished product to the U S  without facing a tariff  This will give the foreign firm a competitive advantage over Whirlpool both at home and abroad  Whirlpool will shed profits and may shed workers  So whatever advantages are given to steel manufacturers will be paid for by companies and workers that use steel  The problem for Trump is that there are only 140 000 domestic workers in the steel making industry  but more than six million workers in industries that make stuff FROM steel   American Iron   Steel Institute 
Trump s gambit is also politically ham fisted  He likes to say that his tariffs are aimed at bad actors like China  But that country is far down the list of steel exporters to America  The move really hits our close allies first  particularly Canada  a country that accounts for 16  of our steel imports  according to a December 2017 report from the Dept  of Commerce  But 50  of U S  steel exports GO to Canada  Total cross border trade between the U S  and Canada in 2016 came in at more than  600 billion annually  according to the Office of the U S  Trade Representative  That s a very big applecart to push over for a comparatively small gain 
Potentially even more dangerous is the way the tariffs will be implemented  By absurdly claiming that they are being done in the interest of  national security  rather than economic advantage  the Trump administration is inviting embarrassing losses at the World Trade Organization  which combined with a rapidly deteriorating diplomatic environment could further isolate the U S economically 
The big problem is where it all ends  Already major voices in the European Union  particularly from Germany  have threatened retaliatory tariffs on politically and symbolically sensitive American exports like bourbon  blue jeans  and Harley Davidson motorcycles  Trump has threatened to tax European cars  if the EU follows through on those threats  Given the personalities involved  and the national pride at stake  it s not hard to see that this tit for tat could escalate quickly and lead to a full blown trade war on multiple fronts 
But this is not a war we can win  A decline in imports will force us to rely on our own production to meet all of our consumption  But we no longer make large categories of products that we consume  Even if we were to be able to ramp up production quickly  American consumers would be looking at much higher prices  With plenty of indications that inflation is already starting to percolate  now is not a time to go out looking for more 
But most concerning is the likelihood that a large decline in trade translates into a diminished international appetite for U S  dollars  With government borrowing about to surpass  1 trillion annually  even while the Federal Reserve itself is set to begin selling more than  600 billion annually in Treasury bonds  we will need to find lots of buyers for U S  dollars for years to come  If a trade war discourages those buyers  the dollar will fall and interest rates will rise even faster  But it could get much worse than that  If a recession forces the Federal Reserve into another round of quantitative easing  we will desperately need foreigners to show up at our bond auctions  If they don t we will lose the ability to export our inflation  and all the excess liquidity will remain at home  where it will push up prices on the limited domestic supply of goods and services  This means even higher prices for American consumers  many of which will also be unemployed  The combination of rising unemployment and inflation will be bad politics for Trump  as it will allow democrats to use the  misery index  to defeat him in 2020 much as Ronald Reagan used it to defeat one term Democratic Jimmy Carter forty years earlier 
Let s hope that Trump s bluster on trade is just a negotiating tactic  Maybe he s crazy like a fox  and his threats will produce a favorable outcome for the U S  But given his international unpopularity  and how quickly world leaders have mobilized for war  I wouldn t count on it  More likely his blunders on trade will simply move our day of economic reckoning that much closer ",2018-03-08,Peter Schiff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trump-plays-with-fire-on-trade-200296481,200296481
123095,344610,WHR,Stock Market s Unseen Bullish Breakout Awaiting Confirmation,opinion,"AT40   55 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   46 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   16 6Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary The buyers went right back to work after bears engulfed the end of trading last week The indices crept higher on the day toward critical resistance at their 50 day moving averages  DMAs   Even more important to me was the performance of my favorite technical indicator  AT40  T2108  aka the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs 
For the first time in 23 trading days  AT40 closed above 50   AT40 is at its highest close since January 30th which means that once again it is on the edge of overcoming all the angst of the big sell off that led to persistent oversold conditions in February  This breakout is unseen to most market participants  but I am sitting up straight and taking notes 
AT40  T2108  broke out and continued its pattern of higher highs and higher lows 
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 0 8  after fading a bit from 50DMA resistance  The good news is that the index is actually managing an upward bias since its last test of 200DMA support  The NASDAQ gapped up right to 50DMA resistance on Friday  On Monday  the NASDAQ gapped up again but stopped cold again right under 50DMA resistance with a 0 7  gain  The price action for the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  was similar to the NASDAQ but a test of 50DMA resistance has yet to quite occur 
The S P 500  SPY  is facing down a critical test of 50DMA resistance 


The NASDAQ is facing its own test of 50DMA resistance 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  is also trying to end the churn with an upward push toward 50DMA resistance 
Given the upward bias growing in the major indices  I should not be surprised to see the volatility index  the VIX  continue to implode  Yet on Friday I locked in profits on my iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  NYSE VXX  short and bought call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  in anticipation of more market chop along with a VIX rebound  The VIX rebound may still happen this week given it is well over extended below its lower Bollinger Band  BB   The chart below shows a cautionary tale of what happened when the VIX last extended this far below its lower BB  in March  

The volatility index  the VIX  extended its losing streak to 5 straight days   its longest losing streak in over a month 
The market has experienced 2 1 2 months of selling and churn  The exhaustion of one side or the other appears near and the sellers are looking more tired right now  AT40 is leading the way to a buyer s breakout  Still  if the major indices cannot do their part in breaking 50DMA resistance and confirming the AT40 breakout  then the churn will start all over again  The VIX will spike higher  and I will quickly re establish a VXX short    Under the setback scenario  at least buyers can lean on the growing pattern of higher highs and higher lows  Needless to say my short term trading call stays firmly locked on neutral 
CHART REVIEWS
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  With bullish tidings bubbling up  I can look at a chart like WHR and see a firming bottom  On April 4th  Goldman Sachs downgraded WHR to a sell  The stock promptly gapped down but buyers took over from there  A 2 8  loss at the open turned into a slight gain by the close   the trading looked like a final washout of sellers  Sellers regained control one more time and challenged the intraday low two and three days later  On Monday  WHR gained 3 4  and closed at a fresh post downgrade high 
WHR reports earnings next Monday on the morning of the 23rd  so there are high risks holding onto a new position through earnings  However  a rally into earnings looks underway  If WHR can survive this earnings announcement by holding its recent low  it will make a very good buy  The easy stop loss is at a new low  and may even be the signal that sellers have finally established firm control on the stock 

Whirlpool  WHR  is slowly but surely shaking off the burden of bears  The stock closed above its declining 20DMA for the first time in 2 months

take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Whirlpool Q3 Earnings   Sales Miss  Cuts ViewWhirlpool reported third quarter 2017 results  wherein both earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The quarter marked the company s fifth consecutive negative earnings surprise and second straight sales miss  Additionally  management cut earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher raw material inflation and unfavorable price mix Q3 HighlightsWhirlpool s quarterly adjusted earnings per share came in at  3 83 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 90   However  it increased 4 7  year over year On a GAAP basis  the company s earnings grew 20  to  3 72 per share from  3 10 earned in the prior year quarter  The

six months  Shares of the company grew 10 2  while the sector depicted a growth of 1 9  Let s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been impacting Whirlpool s performance Factors Aiding Growth Much of Whirlpool s growth in the past is attributable to its innovation strategy  which forms the core of its business model  The company invests heavily in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers  Evidently  the company has inked a deal with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   to introduce voice controlled home appliances  Additionally  the company is keen on boosting revenues of its core appliance business through expansions and investments  This should aid in fuelling growth of its high margin categories Further  the company remains on track to deliver on its long term goals for 2020  backed by its brand strength and product portfolio  The company aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  every year  Further  the company anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix  This  in turn encouraged management to target its EBIT margin to exceed 10  by 2020  Further  the company envisions earnings per share to grow by 10 15  each year  Also  Whirlpool anticipates free cash flow generation of 5 6  of revenues by 2018  While the company lowered earnings outlook for 2017  other operating guidance remains in line with management s long term targets The company is also striving to improve its margins through a series of measures  including cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives focused on improving business efficiency  In the first quarter 2017  Whirlpool s ongoing cost productivity along with cost reduction and capacity reduction initiatives remained on track  offset by higher raw material inflation and unfavorable currency  Backed by improved cost productivity and unit volume growth the company expanded margins by over 70 basis points in the quarter  Further  the company anticipates delivering full year 2017 margins in the range of 11 5 12   at or above industry levels Not only this  Whirlpool follows a balanced capital allocation approach that focuses on making appropriate capital allocations to fund its capital needs as well as return value to shareholders  The recent 10  dividend hike highlights the company s financial strength and focus on shareholders Waning Bottom Line Poses ConcernDriven by raw material inflation and temporary integration challenges in Europe  Whirlpool s first quarter 2017 earnings lagged estimates for the third consecutive quarter and dipped year over year  Integration related challenges also led the company to trim its earnings forecasts for 2017 Given the pros and cons  Whirlpool currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Bottom Line Whirlpools  cost containment efforts are quite noteworthy and have been yielding significant results  We believe that Whirlpool s long term targets  coupled with its strong brand portfolio will further improve its performance  However  we prefer to wait and watch if these efforts can help the company sustain its momentum Moreover  Whirlpool s long term earnings growth rate of 15 9  makes us confident of its inherent strength  Estimates for second quarter and fiscal 2017 have been stable at  3 57 and  15 08  respectively  in the past 30 days Key PicksInvestors may

123188,344703,WHR,Positioning Your Portfolio Ahead of Trump s Trade Tariffs,opinion,"Free trade agreements keep the world competitive 
A level playing field increases economic growth  That s a big reason why more and more countries have entered into these kinds of deals  as shown in today s chart 
But the soon to be new leadership might threaten this trend  Trump wants to place tariffs on foreign made goods  He s even called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever approved 
With Inauguration Day getting closer  it s important to prepare your portfolio 
Now  there s no doubt that Trump s tariffs will keep jobs here  But they ll also put pressure on U S  companies that manufacture abroad  And global companies will struggle even more if the tariffs spark trade wars 
That s why we re turning to companies that produce the majority of their goods in the U S  They ll continue operating unscathed  And they might even become more competitive   After all  companies that outsource will need to raise their prices to cover the new tariff costs  
Finding U S  manufacturers that produce the majority of their goods in America is no easy task  But we ve managed to uncover two great American stocks that fit the bill   
Two Made in America Stocks
The first made in America company is Whirlpool  NYSE  NYSE WHR   Whirlpool is a leading producer of home appliances  Some of its brands include Maytag  Amana  Jenn Air and KitchenAid 
Whirlpool has said about 80  of its appliances sold in the U S  are made here  That s a huge portion compared to its competitors 
It is worth noting that Whirlpool does generate a large portion of sales overseas  But the company has stayed committed to producing its U S  sold goods in America  New tariffs shouldn t impact Whirlpool as much as its competitors 
Our second company is even larger than Whirlpool  but it s less of a household name 
Nucor  NYSE  NYSE NUE  operates and sells steel products in North America  It builds reinforcing steel for cement and other materials  The business sells steel mesh  grating  fasteners and many other products 
Nucor is a U S  company that will benefit if Trump s trade deals come to fruition  The talk of increased infrastructure spending is also a plus 
These two companies should prosper under the new regime  Ending or changing the free trade agreement will benefit made in America companies in the short term 
So take a look at your portfolio today  How vulnerable are your holdings to Trump s trade tariffs ",2016-12-25,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/positioning-your-portfolio-ahead-of-trump’s-trade-tariffs-200170765,200170765
123205,344720,WHR,Word On Wall Street  Costco Comps Expected To Accelerate In 2H17,opinion,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  has largely traded sideways over the last year after a 92  run between April 2012 and December 2015  The stock s upward trajectory slowed as the company s core comps began to slow amid increasing food deflation  the removal of tobacco products  and an increasingly competitive retail environment  Today  the key question revolves around where  will move from here   will they return to COST s historical mid single digit growth  or will they continue to remain pressured as competitors increasingly encroach on their territory

Bulls believe Costco comps will return to mid single digits

Source  Company filings  brokerage estimates
Near term tailwinds
Bulls primarily believe that  in the near term  comps will return to its mid single digit history  driven largely by several tailwinds 
Removal of tobacco headwind
Costco began slowly removing tobacco products from its stores over the last several years  Tobacco products are low margin  labor intensive  and are often the target of thefts  Around this time last year  Costco noted that tobacco was running in the negative double digits  which likely pressured overall company comps meaningfully  by perhaps 1 2   last year  Going forward  the headwind is expected to ease  which should help comps 
Food deflation easing
Like the tobacco headwind  Costco comps have been negatively impacted for the last several quarters by food deflation  However  management expects these headwinds to ease as they enter the summer of 2017  CPI data suggests that already the headwinds are easing  as food deflation has become less negative over the last four months  Many other retailers have echoed this sentiment as well and expect inflation in 2H17 
Credit card change
Costco switched over to a Citi Visa credit card  from their previous American Express  NYSE AXP  card  in mid 2016 and expects this to provide a benefit to comps and to margins  The card is expected to drive additional sales due to better cash back rewards  Additionally  margin should benefit as Costco pays less to Visa than to American Express  In F1Q17  Costco s first full quarter with the credit card change  the company saw a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin expansion from the card 
Membership price increase
Effective June 1st  Costco will be raising the price of a basic membership from  55 to  60  Costco s executive memberships will increase from  110 to  120  While some investors are fearful that such an increase could hurt renewal rates  see bearish segment later in the article   bulls believe renewal rates will not be hurt too significantly  37  of users  and 65  of revenue  is tied to Costco s loyal executive members 
The increase is expected to benefit EPS by  0 30  0 40 on an annualized basis  but will be spread out over the course of  2 years as members gradually renew   and are now largely baked into estimates as management has noted plans for some time now 
Easing comparisons
Comp  will ease for Costco in both 3Q and 4Q  Last year  comps were flat in 3Q and 4Q when including gas and FX  Excluding gas and FX  comps decelerated from 6  and 5  in 1Q and 2Q to 3  in 3Q and 4Q  This year  Costco should get some benefit as they grow off of a lower base 

Source  Company filings

Costco reported March monthly sales that showed improvement
On Wednesday night  Costco also reported March monthly sales that showed that comp trends are improving as bulls hoped  The company reported a March comp of 6  including gas and FX  and 5  excluding gas and FX  As of right now  the stock is up 2  in response to the positive report 

Source  Company filings
There were several moving pieces from the report 
March sales were positively impacted by one more selling day than the previous March period due to the Easter shift this year from March to April  Easter is on April 16 this year vs  March 27 last year  Costco closes on Easter  so a month without Easter will be getting a benefit from the prior year s month with Easter  Management noted that the Easter shift helped comps by 1 1 5   Even accounting for the shift  March comps were better than expected  Note that April comps are expected to be lower by the Street due to the Easter shift 
Management noted that weather negatively impacted total comps by 0 5  
Average transaction was  2 5   which includes a negative impact of  0 5  from FX and a positive impact of  1 5  from gas   Importantly  comp traffic was  3 75   suggesting that traffic trends are improving 

Longer term tailwinds
Longer term  bulls see a number of favorable business characteristics that will allow them to sustain mid single digit comps over the next several years  These factors should support Costco s high valuation as well given the more stable profile for earnings 
International growth
Costco s international growth opportunity is often cited as justification for the company s multiple and higher earnings expectations  The company currently owns 728 warehouses  with 508 in the US and 220 internationally  94 of which are in Canada  
Going forward  investors believe that the company will open more international stores with roughly half of the 29 planned store openings in 2017 going towards international openings  and potentially growing over time
In addition to the obvious sales benefits  international stores are also expected to contribute to margin expansion as international stores have higher margins than US stores  International stores have higher margins due to less competition and a lower mix of gas sales  which have low margins  
While the margin expansion is not expected to be very meaningful in the short term  it could grow over time as international stores make up a larger part of the company s new store openings

Note  I thought I d try out different colors  Let me know if this makes you want to throw up 
Protective moat from online
Costco is seen as a company that is more insulated from the online threat than other retailers for several reasons 
The company s business model is to offer low product prices and an additional bulk product discount  The company saves in other areas that other stores might not traditionally receive savings in  including real estate  as the  stores  are warehouses   advertising  almost no advertising spend  relying on word of mouth and local community outreach   limited SKU assortments  and bulk purchasing  As a result  while gross margins are lower than other stores  operating margins are more in line with competitors  Additionally  the company sells at a higher turnover than other competitors since they sell in higher volumes  As a result of this business model  Costco s prices are very competitive against other retailers  including Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  s  In fact  several price studies conducted by banks have suggested that their prices are lower on key items 
As a result of the lower prices and unique store format  Costco has a highly loyal customer base with above average incomes  Their membership has had historically high renewal rates at roughly 90   The company is often seen positively by the local community as well  as the company pays its employees generously 
Finally   57  of sales are in food related categories  which online has not historically penetrated very deeply 
As a result  investors believe Costco is better insulated from the online threat than other retailers that offer similar products  However  Costco admits that online is still a threat  and they are making efforts to grow their online site and presence  Currently  roughly 4  of sales come from the online channel  and management plans to continue to invest in this channel 
The appliance category presents another opportunity for growth
Costco is adding appliance brands Samsung  KS 005930   LG  and Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  to stores  While the category is in its nascent stages  management believes there is an opportunity to grow the category and potentially become a major player over time  The biggest competitors here include Sears  which has been bleeding share for many years now   Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY   Home Depot  NYSE HD   and Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW  
If the category can grow meaningfully in size  appliances could add as much as half a point to comps

Multiple is justified by stability of business and visibility of earnings growth
There has been some discussion on Costco s high multiple compared to other retailers  as it trades in the high 20s on a PE NTM basis despite low earnings growth  Bulls would largely point to the company s unique business model which provides further insulation than other retailers from competition  and therefore more stability and predictability in their outlook  After flat earnings growth in 2016  consensus estimates show that bulls believe the factors mentioned above will drive earnings to 9  growth in 2017 and 14  growth in 2018

Bears see increasingly competitive environment
Bears believe mid single digit growth  while perhaps achievable in the short run  will likely not be sustainable going forward due to the following factors 
Growing competition
The slowdown in comps over the last two years was largely attributed to cyclical factors and one time headwinds  However  the bear case is that competition has also eaten away at Costco s traffic trends  and as a result  trends may not return to mid single digits 
Competition continues to mount for Costco  Walmart  NYSE WMT  continues to make investments in fresh food  Sam s Club s sales are improving as well  as comps have now improved sequentially for the last four quarters  The company is increasing its tobacco offerings in response to Costco lowering exposure to the category  and is getting more aggressive with price investments as well

Additionally  other types of retailers are becoming aggressive as well  Hard discounters are entering the space  i e  Aldi  Lidl   Specialty players like Whole Foods remain focused on organic  and while their results suggest they have lost share to Costco  they remain committed to recapturing their share 
Can online players penetrate the food category 
As is now common among retailers  Costco faces the question of just how insulated they are from the online threat  We ve seen this play out in all areas of retail  even the areas that were once thought untouchable by the online players such as mattress players  competition from Casper  and  
While bulls might claim that Costco has a price advantage and a treasure hunt experience that can t be replicated  consumer surveys suggest that consumers view Amazon to be just as competitive on price as Costco 
Additionally  although online has yet to penetrate the food space   the space  and many people believe it will only be a matter of time until they are successful 
Furthermore  while 57  of their sales have yet to be fully impacted  43  is still open to online  including areas with high online penetration such as consumer electronics 
Finally  bears have noted that Costco s higher end customer base makes them particularly susceptible to online players  given their propensity to shop there 
Member price increases could hurt renewal rates
As noted above  bulls point to Costco s historically high renewal rates as evidence of Costco s loyal customer base  and the high likelihood that customers will renew after the price increase goes into effect 
However  bears believe that the competitive environment has drastically changed  and that other memberships such as Amazon Prime deliver just as much value  if not more  with streaming videos and other services  Customers may decide on just one membership  and they could choose other competitors   Also note that Costco s renewal rates have historically been negatively impacted during price increases in the past 
Margin flow through may not be high due to competition
As noted above  bulls believe that card benefits and member price increases could both drive higher margins  However  given the competitive environment  there is a risk that management will choose to reinvest those savings back into lower prices  and therefore would not see the margin benefits that investors might be expecting  So long as traffic and comps hold up  this may not be an issue  But if they begin to deteriorate  management may choose to give up margin expansion to remain competitive with the other players 
Comps a key factor moving forward
Ultimately comps will be a major factor of where the stock moves from here  If the company is able to generate mid single digit comps as its unique model separates itself from the pack  the stock will likely move higher  However  if comps struggle to stay there as consumers flock to other memberships  Costco will likely face sales struggles  margin pressure  and multiple contraction  Given where valuation and consensus estimates are  most investors are betting on the former scenario ",2017-04-07,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/word-on-wall-street:-costco-comps-expected-to-accelerate-in-2h17-200181601,200181601

Commentary

It was hard to guess how low would be low enough  but the stock market got to that point where the sellers completely exhausted their power of persuasion  In the last T2108 Update I outlined my expectations and conditions for a bounce  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   dropped as low as 31 2  before buyers rushed into the vacuum left behind by the sellers 
As a reminder  when the market is in a bullish mood  T2108 around 30  has proven close enough to oversold to spark the next rally  Such was the case after Brexit  and buyers are clearly looking for a repeat performance here 
T2108 stretched downward as far as it could go  Will T2108 rush back to its earlier downtrend 
The volatility index  the VIX  had an even more dramatic day  The highs surprised me more than the lows given how the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   was already so extended  At its high of the day  the VIX gained 17  from Friday s close 
That stretch alone had reversal written all over it  After the dust settled  the implosion of volatility was near complete  The VIX managed to close below the important 15 35 pivot point and may have signaled a very rapid return to the zone of complacency that dominated trading for the last two months Volatility implodes in spectacular fashion 
The only solace the bears could find on the day was the failure of the S P 500  SPY  to punch through resistance at its 50DMA  The buyers ran out of runway and settled for a 1 5  gain on the day The S P 500  SPY  surges from its lows as the rubber band stretches too far below the lower Bollinger Band  BB   Is a hurdle over 50DMA resistance coming next 
The technicals alone can explain the drama of the day  Yet  the story is much better with the fundamental backdrop of yet more Fedspeak  On Friday  the market panicked about the prospect of imminent rate hikes  In my last post  I explained the source of Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren s optimism that ironically caused the market so much fear 
Monday  the market heaved a sigh of relief because two more FedHeads spoke and failed to lend support to Rosengren s thesis of getting on with the business of rate hikes  Yet  after it was all said and done  expectations for the next Fed rate hike stayed in December  In fact  at 55 4  the odds are HIGHER than they were before Rosengren spooked the market After all the circus  financial markets are sticking with the December rate hike scenario 
The Fedspeak circus is getting oh so tiring  but we have to put up with it  The Federal Reserve as a group remains scared to death that too much action could cause a calamity 
FedHeads are juggling competing data points  They are jumping through hoops of fire previously unseen  They are watching in trepidation and unease as financial markets fly high on the trapeze  They are reluctantly walking a tightrope of monetary policy unsure of the resiliency to volatility 
The clowns are trying to get serious but cannot help scurrying about as the Fed twists and turns  alk down the economy  Celebrate  Talk up the economy  Panic The ups and downs of the stock market 
So what generated the oohs and aahs from the financial crowd this time 
  In an essay titled     Kashkari was about as far away as he could get from talking about an economy in need of rate hikes  He chose to focus on diagnosis and solutions for fixing a slow growth economy  This essay was released well before U S  markets opened and fertilized the ground for the next catalyst 
  In a speech titled  The New Normal  and What It Means for Monetary Policy   Brainard distinctly pushed back on imminent rate hikes  In her conclusion  Brainard observed that 

 In today s new normal  the costs to the economy of greater than expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness This asymmetry in risk management in today s new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation  I believe this approach has served us well in recent months  helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation  

These are certainly not the words of a FedHead ready to preside over rate hikes  The market took the ball from there and ran with it 
The performance of the bulls was impressive enough to encourage me to shift back down to a neutral short term trading call  If the VIX had not opened at such a high level  I would be a lot more comfortable staying cautiously bearish and even looking for the potential of a fade of the S P 500 at 50DMA resistance 
Instead  the current setup has all the looks of another big shake out of sellers  As such  just like the post Brexit melt up  it will not take much more motivation to send the S P 500 into orbit from current levels 
My trades on Monday once again reflect my mixed approach  1  I quickly covered my latest short on BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP   2  I flipped call options on Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   3  I bought more call options on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   4  and I even bought call options on ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY    albeit very late in the game 
Most importantly  after I noticed iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  lagging the rally  I jumped back into call options  I will review this position in my Housing Market Review for September 
While I did not take on any new bearish positions  I DID fail to close out existing bearish positions like my SDS shares and my shares in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   married to a short call   With a bit of hindsight  I think I was not aggressive enough in closing out existing bearish positions  and yes  I am having post Brexit flashbacks   
Finally  my last T2108 Update provided a large sampling of charts outlining short and long opportunities  Those still stand  Just a few key updates on three of the charts  
Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  soared 5 7  on the day to reach the top of the trading range with a quickness  I certainly regret selling those call options 
I am surprised the precious metals did not perform better  Neither SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  nor iShares Silver  NYSE SLV  posted gains even as the U S  dollar index closed slightly down 
Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  started the day with a complete reversal of the stock s last big jump 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  started the day with an open below 200DMA support but rallied to a 1 9  gain

Commentary The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   ended the week about the same place where it ended the previous week  The index even ended the month of September almost exactly where it ended the previous month of August  In between both bookends the S P 500 experienced major churn and the occasional bout of heartburn  The Federal Reserve and FedSpeak was a dominant theme that in the final week took a  temporary  backseat to the screaming headlines about the troubles at Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   DB  
The S P 500 bounced back from three bouts of quick and sharp selling to close out the month flat  The 50 day moving average  DMA  is now holding as key resistance 
Note in the chart above how the 50DMA is currently holding as approximate resistance  While the S P 500 struggles to recapture former glory  the tech laden NASDAQ  QQQ  managed to notch new all time highs  The 50DMA for the NASDAQ has a definitive uptrend that is guiding the index ever higher and providing support  The NASDAQ gained a whopping 9 7  in the third quarter  The S P 500  only  managed a 3 3  gain over that same period  Either way  the post Brexit trading action demonstrated the power of violently shaking motivated sellers out of the market 
The NASDAQ  QQQ  is leaving the troubles behind 
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs  bounced right along with the stock market  T2108 s action confirms the message of the S P 500 and fails to confirm the message of the NASDAQ  At its low point in the current cycle  T2108 closed marginally lower than its post Brexit low  levels not seen since the heartburn of February  Just as with the post Brexit episode  the 20s proved  close enough  to oversold to fuel the next bounce  The churning seas since that bounce have sent T2108 soaring and plunging on alternating days  T2108 closed the month at a very neutral 50 1  
The volatility index  the VIX  experienced its own violent swings in September  Each spike higher was a fresh chance to fade volatility  This strategy dominated my thinking and trading through the month  As usual  the 15 35 pivot strongly defined the VIX s action  Ever since the Fed helped shove the VIX off its last spike higher  the VIX has failed to close above the pivot  The VIX closed the month at 13 3  just above its  launching pad  of around 12  a level that the VIX tends to reject eventually 
A wild month for the volatility index  the VIX 
The dollar index  DXY0  experienced its own churn in September  The index s 50 and 200DMAs have tightly capped the trading action  A breakout down from the current congestion could launch a major move in the dollar 
The U S  dollar index had its moments in September but overall its volatility paled in comparison to the churn found in stocks  On net the dollar logged a minor loss for September and for the third quarter 
As we leave behind a month and a quarter of major churn  it is natural to expect more of the same in the coming quarter given the big looming events of the U S  Presidential election and a likely rate hike from the Fed in December  My bias still leans toward fading volatility when spikes coincide with screaming headlines  I am keeping a base number of shares in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  that serve as the starting point for selling calls and buying puts 
Deutsche Bank  DB  is a fascinating case of what can happen in an over crowded trade  especially on the bearish side  The chart below was posted on StockTwits on September 29  2016  and it should tell you everything you need to know about the powderkeg sitting underneath DB shares 
The bears are bumrushing Deutsche Bank  DB  
The current surge in open interest for put options is eye popping  So no surprise that when a little bit of good news came out on Friday about DB the stock soared 14 0  
Deutsche Bank rallies sharply off its all time low  Yet  is this surge enough to launch DB out of the deathgrip of a major downtrend and bear raid 
I currently hold call options on DB  After seeing how crowded the bear trade is  I decided to hold onto the call options to see whether the contrarian relief bounce can continue for additional large gains  Based on the extreme in negative sentiment and the likelihood that Germany will be forced to bail out DB if necessary  I am not looking to join the bearish hoards to fade whatever rally ensues 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  has churned in a tight range since it broke down below 200DMA support two weeks ago  I made a bet that October will deliver a continuation downward 
Whirlpool  WHR  tries to stabilize after a 200DMA breakdown 
 I marveled at the ability of Cognizant Technology  CTSH  to bounce back from a poor earnings report  It was a time when it seemed buyers were automatically buying any dip for any reason in a swath of individual stocks  Turns out I should have stuck with the short side 
On Friday  traders slammed CTSH in the wake of  of an internal investigation and the abrupt resignation of the company s president  CTSH lost 13 3  on the day as buyers managed to pick the stock up over two points from the low of the day 
A mixed analyst response probably helps explain the ability of CTSH to lift off its lows  It will likely hold that low and churn until the news takes on more shape  Argus cut CTSH to hold  Citigroup  NYSE C  dropped CTSH to neutral  HSBC actually initiated CTSH with a buy although that rating may have come without knowledge of the CTSH revelations  Needham   Company kept its buy rating and  68 price target and probably best  

 Given the early stage and scarcity of detail on the payments investigation  it does not currently alter our forward looking view of the stock  but we will continue to monitor the situation  We attribute the fall in the stock today more to the investigation than the resignation itself  though investors may be concerned that the two events are related  

Cognizant Technology  CTSH  plunges   ironically after buyers attempted to take CTSH off the last lows  Note the 50DMA breakdown and follow through in early September that provided a bright red warning flag 
Two weeks ago I bought put options on Teucrium Corn ETF  CORN  as a play on 50DMA resistance  Even with a second test of resistance  the trade looked OK until Friday  CORN gapped down only to end the day with a 1 9  gain on high volume  This move formed a bullish engulfing pattern that is often the mark of a bottom  This bottom gets confirmed if CORN closes above  19 20 share which would clear a lot of resistance  For now  CORN is stuck at 50DMA resistance 
Teucrium Corn ETF  CORN  is struggling with 50DMA resistance but a high volume reversal may have finally fueled a a change in fortunes

Growth at a reasonable price  or GARP  is an effective investment strategy for investors interested in building up a portfolio that offers characteristics of both value and growth investing  Investors following GARP seek to acquire stocks that have solid growth prospects  but are available at discounted prices  Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio  which is using GARP investing  is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing rather than investing in both value and growth stocks 

GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics

Growth Metrics

Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  they choose stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 

Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flows get precedence in GARP investing 

Value Metrics 

GARP investing gives precedence to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style chooses stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  they avoid picking companies with extremely high P E ratios 

Moreover  price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered in GARP investing 

Using GARP principles  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer good returns in the near term

123331,344846,WHR,Beat Market With Top Ranked Value ETFs   Stocks,opinion,The U S  stock market is expected to see huge volatility and heavy trading this week given the referendum on U K  s membership in the European Union  EU  to be held on June 23  This is especially true as the weekend polls suggest that chances of Britain remaining in the European Union have increased An opinion poll by Survation for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday showed that 45  wanted to remain in EU and 42  are in favor of leaving  Another poll conducted by a YouGov Sunday Times revealed that chances of Britain exiting the EU has dropped from 46  to 43  while that of staying increased to 44  from 43   However  chances of Britain exiting the European bloc is still a concern for investors that could lead to worldwide economic instability and chaos in the stock markets  read      Additionally  uneven domestic growth  weak corporate earnings  Fed s policy uncertainty  sluggishness in emerging markets and global growth fears added to the worries  In fact  both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  IMF  have slashed their global growth forecast for the second time for this year  The World Bank now expects global growth of 2 4  versus 2 9  expected earlier due to sluggish growth in advanced economies  stubbornly low commodity prices  weak trade and diminishing capital flows while the IMF lowered the projection to 3 2  from 3 4  Amid these uncertainties  value investing appears safe and appealing to investors  The strategy includes stocks with strong fundamentals   earnings  dividends  book value and cash flow   that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market Why Value Investing Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news  resulting in share price movement that does not reflect the company s true long term fundamentals  This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price As a result  value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared to growth and blend counterparts  In fact  these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long term investment horizon and are less susceptible to trending markets  read    Given this  investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current volatile market environment  For them  we have presented four ETFs and stocks that have easily crushed the market from a year to date look and are likely to continue their outperformance in the days ahead ETF PicksUsing our database  we have selected value ETFs that provide exposure to the broad stock market instead of a particular sector and have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  with a decent level of AUM of above  50 million  This is because these ranks suggest strengthening fundamentals and superior

123363,344878,WHR,5 GARP Stocks To Enhance Your Portfolio Returns,opinion,"An investing strategy that helps investors to pick stocks at a discount and offers impressive growth prospects has always been popular  Growth at a reasonable price  or GARP investing is one such strategy that seeks to achieve this aim 
Investors following this strategy pick undervalued stocks with strong earnings growth history and prospects  While this appears similar to the blend strategy  there is a thin line of difference  While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks  GARP investing looks for stocks that provide the best of both value and growth investing 
Key Features of GARP
The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing  While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio  they also use earnings per share  EPS  growth rates and return on equity  ROE  like growth investors to identify potential stocks  However  the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors 
While value investors look for an extremely low P E ratio to choose a company  the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry average  Meanwhile  GARP investing chooses stocks with P B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors  
Separately  investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates  Companies that qualify GARP investing are believed to have past as well as expected growth rates over the next few years between 10  and 20  
Another metric  which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing  is return on equity  ROE   Like growth investors  the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry average 
Screening Parameters
Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only seven 
Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen

123364,344879,WHR,3 Lessons From Our Best Stock Trades,opinion,"Welcome to Episode  33 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 

	Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 

	In this episode  Tracey is joined by David Bartosiak  Zacks Equity Strategist and Editor of the Momentum Trader and Home Run Investor services  to discuss the lessons they ve learned from trading stocks 

	Without talking about it beforehand  they both decided to share their top three lessons  and  wouldn t you know it  none of the lessons overlapped 

	David came at it from a momentum trading angle while Tracey leaned more heavily on her value investing history 

	For Dave  his first lesson was  Don t fall on your own sword   If your strategy isn t working  get out 

	Don t try to convince yourself the market is wrong  Dave discusses Twitter  TWTR  and how it looked like such a great trade when Jack Dorsey came back  but it hasn t turned out that way 

	For Tracey  her first lesson was to have  patience  

	In 2014  CEO Mary Dillon bought shares of Ulta  ULTA  when it sold off on a weak earnings report  Dillon bought a chunk of shares in March 2014  But in the months afterwards  the shares didn t do anything 

	They didn t pass her buy in price again until September 2014  In the meantime  Tracey  who bought them in the Insider Trader after Mary bought  held them in the Insider Trader portfolio for all those months as they treaded water 

	Her patience paid off  It turned out to be a highly lucrative trade  as shares have since soared 

	Additionally  Tracey and Dave look at Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   NeoPhotonics  NPTN   and Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  as further examples of lessons learned from trading including how to trade small caps and why not to follow the herd 

	Learn from their mistakes and successes 

	Find out what Tracey and Dave s think of these  and other trading lessons  in this week s podcast ",2016-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-lessons-from-our-best-stock-trades-200133198,200133198

123367,344882,WHR,Box Craters On Billings,opinion,"Box Inc   NYSE BOX 
Earnings And Technicals

On Wednesday after the market closed  Box announced first quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations but billings came up short and sent shares tumbling in the post market session  The company announced an adjusted first quarter loss of 18 cents per share on  90 2 million in revenues while analysts were looking for a loss 24 cents per share on  88 7 million in revenues  The company also announced billings for the quarter that came in at  75 9 million while analysts were looking for  84 1 million and with this miss is why shares are taking a dive  Currently analysts have an average price target of  18 67 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares fell in the post market session to lows of  10 57 after closing the day at  12 81 representing a 17  drop in price  Shares are looking to open Thursday around the  11 50 which is an important key level and if that holds we could see a bounce back up to the  12 level followed by the 200 day moving average currently sitting at  12 44  If It doesn t hold that level then we could see shares dip to support at  11 followed by the  10 level  Shares on the macro scale have been performing better over the past few months as shares were able to bounce off  9 with a double bottom and work their way back up to the 200 day moving average where they struggled to make it over  Look for shares to be active today with increased volatility and range as more traders will be looking to take advantage of the big post market move 
CEO Comments

First quarter revenue was strong at  90 million  representing 37  growth year over year  We also continued to drive operational efficiency  with GAAP and non GAAP EPS improving by 9 and 10 cents  respectively  year over year   said Aaron Levie  co founder and CEO of Box   We won more than 5 000 new customers and added or expanded deployments with leading enterprises like Airbnb  Brooks Brothers and The Whirlpool Corporation  NYSE WHR   We also introduced Box Zones  achieved FedRAMP certification and launched strategic partnerships with Adobe  Cognizant and others  continuing to expand our addressable market 
In the first quarter  we achieved a marked improvement in cash flow from operations of negative  4 2 million and  excluding a payment related to a litigation settlement  would have achieved near breakeven cash flow from operations of negative  500 000   said Dylan Smith  co founder and CFO of Box   We are confident in our growth opportunity  driven by our product differentiation and expanding market  and we remain committed to achieving positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year
