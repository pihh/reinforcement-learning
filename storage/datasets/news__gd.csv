14875,236390,GD,China s Media Hints at Sanctioning U S  Defense Firms Over Taiwan,news," Bloomberg     Chinese state media raised the specter of backlash against U S  companies including General Dynamics Corp  NYSE GD   and Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON   as the foreign ministry warned firms would be sanctioned if a potential  2 billion arms sale to Taiwan goes ahead 
Firms including General Dynamics  Honeywell  Oshkosh Corp   Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co  and the Pennsylvania operations of BAE Systems  LON BAES  were cited as having been involved in recent arms sales to Taiwan  The Communist Party s flagship People s Daily newspaper said their non defense businesses in China may be  boycotted  in an article circulated on WeChat  without specifying what that would entail  State broadcaster CCTV and news agency Xinhua carried similar stories 
China is the third biggest market globally for luxury jet maker Gulfstream Aerospace Corp   a General Dynamics subsidiary  the People s Daily said  adding that the company is eager to display its products at the biennial airshow in Zhuhai  It also said that Honeywell s air conditioning systems are widely used in China  and Oshkosh makes fire trucks that are used in more than 60 airports across the country 
 In order to safeguard the national interest  China will sanction U S  companies involved in the weapons sale   China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Monday   The Chinese government and Chinese enterprises will not cooperate and conduct business with these American companies  
 The specific details are not disclosed at present  but please believe that the Chinese have always followed through on their words   he said 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday warned the U S  it was  playing with fire  by approving the arms sale  Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said last week China would release a list of so called unreliable entities soon  which the government has said will include firms that threaten national security 
Flash Point
U S  military support for Taiwan  which has continued despite Washington s decision to cut official diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing 40 years ago  has long been one of the biggest sticking points between the two countries  While China considers Taiwan part of its territory  the island provides a vital link in a chain of American security partnerships in Western Pacific 
Taiwan has reemerged as a potential flash point amid U S  President Donald Trump s trade dispute with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping  Meanwhile  Taiwanese President Tsai Ing wen  who hails from a pro independence party  has courted U S  backing  holding an unprecedented phone call with Trump before his 2017 inauguration  Tsai recently stopped over in the U S  on a trip to visit Taiwan s diplomatic allies in the Caribbean 
China s warning  shows the degree to which Taiwan is the most sensitive issue for Xi Jinping   Kelsey Broderick and Michael Hirson of New York based consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note   Beijing has somewhat limited willingness to impose harsh actions on Taiwan directly  for fear that harsh actions would backfire and draw support for Tsai  
China has threatened to impose penalties on companies involved in arms sales to Taiwan before  but has kept them informal and discreet  according to Eurasia  In 2015  it lodged a formal complaint protesting a  1 83 billion sale 
The potential sale  which was first reported by Bloomberg News in June  is estimated to cost about  2 billion  according to the Pentagon statement  The weapons and equipment requested by Taiwan include Stinger missiles  108 M1A2T Abrams tanks  as well as hundreds of machine guns  smoke grenade launchers and ammunition

14898,236413,GD,Special Report  White House veterans helped Gulf monarchy build secret surveillance unit,news,"By Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing WASHINGTON  Reuters    In the years after 9 11  former U S  counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke warned Congress that the country needed more expansive spying powers to prevent another catastrophe  Five years after leaving government  he shopped the same idea to an enthusiastic partner  an Arab monarchy with deep pockets  In 2008  Clarke went to work as a consultant guiding the United Arab Emirates as it created a cyber surveillance capability that would utilize top American intelligence contractors to help monitor threats against the tiny nation  The secret unit Clarke helped create had an ominous acronym  DREAD  short for Development Research Exploitation and Analysis Department  In the years that followed  the UAE unit expanded its hunt far beyond suspected extremists to include a Saudi women s rights activist  diplomats at the United Nations and personnel at FIFA  the world soccer body  By 2012  the program would be known among its American operatives by a codename  Project Raven  Reuters reports this year revealed how a group of former National Security Agency operatives and other elite American intelligence veterans helped the UAE spy on a wide range of targets through the previously undisclosed program   from terrorists to human rights activists  journalists and dissidents  Now  an examination of the origins of DREAD  reported here for the first time  shows how a pair of former senior White House leaders  working with ex NSA spies and Beltway contractors  played pivotal roles in building a program whose actions are now under scrutiny by federal authorities  To chart the UAE spying mission s evolution  Reuters examined more than 10 000 DREAD program documents and interviewed more than a dozen contractors  intelligence operatives and former government insiders with direct knowledge of the program  The documents Reuters reviewed span nearly a decade of the DREAD program  starting in 2008  and include internal memos describing the project s logistics  operational plans and targets  Clarke was the first in a string of former White House and U S  defense executives who arrived in the UAE after 9 11 to build the spying unit  Utilizing his close relationship to the country s rulers  forged through decades of experience as a senior U S  decision maker  Clarke won numerous security consulting contracts in the UAE  One of them was to help build the secret spying unit in an unused airport facility in Abu Dhabi  In an interview in Washington  Clarke said that after recommending that the UAE create a cyber surveillance agency  his company  Good Harbor Consulting  was hired to help the country build it  The idea  Clarke said  was to create a unit capable of tracking terrorists  He said the plan was approved by the U S  State Department and the National Security Agency  and that Good Harbor followed U S  law   The incentive was to help in the fight against Al Qaeda  The UAE is a very good counterterrorism partner  You need to remember the timing back then  post 9 11   Clarke said   The NSA wanted it to happen   The NSA did not answer written questions about its knowledge of DREAD or its relationship to any of the contractors  The State Department said it carefully vets foreign defense service agreements for human rights issues  UAE spokespeople at its Washington embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment  Clarke s work in creating DREAD launched a decade of deepening involvement in the UAE hacking unit by Beltway insiders and U S  intelligence veterans  The Americans helped the UAE broaden the mission from a narrow focus on active extremist threats to a vast surveillance operation targeting thousands of people around the world perceived as foes by the Emirati government  One of Clarke s former Good Harbor partners  Paul Kurtz  said Reuters  earlier reports showed that the program expanded into dangerous terrain and that the proliferation of cyber skills merits greater U S  oversight   I have felt revulsion reading what ultimately happened   said Kurtz  a former senior director for national security at the White House  At least five former White House veterans worked for Clarke in the UAE  either on DREAD or other projects  Clarke s Good Harbor ceded control of DREAD in 2010 to other American contractors  just as the operation began successfully hacking targets  A succession of U S  contractors helped keep DREAD s contingent of Americans on the UAE s payroll  an engagement that was permitted through secret State Department agreements  Reuters found  The program s evolution illustrates how Washington s contractor culture benefits from a system of legal and regulatory loopholes that allows ex spies and government insiders to transfer their skills to foreign countries  even ones reputed to have poor human rights track records  American operatives for DREAD were able to sidestep the few guardrails against foreign espionage work that existed  including restrictions on the hacking of U S  computer systems  Despite prohibitions against targeting U S  servers  for instance  by 2012 DREAD operatives had targeted Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Hotmail and Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  email accounts  Eventually  the expanding surveillance dragnet even swept up other American citizens  as Reuters reported earlier this year  In an interview  Mike Rogers  former chairman of the U S  House Intelligence Committee  said he has watched with growing concern as more and more former American intelligence officials cash in by working for foreign countries   These skill sets do not belong to you   he said of ex U S  agents  but to the U S  government that trained them  Just as Washington wouldn t let its spies work in the pay of foreign nations while employed at the NSA  he said   Why on God s green earth would we encourage you to do that after you leave the government   An NSA spokesman said former employees are mandated for life not to reveal classified information  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE GULF For years before the creation of DREAD  Clarke grappled with the need for domestic surveillance in the United States  as well as its potential dangers  Clarke  a counterterrorism czar to Bill Clinton and George W  Bush  is perhaps best known for offering an unequivocal public apology for Washington s inability to prevent the 9 11 attacks   Your government failed you  Those entrusted with protecting you failed you  And I failed you   Clarke said in 2004  one year after leaving government  testifying before a U S  commission established to investigate intelligence failures leading to the 9 11 attacks  To prevent future attacks  Clarke urged America to create a domestic spying service  while saying such a unit must avoid civil liberties violations   We d have to explain to the American people in a very compelling way why they needed a domestic intelligence service  because I think most Americans would be fearful of a secret police   he said  Clarke s testimony to the 9 11 Commission helped lead to the creation in 2005 of a domestic intelligence service within the Federal Bureau of Investigation   described as  a service within a service    staffed by federal agents  language analysts and surveillance specialists  Two years earlier  Clarke had joined his former deputy Roger Cressey at the newly launched Good Harbor Consulting  a security advisory group  Clarke brought one of the most famous names in U S  national security  He also brought a decades long relationship with a potential client of immense wealth  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan  known as MbZ  the son of the UAE s most powerful ruler  In the months preceding the 1991 U S  led war on Iraq  Clarke  then a senior American diplomat  had been sent to the Gulf to seek assistance from regional allies  MbZ stepped up as the U S  prepared to go to war  MbZ helped Clarke obtain permission from the Emirati government for bombing runs in UAE airspace  and he funneled billions toward the American war effort  In 1991  when Congress questioned whether Washington should allow a  682 million arms sale to UAE  Clarke bristled   They transferred  4 billion to the U S  Treasury to support the war effort   he told the House Subcommittee On Arms Control   Is that the kind of nation that we should snub by denying them 20 attack helicopters  I don t think so   The UAE got the choppers  In the years after Clarke joined Good Harbor in 2003  MbZ  the de facto ruler of the UAE  granted the company the rare opportunity to help build the country s homeland security strategy from the ground up  Clarke s Good Harbor soon won a series of security contracts to help the UAE secure its infrastructure  including work to protect the Gulf state s seaports  nuclear projects  airports  embassies and petrochemical facilities  according to two people with direct knowledge of the contracts  Along with helping stand up an emergency response department and maritime security unit  Clarke believed the UAE required an NSA like agency with the ability to spy on terrorists  Clarke said he placed Good Harbor partner Paul Kurtz  himself a former White House veteran  in charge of the contract   At the highest level  it was cyber defense and how you protect your own networks   Kurtz said in a phone interview with Reuters  The UAE wanted to know  he said   How do I understand more about what terrorists may be doing    Asked whether he was concerned the UAE could use the capability to crack down on activists or dissidents  Clarke stressed that  the overarching concern was getting Al Qaeda   He said he had limited visibility into the program at the time and that Kurtz was responsible for the day to day management of the contract to build the program  Kurtz said his personal involvement was limited to high level consulting  with his knowledge of daily activities  next to none   For technical expertise on hacking  he said  Good Harbor relied on subcontractors from the American defense company SRA International  managed by an executive named Karl Gumtow  SRA  then a 7 000 employee operation based in Fairfax  Virginia  was chosen because of its experience with NSA contracts  Clarke said  MISSION LAUNCHED Utilizing eight contractors from SRA  Good Harbor started building DREAD in 2008 inside a building that resembled a small airplane hangar on the edge of the Al Bateen airport in Abu Dhabi  The program began as an arm of MbZ s royal court  and was initially managed by the prince s son  Khalid  The contractors built the project from scratch  They trained potential Emirati staff in hacking techniques and created covert computer networks and anonymous Internet accounts the UAE could use for surveillance operations  In 2009  the group set out to build a spy tool codenamed  the Thread   software that would enable the Emiratis to steal files from Windows computers and transmit them to servers controlled by the Court of the Crown Prince  DREAD program documents show  Beyond offering guidance and support  Good Harbor and SRA did not envision an active role in hacking operations  The program was intended to leave the UAE equipped with the cyber capabilities to pursue terrorism threats on its own  But within months  the Americans could see they needed to take the lead from their less experienced Emirati colleagues  said three former DREAD operatives  Some UAE trainees appeared disinterested and ill equipped  One trainer  a former SRA contractor and ex NSA cryptographer named Keith Tuttle  concluded one student had  lost interest  and another  continues to struggle with technology   a program report card reviewed by Reuters shows  That left the Americans with little choice but to get more involved  two former DREAD operatives told Reuters  eventually doing everything aside from hitting the final button on a computer intrusion  Tuttle  citing advice from his attorneys  declined to comment  A spokesman for General Dynamics  NYSE GD   the owner of SRA International after multiple business acquisitions  said the original contract with Good Harbor ended in 2010  He declined further comment  The hacking requests from UAE security forces to the new unit accelerated after Christmas 2009  just one year after Good Harbor started on DREAD  UAE leaders received intelligence warnings that a violent extremist attack could be imminent  A panicked request came to the nascent hacker team  Help us spy on outbound Internet traffic coming from a suspected extremist s home computer network located in the northern part of the country  DREAD s SRA handlers were still months from finishing the Windows hacking software  Thread  Suddenly  U S  operatives were cobbling together makeshift spy tools based on computer security testing software found for free online  according to two people with direct knowledge of the incident  Yet they succeeded within weeks  hacking the suspected extremist in a mission seen by the Emiratis as a key success that may have prevented an attack  The incident marked a crucial moment in the relationship  With that success came more targeting requests and a deeper role for the Americans  said two people with direct knowledge  By the end of 2010  Good Harbor stepped back from DREAD  leaving control in the hands of SRA vice president Gumtow  program documents show  He had just started his own Maryland company  CyberPoint   Our focus was to help them defend their country   Gumtow said in a phone interview  With Good Harbor s departure  Kurtz joined CyberPoint  although he said his involvement in DREAD ended by 2011  40 AMERICANS AND  34 MILLION Within two years  Gumtow expanded the number of Americans on the program from around a dozen to as many as 40  More than a dozen were poached from the halls of the NSA or its contractor list  DREAD s annual budget reached an estimated  34 million  project documents show  Some American recruits had concerns about working for a foreign spy service  But the program s connection to respected national security figures such as Clarke  Kurtz and Gumtow led them to conclude the effort was above board  four former operatives said  Jonathan Cole  a former U S  intelligence operative who joined DREAD in 2014  said he believed the UAE mission had Washington s blessing due to the involvement of CyberPoint s Maryland based staff in other classified programs for the U S  government   I made some assumptions   Cole said  In 2011  the program moved to the first of a series of secret converted mansions  known as the Villa  and among its American contractors was given the codename Project Raven  Gumtow told Reuters his U S  contractors were hired only to train Emirati hackers  and were prohibited from assisting in operations themselves  U S  law generally prohibits Americans from hacking computer systems anywhere  but specifically prohibits targeting of other American people  companies or servers  Although Gumtow managed the DREAD contract for five years from Baltimore  he said he never learned of such activities occurring among his staff  He said his visibility was limited  as he visited his UAE staff five or six times a year   I did not get involved in day to day program activities   Gumtow said   If we had a rogue person  then there s nothing I can do   Still  the American team soon occupied almost every key position in the program  American operatives helped locate target accounts  discover their vulnerabilities and cue up cyberattacks  To stay within the bounds of the law  the Americans did not press the button on the ultimate attack  but would often literally stand over the shoulders of the Emiratis who did  10 former operatives told Reuters  After the 2011 Arab Spring demonstrations shook the region  Emirati security experts feared their country was next  DREAD s targets began to shift from counterterrorism to a separate category the UAE termed  national security targets    assisting in a broad crackdown against dissidents and others seen as a political threat  The operations came to include the previously unreported hacks of a German human rights group  the United Nations  offices in New York and FIFA executives  Between 2012 and 2015  individual teams were tasked with hacking into entire rival governments  as the program s focus shifted from counterterrorism to espionage against geopolitical foes  documents show  One target was UAE archrival Qatar  which in 2010 gained global attention by winning the right to hold soccer s 2022 World Cup  In 2014  DREAD operatives targeted directors at FIFA  the Swiss based body that runs international soccer  and people involved in Qatar s World Cup organizing body  The ploy was designed to steal damaging information about Qatar s World Cup bid  which could be leaked to embarrass the UAE s Gulf rival  Allegations that FIFA officials were bribed by Qatar in exchange for granting its World Cup bid surfaced in media reports in 2014  The FIFA hacking operation  codenamed Brutal Challenge  was planned by an ex NSA analyst named Chris Smith  according to DREAD operation planning memos reviewed by Reuters  The hackers sent boobytrapped Facebook  NASDAQ FB  messages and emails containing a malicious link to a website called  worldcupgirls   Clicking on the link deployed spyware into the target s computer  It is not clear whether the mission succeeded  But the targets included Hassan Al Thawadi  secretary general of Qatar s FIFA organizing body  and Jack Warner  a former FIFA executive who the U S  later indicted on money laundering charges  Qatar s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy  a governmental body in charge of helping organize the 2022 footballing tournament  had no comment  A spokesman for Qatar s government said the country saw its successful bid to host the World Cup as  a chance for the world to see our region in a new light   In a statement  a spokeswoman said FIFA was  not aware  of any hacking incidents related to Qatar s World Cup bid  A second spokesperson said a FIFA internal investigation did not find that Qatar paid bribes to win the right to host the tournament  Warner  who is facing extradition to the United States from Trinidad and Tobago  could not be reached for comment  He has repeatedly proclaimed he is innocent of the charges  Smith did not respond to messages sent through email and social media  FOREIGN LICENSE  SCANT OVERSIGHT To conduct its UAE business  CyberPoint obtained a State Department foreign defense services license in 2010 and 2014  The agreements  reviewed by Reuters  are written in broad language  Hacking operations are described as  collecting information from communications systems inside and outside the UAE   The agreements placed no restrictions against targeting human rights activists  journalists or U S  allies  A State Department spokesman said that before granting such a license  the agency carefully weighs human rights concerns  The authorization doesn t grant the right to violate human rights  he said  But he declined to comment on the agreements between the agency and CyberPoint  The DREAD agreements did prohibit the program from assisting in hacking operations against Americans or American owned email servers  Doing so  could subject you to criminal liability under U S  law  even if the activities were conducted overseas   warned a CyberPoint legal counsel in a 2011 memo  This restriction was often sidestepped  project documents show  CyberPoint employees assisted in the hacking of hundreds of Google  Yahoo  Hotmail and Facebook accounts  sharing screenshots from the intrusions in presentations with senior Emirati intelligence officers  For example  DREAD accessed Google and Yahoo accounts to steal its targets  Internet browser history  with the hackers highlighting their porn preferences in reports to managers  documents show  In 2012  the program targeted the Hotmail and Gmail accounts of five staffers of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation  a German pro democracy group that at the time was pushing for greater press and speech freedoms in the UAE  DREAD intercepted messages from one foundation manager s hacked Gmail account   Assume all comm channels have been  compromised  the manager s message to an employee read  Behind the scenes  the German ambassador to the UAE was called to meet with officials from the Emirates  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  who said the German non profit must leave the country  said a person with direct knowledge  In March 2012  the group was ordered out  The foundation declined comment  American operatives also helped target the Gmail and Facebook accounts of Ahmed Ghaith al Suwaidi  an Emirati economist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood  in 2011  In January 2012  DREAD hackers reported Al Suwaidi had emailed signed documents putting his wife in charge of his assets in case anything happened to him  DREAD operation documents show  Two months later  al Suwaidi was arrested and detained in a secret prison  where he said he was tortured and forced to sign a confession  said Amnesty International  In 2013  as part of a trial of 94 activists accused of fomenting a coup  he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison  Mohamed Al Zaabi  a friend and fellow activist  said al Suwaidi had never advocated for a coup and had simply pushed for political reform  Gumtow said that  to the best of his knowledge  CyberPoint was careful to stay within the bounds of the license and U S  law   SLIPPERY SLOPE  Over time  conflict emerged between the Emiratis and Americans over the selection of targets  which Americans believed sometimes crossed the line into hacking U S  related entities  The locals began restricting the Americans  access to surveillance databases  marking some  For Emirati Eyes Only   Near the end of 2015  the UAE canceled its CyberPoint contract and hired a UAE cybersecurity firm  DarkMatter  Gumtow warned his employees that if they remained in the program  they would no longer be authorized under the State Department agreement and would be essentially going rogue  More than a dozen stayed  While DarkMatter took over DREAD  the program was a tightly held secret  with even some company executives unaware of its existence  said six people with direct knowledge of the matter  Under DarkMatter  DREAD targeted the United Nations  offices in New York in a bid to compromise the email accounts of foreign diplomats from countries seen as UAE rivals  said a former operative  A UN spokesman confirmed the organization s cybersecurity team identified attacks from a hacking group associated with the UAE  In some cases  DREAD s surveillance operations preceded the torture of targets  In 2017  operatives hacked the emails of Saudi women s rights activist Loujain al Hathloul  after she tried to defy a ban against women driving in Saudi Arabia  a former DREAD operative said  Three years earlier  al Hathloul  who was studying in the UAE  had been arrested by the Saudis after trying to drive across the border into Saudi Arabia and jailed for 73 days  DREAD operatives monitoring al Hathloul gave her the codename Purple Sword  In 2018  just weeks before a royal decree allowed Saudi women to drive legally for the first time  UAE security forces arrested al Hathloul again in Abu Dhabi and placed her in a private jet back to her home country  Once there  Saudi security forces jailed her on charges of sedition  torturing her in a secret facility outside Jeddah  where she remains  her brother Walid al Hathloul told Reuters   It s very disappointing to see Americans taking advantage of skills they learned in the U S  to help this regime   he said   They are basically like mercenaries   Saudi Arabia and the UAE are close allies  A Saudi embassy spokesman did not respond to requests for comment  In a brief emailed statement  DarkMatter said it was unaware of Reuters  findings or any improper actions by the company  A federal grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether American staff violated U S  hacking laws in the UAE mission  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department declined to comment  Congress is also asking questions  citing the earlier Reuters reports while pressing the State Department to explain DREAD and pushing for more transparency in foreign license agreements  Foreign governments  have apparently exploited the advanced training and expertise of individuals who developed their technical skills while in U S  national service   members wrote in May to the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of State  Rogers  the former House intelligence committee chairman  said it s time for Washington to impose tougher restrictions on foreign intelligence contracting   Outright eliminating those opportunities  I think  should absolutely be on the table   he said

14907,236422,GD,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For General Dynamics  GD ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering General Dynamics  GD   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry 
This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 99  
For the last reported quarter  General Dynamics came out with earnings of  3 14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 06 per share  representing a surprise of 2 61   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 68 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 77 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 36  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for General Dynamics  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
General Dynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 21   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-general-dynamics-gd-200497028,200497028

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  All participants will be in a listen only mode   Operator Instructions  Please note this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel  Vice President of Investor Relations  Please go ahead Howard A  Rubel    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Elissa and good morning everyone  Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call  Any forward looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company s outlook  These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties  Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company s 10 K and 10 Q filings With that concluded  I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Phebe Novakovic Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning and thank you  Howard  So  earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of  10 77 billion  earnings from continuing operations of  1 02 billion and earnings of  3 51 per fully diluted share  This 14  improvement in EPS against the fourth quarter 2018 was the result in part of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins  The quarter over quarter earnings improvement at Aerospace was a major driver of this result We enjoyed a very solid fourth quarter and a strong 2019  We achieved most of our operational and financial goals and added meaningfully to our backlog  in some cases rather dramatically  The results and comparisons with prior periods are straightforward and rather compelling  I ll go through them briefly and leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments  our outlook for 2020 and your questions  I also think you will find the press release and the highlights chart on our website fulsome and helpful As we had indicated at the start of the year  the final quarter was our strongest  Earnings per share at  3 51 beat consensus by  0 06  Revenue and operating earnings were somewhat better  Our provision for tax was lower  offset somewhat by a higher share count and higher borrowing costs  So all in all  a solid quarter with good performance compared to the year ago quarter  as well as the third quarter of 2019 For the full year  we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  11 98  Revenue of  39 35 billion was up over 2018 by  3 2 billion  an increase in each of our reporting segments  Operating earnings of  4 6 billion were up  191 million of 4 3  over 2018  Earnings from continuing operations of  3 5 billion were up  126 million or 3 8  over 2018  Importantly  earnings per share from continuing operations were  0 76 above 2018 Our business was strengthened by a significant growth in our backlog to a new high of  87 billion  A very strong order take  particularly in aerospace and marine  positions the Company well for 2020 and belong    beyond  Let me review the full year and the quarter on a year over year basis without reference to sequential comparisons  On a sequential basis  suffice it to say that we have significantly more revenue  Phonetic   higher operating earnings  higher earnings from continuing operation and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter of 2019  So I ll discuss each group and  Phonetic  provide some color where appropriate First Aerospace  Aerospace revenue of  2 9 billion was up  226 million  or 8 4  against the year ago quarter  This increase was attributable to deliveries of the 600 and favorable mix related to the rest of the product line  Services were stable  Quarterly earnings were up  98 million  an increase of more than 25   For the full year revenue of  9 8 billion was up  1 35 billion  or 16  over 2018  Operating earnings of  1 53 billion were up  42 million on lower operating margins  The lower operating margins were attributable to the mix as we continued the transition at Gulfstream delivering G500s and the initial G600 aircraft  Pre owned sales also negatively impacted margins and profits  Excluding the pre owned revenue and losses provide an indication of the underlying strength of the operations  Margins on that basis were 16 1  versus 15 6  as reported Furthermore  margins increased on a sequential basis throughout the year  At mid year last year  we told you to expect revenue of about  9 95 billion with earnings of about  1 5 billion to  5 billion  We finished the year with somewhat less revenue  a better margin rate and somewhat higher earnings  Deliveries were 147 versus our forecast of 145  All in all very close to the forecast we gave you On the order front  activity in the quarter was stellar and the pipeline remained strong  The book to bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 1 7 to 1 dollar denominated and better than that for Gulfstream alone  For Gulfstream airplane deliveries versus orders  it was 2 times on a dollar basis  For the year on both a unit and dollar basis  orders were 54  higher than 2018 Backlog is up about  2 billion sequentially and for the year  From a qualitative perspective  we were quite pleased with the customer mix and product demand  All major regions experienced greater demand  including Asia Pacific  the Mid East  and particularly Europe  During the year  we delivered the 400th G650  The airplane continues to be in demand  Orders for the aircraft were up year over year  We continued to work with the airplane  Phonetic  and expect G600 to be certified shortly  All five of the G700 flight test aircraft are complete and we have begun installation of an interior on the sixth aircraft  We are making good progress toward the first flight  G500 and G600 unit manufacturing costs continued to decline and we are producing very good quality  You should see more G500 and G600 deliveries as the year unfolds Next Combat  Revenue in the quarter of  2 billion was 13 1  above a year ago  Operating earnings of  284 million were also well ahead of the final quarter 2018  For the full year  revenue of  7 billion was up  766 million  a 12 3  increase  Operating earnings of  996 million were up  34 million  By the way  this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at mid year  We enjoyed better revenue than our forecast and had earnings of about  1 billion similar to our outlook  We continued to see the opportunity for further growth of the business  The FY  20 army budget fully supports our programs and we continue to see significant international opportunities  particularly in Europe  We are continuing to negotiate with Spain on a large vehicle program that provides the Spanish Army with important new capabilities In the US  our Army customer is modernizing which provides steady demand across our combat vehicle munitions businesses  In short  this group had quite positive revenue growth  continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity Next Marine Systems  This is a really good news story  Marine s fourth quarter revenue of  2 57 billion was up  268 million  a compelling 11 7  increase over the year ago quarter  Operating earnings of  199 million were down  14 million against the strong fourth quarter in 2018  For the full year  revenue of  9 2 billion was up  681 million  or 8   Operating earnings for the year of  785 million were up by  24 million or 3   despite a 50 basis point drop in margins  At the midpoint of 2019  we expected revenue of about  9 billion and operating earnings of  770 million  We came in above that for both As you are aware  we signed the Virginia class Block V contract in December  This  22 billion award provides the Navy an important increase in its capability and affords us the opportunity to make a fair return  In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer  we continue to invest in each of our yards  particularly at EB  Phonetic  to prepare for Block V and the new Columbia Ballistic Missile Submarine  In preparation for EB s increased work scope on Block V we constructed additional facilities at Quonset Point to build the payload module  So suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the sizes of fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog Now to our Information Technology  IT generated revenue in the quarter of  2 024 billion and operating earnings of  172 million with an attractive 8 5  operating margin  EBITDA margin was 13 1   Quarter over quarter revenue was lower due to several divestitures  delays in award execution and the completion of mature programs and the start of new ones  in other words  timing and mix  A case in point  there are now  22 7 billion in awards that have been delayed compared to  10 4 billion at the end of 2018  Our integration remains ahead of schedule  both in terms of building an integrated and unified business as well as achieving our cost synergies  the benefit of both are beginning to emerge For the year  revenue was  8 4 billion and operating earnings were  628 million with a 7 5  margin  EBITDA margin rose to 12 6  in 2019 from 12  in 2018  We are encouraged by the 14 7  year over year increase in our backlog to  9 1 billion  but there is more work to be done At mid year we had indicated revenues of about approximately  8 5 billion and operating earnings would be around  630 million  We were a touch right in revenue  but operating earnings were as predicted  Let me remind you of something about us  We never accept lower margins in exchange for revenue Next Mission Systems  Revenue in the quarter of almost  1 3 billion was up 2 5  against the year ago quarter  Operating earnings of  188 million were up  7 million with margins up 20 basis points to 14 7   For the year  revenue of  4 94 billion was up  211 million  or 4 5   Operating earnings of  683 million were up  24 million  or 3 6   Book to bill for the year was 1 time with backlog at  5 4 billion  Mission Systems revenue of  4 94 billion  Phonetic  was just a touch short of the approximately  5 billion in revenue we had expected for this business at mid year  Margins of 13 8  matched our expectation  The business continues to show steady  profitable growth Mission Systems offers critical high consequence C4ISR and cyber systems that are built into platforms and missions that our customers rely on  This has positioned them well as they have worked to expand those capabilities into new market segments and to new platforms On this call at mid year on a companywide basis  our forecast for 2019 was to expect revenue of approximately  39 2 billion  operating earnings of  4 6 billion and EPS of  11 85 to  11 90  As you know  we wound up ahead of that forecast Now before I address guidance  I m going to ask Jason to address cash and specifically the near resolution of our issues with respect to our large international contract with Canada and several other key items  There have been some positive    very positive developments with respect to these issues in the last three weeks  Jason Jason W  Aiken    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Phebe and good morning  I m going to cover a number of topics to provide some color with respect to our 2019 results and some context for the 2020 guidance that Phebe will give you in just a few minutes  First is cash  As you can see from our press release exhibits  we generated just over  2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter  reflecting approximately 200  of net income  That resulted in a cash conversion rate of 57  for the full year  obviously lower than we were striving for  As you might infer from this result  we did not collect the outstanding arrears on our large international combat vehicle program before the end of the year As Phebe noted  the good news is that in the weeks following the end of the year through engagement with our principal customer  we have laid out a new path forward that rebaselines the program  including updated delivery schedules  a revised payment plan going forward and a number of contractual terms that provide greater assurance of payment on a go forward basis  In connection with this  we received a  500 million progress payment in January and we will continue to receive scheduled progress payments on a newly established payment schedule  This includes an additional  500 million this year and regular payments for product delivered in 2021 and beyond that will bring down the working capital balance on this program over the next three years  This increased clarity around payments on the program gives us a greater level of assurance with respect to our expectations for free cash flows in the coming years  To that point  we expect our free cash flow conversion for 2020 to be in the 85  to 90  range  reflecting an increased pension contribution and the peak of our capital investments in our Marine Systems business to support the sizable growth that is coming in this decade and beyond as well as the build of G700 test articles and initial inventories in anticipation of its 2022 entry into service With these capital needs winding down and the liquidation of the working capital in Combat Systems  we expect free cash flow to exceed 100  of net income starting in 2021  Despite the cash shortfall in 2019  we were able to retire 100  of our outstanding commercial paper balance as anticipated  We ended the year with a cash balance of just over  900 million and a net debt position of  11 billion Our net interest expense for the fourth quarter was  110 million  bringing interest expense for the full year to  460 million  That compares to  112 million and  356 million for the comparable 2018 periods  Our next scheduled debt maturity is for  2 5 billion in the second quarter of this year and we expect interest expense to drop to  410 million in 2020 accordingly  With our strong balance sheet and the increased certainty around our international cash forecast  we now have a level of financial flexibility that we did not enjoy last year On the capital deployment front  in addition to repaying our commercial paper we had capital expenditures of approximately  380 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total just shy of  1 billion  or 2 5  of revenues You may recall that we expected 2019 capex to be closer to 3  of sales  but it came in slightly lower as we prudently managed these investments while working to resolve the international cash situation  At  449 million  capex in the 2019 for Marine Systems accounted for 45  of our capital spending and was nearly four times its depreciation for the year  We again expect Marine Systems to command the largest share of our capital budget in 2020 as we work toward satisfying the nation s need for its critical naval systems  As a result of some of the 2019 investments pushing to the right  we expect our capital investments to remain elevated in 2020  similar to the 2019 level and declining thereafter We also paid  294 million in dividends in the fourth quarter  bringing the full year of  1 2 billion  I alluded to our pension contributions earlier  And with respect to our pension plans  we contributed  185 million in 2019 and we expect that to increase to approximately  470 million in 2020  the majority of that in the third quarter Turning to income taxes  We had a 16  effective tax rate in the fourth quarter resulting in a full year rate of 17 1   a little better than our previous guidance attributable primarily to the finalization of our 2018 tax return  Looking ahead to 2020  we expect a full year effective tax rate of around 17 5  Next I d like to alert you to an accounting change that we ve made starting in 2020  This relates to our treatment of pre owned aircraft sales in our Aerospace group  As you are aware  this is an immaterial activity for us with transactions that are generally break even or at a de minimis loss  However  the forecasting and reporting of pre owned sales results in non economic perturbations in revenue and operating margins for the Aerospace group that create unnecessary confusion around the group s performance  As a result  we will no longer report pre owned aircraft sales going forward  only the bottom line earnings impact  which is again has historically been close to break even When you consider the 2020 revenue guidance for the Aerospace group that Phebe will provide in just a moment  you should level set 2019 revenues excluding  292 million of pre owned sales  So for comparative purposes that would bring 2019 revenue for the group to approximately  9 5 billion The last item I d like to provide a little color on is our backlog  We ended the year with a backlog at an all time high of approximately  87 billion  exceeding the previous mark by more than  10 billion  And the total potential contract value  including options and IDIQ value  ended the year at over  126 billion  an increase of more than 22  over both the prior quarter and the end of 2018  This is the result of very strong order activity across the board as four of our five segments posted a book to bill of 1 to 1 or greater for the quarter and the year  As Phebe noted  the Aerospace group had a very strong quarter with a book to bill of 1 7 times on revenue growth of almost 8 5   This was the result of the second highest order quarter for the group ever and its highest in over 10 years  That brings the full year book to bill to 1 2 times on revenue growth of 16  Combat Systems had a solid book to bill of 0 8 times on revenue growth of over 12  for the year  though they were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations that reduced the backlog balance by  300 million versus the end of 2018  GDIT and Mission Systems continued to have strong steady order activity  each with a 1 to 1 book to bill in the fourth quarter  And that brings Mission Systems to 1 to 1 for the year and GDIT to 1 1 to 1 for the full year  This marks five consecutive years that each of these businesses have had a book to bill of 1 to 1 or greater  And I would remind you that for both of these segments  the IDIQ value  which we don t report in orders or backlog  generates roughly half of their respective annual sales  For Mission Systems this value was almost  7 5 billion at the end of the year and for GDIT it reached  19 billion  This conservative approach of excluding this contract value from our reported order activity makes a direct comparison with some of their industry peers somewhat less meaningful And finally  Marine Systems had an outstanding year with a book to bill of over 8 times in the quarter and approximately 3 times for the year  As we ve discussed in the past  this group has large long term contracts to provide clear visibility to revenue growth well into the future  To put a finer point on it  each of the shipyards in the group has from backlog at the end of 2019 that run through the mid to latter part of this decade  providing significant opportunity for both top line and bottom line growth That concludes my remarks and I ll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2020 and wrap up remarks Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jason  So let me provide our operating forecast for 2020 initially by business group and then a Company wide rollup  In Aerospace  we expect 2020 revenue to be about  10 billion without pre owned sales  up from 2019  Operating margin will be about 15 7  to 15 8   Revenue will be much stronger in the second half as will margin rate  Operating margin will accelerate through the year  similar to 2019 starting in the 14  range and ending around 18  by the fourth quarter  We are seeing 5  revenue growth in 2020 and between  40 million to  45 million of improved earnings In Combat we expect revenue of about  7 3 billion and approximately  300 million increase over 2019  We expect operating margins to be about 14 3   Here again  look for both revenue  earnings and margin rate to grow quarter over quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter We continue to see solid growth for the business with orders for the Abrams and solid demand for the Stryker    our Stryker vehicles and munitions  Like last year  we see domestic volumes rising faster than our international business  although a few international opportunities could tip that balance The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately  9 85 billion  an increase of almost  700 million over 2019  Operating margin in 2020 is anticipated to be about 8 6   We anticipate growth at each of our yards  The long term driver of growth here is the submarine work which is expanding exponentially  Our biggest opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted margin rate  We expect IT revenue in 2019 of about    we expect IT revenue of approximately  8 45 billion  consistent with 2019  With margins in the 7 6  range  this  Phonetic  results in a modest increase in operating earnings We expect Mission Systems revenue in 2020 of about  5 1 billion  an increase of approximately  140 million  We anticipate operating margins about 14 1   again building throughout the year So for 2020 Companywide  we expect to see slightly more than  40 7 billion of revenue  up 4  over 2019  and operating margin of 11 9   This all rolls  Phonetic  to a forecast of  12 35 to  12 60 per fully diluted share  On a quarterly basis  we expect EPS to play out much like it did in 2019 with Q1 about  2 60 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operation  It assumes a 17 5  tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count constant with year end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises  So much like last year  beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan  achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital I should leave you with this final thought  the near imminent resolution of our large international contract and attendant cash issues  including the current receipt of funds provides enormous clarity in the liability of funds  This coupled with our strong balance sheet leaves us with greater flexibility for capital deployment than we have had in the recent past  We intend to utilize it to create value for our shareholders Howard A  Rubel    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Phebe  As a reminder  we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up  So  Elissa  would you please remind the participants how to enter the queue now  please Questions and Answers OperatorYes  Thank you   Operator Instructions  And the first question today comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please go ahead Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYeah  good morning Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Ron Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust following up on your final comment there that you have more flexibility around capital deployment  That was a bit of a teaser  What are you thinking  I mean  what    buying back shares  I mean  what are you thinking about that Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  we ll deal with our short term debt and then we will buy back shares appropriately Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnything else  I mean  are you thinking about other things to do in the portfolio  meaning    I mean  we ve seen a flurry of M A in this space  So    I mean is there anything to add  Phonetic  Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe don t comment on M A  Nice try  Ron Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  All right  All right  Thank you guys OperatorThe next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays  Please go ahead David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystThanks  Good morning Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  David David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystPhebe  on the Gulfstream  I guess  revenue forecast  can you help us a bit  maybe at a high level in terms of some of the moving pieces there  what you re expecting for total aircraft deliveries  kind of the ramp down on the 650 Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we expect about 150 aircraft deliveries this year  And consistent with our expressed plan to you all some time ago  we will ramp down the 650 deliveries as we increase the 500 and 600 deliveries  So that mix and cadence around that mix is anticipating    is playing out as anticipated David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystAnd you do you expect more of the 650 ramp down to occur in  20 or  21  I think before you have been talking about more of that hit coming in  20 versus  21 Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLargely in  20  but we ll continue to ramp according to really the demand  We are ramping to a point where we have demand and delivery in an equilibrium and I m quite comfortable that we ll get there  But it s pretty clear  that was very clear to me that in 2020  650 deliveries will  as anticipated  decrease OperatorThe next question today comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research  Please go ahead Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystThanks so much  Good morning Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystOn GDIT Phebe  it looks to me now the organic revenue growth has been a little bit below what some of the other peers in the industry have been able to achieve and that slides to continue in 2020  Now  is this a consequence of these award delays  or is it something to do with just the time it takes to integrate CSRA or something else  And when would you expect this revenue growth rate to pick up Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I tried to be pretty    it was pretty explicit in my remarks around that  But just to reiterate  there are three fundamental factors  First  we experienced significant delays in the execution of awards  The velocity of execution slowed considerably and the number of awards    potential awards costs  Indecipherable  purgatory increased dramatically  Second  and don t forget this  we exited two lines of business last year  And third  we had several mature programs and we lost one or two recompetes  both of which reduced near term volume  that will be replaced over time by our new wins  So think of this latter category as mix and timing Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystSo is it safe to say that   Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd to your second question  we had anticipated that 2019    from 2020  we would show some growth  That growth has now moved to the right in 2021 and we re expecting mid single digit growth  again driven by execution and velocity of the contract awards Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystOkay  Thanks so much OperatorThe next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein  Please go ahead Doug Harned    Bernstein    AnalystThank you  Good morning Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Doug Doug Harned    Bernstein    AnalystHi  Can you take us through a little bit on the Block V Virginia class because this is obviously a bigger boat  It s very important  What are the differences that you see between Block V and Block IV  and how should we expect that to flow through to financial performance over the next several years Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  you quite accurately point out the Block V is a    represents a considerable increase in capability for the US Navy and a considerable increase in our workload  given that the addition of the new capabilities is executed entirely by us  And so  as we think about  from Block IV the Block V  we continue to come down our learning curves and we are sequencing all of these now builds around the first delivery of Columbia  which is we ll start work at the end of this year So  I think that with respect to Block V  our job is simply to execute Block V effectively  And as I said in my remarks the key here is just increasing our margin and really improving our ship over ship capabilities  So we ve got Block V in very good shape along with our Navy customer and we ve begun to work on it and we ll continue that execution for the next several years Doug Harned    Bernstein    AnalystAnd then you talked about the investment you re having to make for capex for both the Block V and Columbia class  But when you think about the trajectory for that investment  it s not just facilities  but it s also labor  And when you look at planning for this  how do you see the trajectory for your costs and for reimbursement by the customer as you work to build up here Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo let s take that into twofold  First  our customer is well aware of the imperatives that we face  And they have worked closely with us to better match the investment with the return which is wholesome for everyone  With respect to the essence or nub of your question  ramping up on growth in our workforce  So we started this about eight years ago  working in public private partnerships with Rhode Island and Connecticut  to begin to train the kinds of workers that we needed and in large numbers  That coupled with our internal training program  we have demonstrated over the last four years  We have brought new shipbuilders into the yard at a higher initial capabilities and then they continue to learn So  the Navy has fully supported our efforts with respect to expanding our workforce and the need to bring training up and some skill set frankly in the country had atrophied when you think about plumbing and pipe fitting and electricians and welders  Welders are a critical and key capability  A number of those in the US training programs throughout the United States had atrophied a bit  And in our world  up in New England  we are rebuilding those at a very rapid rate  So  we have    we re very comfortable that we can meet our expectations for growth OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company  Please go ahead Cai von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystYes  thank you very much  So at one point  Phebe  you were talking about the G500 and 600 coming down the learning curve and becoming more profitable as we move out in time  And I think you suggested in 2021 directionally margin should be up as that plus ways the mix shift away from the 650  Is that still a trend that you look for Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s a trend that we look for and that we are experiencing  As you would expect from the operating discipline and the price discipline and the cost discipline that we have  we continue to see learning and nice learning on each and every one of these aircraft coming down the line to offset the reduction    in part to offset the reduction in 650 deliveries This    we had clearly articulated this plan several years ago and we ve been right on sequence on it  So I think there is nothing new there in terms of the strategy and the execution around that strategy Cai von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystTerrific  And then  Jason  quickly for you  You talked of conversion going to 100  in 2021  Can you give us some color in terms of how much does pension contribution come down  if at all  how much does capex come down  And what kind of a benefit do you get from inventory liquidation on the 500 and 600  Thanks Jason W  Aiken    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  when you think about the capital investment we had    I think I said earlier  we had expected about 3  of sales in 2019 and ended up at about 2 5   You should expect to see that in a similar range  call it  2 5  in 2020 because of the elements of that that we pushed to the right  That will step down starting in 2021 so that by  call it  2023 we ll be back to the typical more historic typical 2  range that we ve been in Pension contributions on the other hand are  as I mentioned  elevated   400 million plus in 2020  It will stay elevated for another year or so  maybe a year  and then come back down from there  So  a little bit of a surge in pension contribution and then returning back down to a lower level And then I think in terms of the working capital  the biggest single thing that you should expect is  we ended the year with somewhere close to the neighborhood of  2 9 billion of unbilled receivables  contracts and process  if you will  on the large international combat vehicle program  That will step down to the point that that working capital is essentially liquidated by the end of  call it  2023  That  along with the 500 and 600 as you mentioned  those test articles will be sold here in 2020 and 2021  respectively  So those will be a benefit And as a result  the aggregate outcome of that is we expect to actually see free cash flow in  21 and beyond  call it  2021   22  even  23  actually in excess of 100  of    in excess of 100  in net income  So  we ll start to recapture some of that shortfall that we ve had over the past couple of years OperatorThe next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel  Please go ahead Joseph DeNardi    Stifel    AnalystYeah  Hey  good morning  Phebe  if we go   Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Joseph DeNardi    Stifel    AnalystIf we go back four or five years  I think there was a debate as to how the Navy would afford Columbia and Virginia and they ve decided to kind of build both simultaneously  When does that actually get locked in  Do you see any political risk to that that that decision gets revisited whether to feather in Columbia in place of Virginia or is that risk gone at this point  Thank you Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  think about long term demand for a given product line as driven by the warfighters  needs  And with respect to both classes of our submarines  there are    there is real warfighter demand on Virginia and then on Columbia  That is a national program and it can t wait  So the nation sees the decision makers in both the executive branch and on Capitol Hill  see the imperative to fund and wholesomely fund both of those programs  And as we sit here today  we see pretty good surety  very good surety on a going forward basis of the stability of that backlog and the reliability of increasing backlog in submarines for quite some time to come Think about the submarine business  shipbuilding in general  but the submarine business in particular as executing slowly over time  relatively slowly over time  given the complexity of building a nuclear submarine that is offset in terms of predictability of backlog  These are very secure platforms because they are in demand  They are in current demand and they will be in future demand  There are certain imperatives   Phonetic OperatorThe next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning everyone Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Noah Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystPhebe  I wondered if you could just expand on what you re seeing in the overall business jet and Gulfstream demand environment because on the one hand some of the leading indicator data there has looked a little tougher  but obviously you ve got your new product set and have the really strong bookings in the quarter  So just kind of curious to hear what you re seeing and was the book to bill excluding the G700 also about 1 in the quarter Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  the answer to your question  the latter question is  yes  If you have been following us  and you have  for some time  you ll know that our basic predicate for this business is that new product  and truly new product  clean sheet airplanes  all new  drive demand and that predicate is borne out  not surprisingly  in my mind So our new products are generating demand and our expected new product in the 700 is generating demand  So  think about the experience of OEMs in this market as really idiosyncratic to the product offerings they have  So what our experience in this market is that we have enjoyed nice steady demand year over year  That demand has increased as the new products are announced and entering to service  And in addition  so much of selling airplanes is predictability of the delivery and reliability of the airplane and the ability to service  All of that drives demand and we are  I think  arguably without question  the best in class with respect to all of those key factors  So we are quite comfortable with our positioning and fourth quarter was good and the pipeline is active Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd then just on the margins in the segment  I think the Company has said that the 2021 rate of expansion should be faster than the  20 rate of expansion  And I think you ve even said getting back into the high teens  21  maybe  22  Do I have that right  does that still hold in terms of the trajectory from here Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe trajectory does hold more  Phonetic  in this year in the high teens margin  but then    so this is a complex business with lots of moving parts  Margins tend to be somewhat variable quarter over quarter  largely driven by mix  But again  the basic thesis around the introduction of these airplanes and the profitability and the realization of those    that profitability remains today the same as it was OperatorYour next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research  Please go ahead George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYes  good morning  Phebe  it doesn t look like the 650 deliveries really came down much  if anything  in  19  So are the declines in  20 reflecting just lower backlog in 650 today than a year ago or what s really driving the 650 decline Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe 650 backlog has not declined  We have seen a nice increase  The deliveries quarter over quarter of these airplanes is often driven by customers  So  we had about three 600s that for various outside the United States regulatory issues were delayed  We will move into this delivery is expected for this quarter  And we had some 650s that customers wanted earlier  So  we took a few of those  So this is    and we re able to execute and satisfy those customer needs  So 650 has done extremely well  not insignificantly as we talked about in this call and the third quarter  There are a lot of demand signals and demand catalysts for the 650  The introduction to 700 clarified it  And frankly  as we told you what has increased is 650 demand  So    and by the way  this airplane  we ve got 400 of them in service and some of them are coming out of warranty and there is a natural replacement cycle  So  we continue to see nice demand for the 650 George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystSo why bring down the deliveries if the backlog is up  I must be missing something here Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBecause ultimately over time you want to fully match the backlog with the deliveries  And if you recall  we entered this transition period with an extraordinarily long  and I argued at that time  a too long wait time  And we have equalized that wait time to order to wait time significantly during this transition period  and we ll get back to that regular cadence  But our    look  our 650 order book and what we ve got in backlog fully supports our going forward 650 production estimates  That s what you really want to see  The order book is enough to satisfy your 650 deliveries Howard A  Rubel    Vice President  Investor RelationsOperator  this upcoming question will be our last OperatorThe last question today comes from Seth Seifman of JP Morgan  Please go ahead Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  Good morning Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Seth Seifman    JP Morgan    AnalystI guess  Phebe you mentioned in Marine Systems that there was opportunity in operating margin  Are there specific milestones that you would point to potentially coming up this year and if so  what and when are they Phebe N  Novakovic    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo there are multiple milestones in any given year and they are tied to an exceedingly large number of internal milestones and milestones to our Navy customer  But that s not the only thing that    so we will see some of those as we always do in any given year  But really our ability to drive margins is all about the cost control and performance and we continue to drive hard on both  This is a very high performing shipyard Seth Seifman    JP

149470,370986,GD,Analysts Say Brace for a Steeper Plunge as Shutdown Drags On,news," Bloomberg     The year end rout in financial markets may get worse with S P futures falling as much as 0 9 percent in a volatile morning session  Analysts and strategists say investor sentiment is weakening further amid the federal government shutdown  with no quick end in sight 
The S P 500 Index has fallen more than 12 percent just in December  on pace for the steepest monthly decline since October 2008  as fear of a possible slowdown in the new year gripped the market  Recent cautious commentary from economic bellwether FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   stoked concerns  with warnings about slowing global trade and weakness in the European economy  Investors are also possibly pricing in the impact of a policy error by the Federal Reserve and a weak Chinese economy 
Given the bearish backdrop  a prolonged shutdown can only mean one thing  more sell off 
 Risk aversion is now extreme  even though the Street may point to a  less dovish  FOMC and concerns about a U S  government shutdown as possible reasons for the selloff  the apparent lack of positive drivers and headlines has curbed risk appetite   Nomura strategist Masanari Takada wrote in a note   While sentiment looks to be skewed towards fear  most market participants seem to be looking for a plausible excuse to sell  
The bone of contention in the standoff between the two parties is the funding for President Donald Trump s border wall with Mexico  The next possibility for votes in the House and Senate is Dec  27  but Democrats have indicated the two sides are far from a deal 
 Best unlikely case to end partial U S  Government shutdown would be post Christmas deal when Congress returns Thursday   Cowen analysts Roman Schweizer and Cai von Rumohr wrote in a note to clients   Worst likely case is after Jan  3 when Democrats get the House back  We do not see Democrats funding Trump s Wall  
Government contractors such as technology service providers may feel some pressure  although Cowen expects any financial impact to be very minor  Science Applications International Corp  might be among the most exposed as its three large NASA programs account for an estimated 7 percent of sales  but Cowen expected the impact to be modest 
While the current shutdown affects only nine out of the fifteen cabinet level departments  and excludes the Department of Defense  the uncertainty will be an overhang on defense stocks 
Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu sees  an overhang around the fiscal 2020 budget negotiations that will require compromise on both sides of the aisle and a Budget Agreement to repeal the Sequester   Defense stocks suffered a setback last week after Secretary of Defense James Mattis resigned following Trump s announcement about withdrawing troops from Syria

Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as General Dynamics  GD   a current top ranked dividend stock 
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
Why does the IRS require you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72  If you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

149498,371014,GD,Trudeau s dilemma  how to be tough on Saudi Arabia and save jobs,news,By Allison Martell LONDON  Ontario  Reuters    Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is faced with a dilemma as an election approaches   how to credibly clamp down on Riyadh over its human rights record while sparing a  13 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia  Trudeau  who has promised  consequences  for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi  is under pressure to freeze an already unpopular  13 billion contract for armored vehicles built in Canada by U S  based General Dynamics  NYSE GD   The problem is that the deal underpins 3 000 jobs in the small city of London  Ontario  a recovering manufacturing center and a likely battleground in next year s federal vote  The debate over the deal is worrying to members of Trudeau s ruling Liberal party  including Peter Fragiskatos  the lawmaker from the London North Centre parliamentary constituency   A lot of jobs depend on this contract   Fragiskatos said in an interview  noting Trudeau has visited the city several times and  understands very well the challenges that London has faced  I am advocating very strongly for my community   A source directly familiar with official thinking said  we don t want to lose those jobs   but added it was also important for Canada to take a stand when human rights are violated   Canada is committed to upholding human rights  freedom of expression and the protection of journalists around the world   Trudeau said last week  and that Ottawa would review its export permits to Saudi Arabia in response to the death of Khashoggi  whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has sparked an international outcry   As for further penalties  a government official said on Monday that Canada is carrying out a  comprehensive review of our relationship with Saudi Arabia   while trying to  establish a credible narrative  for the murder and coordinate a response with allies  In recent years  Trudeau has cast himself and his government as standard bearers for progressive values at a time when the United States is withdrawing from the global stage under President Donald Trump  Canada is particularly sensitive to Khashoggi s murder after Riyadh abruptly severed diplomatic ties following Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland s tweet in August demanding the release of jailed activists  Trudeau backed Freeland after the tweet and the two have been generally aligned on the murder of Khashoggi  But asked last week why Ottawa would go ahead with the arms deal  Freeland replied it was  a very good question  and declined to be more specific  Trudeau has said scrapping the deal would cost  billions  in penalties  Opposition critics and human rights groups say that if Trudeau is serious about standing up for human rights  he should cancel the deal  Other nations are also grappling with how to send a strong message to the Gulf oil producer about its need to respect human rights while limiting the economic impact  Germany halted new weapons sales to Riyadh  and Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for the rest of the European Union to adopt a similar position  Berlin is also reviewing sales that have already been approved  including contracts for patrol boats that are under construction  But in Britain  the second largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia after the United States  Prime Minister Theresa May s government has repeatedly rejected calls from opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to end arms sales to Riyadh        There are jobs in the UK     at stake so when it comes to the issue of arms sales we have our procedures   Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told lawmakers on Wednesday   CRUCIAL TO LIBERALS London s newly elected mayor Ed Holder  a former Conservative minister who helped found the Canada Saudi Business Council and led a trade delegation to the kingdom in 2016  said the contract should not be canceled   I ve been in contact with the federal government about that and I m advised that they don t intend to cancel the contract   he said in a radio interview after his Oct  22 election  The political fallout of scrapping the deal could be significant  The Liberals control two of London s four seats and have a narrow  12 seat parliamentary majority heading into a re election campaign for a vote due by Oct  21  2019   Places like London  Ontario  will be crucial to the Liberals   said Darrell Bricker  head of Ipsos Public Affairs polling company  The Liberals  at 36 percent  are just one point ahead of the Conservatives  with the left leaning New Democrats  who say the Saudi military contract should be scrapped  are at 20 percent  according to the latest Ipsos poll  While Trudeau has announced a review of export permits  those already issued are being respected  the government official said  That should spare General Dynamics any immediate impact   A 2016 document from the foreign ministry posted online shows General Dynamics had already received approval for C 11 billion worth of exports as part of the deal  Canada shipped C 166 9 million worth of armored vehicles and parts to Saudi Arabia in July  trade statistics show   We are continuing to build that vehicle on schedule  and we see no indication that contract has changed   General Dynamics Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a conference call last week   Steady as she goes    With additional reporting by Steve Scherer and David Ljunggren in Ottawa and Guy Faulconbridge in London  Editing by Susan Thomas

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
General Dynamics  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  10 77 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 61   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 38 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters

What s Next for General Dynamics 
While General Dynamics has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Saudi assets in Canada are confined mainly to stakes in upscale hotel operators  some small stock holdings in companies like Canadian National Railway Co   and grain facilities 
Most investments have been made by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal through his Kingdom Holding Co   a Riyadh based conglomerate with investments in hotels  real estate and equities  The company s international hotel unit joined Bill Gates s Cascade Investment and Canadian Isadore Sharp in a 2007 buyout of management company Four Seasons Hotels Inc   taking a 47 5 percent stake 
 The matter does not affect the day to day operations of Four Seasons   spokeswoman Sarah Tuite said in an email   It is business as usual as we continue to welcome guests to our hotels and resorts worldwide  
Alwaleed s influence in the kingdom has diminished after his arrest last year in an anti corruption sweep by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  who is seen to be sending a message to critics of his leadership with this latest reaction against Canada 
Wheat Board
G3 Global Grain Group  a joint venture between state owned Saudi Agriculture   Livestock Investment Co  and U S  agri food company Bunge Ltd   bought a 50 1 percent stake in the Canadian Wheat Board for C 250 million   192 million  in 2015  SALIC boosted its stake to 75 percent a year later  The partnership also holds an interest in a grain export terminal being built near Vancouver  On Tuesday  officials of the Winnipeg  Manitoba based G3 said the company continues to buy and sell grain as usual  Officials didn t immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday 
Last year  Toronto based technology startup QD Solar Inc  received funding from a group that included Saudi s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Netherlands based venture capital firm DSM Venturing 
Saudi lender National Commercial Bank has an asset manager that held investments in 41 Canadian companies including Suncor Energy Inc   Canadian Natural Resources Ltd  and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd  in its AlAhli North America Index Fund  according to May 2017 filings  CN Rail  at  473 500  was the largest Canadian investment of the fund s  148 2 million portfolio 
Two way trade between the two countries is tiny    around 0 4 percent of Canada s total trade in 2017  Canada exported C 1 37 billion worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year  mostly tanks and other armored fighting vehicles and their parts  according to Statistics Canada  The country imported C 2 63 billion in goods from Saudi Arabia over that period  mostly crude imported to the Irving Oil Ltd  refinery in Saint John  New Brunswick 
Export Development Canada  the country s trade financing agency said it has exposure of about C 2 billion to Saudi Arabia  and about 250 customers operating in the kingdom 
 Canada stands up firmly and respectfully for human rights   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Wednesday in Montreal  sidestepping questions on the impact of the Saudi moves  He also declined to say whether Canada would apologize for its statements about the women s activists 
The tanks and armored vehicles are manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada  based in London  Ontario  a unit of U S  defense giant General Dynamics Corp  NYSE GD    under a C 15 billion contract with Saudi Arabia signed by the Canadian government in 2014 
Currency Reverses
Saudi s move had a brief impact on the Canadian dollar  with the loonie depreciating as much as 0 5 percent to C 1 3120 per U S  dollar after the Financial Times reported the Saudi Arabia central bank and state pension funds instructed overseas asset managers to dispose of Canadian assets starting Tuesday 
Canada s currency later reversed those losses to trade 0 3 percent higher at 4 29 p m  in Toronto  The S P TSX Composite Index closed 0 2 percent higher at 16 315 08  Yields on 10 year government bonds fell 1 basis point to 2 36 percent 
Saudi holdings of Canadian dollar reserves are between C 10 billion and C 25 billion  with the upper end of that estimate representing 10 percent of daily Canadian dollar trading volume  according to estimates from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
Gold  Engineering
Canadian direct investors in Saudi Arabia  meanwhile  include Barrick Gold Corp   the world s second biggest producer  and SNC Lavalin Group Inc   Canada s biggest engineering and construction company 
SNC  which has been operating in the kingdom for five decades  said late Wednesday it s not yet been able to  fully assess  the impact of the tensions with Saudi Arabia on its business  SNC had revenue of about C 993 million in the country last year  representing about 11 percent of total sales 
 If a widespread commercial embargo on Canadian commercial interests in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were to be implemented on a prolonged basis  there will be an impact on our future financial performance   SNC said in a statement 
As for Barrick  the Toronto based miner said it doesn t expect its copper mine in Saudi Arabia to be affected by the escalating tensions with Canada

149549,371065,GD,Exclusive  U S  government contractor Engility explores sale  sources,news,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  defense contractor  Engility Holdings Inc   N EGL  is exploring a sale  amid a wave of consolidation in the U S  government services sector  three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday 
The development is the latest example of how increased defense spending under U S  President Donald Trump and the Republican Party is driving contractors to pursue mergers so that they have more scale to bid on bigger projects  spanning everything from outdated computer systems to antiquated cyber security 
Engility has attracted interest from companies that include  CACI International Inc   N CACI  and Science Applications International Corp  SAIC   N SAIC   though deliberations are at an early stage and may not lead to a deal  two of the sources said 
The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential  Representatives from Engility and CACI did not immediately respond to a request for comment  A SAIC representative declined to comment 
Chantilly  Virginia based Engility provides skilled personnel to U S  departments of defense  homeland security and justice  among others  It has a market capitalization of  1 2 billion 
Engility is no stranger to dealmaking  It acquired privately held peer TASC for about  1 1 billion  including debt  in 2014  At the time  TASC was controlled by private equity firms KKR   Co Inc  N KKR  and General Atlantic LLC  who took Engility shares as well as seats on Engility s board as a part of the deal  KKR and General Atlantic now own close to half of Engility 
In April  weapons maker General Dynamics Corp  N GD  bought CSRA Inc for  9 7 billion to expand its government services business  after CACI withdrew its offer for CSRA following a bidding war 
Beyond General Dynamic s purchase of CSRA  many companies in the government services sector have struck deals this year  including DXC Technology Co  N DXC   which combined its U S  public sector business with Vencore Holding Corp and KeyPoint Government Solutions to create an independent  publicly traded company serving U S  government clients ",2018-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-us-government-contractor-engility-explores-sale-sources-1526448,1526448

149617,371133,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when General Dynamics  GD  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 9  
Revenues are expected to be  9 68 billion  up 6 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics 
For General Dynamics  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of  2 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 77  delivering a surprise of  3 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Dynamics doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-dynamics-gd-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474084,200474084

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 61   A quarter ago  it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of  2 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 77  delivering a surprise of 3 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
General Dynamics shares have added about 14 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for General Dynamics 
While General Dynamics has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

149642,371158,GD,Is General Dynamics  GD  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put General Dynamics Corporation   NYSE GD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  General Dynamics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 48  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  General Dynamics s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 13 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Aerospace sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 62  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that General Dynamics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 65  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for General Dynamics stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  General Dynamics has a P S ratio of about 1 41  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  General Dynamics currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes General Dynamics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for General Dynamics is just 1 79  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  GD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though General Dynamics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives GD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best  The current quarter has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below General Dynamics Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGeneral Dynamics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick

149643,371159,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
General Dynamics in Focus
Based in Falls Church  General Dynamics  GD  is in the Aerospace sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 16 42   The defense contractor is currently shelling out a dividend of  1 02 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 23   This compares to the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield of 0 91  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 91  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 08 is up 12 4  from last year  In the past five year period  General Dynamics has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 62   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  General Dynamics s current payout ratio is 36   meaning it paid out 36  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  GD expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 88 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 88  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  GD presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-09-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-dynamics-gd-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200469196,200469196

149657,371173,GD,Trump proposal slashes taxes on businesses  the rich  fuels deficit worries,news,"By David Morgan and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed the biggest U S  tax overhaul in three decades  offering to cut taxes for most Americans but prompting criticism that the plan favors the rich and companies and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit  The proposal  which the Republican president said was aimed at helping working people  creating jobs and making the tax code more simple and fair  faces an uphill battle in Congress with Trump s own party divided and Democrats hostile  The plan would lower corporate income tax rates  cut taxes for small businesses  reduce the top income tax rate for individuals and scrap some widely used tax breaks including one that benefits people in high tax states dominated by Democrats  Forged during months of talks among Trump s aides and top Republicans in Congress  the plan contained scant details about how to pay for the cuts without fueling deficits  It must be turned into detailed legislation by the Republican led congressional tax writing committees  Speaking at an event in Indianapolis  Trump called the plan the largest tax cut in U S  history and  historic tax relief to the American people    This is a once in a generation opportunity   Trump said   We want tax reform that is pro growth  pro jobs  pro worker  pro family and yes tax reform that is pro American   Trump  a real estate mogul turned politician who promised big tax cuts as a candidate last year  said earlier on Wednesday when asked by reporters that he personally would not stand to gain financially from the proposal   I think there s very little benefit for people of wealth   said Trump  who has refused to make public his own tax returns unlike many of his White House predecessors  Republicans have produced no major legislative successes since Trump took office in January even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress  The Republicans  top legislative priority  an overhaul of the U S  healthcare system  collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday  while another key item on Trump s wish list  infrastructure spending  has yet to materialize   A comprehensive rewrite of the U S  tax code has eluded lawmakers for decades  The last one was passed in 1986   The White House said that under the proposal typical middle class families would have less of their income subject to federal income tax  Trump noted that the first  12 000 earned by an individual and the first  24 000 by a married couple would be tax free  The plan would lower the top individual rate from to 35 percent from 39 6 percent  It foresees a 20 percent corporate income tax rate  down from the current 35 percent but not as low as Trump s initial demand for 15 percent   Companies in the United States pay high taxes by global standards but many of them pay much less than the headline rate due to loopholes and tax breaks  The proposal now faces a long legislative process that could take months  Trump has appealed to Democrats to support the plan  although they were not consulted in drafting it    HOLDING THE BAG   Under this plan  the wealthiest Americans and wealthiest corporations make out like bandits while middle class Americans are left holding the bag   said Chuck Schumer  the top Senate Democrat  Republicans hold a thin 52 48 majority in the Senate and may need some Democrats on board to win passage  But Democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy Americans rather than the middle class families that Trump and Republicans say they are trying to help    If this framework is all about the middle class  then Trump Tower is middle class housing   said Senator Ron Wyden  the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee   Kevin Brady  chairman of the tax writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee  said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year  House Speaker Paul Ryan  a Republican  said   This is a now or never moment   The White House and congressional Republicans did not give an estimate of the plan s cost or how much it might add to federal deficits  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget policy group on Wednesday estimated that the plan contains about  5 8 trillion over a decade of total tax cuts and would have a net cost of  2 2 trillion through 2027  Analysts have warned that huge tax cuts would balloon the federal deficit and debt if economic growth projected by Republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates   The tax framework would establish a 25 percent rate for business income from businesses called  pass throughs   These usually small  private enterprises represent an estimated that 95 percent of all U S  businesses  Under current tax law  business profits are  passed through  to owners as personal income  which is often taxed at the top 39 6 percent individual income tax rate   Republicans proposed eliminating some existing tax deductions  though they retain deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable deductions  They proposed scrapping the deduction for the amount a taxpayer pays in state and local taxes  which could hurt people in high tax states including California and New York that tend to vote Democratic  The plan  which would retain deductions for mortgage interest payments and charitable deductions  aims to consolidate the current seven tax brackets into three brackets of 12 percent  25 percent and 35 percent   
The proposal was embraced by the U S  Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group and an organization called the RATE Coalition representing large American companies including AT T Inc  N T   FedEx Corp  N FDX    Home Depot  Inc  N HD   General Dynamics Corp  N GD  and Walmart Stores Inc  N WMT  ",2017-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trumps-tax-plan-to-propose-deep-us-rate-cuts-lacks-revenue-details-533310,533310

149688,371204,GD,Missing from Trump s grand Navy plan  skilled workers to build the fleet,news," In March 17 item  corrects paragraph 10 to say shipyard is in Newport News  not Norfolk  By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump says he wants to build dozens of new warships in one of the biggest peace time expansions of the U S  Navy  But interviews with ship builders  unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan  The initiative could cost nearly  700 billion in government funding  take 30 years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers   many of whom don t exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained  according to the interviews and the documents reviewed  Trump has vowed a huge build up of the U S  military to project American power in the face of an emboldened China and Russia  That includes expanding the Navy to 350 warships from 275 today  He has provided no specifics  including how soon he wants the larger fleet   For graphics on projected strength of U S  Navy  shipyard employment see    The Navy has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a report that explores how the country s industrial base could support higher ship production  Admiral Bill Moran  the vice chief of Naval Operations with oversight of the Navy s shipbuilding outlook  told Reuters  He declined to give further details  But those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues   there are not enough skilled workers in the market  from electricians to welders  and after years of historically low production  shipyards and their suppliers  including nuclear fuel producers  will struggle to ramp up for years  To be sure  the first  and biggest  hurdle for Trump to overcome is to persuade a cost conscious Congress to fund the military buildup  The White House declined to comment  A Navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require  sufficient time  to allow companies to ramp up capacity  The two largest U S  shipbuilders  General Dynamics Corp  NYSE GD  and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc  told Reuters they are planning to hire a total of 6 000 workers in 2017 just to meet current orders  such as the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine  General Dynamics hopes to hire 2 000 workers at Electric Boat this year  Currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than 15 000 workers  to nearly 20 000 by the early 2030s  company documents reviewed by Reuters show  Huntington Ingalls  the largest U S  military shipbuilder  plans to hire 3 000 at its Newport News shipyard in Newport News  Virginia  and another 1 000 at the Ingalls shipyard in Mississippi this year to fulfill current orders  spokeswoman Beci Brenton said  Companies say they are eager to work with Trump to build his bigger Navy  But expanding hiring  for now  is difficult to do until they receive new orders  officials say   It s hard to look beyond  current orders  Brenton said  Smaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious   You can t hire people to do nothing   said Jill Mackie  spokeswoman for Portland  Oregon based Vigor Industrial LLC  which makes combat craft for the Navy s Special Warfare units   Until funding is there     you can t bring on more workers   SCALING UP WORKFORCE Because companies won t hire excess workers in advance  they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes  said Bryan Clark  who led strategic planning for the Navy as special assistant to the chief of Naval Operations until 2013  Union and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging  Demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as  300 000 per year  including overtime and benefits  said Danny Hendrix  the business manager at Pipeliners Local 798  a union representing 6 500 metal workers in 42 states  Much of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many can t get  said Jimmy Hart  president of the Metal Trades Department at the AFL CIO union  which represents 100 000 boilermakers  machinists  and pipefitters  among others  To help grow a larger labor force from the ground up  General Dynamics  Electric Boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in Connecticut and Rhode Island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers   It has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding   said Maura Dunn  vice president of human resources at Electric Boat  It can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds  radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclear powered submarine  said Will Lennon  vice president of the shipyard s Columbia Class submarine program  The Navy envisioned by Trump could create more than 50 000 jobs  the Shipbuilders Council of America  a trade group representing U S  shipbuilders  repairers and suppliers  told Reuters  The U S  shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly 100 000 in 2016  Labor Department statistics show  The industry had as many as 176 000 workers at the height of the Cold War in the early 1980s as the United States built up a fleet of nearly 600 warships by the end of that decade   SUBMARINE CRUNCH Apart from the labor shortage  there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the Navy  especially its submarine fleet  Expanding the Navy to 350 ships is not as simple as just adding 75 ships  Many ships in the current 275 vessel fleet need to be replaced  which means the Navy would have to buy 321 ships between now and 2046 to reach Trump s goal  the Congressional Budget Office said in a report in February  The shipyards that make nuclear submarines   General Dynamics  Electric Boat in Groton  Connecticut  and Huntington s Newport News   produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early 1980s  But for more than a decade now  the yards have not built more than two per year  The nuclear powered Virginia class and Columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build  The first Columbia submarine  which is set to begin construction in 2021  will take seven years to build  and two to three additional years to test  Retooling the long dormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments  but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain  said Clark  the former strategist for the Navy and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments  Makers of submarine components such as reactor cores  big castings  and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production  said a congressional official with knowledge of the Navy s long term planning   We have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year  You can t then just throw one or two more on top of that and say   Oh here  dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two   You just can t   the official said  In his first budget proposal to Congress on Thursday  Trump proposed boosting defense spending by  54 billion for the fiscal 2018 year   a 10 percent increase from last year  He is also seeking  30 billion for the Defense Department in a supplemental budget for fiscal 2017  of which at least  433 million is earmarked for military shipbuilding  A 350 ship Navy would cost  690 billion over the 30 year period  or  23 billion per year   60 percent more than the average funding the Navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades  the Congressional Budget Office said  Senator John McCain  chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  who will have a major say in approving the defense budget  said in a statement to Reuters that he supported Trump s vision to increase the size of the Navy to deter adversaries

149697,371213,GD,Analysts Estimate General Dynamics  GD  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects General Dynamics  GD  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  9 40 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics 
For General Dynamics  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of  2 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 56  delivering a surprise of  7 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Dynamics doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-general-dynamics-gd-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200440805,200440805
149698,371214,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"General Dynamics  GD  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 77 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 68 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 82 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of  2 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 56  delivering a surprise of 7 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
General Dynamics  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  9 56 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 19 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
General Dynamics shares have added about 18 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for General Dynamics 
While General Dynamics has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

149699,371215,GD,Why General Dynamics  GD  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
General Dynamics in Focus
Based in Falls Church  General Dynamics  GD  is in the Aerospace sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 19 36   Currently paying a dividend of  1 02 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 17   In comparison  the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield is 0 95   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 86  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 08 is up 12 4  from last year  General Dynamics has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 62   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  General Dynamics s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  GD expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 76 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 81  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  GD is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-general-dynamics-gd-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200444738,200444738

149771,371287,GD,This Is Why General Dynamics  GD  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
General Dynamics in Focus
General Dynamics  GD  is headquartered in Falls Church  and is in the Aerospace sector  The stock has seen a price change of 3 19  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 02 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 51   In comparison  the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield is 1 03   while the S P 500 s yield is 2 03  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 08 is up 12 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  General Dynamics has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 18   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  General Dynamics s payout ratio is 33   which means it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for GD for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 75 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 72  
Bottom Line

149837,371353,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"The market expects General Dynamics  GD  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 2  
Revenues are expected to be  8 89 billion  up 18  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 67  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics 
For General Dynamics  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that General Dynamics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of  2 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 07  delivering a surprise of  3 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Dynamics appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-dynamics-gd-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200407763,200407763

149839,371355,GD,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  General Dynamics  GD  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
General Dynamics in Focus
Headquartered in Falls Church  General Dynamics  GD  is an Aerospace stock that has seen a price change of 12 51  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 02 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 31   In comparison  the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield is 0 97   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 9  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 08 is up 12 4  from last year  In the past five year period  General Dynamics has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 18   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  General Dynamics s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  GD expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 73 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 55  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that GD is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-general-dynamics-gd-could-be-a-great-choice-200411786,200411786

149842,371358,GD,Mitsubishi eyes technological leap  and exports  with armored vehicle,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    In January  a top U S  Marine general visited Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan to look at a prototype of an amphibious assault vehicle that could one day be a key pillar in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s push to sell weapons abroad  Using engines adapted from the main battle tank the company makes for Japan s military and new water jet propulsion technology  the full size prototype is undergoing pool tests  although it is in the early stages of development and production could be years off  Nevertheless  the maker of the wartime Zero fighter plane is eyeing overseas sales after Abe lifted a decades old ban on arms exports in April last year as part of his more muscular security agenda  two Japanese defense industry sources said  Mitsubishi designers believe the prototype shown to U S  Marine Corps Pacific commander Lieutenant General John Toolan will be more maneuverable and faster across the water than the 40 year old AAV7 amphibious assault vehicle used to carry U S  marines onto beaches from naval ships anchored offshore  the sources said  The AAV7 is built by the U S  unit of Britain s BAE Systems  LONDON BAES   The prototype s engines in particular could be fitted onto other armored vehicles  the sources added   It s an opportunity for Mitsubishi Heavy to tap overseas markets for its engine technology   said one of the sources  who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media  Mitsubishi Heavy wants to build an amphibious armored vehicle that can move through water at 20 to 25 knots  37 to 46 km per hour  compared to the more than 7 knots  13 km per hour  reached by the AAV7  said the sources   If the Japanese can get 20 knots in the water without compromising maneuverability on land  we will be very interested   said one Marine Corps official who saw the prototype in January but declined to be identified    Whether that s possible remains to be seen   A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said the prototype had been shown to the Japanese Ministry of Defense  but declined to give details about the vehicle  At a Paris arms show last June  a suitcase sized model of an eight wheeled armored troop carrier was the centerpiece display at the company s exhibition booth  The Ministry of Defense was aware of Mitsubishi Heavy s research into amphibious vehicles but was not involved in the project  a ministry spokesman said  Manny Pacheco  a spokesman for U S  Marine Corps procurement  declined to comment on the prototype   But he said the Marine Corps was  always interested in the technological advances of industry  and encouraged manufacturers to use  every opportunity to showcase their wares and get their products submitted through our competitive procurement process   TOUGH TECHNOLOGY Amphibious vehicles are central to marine units around the world  allowing forces to operate on land and sea  But there has been little significant technological advancement in such vehicles in recent decades  A tracked Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle that was being developed for the U S  Marine Corps by U S  weapons maker General Dynamics Corp  NYSE GD  was canceled in 2011 after big cost increases and technical issues  The Marine Corps last year kicked off a competition for a new wheeled amphibious combat vehicle  ACV  that could operate on shorelines and shallow water   Pacheco said the Marine Corps was reviewing proposals from five manufacturers to build a prototype  He did not identify the companies  A feasibility study by BAE and General Dynamics had recommended against using current technology to build a vehicle in line with Marine Corps requirements  a U S  based BAE spokeswoman told Reuters   The study concluded that although the technology existed  it would not be fielded at an affordable price   she said  BAE was talking to Mitsubishi Heavy about being a potential partner on the body design of the new Japanese vehicle  the BAE spokeswoman added   General Dynamics was in similar talks with Mitsubishi Heavy  said sources in Japan  General Dynamics said it did  not have any information to provide at this time   NEED FOR SPEED Mitsubishi Heavy has been making armored vehicles for Japan s military for around 80 years  beginning with the Imperial forces in the 1930s  It also builds fighter aircraft  naval vessels  submarines and missiles  The company also makes high speed marine engines and water jet propulsion systems  according to its website   Japan s technology is good enough that we have to look at it   said a U S  military industrial source familiar with the amphibious vehicle plans  Although a coastal nation  post war Japan only formed an amphibious military unit in 2012  The 3 000 strong unit will be equipped with more than 50 AAV7s  It was disappointment at the speed of those vehicles over water that spurred Japan to build a new one  Japanese defense officials told Reuters   Japan s military is also concerned about the ability of the caterpillar tracked vehicles to ride over coral reefs  a common feature in the East China Sea  where Tokyo is embroiled in a territorial dispute with China  
The BAE spokeswoman acknowledged the desire of the U S  Marine Corps to increase water speed  adding there should be  no operational concern  with coral reefs ",2015-06-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/mitsubishi-eyes-technological-leap,-and-exports,-with-armored-vehicle-347892",347892

149864,371380,GD,U S  approves sale of  600 million in tank ammunition to Iraq,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government on Monday said it had approved the sale to Iraq of  600 million in tank ammunition manufactured by General Dynamics Corp  N GD   saying it would help the Iraqi government establish an integrated ground defense capability   Congress now has 30 days to block the sale  although such action is rare since arms deals are usually vetted carefully before a congressional notification   The Pentagon s Defense Security Cooperation Agency  or DSCA  notified lawmakers that the State Department had approved the sale of 10 000 M831 120m  high explosive anti tank munitions  10 000 M865 120mm kinetic energy warheads and 26 000 other munitions  as well as logistics services   DSCA said the prime contractor would be General Dynamics  maker of the M1A1 Abrams tank and the requested munitions   The U S  military has been conducting air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria  and is seeking to strengthen the Iraqi government so it can resist the extremists more effectively

149865,371381,GD,General Dynamics sees more demand for  insider  cyber protection,news,"By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    General Dynamics Corp  a key provider of cyber services for the U S  government  said recent high profile cyberattacks were boosting demand from government agencies for better protections against breaches by so called insiders  Nadia Short  vice president and general manager of cyber systems for General Dynamics  Mission Systems business  told Reuters in an interview this week the well publicized hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment had galvanized interest in the security of U S  government and industry computer networks  She said the Sony attack  which Washington has blamed on North Korea  was resonating with the American public in a way that earlier attacks on private companies had not  and could boost the prospects for passage of cybersecurity legislation  Short welcomed President Barack Obama s push for cybersecurity legislation and greater sharing of information by industry and government about potential threats  She said continued cyberattacks and the large number of documents leaked by former U S  National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden were prompting government agencies to beef up security against outside attackers as well as the so called insider threat  Four or five government agencies have requested information or proposals over the last six months focused on insider threat detection  Short said  She declined to name the agencies  Short said insider attacks were difficult to eliminate completely  but the company offered services that could detect unusual behaviors that almost always preceded such incidents  The company also does forensic studies when breaches occur and offers network encryption devices  she said  Even tracking printer use at unusual times or thermostat activity could help officials predict abnormal behaviors  While U S  military spending has declined in recent years  demand for cybersecurity has remained stable and even grown significantly in some areas  Short said   Like other defense contractors  General Dynamics has found it difficult to penetrate the commercial market  but Short said there was growing demand in the government sector  Short said the company s decision last fall to combine its cyber and engineering services units had given her division more breadth  access to more expertise and to new customers  and the ability to engineer more comprehensive security solutions  
 Across the board  I see this as still being a growth area for us   Short said  She declined to provide details about the amount of revenue generated in the cyber business  but said General Dynamics planned to increase investment in the sector and would likely hire more workers this year ",2015-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/general-dynamics-sees-more-demand-for-'insider'-cyber-protection-324646,324646
149886,371402,GD,Why General Dynamics  GD  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider General Dynamics  GD   This company  which is in the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 25  
For the last reported quarter  General Dynamics came out with earnings of  3 07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 98 per share  representing a surprise of 3 02   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 74 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 89 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 47  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for General Dynamics  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of  0 87  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-general-dynamics-gd-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200403186,200403186
149904,371420,GD,Weighing The Week Ahead  Is There A New Message From The Markets  ,opinion,"We have a light economic calendar and a short week  We ll get earnings reports from another 10  of S P 500 companies  With plenty of time and little fresh information  I expect plenty of pure speculation about the state of the market  This commentary will have a broad theme  with pundits asking 

Is there a new message from the markets 

Last Week Recap

In my last edition of WTWA I took note of the growing emphasis on technical indicators  even for long term investors  asking whether the 200 day moving average should be considered  As often happens these days the stories focused on political developments and the surprise Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  decision not to build a second headquarters in New York  The S P climbed above the 200 day MA on Friday without much fanfare  Next problem  please 

The Story in One Chart

I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  This week I am featuring Jill Mislinski  She includes a lot of relevant information in a single picture   worth more than a thousand words  Read the full post for more great charts and background analysis 



Stocks gained 2 5  on the week and the trading range was only a touch wider  2 66   You can see volatility comparisons in our Quant Corner  below  

For some additional perspective  here is the chart of the economic expansion 



This chart makes it clear that the rally  while long and strong overall  include major pauses and a few drawdowns along the way 

The News

Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 

When relevant  I include expectations  E  and the prior reading  P  

New Deal Democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research  This week s update notes that short term and coincident indicators have turned negative  while the long term group is still neutral  He provides the following  note of caution  in his conclusion 


A special note of caution this week  In the past several weeks a whole variety of both weekly and monthly indicators in several time frames have abruptly cratered  Part of that may be due to the  polar vortex  giving rise to 30 year low temperatures in part of the country  but I suspect that the effects of the government shutdown have been more pronounced than almost everybody thought  A similar pattern happened during the 2011  debt ceiling debacle   If so  the coincident indicators in particular should begin to bounce in the next several weeks 


The Good

The government shutdown controversy ended in compromise  This is great news for the economy and for investors 
The JOLTS report showed continuing labor market strength   The Daily Shot  



CPI and PPI both continued to show a tame increase of 0 2  for January  The PPI core was 0 3  while the headline was  0 1  
Earnings reports continue to beat expectations at a rate that is close to the five year average  Earnings are a touch below with a 70  beat rate but revenues are above  62    John Butters  FactSet  points out the much improved reaction to these reports  both beats  and misses 



China US trade  The overall news was mixed  but those worrying that the 90 day deadline was too short learned Trump might extend March 2 trade deadline  Or you could have gotten this  news  on December 6th  Below is a portion of my post on the China situation  The rest of the table is available here  along with some helpful conclusions about what to expect 


Mortgage rates continued to decline 



Mortgage delinquencies dropped to an 18 year low   Calculated Risk  



Michigan sentiment registered 95 5  E 94 P 91 2   Jill Mislinski has the story  including the low inflation expectations  As usual  she combines many key variables in a single chart 



The Bad

Initial jobless claims again moved higher   239K versus a forecast of 225K and prior of 235K 
The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index pulled back further from recent highs   101 2 versus prior of 104 4 



Industrial production declined 0 6  in January
Retail sales for December declined 1 2   Ex auto  the decline   1 8   was even greater  Expectations were for a 0 2  gain  James Picerno  The Capital Spectator  analyzes the report  shows the impact on Q4 GDP forecasts from several key sources  and provides important perspective 
It s important to recognize at this stage that slower economic growth doesn t automatically lead to a new recession in the near term  While it s impossible to rule out the possibility that the US will succumb to contraction later in the year  for the moment there s precious little hard data that shows that recession is a high probability event for the immediate future 





Eddy Elfenbein joins others in wondering how the report could be so different from other recent data  He concludes  For now  I think this is a suspect report  I want to see more data that confirms this 

The Ugly

Aurora shootings  More senseless death  Another illegal weapon  More brave first responders  Five of them were injured as they saved many other lives   Daily Herald  Chicago paper focused on the suburbs  

The Week Ahead

We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second  best is planning what to look for and how to react 

The Calendar

The calendar is light with reports all occurring in a three day segment of the holiday shortened week  There is some fresh housing data  and leading indicators can now reflect updates from estimates made during the shutdown  The favorite sport of many  parsing anything from the Fed  means that the FOMC minutes from January will get a close look 

We ll get earnings reports from another 10  of the S P 500 companies and of course  continuing political news 

Briefing com has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  Here are the main U S  releases 



Next Week s Theme

Given the light calendar and short week  there will be plenty of pages and air time to fill  This is a prime environment for the punditry to speculate about what is moving the market and what comes next  With the big week for stocks and weak retail sales  I expect many to be wondering 

Are markets sending a new message 

I riffed on this theme a month ago  at the start of earnings season  At that time most were  explaining  that stocks were warning of a recession  despite what economic data might show  With the market rally  there are some fresh lines in the debate 

The pundit in chief still sees economic weakness in his calls with small retail companies  We were saved when the Fed took his advice and switched course on interest rates  He is available to be Fed chair if needed  and he would do the sort of research that is really required  Summary  A complex rationalization of a conflicting position  Paul Schatz has a nice roundup of key technical factors and the stubborn positions of traders who are unwilling to admit error  He writes about one such example as follows 
Another joker I was on Fox Business with cries everyday stocks rally that it s all just manipulation  It s all fake he says  As long as people disavow this rally  it is going to continue 


Those on my  reliably bearish commentary  Twitter list have switched from emphasizing the market to emphasizing economic data  They are on a mission to find something wrong to describe every day  I often respond or comment  but this seems to be a waste of time   To see this and other lists  just go to  dashofinsight on Twitter  go to my profile  and choose  list   While you are there  please  follow  me  I m still way behind Kim and the Real Donald  Suggestions for new list memberships are most welcome  

Brian Gilmartin made a similar effort with his polite treatment of a chart that is Silver Bullet material  He then did his own analysis of an objective question   how far ahead markets are looking  See his post for a discussion of the key factors and his conclusion that a decline in Q119 earnings is already in the market  Here is the chart in question  I am confident that the WTWA readership can spot the errors 



Stocks often rise even when there is the  dreaded earnings recession  notes Ben Carlson  He looks at a lot of data and offers explanations for various time periods  He does not see a relationship between earnings growth and stock performance 
Despite the rally since December  Scott Grannis concludes that investors  are still acting more out of caution than greed or optimism   He sees no euphoria   just reduced worries 

As always  I ll have my own conclusions in today s Final Thought

Insight for Investors

Investors should embrace volatility  They should join my delight in a well documented list of worries  As the worries  shutdown  Fed policy  trade  are addressed or even resolved  the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely 

Best of the Week
If I had to recommend a single  must read article for this week  it would be Prof  Tim Duy s Beware of a Recessionary Bias Among Analysts  This problem is the biggest current challenge for individual investors  and Tim does his typical first rate job of explaining the issue  One must understand that a soft patch need not lead to a recession  Importantly  do not project much from a single data point  He gently  cautions against  this type of analysis 


He then shows that the recent decline is from a surprising mid year jump  that the long term trend is intact  and that this is not really a leading indicator  You will enjoy his charts  Please also note the widespread circulation of the Rosenberg assertion 
Stock Ideas

Abnormal Returns is an important daily source for all of us following investment news  I read it daily  finding many good ideas  His Wednesday personal finance theme is of special interest for investors  Among the usual collection of excellent choices  I especially liked the Kiplinger article  Social Security Scams Are a Growing Threat  The scammers are finding ever more creative ways to steal from the elderly  Read the article to learn some simple and easy protective steps 
Watch out for 
Mutual fund redemptions  Most of us do not worry about this issue  but Morningstar identifies the situations where there may be some danger  Problems can occur when the fund is excessively invested in illiquid securities and redemptions rise rapidly  This is a rare problem  but it does not hurt to know the signs 
Helpers bearing advice  Demonetized borrows the Warren Buffett terminology to analyze the transactional financial salesperson  Drawing upon his own experience  he reaches some great conclusions  including this one  Where you run into trouble is when you mistake a TRANSACTIONAL relationship for a FIDUCIARY relationship 
Final Thought
I placed special emphasis on the economic news this week  Understanding the economic indicators and trends helps keep investors on the right track  Without this perspective it is easy to overreact to a single bad report or even a small decline from a peak  Don t get fooled by a chart with a big red arc over the recent peak and an arrow pointing sharply lower  Every big decline starts at a peak  of course  but some precede plateaus or new peaks  Only time and more information will help determine which 
 Davidson   via Todd Sullivan  has a great track record bolstered by analysis which makes sense  He is a rare exception to my rule about using anonymous sources  mostly because I recognize good work when I see it  I also have Todd s assurances that he is  the real deal  
He notes that analyzing economic context and valuing stocks are the two key elements of investing  What is left out  Market psychology  He writes 

History records that markets have always responded after the fact  Investors have never missed an opportunity to profit once the opportunity is recognized  They have also routinely chased investments they believed might have but did not eventually have fundamental returns  The pessimism since Oct 2018 that a recession is looming provides the best opportunity in  6yrs years for investors  There are many individual opportunities which appear attractive 

Contrast this with much of the pundit commentary  I watched a Bloomberg segment featuring a top executive from one of the big firms  He discussed the decline in earnings growth  emphasizing how tough the comparisons were going to be next year  Complete absent from his analysis was the stellar earnings growth in 2018 with no boost in stocks  Take another look at the long term chart at the beginning of this post and the data from Brian Gilmartin  Now suppose that we considered earnings growth over a multi year period  not separately for 2017  2018  and 2019 
Focusing only on growth imputes legitimacy to the start of the comparison period  That is often quite wrong 
If you watch for this  you will see many examples of this shallow approach to the data 
 I agree with  Davidson  that there are many individual opportunities  If you need help in finding some  send us an email to main at newarc dot com  We can also discuss your personal risk control needs  or our popular yield enhancement program  
I m more worried about 
Budget deficits and government debt  I don t mind a reasonable deficit when times are tough  That is when demand for services is greatest and counter cyclical policy most helpful  When times are good  it is time to reduce debt  William G  Gale  Econofact  has an excellent and readable discussion 
Crumbling infrastructure 
I m less worried about

149918,371434,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"General Dynamics  GD  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 07 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 98 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 50 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 02   A quarter ago  it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of  2 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 89  delivering a surprise of 5 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
General Dynamics  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  10 38 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 89   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 28 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
General Dynamics shares have added about 12  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 3  
What s Next for General Dynamics 
While General Dynamics has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Union Pacific   NYSE UNP    AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   and General Dynamics   NYSE GD   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Top Research Reports for Union Pacific  AbbVie and General DynamicsThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Union Pacific  AbbVie and General Dynamics  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy rankedUnion Pacific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry   20 4  vs   12   in the past year  Union Pacific reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018  Both the metrics also increased year over year  Higher freight revenues on the back of volume growth aided top line growth For 2019  the company anticipates volumes to increase in the low single digit range  The Zacks analyst thinks Union Pacific s efforts to reward its shareholders are encouraging  Notably  the company has hiked dividends thrice since November 2017 Improvement in operating ratio and low tax rates are added positives  Its efforts to promote safety are noteworthy as well  However  high debt levels and operating expenses are concerns  Escalated capital expenditures are contributing to rise in costs Shares of AbbVie have lost  29 6  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s decline of  1 2   AbbVie missed estimates for earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks AbbVie s key drug  Humira has been performing well in the United States based on strong demand trends despite new competition Moreover  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  Mavyret saw a stronger than expected launch and has become a significant contributor to sales  AbbVie has also been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential expected to be launched in the near term  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets will be a big headwind in 2019  Also costs to support expected new product line extension launches are likely to hurt profits in 2019 General Dynamics  shares have lost  23 2  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry s decrease of  6 3   General Dynamics ended fourth quarter 2018 with both earnings and revenues surpassing expectations The Zacks analyst thinks the company enjoys solid demand for its varied defense products leading to organic growth  whereas a notable acquisition strategy adds to inorganic growth  The company is on track to achieve FAA type certification for its G600 aircraft later this year  which is expected to enter service in 2019 These new jets are likely to be significantly accretive in terms of revenues as well as earnings for the company  once they become available to global customers  Moreover  a comparative analysis of the company s historical EV EBITDA ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investors  concern Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Total System Services  NYSE TSS  and C H  Robinson  CHRW  Looking for Stocks with

149950,371466,GD,General Dynamics  GD  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"General Dynamics  GD  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 8  
Revenues are expected to be  10 29 billion  up 24 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Dynamics 
For General Dynamics  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that General Dynamics would post earnings of  2 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 89  delivering a surprise of  5 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
General Dynamics doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-dynamics-gd-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200378452,200378452

149973,371489,GD,Will General Dynamics  GD  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  General Dynamics  GD   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This defense contractor has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9 36  
For the last reported quarter  General Dynamics came out with earnings of  2 89 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 74 per share  representing a surprise of 5 47   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 49 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 82 per share  delivering a surprise of 13 25  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for General Dynamics lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of  1 35  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 23  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

research reports on 16 major stocks  including UnitedHealth  Amgen and United Technologies  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Buy rated UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry in the last year  up  53 2  vs   52 9    The company s fourth quarter earnings beat expectations and grew year over year  led by higher revenues in both its segments and membership growth The Zacks analyst likes the company s robust Government business and continued strong growth at Optum  Its international business and strong capital position that allows for business investment are the other positives  It has been witnessing an increase in membership for several years The company has raised its 2018 earnings guidance  led by tax reform upside  Nevertheless  membership loss in its fee based commercial and Brazilian businesses may pull down overall membership growth Shares of Amgen have gained  21 3  over the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry  which has gained  4 2  over the same period  Amgen is well positioned for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio  Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are performing well Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline including biosimilar drugs  Additionally  the Zacks analyst thinks Amgen s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient  The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters  Estimate movement has been mixed ahead of the company s Q4 earnings release However  the company has some challenges in store  given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature drugs  Also the softness in Enbrel sales due to stiff competitive and pricing pressure is a key cause for concern  Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions Buy rated United Technologies  shares have outperformed the Zacks Conglomerates sector in the last six months  the stock is up  10  vs  the  3 8  decline for the sector   United Technologies remains focused on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum  flawless execution  innovation for growth  structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation The Zacks analyst thinks the acquisition of Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL  will offer the company bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as the combined entity would emerge as one of the largest global aircraft equipment manufacturers  The company s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery  and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market Management further increased its guidance for 2017 on healthy growth dynamics  However  United Technologies is exposed to market price volatility and availability risks related to raw materials  which hamper its ability to meet delivery schedules and increase operating costs Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CSX Corporation and General Dynamics Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric

150185,371701,GD,Defense Stocks Reporting Q4 Earnings Jan  24  GD  HXL,opinion,"The fourth quarter earnings season has gathered steam with 53 S P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 19  So far  the results reflect a positive view of corporate earnings  with tax cuts driving earnings estimates  As the reporting cycle gets underway  the earnings scenario will most likely show more favorable trends 
Notably  annual earnings for the 53 index members that have released their Q4 result have improved 11 7   while revenues increased 7 5   The beat ratio for the bottom line was 81 1   while that for top line was 75 5   as of Jan 19 
Coming to the   none of the stocks have reported their Q4 results so far  However  considering the inherent stability of this industry  projections for the   one of the 16 Zacks sector   which constitutes the Aerospace Defense industry  hint at an impressive quarter  when compared to its Q3 performance 
Evidently  the sector s earnings are likely to improve 6 6  on 5 7  higher revenues in the fourth quarter  In the third quarter earnings for this sector declined 6 8  on 4 4  sales growth  For more details on quarterly releases  you can go through our latest  
Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter  courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump  A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks  With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor  defense stocks are likely to gain traction in the coming days  Moreover  growing international market for weaponries with more developing nations expanding their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry s growth 
With almost 262 companies  81 S P 500 members  slated to report their Q4 results this week  let s find out where the following defense stocks stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Jan 24 
General Dynamics Corp    NYSE GD   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 70  in the last quarter  Notably  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 3 44  
Order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception  In this line  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s fourth quarter sales is  8 4 billion  reflecting 2 5  year over year growth 
However  unfavorable margins may impact its Aerospace segment s results  Evidently  fourth quarter consensus estimate for the segment s revenues is pegged at  1 930 million  reflecting a year over year decline of 13 2   Segment wise  other three business units of General Dynamics indicate positive annual sales growth  considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate 
Per our proven model  a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Impressively  General Dynamics constitutes that right combination 
Notably  the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 19   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  read more    General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

   Hexcel Corporation   NYSE HXL   posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 90  in the prior quarter  However  the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  the average negative surprise being 0 38  
The Earnings ESP for Hexcel Corp  is  3 74   because the Most Accurate estimate of 67 cents per share is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  4 
Therefore  our proven model does not conclusively show that Hexcel Corp  is likely to beat earnings this quarter Hexcel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

150279,371795,GD,Can Submarine Deals Lift General Dynamics   GD  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation   NYSE GD   is scheduled to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 25  before the opening bell We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon to drive the company s revenues in the third quarter  However  Aerospace segment is expected to face margin pressure in the second half of the year  which is reflected in third quarter sales estimate for this unit Let s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics  quarterly results String of Contracts to Boost GrowthA scrumptious order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States tend to boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception  In this line  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s third quarter sales is  7 9 billion  reflecting 2 1  year over year growth Notably  the significant contract that General Dynamics secured in the third quarter  include a  5 1 billion special incentives contract to complete the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia class ballistic missile submarines  SSBNs   a modification contract worth  115 3 million for offering additional lead yard services  development studies and design efforts to support Virginia class submarines and a contract worth  310 6 million to design  develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3 General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    The company also won a  341 2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent  planning yard  engineering and technical support for in service nuclear submarines and another modification contract worth  109 2 million for procuring Hydra rockets Being one of the top notch submarine contractors in the nation  such contracts are expected to bolster the company s Marine Systems segment s growth  Evidently  our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems  sales stands at  2 068 million  up 0 2  annually Will Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport  During second quarter earnings call  General Dynamics  management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment s sales growth in the second half of the year  citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport  In line with this expectation  our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at  2 039 million  reflecting a year over year decline of 9 2   Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 10 4  to  398 million  per our consensus estimate Although the company continues to boast a strong forte in the Gulfstream business  which exhibits a strong pipeline growth  a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment s overall third quarter growth  Other Factors at PlaySegment wise  other two business units of General Dynamics indicate higher annual sales growth  considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate On the flip side  the company s services business is expected to deliver weak performance due to slow execution of programs in several civilian agencies  owing to uncertainty and  in some cases  reduction in funding levels For the to be reported quarter  our consensus estimate for General Dynamics  earnings is pegged at  2 43 per share  down 2 14  year over year Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter  Notably  a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  General Dynamics possess both of these attributes  as mentioned below Zacks ESP  General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of  0 37   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 44  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 43  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII   is expected to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 8  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 04  and a Zacks Rank  2 Leidos Holdings  Inc    NYSE LDOS   is expected to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 2  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 75  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Recent Peer ReleaseTextron Inc    NYSE TXT   recently reported third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 65 cents per share  beating the Zacks

150601,372117,GD,3 Defense Stocks Set To Beat Earnings In Q1,opinion,With the Q1 earnings season off to a good start this year  the overall outlook for this reporting cycle has definitely improved buoyed by expectations of higher earnings as well as revenue growth compared to the prior quarter  As far as the defense sector is concerned  stocks in this space have been rallying over the past few months  courtesy of the  big  spending promises made by President Trump Evidently  major indices like the S P 500 Aerospace   Defense Index as well as the Dow Jones U S  Aerospace   Defense Index rallied around 7  in the first quarter  Rising geopolitical uncertainties throughout the globe is expected to help defense companies maintain their outperformance in Q1 Budget Proposals   Other DevelopmentsOn Mar 16  Trump unveiled the Pentagon s fiscal 2018  FY 2018  defense budget proposal of  639 billion  This reflects a  52 billion increase over the fiscal 2017 current budget level of  587 billion  Moreover  the base budget of FY 2018 reflects a 10  increase from the current level Trump also proposed an increase in the current fiscal s defense budget by  30 billion    24 9 billion in base budget and  5 1 billion in overseas funds  This also takes into account an additional  3 billion fund for the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  for urgent border protection activities  Without a doubt  approval of these proposals will significantly drive profits for defense companies Last month  Trump urged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO member nations to contribute more to the organization s defense funds  He expressed his disapproval of how a few nations owe  vast sums  to the U S  and NATO Although Trump s comments were widely criticized  since U S  is the largest contributor to NATO  about 72    his pressure on other members to spend more on defense is expected to increase defense funds for the allied members as a whole  Clearly  defense biggies in the U S  that generate a substantial share of their revenues from international customers will be direct beneficiaries In addition  macroeconomic statistics like improving employment in the private sector  more or less stabilized oil price over the past few months  and increasing core consumer price inflation boosted consumer confidence and is being reflected in increased consumer spending  In fact  in Jan 2017  the U S  personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index increased 0 4    the highest since Feb 2013   after the 0 2  hike in December In fact  pinning hopes on Trump s supply side economic reforms  economists expect the nation to witness 2 3  growth in 2017 as compared to 1 9  growth last year  Consequently  investors who have been fretting over sluggish growth in the U S  last year  have regained confidence in the market Although rising interest rates continue to be a spoilsport for this sector  its non cyclical feature helps overcome all oddities Picking the Right Stocks     With the existence of a number of industry players  finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task  Our proprietary methodology  however  makes it fairly simple for you  You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement  It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  Our ChoicesGiven below are three defense primes that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII     Newport News  VA  based Huntington Ingalls is the largest military shipbuilder in the U S  It designs  builds and maintains nuclear powered ships such as aircraft carriers and submarines  and non nuclear ships  such as surface combatants  expeditionary warfare

Time to Buy or Sell Defense Stocks 

	When the recent U S  election sent up a surprise Presidency  we got this old bull market to spring back to life 

Here are 3 key parts to the latest rally 

	Number One  

	A Republican President and Republican control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives means the chance of passing a spending bill is much higher  That led scores of covering analysts to raise EPS estimates on companies that can benefit   in particular from more Infrastructure or Defense spending  There may also be less regulation on the Health Care and Financial sectors 

	Number Two  

	Higher expected spending and lower taxes by the soon to be installed federal government has been the main driver behind recent bond investor transactions  They sold their U S  Treasuries to buy stocks or move to cash or alternatives  T bond selling pushed risk free federal government bond interest rates sharply higher  Remember  T bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions 

	However  there is a bearish Number Three  

	The Equity Market sky is not clear to the horizon  Respected market strategists have spoken up with meaningful concern  This fearless stock market looks to be underestimating the possibility of President Trump rattling risk markets during his 4 year term  He remains unpredictable 

	There are big GDP growth negatives to higher long term bond rates  Think about the pace of house buying and the effects of a stronger U S  dollar  There are also negatives to less regulation  Recall the wonderful poorly regulated securitized mortgage markets in 2006 

	The best Bull example in this recent phenomenon may be Defense stocks 

	The 13 company strong Zacks Aerospace Defense industry has been bid up in recent trading  gratis the widely covered Trump rally  We can thank the ETF industry for the broad  ebullient share price pick up 

	However  Industry EPS fundamentals help keep these shares aloft  too  The current Aerospace Defense Zacks Industry Rank comes in at a terrific  35 out of 265  rising  12 industry spots more in recent weeks  Covering analysts raised their estimates 40 times during this time period  with only 5 cutting estimates  That s the  Number One  Trump rally evidence I m talking about 

Should you buy now        Not If Zacks Valuation scores are too high on the given stock 

	I say sell and take profits on the largest Defense players if they get poor Zacks Value scores like D  Once significant profit taking occurs  you might want to dip a toe in the water 

	Bone up on the smaller less known Aerospace Defense players  Find one that looks relatively more attractive

150717,372233,GD,Markets Price In Democratic Lead  6 Clinton Friendly Stocks,opinion,"Major U S  benchmarks witnessed an impressive recovery from losses on Monday following the news that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton will not be charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Clinton s presidency campaign as well as the U S  stock markets had taken a major hit in the past few days on the news of the FBI probing Clinton s new emails related to its investigation  of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server  
The investigating agency s clean report came as a sigh of relief for both Clinton and major benchmarks  While the stock markets registered the biggest one day gain in more than seven months on Monday  the fear gauge  CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  plunged nearly 17  following nine straight sessions of gains  Though recently released poll results indicate a close contest  most of the polls show that Clinton has a marginal lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump 
Given this backdrop  it will be interesting to find out which sectors are poised to gain the most if Clinton emerges victorious 
Sectors to Benefit if Clinton Wins
Solar
Solar companies are expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries if Clinton manages to win the election  One of the biggest agendas of her campaign was the installation of 500 million solar panels throughout the country by 2020  In one of the presidential debates  Clinton said she will try to  grip  and  deal  with the climate change by installing  a half a billion more solar panels   She also added that by doing the same   we can have enough clean energy to power every home  
If this happens  then the solar capacity in the U S  will expand nearly 5 7 times from the current level  In addition to this  several initiatives of the federal government  which include extension of tax credits for solar installation  are also expected to provide a boost to this sector  The impressive outlook for the sector bodes well for solar companies such as SolarCity Corp    NASDAQ SCTY   and Enphase Energy  Inc    NASDAQ ENPH    These two companies also hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   indicating their bright prospects in the near future 
Hospital
Though Clinton s victory may have a negative impact on drugs manufacturers given her intention to put a stop on charging excess prices for drugs  hospital operators might benefit from her presidency  Clinton is expected to expand the number of enrollees under Obamacare at more affordable premiums  She promised to reduce the premiums from the current 9 66  to not more than 8 5  if she wins the election 
She said   I ve fought for quality  affordable health care my entire career  As president  I ll defend the Affordable Care Act  build on its successes  and go even further to reduce costs   Though insurance companies are expected to get affected if expansion of enrollees under the Obamacare truly takes place  companies that are engaged in managing hospitals will likely get a boost 
Some of these companies include HCA Holdings  Inc    NYSE HCA   and LifePoint Health  Inc    NASDAQ LPNT    While HCA Holdings operates general  acute care hospitals throughout the U S   LifePoint Health is involved in operations of community hospitals  regional health systems  physician practices  outpatient centers  and post acute facilities across the nations  Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank  2 
Defense
Clinton has talked about  spending and ending defense sequesters cuts  She argued   The sequester makes our country less secure  Let s end it and get a budget deal that supports America s military  our families and our country   Meanwhile  her strong intentions to put an end to terrorism and pledge to take steps to cut down cyber security threats are expected to have a positive impact on the defense sector 
Meanwhile  several actions taken by her in the past as Secretary of State  which include supporting intervention of the U S  in Libya and arming Syrian rebels to stand against ISIS  also indicate that Clinton s win will be a boon for the sector  Companies in the space like Engility Holdings  Inc    NYSE EGL   and General Dynamics Corp    NYSE GD   are thus poised to gain if Clinton wins the election  WhileEngility Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   General Dynamics has a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

151059,372575,GD,TransDigm  TDG  Q3 Earnings Beat  Sales Rise Y Y  View Up,opinion,After a strong beat last quarter  TransDigm Group Incorporated   NYSE TDG   followed up with another striking beat in its third quarter fiscal 2016 results  The company raised its fiscal 2016 guidance as well The aircraft supplier posted adjusted quarterly earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of  2 94 per share  trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 80 by 5  The figures fared even better in the year over year comparison  registering an increase of almost 37 4  from the year ago tally of  2 14 per share Net income for the quarter came in at  140 6 million  up a whopping 41 9  from the comparable quarter a year ago  The increase in income was driven primarily by growth in net sales  robust performance in the company s commercial aftermarket segment and successful cost productivity efforts  Lower interest expenses and refinancing costs added to earnings growth Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter came in at  797 7 million  representing a year over year growth of 15 4   The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  822 million Despite the miss  the company s organic net sales grew about 8 3  in the quarter  Strong growth in commercial aftermarket revenues  up about 8  from the prior year  contributed to the top line  Commercial OEM also contributed to the top line expansion  growing 4  year over year  Even Defense revenues jumped back on the growth track  rising 3  over the comparable period last year TransDigm s EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  escalated 26 5  year over year to  344 6 million  driven by robust sales and strong gross margin expansion AcquisitionsContinuing with its robust acquisition strategy  TransDigm wrapped up the purchase of ILC Holdings Inc   the parent company of defense firm Data Device Corporation   DDC   for  1 billion  during the quarter  DDC is a provider of data networking  power control and motion control products and software for the defense  aerospace and industrial industries  The firm boasts a strong presence across key military aircraft platforms and a growing presence in the commercial aircraft market  The deal will help TransDigm expand its footprint in the market of highly engineered  proprietary products with significant aftermarket content  while strengthening its presence in the military and commercial aircraft market Just last quarter  TransDigm acquired Breeze Eastern Corporation  which designs and manufactures mission critical electromechanical systems  for about  205 million  The acquisition will strengthen TransDigm s foothold in the aerospace industry  especially in the niche markets of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components Liquidity   Share RepurchasesTransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 67 billion  significantly up from  714 million as of Sep 30  2015  The company boosted its cash balance through an offering of additional term loans of  950 million  a private offering of  950 million  higher commitments on its revolving credit facility and some debt refinancing  The proceeds from the above actions were partly used to fund the purchase price of the DDC acquisition The company s long term debt was  9 95 billion at the end of the quarter compared with  8 11 billion at the end of Sep 2015 In fiscal 2016 so far  the company has repurchased 1 015 387 shares for an aggregate cost of about  208 million  The company had authorized a new share repurchase plan during the last quarter  comprising buyback of shares worth approximately  450 million  and roughly  341 million worth of shares remain under the new authorization Fiscal 2016 Guidance Raised AgainTransDigm raised its top line and earnings guidance for fiscal 2016 once again  incorporating the effect of the DDC acquisition  the present market scenario as well its recent operational performance For fiscal 2016  the company upped its guidance for net sales from previous expectations of  3 151  3 181 million to a range of  3 170  3 190 million Also  it now expects adjusted earnings to come in a range of  11 21  11 39 per share  up from the prior projections of  11 04  11 28 TRANSDIGM GROUP Price and Consensus   Our TakeAfter displaying erratic growth trends over a number of quarters  we believe that TransDigm is on a solid growth track again  Improvement in the commercial aftermarket  coupled with significant uptick in defense bookings bode well for its growth picture in the coming quarters  In addition  the aircraft business is taking off globally  and TransDigm is well placed to capitalize on the growth TransDigm s acquired businesses will likely continue being strong growth drivers in the coming times  Further  the company s efforts to streamline costs will likely translate into strong margin expansion in the quarters ahead TransDigm presently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense space include Ducommun Inc    NYSE DCO    KLX Inc    NASDAQ KLXI   and General Dynamics Corporation   NYSE GD    each

5 Low Leverage Bargain Stocks to Buy Now

	 Leverage  is a term used casually and frequently in everyday business  but deep down it is of grave importance  Basically  leverage  better known as financial leverage  refers to the use of debt financing by any corporation to boost its business  Although companies also have the option to resort to equity financing  the majority of them see debt financing as a more viable choice 

	This is because debt financing brings in money at a lower cost than equity financing  especially in periods of historically low interest rates  However  too much debt can turn out to be detrimental for any business 

	Particularly  it is better to avoid companies bearing a high degree of financial leverage as they are the most vulnerable ones in times of financial distress and may even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario 

	Considering this  it is reasonable to conclude that investors should measure the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing before putting their hard earned money in its stock  Several leverage ratios have been constructed for this purpose  debt to equity ratio being the most popular among them 

Analyzing the Ratio

	Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity

	This metric is a liquidity ratio that reflects how much debt a company currently bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a comparatively less risky business and thereby greatly contributes to an investor s confidence in a company s financial stability 

	With the second quarter earnings season on the last lap  investors must be flocking to high earnings yielding companies  However  it will be rather stupid to target stocks exhibiting a surge in earnings only  This because if a stock has a high debt to equity ratio  its so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare any time soon 

	So instead of choosing companies bearing high earnings growth  low leverage stocks should be ideal investment choices  for a sensible investor 

Picking the Right Strategy

	Choosing stocks based solely on one financial metric might not fetch the desired outcome 

	To ensure the maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure to include some other criteria  Particularly  we added a low P E ratio and a favorable to the screen to shortlist cheap stocks 

	Here are the parameters 

Debt Equity less than X Industry Median    Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers 

Current Price greater than or equal to 10    The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above 

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000    A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median    Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation 

Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5    This shows earnings growth expectation 

Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success 

Value Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

P E  using F1 estimates  less than or equal to 16   This selects undervalued stocks 

	Although 14 stocks passed the screen  we have eliminated those that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio 

	Here are five stocks from the final eight 

Omega Protein Corporation       This renowned producer of a custom line of omega 3 fish oil  protein rich specialty fish meal and organic fish solubles currently sports a Zacks Rank  1 and witnessed a 6  improvement in its current year consensus estimate in the last 30 days 

General Dynamics Corporation       This global aerospace and defense company  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  witnessed a 1 1  improvement in its current year consensus estimate in the last 30 days 

Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd        This international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products carries a Zacks Rank  1  Last quarter  this company witnessed a 61 5  of positive earnings surprise 

Stepan Company       This chemical solutions corporation holds a Zacks Rank  1 and witnessed a 6 9  improvement in its current year consensus estimate in the last 30 days 

CONE Midstream Partners LP       This company develops natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets and currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  It witnessed a 2 8  improvement in its current year consensus estimate in the last 30 days

In March  the board of directors increased the company s quarterly dividend by 10 1  to  0 76 per share  representing the company s 25th consecutive annual dividend increase  General Dynamics may well soon become the newest Dividend Aristocrat 
Also  the company repurchased 7 8 million of its outstanding shares in the first quarter  The forward annual dividend yield is at 2 2   and the payout ratio is only 30   The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 10 6   over the past five years was also high at 10 4   and over the last ten years was very high at 13 2  
Since General Dynamics is generating much free cash flow  and the payout ratio is low  there is a very good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment

General Dynamics Is Off To A Good Start in 2016
In December 2015  Congress passed an FY16 defense budget of  573 billion   38 billion higher than the base recommendation  That helped lay the foundation for General Dynamics success in 2016 
The company has had a very good start to the year  better than its expectations  General Dynamics delivered strong first quarter results  and according to the company  it is ahead of the operating plan on which its guidance was based 
General Dynamics has been able to achieve growth in the last few years despite budget cutting headwinds  In 2015  the company derived 55  of its revenues from the U S  government  compared to 58  in 2014 
However  recent budget trends have been supportive for the industry 
Department of Defense forecasts calls for additional increases of 2  through 2020  The 2016 budget includes modernizing investments in such areas as nuclear deterrence  missile defense  cyber security and power projection  As such  that development will benefit the company 
On April 27  General Dynamics reported strong first quarter 2016 financial results  which beat earnings per share expectations by  0 18  8 3    The company posted revenues of  7 72 billion in the quarter  also surpassing the consensus estimate of  7 68 billion 
GD has shown earnings per share surprise in all its last five quarters  as shown in the table below

In the report  Phebe N  Novakovic  chairman and chief executive officer  said 

General Dynamics delivered a strong first quarter  with all four groups contributing to our outstanding operating performance  We generated positive operating leverage and achieved the sixth straight quarter with operating earnings of more than one billion dollars 

Although General Dynamics  revenues have been flat in the last few years due to U S  government budget cutting  in my view  it is very encouraging that the company has been able to grow profits by improving operating margins 
Revenue in the first quarter of  7 724 million was down 0 8  from the same quarter a year ago while operating earnings of  1 053 million were up 2 5  due to better operating margin which was up 0 4  year over year  Moreover  three of the company s four business groups expanded margins over the year ago period

Rising margins will help to increase growth  The company s annual average earnings per share growth over the last five years was at 5 9   and the average annual estimated earnings per share growth for the next five years is better at 8 8  
General Dynamics has four primary business segments 
Aerospace
Combat Systems
Marine Systems
Information Systems and Technology
Segment revenues and operating earnings for the first quarter of 2016 are shown in the chart below

In addition  General Dynamics has a strong balance sheet  At the end of the first quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  2 8 billion and total debt of  3 4 billion  The total debt to equity ratio was low at 0 32 
Net cash provided by operating activities in the recent quarter totaled  439 million  Free cash flow from operations  defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  was  374 million 
General Dynamic s Outlook   Backlog
According to the company  it does not  as a practice  change guidance at the end of the first quarter  It is its practice and has been for many years  to give a full review of its expectation at the midpoint of the year 
However  on the first quarter conference call  CEO Novakovic said that the company is ahead of the operating plan on which its guidance was based 
Management s initial estimates  established during the fourth quarter 2015 conference call  were for revenue of  31 6  31 8 billion and an operating margin of 13 3   Management also expected earnings per share of  9 20  up just 1  from 2015 due to higher expected interest expense  a higher tax rate  and currency headwinds 
However  General Dynamics has been conservative in its guidance which has resulted in beating expectations quarter after quarter  Therefore  I assume that the company will post better results for the year than those indicated in its latest guidance 
General Dynamics also had a massive backlog at the end of the first quarter  and it has gained some sizable contracts since then 
According to the company  there was order activity across the Gulfstream product portfolio and strong demand for defense products  which resulted in a book to bill ratio  orders divided by revenue  of one to one in the Combat Systems group and greater than one to one in the Information Systems and Technology group 
Total potential contract value  the sum of all backlog components  was  89 2 billion at the end of the quarter  compared to  90 6 billion at the end of the prior quarter and  96 1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015  Backlog according to company s segments at the end of the first quarter is shown in the chart below
