well  The S P 500 Index  which closed at another fresh high of 3 224 01 in yesterday s trading session  has roughly increased 29  on a year to date basis and is headed for its biggest annual gain since 2013 Preliminary U S  China trade truce over import duties  mild relaxations in Brexit uncertainty and the Federal Reserve s three consecutive rate cuts provided a boost to the S P 500  pushing it to fresh record highs in consecutive sessions While the S P 500 is notching all time highs and is up for a record setting 2019  the  has trailed the index so far this year  Year to date  the sector has gained 18   underperforming the S P s rally With just a few days left before we ring in the New Year  it seems to be the right time to reflect on how the auto sector has fared so far in 2019 and the way it s poised for 2020 Auto Sector Lags S P 500 in 2019 Amid Headwinds The auto sector  being consumer cyclical  is dependent on business cycle and economic conditions  While the U S  economy is growing at a steady pace  many emerging economies like Brazil  India and China  among others  snagged in the slowdown  This has weighed on the auto sector  Dwindling vehicle sales  fierce industry competition  trade tensions  mounting production  and R D costs for shift toward electric and autonomous future are keeping margins under pressure for automakers A study by Fitch Ratings claims that global car sales are anticipated to fall around 4  year over year in 2019  marking the biggest decline since 2008  Declining sales in China  which is the world s largest auto market  is the key factor to impact the worldwide demand of car sales  Carmakers in China  which are battling an unprecedented slump amid economic slowdown concerns  are expected to witness a second straight annual drop in vehicle sales in 2019  New emission standards  weak credit growth  and rise in ride sharing services and used car sales are weighing on the demand for new vehicle sales  Sales in the United States are witnessing a declining trend and vehicle sales are expected to drop 2  year over year in 2019  per Fitch Ratings  Year to date vehicle sales in Brazil  Russia and India have declined 5 5  year over year A shift toward electric and self driving vehicles has made it necessary for automakers to reorient their business model  Technological development with regard to electric  autonomous and connected cars demand huge investment  and even the auto biggies are struggling to generate solid margins amid high capex Plagued by the headwinds  the auto sector s 2019 earnings are expected to decline 13 2  year over year  per the latest  report Will Auto Sector Improve in 2020 The U S  Sino trade tensions  which had been building pressure on automakers for long  are now abating  as the countries have reached a preliminary agreement  Improving domestic economy  rising wage growth and low unemployment levels are expected to provide some respite to the sector in the New Year However  certain challenges will prevail  Notably  Fitch Ratings does not expect any sharp rebound in auto sales in 2020 either Importantly  car companies have to develop and upgrade their offerings to remain on par with the evolving trends in the automotive market  All these challenges require increased research   development  R D  spending to design innovative products  as well as set up production lines to manufacture the same  Considering the changing dynamics  strategic alliances among automakers are likely to gather steam in the upcoming year to effectively share R D costs to fund new technologies  The recent Fiat Chrysler   NYSE FCAU   PSA Groupe merger deal is likely to herald further tie ups in the near future From a future competitive standpoint  carmakers will have to balance revenue generation with broader challenges and escalating expenses  Eventually  the sector s success will depend on how well the players manage escalating costs incurred for mass manufacturing and evolving

9461,230976,SPAR,5 Russell 2000 Stocks That Crushed The Index This Year,opinion,The U S  economy has witnessed several ups and downs this year  While weak global economic growth outlook weighed on the stocks  federal measures like rate cuts boosted the domestic economy  Markedly  after 17 months  trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are slowly easing  giving ample boost to the stock market  Let s delve into the factors that had significant impact on the economy this year  which moved the stock market Factors Influencing the Economy Slowing Trade ConflictsIn the past several quarters  the United States and China levied tariffs on each other s goods  which resulted in a slowdown in global economy  As expected  this significantly affected the stock market  However  with the two big economies agreeing to the terms of a historic phase one trade deal  investors are hopeful for better days ahead As part of the agreement  the United States will likely halve the 15  tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods worth  120 billion  Moreover  it called off the 15  tariff plan  which was scheduled to be implemented on  160 billion Chinese goods on Dec 15  China  on the other hand  didn t proceed with the retaliatory tariff plan of 25  on American autos  Also  the world s second biggest economy is expected to increase imports of American goods  agricultural  energy  manufacturing and others  by at least  200 billion over the next two years While investors are waiting for the deal to be signed within the first week of January 2020  the market is optimistic about the second phase that might include data localization  digital trade  cyber intrusions and cross border dataflow Rate CutsIn 2019  the Federal Reserve reduced interest rate thrice  which currently lies in the range of 1 50 1 75   This provided constant support to the domestic economy  Importantly  in its year end meeting  the Fed announced that it will hold interest rates steady throughout the next year  This boosted investor confidence and demand growth  making a record of 11th yearly economic expansion  The impact of the stimulant is clearly visible from the strengthening labor market  which is evident from the economic data stated below Favorable Economic DataUnemployment rate plunged to a 50 year low of 3 5  in November as 266 000 new jobs were generated in that month alone  With the job market holding up  investors are upbeat about economic performance in the next year The strong labor market  low mortgage rates and favorable demographics are expected to drive the domestic homebuilding market  Notably  this month  builder confidence reached the highest level of 76 points in the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo Housing Market Index since June 1999  Domestic industrial production increased 1 1  in November from the prior month  marking the biggest jump since October 2017  It was supported by the end of the 40 day strike of auto workers involving 48 000 personnel The United States reported the lowest trade deficit in 16 months as the metric contracted 7 6  to  47 2 billion in October from September s revised data of  51 1 billion  Importantly  the University of Michigan s U S  consumer sentiment rose to 99 2 points in December  beating market estimates of 97  This positive sentiment in the domestic economy is best reflected in the stock movements of small and mid cap companies  These companies are touted to be the true reflectors of economic growth Significance of Small and Mid Cap CompaniesWith large cap companies having significant international exposure  small and mid cap companies can portray the domestic economic scenario more prominently  These small cap stocks generally tend to outperform their large cap peers on the back of improving financial health  as these are less susceptible to global concerns Notably  these companies have created more than 50  of the new jobs in the private sector  Moreover  small companies constitute a major portion of the supply chain management systems for large cap companies with innovative and technological inputs  As such  the Russell 2000 is an appropriate indicator of the domestic economy  Reflecting the bullish sentiment of the market  the index rose 22  year to date  with majority of the rally witnessed in the latter part  Thus  we suggest you to place your bet on these small cap stocks  as these are expected to lead to lucrative returns Stocks That Outperformed Russell 2000While Russell 2000 is currently hovering near the 52 week high range  we have selected

delivery markets  They design and manufacture the chassis  and entire vehicles you see on the road as fire trucks  ambulances  municipal service vehicles and delivery trucks To understand how Spartan Motors got to where they are today  we ll need to examine a bit of the company s history  During the 1970 s The Form Rite Corporation had supplied millions of dollars  worth of molded plastic parts to Diamond REO trucks  which was filing for bankruptcy protection  During the bankruptcy proceedings  Form Rite learned of a significant contract that soon to be defunct Diamond REO had secured to build custom fire truck chassis Recognizing the potential value of that agreement  a small group of Form Rite executives and engineers joined forces with former Diamond employees  obtained the contract and incorporated Spartan Motors  leveraging basically their entire personal net worth to build their first chassis Having made excellent build quality their mission  that first chassis was a huge success and a flood of additional orders poured in   mostly for more fire trucks  but Spartan also fielded requests for other custom heavy industry vehicles By 1984  Spartan had outgrown the Form Rite umbrella and was spun off in an initial public offering  using the proceeds to significantly expand their production capabilities Fast forward to today and through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions  Spartan now supplies complete vehicles and parts to huge municipal fire departments   including Chicago  San Francisco  Dallas and Buffalo   as well as delivery vehicles  defense vehicles  lighting products and ladder assemblies Thanks to significant earnings growth and recent upward revisions  Spartan is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Spartan shares have significantly outperformed the broad markets in 2019  gaining 145  YTD versus 23  for the S P 500 and 19  for the small cap Russell 2000  of which Spartan is a member Even after that huge run up  Spartan still trades at a 12M forward P E Ratio of just 19 5X   barely higher than the S P s 18 8X multiple and a downright bargain for a fast growing small cap  That s thanks to rapidly rising estimates for full year earnings  Even after the big rally  Spartan s share price hasn t yet quite caught up with its earnings potential Savvy investors love to pick up a little known stocks that have been flying under the radar before they are discovered by the investing public and swell in valuation  Based on its low P E and Style Score of  A  for growth  Spartan Motors may be just such an opportunity  Warren Buffet and Carl Icahn are two of the most prolific investors of our time and they both figure into the story of today s Bear of the Day   Occidental Petroleum Icahn is one of Occidental s largest single shareholders  and he has been locked in a battle with the company s board after their approval of a  55B takeover of Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  earlier in 2019 which included the assumption of  40B in debt  Engaged in a bidding war for Anadarko with Chevron  NYSE CVX   Occidental sold off  9B worth of global assets and secured  10B in financing from Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Icahn has described the current OXY board as  willing to take inordinate risks and gamble stockholders  money to further their agendas   He claims that they  grossly overpaid for Anadarko  in a deal that   because of the Berkshire funding deal   did not require a shareholder vote Occidental sold Berkshire 100 000 shares of preferred stock which pay an 8  annual dividend and granted warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of common stock The acquisition of Anadarko s assets gives Occidental immediate exposure to the shale oil boom in the Permian Basin in West Texas  but also leaves the company scrambling to continue shedding assets and cut operational costs to shore up their debt laden balance sheet Occidental s level of debt combined with guaranteed preferred dividends is approximately 4 2X projected annual earnings   more than 4 times the industry average Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub defended the acquisition  arguing that the assets that have been acquired will seem cheap in the long run if oil prices rise  That s a big  if  however   with US producers now pumping out more than 12 million barrels of oil each day  OPECs apparently limited ability to prop up global prices and a seismic shift in public sentiment about the future of fossil fuels Where oil is going to be trading in the future is anybody s guess  which is why Occidental s bet is so risky for shareholders like Icahn  He has recently sold approximately 1 3 of his original stake in OXY  but still owns about 22 million shares It hasn t been a great year in the Oil and Gas industry which has seen share prices basically flat even as the S P 500 has gained 23   but it s been much worse for Occidental which is down more than 35  since making the winning bid for Anadarko  The Icahn sales aren t the only factor   plenty of analysts have made similar observations about the debt load   but the fact that Icahn still owns  850 million worth of OXY shares could put additional pressure on the price if he continues to sell What about Buffett It might seem ill advised to bet against a company that has the apparent support of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  and Buffett has profited handily in the past by providing huge money financing to companies with limited options  His  5B backstop of Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  during the financial crisis was legendary and also earned Berkshire a tidy   3 7B profit   thanks largely to the exercise of warrants as GS shares recovered Buffet s participation suggests he believes in Occidental s prospects  but unlike institutional equity investors like Icahn  T Rowe Price and BlackRock  NYSE BLK   the stock doesn t have to appreciate for Berkshire to make money  The 8  yield on his preferred shares is more than double the industry average and the warrants   which will only pay off if the shares rally considerably   could also cause significant dilution to owners of common shares The Oil and Gas industry can be a dicey place to invest  with the potential for windfall profits offset by a host of risks that are completely out of control of industry participants Tesla  TSLA  Rebounds  Is It Cybertruck Redemption Tesla shares edged higher Monday after a botched Friday debut of its new pickup truck that Elon Musk has dubbed Cybertruck  The unveiling went off course when Musk asked his head of design to throw a small metal ball at the vehicle s side window The metal ball ended up cracking the window much to the surprise of the audience and Musk  After the debacle at the premier  TSLA shares slipped Friday as Wall Street was hardly impressed with the design  Despite the eccentric showcase  Musk announced Monday that orders for the new truck were doing better than most expected Tesla s Pickup Makes the RoundsFootage of the window of the electric pickup truck shattering made its rounds on social media as the public all shared their opinions on the uniquely shaped automobile The unveiling in LA focused on demonstrating the new vehicle and its ability to compete in the pickup space dominated by Ford and General Motors  Tesla s Cybertruck pickup is polarizing  with its angular design that makes it stand out and hard to describe  The price of the new vehicle is set to start at  39 900  which is about  10 000 less than expected  However  while the entry level rear wheel drive Cybertruck is set to cost less than  40 000  the higher end  more capable all wheel drive versions will be priced up to  69 900  The priciest version of the electric pickup boasts a zero to sixty acceleration time in 2 9 seconds  up to 500 miles of range  and can tow 14 000 pounds Tesla didn t seem to skimp on the performance capabilities that most pickup consumers look for  but some worry that the odd design might not have mass appeal  During the production of the pickup  some inside the company worried that Musk would let his personal preferences overly influence the design  Despite the design backlash  Tesla has already received 200 000 orders for the new Cybertruck according to Musk Can the Cybertruck Transcend the Nascent Market Putting aside the failure and unconventional design  can Tesla s new pickup truck appeal to a broad audience  Tesla first defied conventional automotive industry wisdom by betting that consumers would be willing to pay a premium to drive an electric car A sleek design was a central part of the formula  as Tesla aimed to inspire consumers to buy an unconventionally modern looking car  It seems Tesla adopted the same strategy with its unique Cybertruck design that it hopes can attract the pickup truck consumer The automotive company has time for its Cybertruck to grow on consumers despite the initial backlash as most don t expect a release until the latter half of 2021 and the electric pickup truck market is just entering its infancy  Research firm IHS Markit projects electric vehicles will account for about 9  of the US automobile market in 2026  up from less than 2  today  Joseph Spak  an analyst with RBC Capital Markets  called the Tesla pickup  a Hummer for the green millennial generation  really the ultimate virtue and vice signaling machine  Bottom LineApart from the unorthodox design and embarrassing accident at the showcase  the capabilities of the truck seem to be in line with what pickup truck enthusiasts would look for  Additionally  the strong preorder numbers reported by Musk may indicate that consumers have looked past Wall Street s initial worries However  investors should note that Ford and GM have already announced plans to design their own electric pickups  with GM set to release its vehicle in the fall of 2021  This may not bode well for Tesla as pickup consumers are known to be brand loyal  and Ford and GM have long dominated the pickup truck landscape On top of all that  TSLA remains a volatile stock that has been on a roller coaster ride year to date  However  the automaker s recent performance has helped make up for some of the losses it endured earlier as it is has gained over 55  in the past 12 weeks  Our Q4 estimates forecast a 35 75  bottom line decline to

9489,231004,SPAR,Here s Why The Superior Industries Stock Still Holds Potential,opinion,Superior Industries    NYSE SUP   highly diversified customer base  significant geographic footprint and extensive array of value added products are aiding the company s revenue growth  Further  the firm s margin expansion efforts in different operating markets bode well  However  lowered projections for net sales and high net debt are concerns  The company s shares have slumped 43 1  year to date  outperforming its  s 26 9  rise Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment What s Aiding the Stock With a highly diversified customer base  significant geographic footprint and extensive array of value added products  Superior Industries is poised for solid top line growth  The firm s acquisition of UNIWHEELS AG in 2017 has positioned it as a leading global partner to automotive OEMs located in both North America and Europe  The company expects the buyout to result into  15 million in annual run rate synergies by 2020 In order to fortify its strategic position  Superior Industries is investing in new manufacturing processes with finer finishes which have a higher value  The company is committed to serve its global customer base by introducing innovative technologies  The strategy is in sync with market trends and customer requirements  Superior Industries  cutting edge R D capabilities have been aiding the firm to broaden and expand the portfolio for premium wheel finishes The firm s margin expansion efforts in different operating markets also bode well  The company s reduction of its manufacturing operation in Fayetteville is likely to reduce overhead  In Mexico  the company is aimed at improving foundry capabilities inside its plant  while also implementing targeted plans to reduce attrition  Superior Industries is likely to improve its sales mix with program launches likely on larger SUVs and higher priced vehicles  Robust demand from OEMs for complex wheel technologies and designs will boost sales over the coming years Superior Industries  efforts to reduce costs and enhance its global competitive position are also encouraging  The company plans to reduce costs through better operational and procurement practices as well as more rigorous factory maintenance to improve equipment reliability  Year to date  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses came in at  46 7million  down 23  year over year A Few ConcernsAs of Sep 30  the company s net debt was  709 million  representing debt to capital ratio of 68 4   The company s elevated leverage restricts its financial flexibility to tap growth opportunities  Moreover  the firm s suspension of quarterly dividend to repay its debt is likely to dampen investor confidence The company has also revised down its full year guidance amid the 40 day labor strike at General Motors  NYSE GM   which is one of the major customers of Superior Industries  It now projects unit shipments in the band of 19 5 19 7 million compared with the prior guidance of 19 5 19 9 million  Net sales are projected to lie between  1 39 million and  1 42 million compared with the prior range of  1 39  1 44 billion Superior Industries  operation in Europe makes it vulnerable to foreign currency fluctuation  A weaker euro to the U S  dollar exchange rate is affecting the company s margins  Also  lower aluminum prices are other headwinds  The firm s major OEM customers are constantly demanding concessions in the form of lower prices  If the company gives in to the demand for higher annual price reductions and is unable to offset the impact of such price reductions through technology improvements and cost reductions  its results of operations and financial condition might be affected  Sluggish auto sales amid economic slowdown are concerns as well Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Auto Tires Trucks sector are BRP Inc    NASDAQ DOOO    Spartan Motors  Inc    NASDAQ SPAR   and SPX Corporation   NYSE SPXC    While BRP flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Spartan Motors and SPX carry a Zacks

9494,231009,SPAR,Here s Why You Should Hold CNH Industrial In Your Portfolio,opinion,CNH Industrial N V  s   NYSE CNHI   upgraded product offerings and digitalization initiatives are aiding the firm to secure new business contracts  The firm continues to engage in share buybacks and regular dividend payouts in almost every quarter  in order to boost investors  confidence  However  declining projections for net sales and rising net debt for industrial activities are concerns  The company s shares have gained 19 8  year to date  outperforming its s 12 6  rise Let s delve deeper to find out why this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining at the moment What s Aiding the Stock The company is developing several products and technologies across all segments to remain at par with the latest technological advancements and emission control procedures  The firm s latest launches  including Iveco s new daily minibus   AFS Connect Magnum series tractors by agricultural equipment provider Case IH  and methane powered wheel loader idea   Project TETRA by the construction equipment segment  are likely to boost its growth prospects  Upgraded product offerings will aid the company in achieving new business contracts CNH Industrial is working on a business plan to combat approaching megatrends that are affecting the industry  which includes digitalization  electrification and automation  The company has been working on a new organizational structure that aims to make it more customer centric and agile  Apart from this  it looks after ways of productivity improvements while keeping a check on costs  CNH Industrial is also analyzing its global manufacturing footprint  capital allocation  R D investments and other long term initiatives The company regularly acquires and divests dealerships and franchises to expand its business  This November  CNH Industrial completed the acquisition of ATI Inc  which will provide access to factory fit industry leading track technology to the customers of Case IH and New Holland Agriculture  It also acquired K Line Ag to enhance the crop production portfolios of Case IH and New Holland Agriculture  The firm sold its Truckline parts business to Bapcor this year  in order to ensure continuity of service for Australia s commercial vehicle customers   As part of its five year plan  the company also spun off its truckmaker Iveco as a separate business to double the profit margin  CNH Industrial aims at operational efficiency through targeted restructuring efforts in order to boost profit and streamline business CNH Industrial engages in share buybacks and regular dividend payouts in almost every quarter which boosts investors  confidence  In the first nine months of 2019  the company paid a dividend of 20 3 cents per share compared with the 17 3 cents paid in 2018  With the expiration of the previous buyback program  the firm recently announced a new share repurchase program of up to  700 million to optimize its capital structure CNH Industrial remains optimistic for the agricultural markets going into 2020  given that the U S  farmers took advantage of the recent improvement in commodity prices  lower commodity stock levels expected at the end of 2019  sustained U S  pharma cash flows  use of CapEx  depreciation tax incentives  as well as the apparent need to replace older equipment to improve yields  All of this will spur equipment demand in the latter part of 2019  as well as going into 2020 What s Pulling the Stock Down The company s bleak guidance for 2019 is a dampener  For the current year  it now projects roughly  26 5  27 billion in Industrial Activities  net sales  down from the prior guidance of  27  27 5 billion  Net debt of Industrial Activities at the end of 2019 is expected between  400 million and  600 million  up from the prior view of  200 400 million Rising capital expenditure is a concern for CNH Industrial  This upswing is resulting from rising investments to develop products and technologies  which includes funding for precision farming platform and launch of the Stage V emission requirement compliant engine applications  Further  investments for capacity expansion  high material costs  overhead expenses and tariff headwinds add to the company s expenses  which are hampering profits  For 2019  it expects R D and capital spending to flare up to 4  and 2  of sales  respectively After effects of unfavorable weather in Australia and Northern Europe  and extreme wet conditions in North America leading to late planting are likely to hurt CNH industrial s agricultural end markets in this year  As agricultural equipment is the largest sales contributor in net Industrial sales  a dismal business is a concern CNH Industrial has a global presence through its four segments  making it vulnerable to foreign the exchange volatility  Also  its strong presence in EMEA might witness headwinds in case of a no deal Brexit  This apart  escalating U S  Sino trade tensions have been impacting the company s performance  Rising costs will dent margins if the company is unable to pass the price increases to customers  While a partial trade deal is currently being worked out between the two nations  new tariffs are likely to be effective if no agreement is in place  The possibility of the imposition of new tariffs on imports is a concern Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Auto Tires Trucks sector are BRP Inc    NASDAQ DOOO    Spartan Motors  Inc    NASDAQ SPAR   and SPX Corporation   NYSE SPXC

company s M2022 goals  Axle buyout and soaring free cash flow bode well  Meritor is likely to feel the heat from industry headwinds and lower truck sales  especially in the markets of Europe  China and India  Let s dig deeper to analyze the overall picture of the company Growth Drivers in PlaceWhile Meritor has successfully executed the three year M2019 program  itis on track to achieve M2022 goals that focus on new business opportunities  margin expansion and cost containment efforts  Per the M2022 goals  the firm is expected to attain 75  free cash flow conversion and remain committed to return money to its shareholders Meritor s buyout of AxleTech has enhanced its growth  The buyout led to the introduction of a complementary product portfolio  providing the company with a full line of independent suspensions  material handling axles  new braking solutions and drivetrain components  It also diversified Meritor s exposure in adjacent end markets served  which will support its target of realizing more than  15 million in annual cost synergies by fiscal 2020 The company regularly introduces products that position it as a market leader in electric drivetrains  Theseproduct introductions have enabled it to clinch contracts from MAN  Mercedes Benz and Iveco  The expanding product portfolio will enable the company to meet the changing needs of customers  In addition  it announced 22 electrification programs with global OEMs that are expected to put nearly 130 fully electric medium and heavy duty commercial trucks on road through 2020 The company is likely to gain from higher marginstied to OEM adoption of advanced products such as eAxle  air disc brakes and precision gearing The firm s free cash flow  a key metric to gauge the financial health  has been increasing over the past two years  The metric came in at  147 and  163 million in fiscal 2018 and 2019  reflecting a year over year increase of 4  and 81 4   respectively  The company s investor friendly moves boost its shareholders  confidence  In fiscal 2019  Meritor repurchased 5 3 million shares of common stock for  95 million  The company also approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization from  250 million to  325 million during the fiscal year HeadwindsTrade tensions and slowdown in global economic growth are playing spoilsports for truck makers  Amid sluggish freight volumes  truck makers are logging lower orders Reportedly  truck giants in North America like PCCAR Inc   PCAR   Navistar International Corporation  NAV   Volvo Trucks USA and Daimler Trucks North America   a subsidiary of Daimler AG  DE DAIGn   DDAIF    have been witnessing a sharp decline in year over year orders for heavy duty models in 2019  Amid macroeconomic headwinds  the truck manufactures are not expecting market conditions and sales to improve in the near term as well Softening heavy duty truck markets in the United States and declining demand for Class 8 trucks are likely to weigh on commercial truck and industrial parts makers like Meritor  In the North America Class 8 market  Meritor projects fiscal 2020 production within 240 000 250 000 units  Production levels in the markets of Europe and India are expected to decline 6  and 17   respectively  in fiscal 2020  Significant economic slowdown in China is likely to lower the firm s revenues from the region  In fact  the firm s initial guidance for fiscal 2020 sales is projected in the band of  3 7  3 8 billion  indicating 14  decline from the midpoint of the forecast Meritor s high debt is a spoilsport  The long term debt of the company was  902 million in fiscal 2019  ended on Sep 30   reflecting a year over year increase of 23 5   The firm s elevated leverage of 68 4  restricts its financial freedom to tap onto growth opportunities Bottom LineWhile we certainly believe that macroeconomic headwinds will hamper Meritor s revenues in the near term  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company

9554,231069,SPAR,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Tap Record High Nasdaq Rally,opinion,The Nasdaq Composite     one of the three major stock indexes of Wall Street     has been performed impressively so far in 2019  On Nov 1  the tech laden index closed at a fresh all time high  surpassing its previous closing high on Jul 26 A fundamentally stable U S  economy  which is growing for the historically longest 11 years     albeit with some loss in pace and a dovish Fed this year     has strengthened investors  confidence in risky assets like equities despite the U S  China trade conflict  Additionally  better than expected economic data and third quarter earnings have strengthened sentiments of market participants Nasdaq Rally ContinuesLast year was extremely disappointing for Nasdaq  The index plunged 3 9  recording its worst ever yearly performance since 2008  However  the Nasdaq started 2019 on a strong note  The tech heavy index is up an impressive 26 4  year to date  On Nov 1  the index closed at 8 386 40  recording a fresh closing high after Jul 26 when it closed at 8 330 21  The intraday high was 8 386 75  beating the previous high of 8 339 64 recorded on Jul 26 The primary reason for Nasdaq s turnaround is the rebound of the technology sector although several stocks from other sectors also performed impressively  The technology sector suffered a severe setback in 2018  Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK   one of the 11 sectors of the S P 500 Index  declined 2 9  last year  However  XLK is the best performer of the S P 500 so far this year  having jumped 36 6  Next Major CatalystSigning of a partial trade deal between the United States and China will give a major boost to the Nasdaq Composite  According to President Trump  the first phase of the deal will address issues related to safeguarding of U S  intellectual property rights  including force transfer or theft of technologies  reform of the China s financial markets and its practice of arbitrarily setting foreign exchange rate The U S  government has decided to scrap its decision to raise tariff rates from 25  to 30  on  250 billon Chinese goods  effective Oct 15  Also  no decision has been taken on the planned new set of 15  tariff on  160 billion Chinese exports  effective Dec 15 China is the largest trading partner of the United States  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about higher tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods  which raised prices of high tech equipment and electronics products On the other hand  a trade spat with the United States resulted in a significant slowdown of China s economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  high tech companies a solid boost as China is also the largest market for U S  high tech products A solution to the U S  China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants Our Top

5  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Sterling Construction Co  Inc    NASDAQ STRL    Universal Forest Products Inc    NASDAQ UFPI    Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ    Insight Enterprises Inc    NASDAQ NSIT   and Spartan Motors Inc    NASDAQ SPAR   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Ranked Stocks to Tap Record High Nasdaq RallyThe Nasdaq Composite     one of the three major stock indexes of Wall Street     has been performed impressively so far in 2019  On Nov 1  the tech laden index closed at a fresh all time high  surpassing its previous closing high on Jul 26 A fundamentally stable U S  economy  which is growing for the historically longest 11 years     albeit with some loss in pace and a dovish Fed this year     has strengthened investors  confidence in risky assets like equities despite the U S  China trade conflict  Additionally  better than expected economic data and third quarter earnings have strengthened sentiments of market participants Nasdaq Rally ContinuesLast year was extremely disappointing for Nasdaq  The index plunged 3 9  recording its worst ever yearly performance since 2008  However  the Nasdaq started 2019 on a strong note  The tech heavy index is up an impressive 26 4  year to date  On Nov 1  the index closed at 8 386 40  recording a fresh closing high after Jul 26 when it closed at 8 330 21  The intraday high was 8 386 75  beating the previous high of 8 339 64 recorded on Jul 26 The primary reason for Nasdaq s turnaround is the rebound of the technology sector although several stocks from other sectors also performed impressively  The technology sector suffered a severe setback in 2018  Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK   one of the 11 sectors of the S P 500 Index  declined 2 9  last year  However  XLK is the best performer of the S P 500 so far this year  having jumped 36 6  Next Major CatalystSigning of a partial trade deal between the United States and China will give a major boost to the Nasdaq Composite  According to President Trump  the first phase of the deal will address issues related to safeguarding of U S  intellectual property rights  including force transfer or theft of technologies  reform of the China s financial markets and its practice of arbitrarily setting foreign exchange rate The U S  government has decided to scrap its decision to raise tariff rates from 25  to 30  on  250 billon Chinese goods  effective Oct 15  Also  no decision has been taken on the planned new set of 15  tariff on  160 billion Chinese exports  effective Dec 15 China is the largest trading partner of the United States  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about higher tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods  which raised prices of high tech equipment and electronics products On the other hand  a trade spat with the United States resulted in a significant slowdown of China s economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  high tech companies a solid boost as China is also the largest market for U S  high tech products A solution to the U S  China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in Nasdaq stocks  However  the selection may be difficult  Here our VGM Score will come in handy  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks that have skyrocketed in 2019 and still have upside left  Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a

9570,231085,SPAR,Ford UAW Deal To  Create Or Retain  Jobs   Make New Investments,opinion,"Ford   NYSE F   and the United Auto Workers  UAW  recently reached a tentative four year labor contract  which would create or maintain jobs  and involve billions in new investments by the U S  auto biggie  With the General Motors    NYSE GM   workers approving the proposed labor contract to end their 40 day strike  the UAW bargainers have used it as a template for negotiations with Ford as well  Notably  the union s latest deal with Ford largely mirrors the UAW General Motors contract  with certain exceptions 
The deal covers more than  6 billion of Ford s spending in jobs and plants  Under the new contract  more than 8 500 jobs will be created or retained  with 19 facilities receiving a portion of the investment money  The largest investment of  1 1 billion would be in Ford s Michigan Assembly plant for the all new Ford Bronco SUV and Ford Ranger mid size pickup

The deal includes the closing of the Michigan engine plant  with more than 600 of its hourly workers getting job offers at the nearby Van Dyke transmission facility 
Approximately 55 000 rank and file members of UAW and Ford are expected to vote on the new contract over the next two weeks  in order to decide the fate of the contract on the basis of simple majority 
Ford s shares have declined around 3 7  in the past three months compared with the roughly 11 5  rise recorded by the  

 
Ford s outlook for 2019 suggests adjusted EPS in the range of  1 20  1 35 compared with the prior year s  1 30  The range assumes a full year adjusted effective tax rate in the band of 18 20   which indicates a rise of 10  from year ago levels  This is likely to create a headwind of 12 16 cents per share in the year 
Solid vehicle mix  supported by F series trucks and SUV models  including Escape  Explorer  Expedition  EcoSport and Edge  among others  all of which offer hybrid and electric options  will likely boost the company s revenues in the upcoming quarters

9574,231089,SPAR,U S  Auto Sales Rev Up In March  5 Solid Picks,opinion,U S auto sales beat expectations in March  fueled by higher demand for SUVs and pickup trucks  Stepped up showroom traffic  big consumer discounts and product launches drove demand for vehicles  Automakers are also benefitting from a strong job market and decade high consumer confidence levels  while business owners are taking advantage of tax cuts to upgrade their fleet  These positives outweighed higher gasoline prices and rise in borrowing costs Banking on the positives  it seems prudent to invest in certain top ranked

The shortfall in deliveries resulted from low production levels at the beginning of the second quarter  Tesla is striving to increase its production capacity  The automaker produced 18 345 vehicles in the second quarter  which represents a 20  increase over the first quarter

9677,231192,SPAR,IPO Look   Allison Transmission  Formerly a Division of General Motors ,opinion,Based in Indianapolis  Indiana  Allison Transmission Holdings  proposed ALSN  scheduled a  500 million IPO with a market capitalization of  4 2 billion at a price range mid point of  23 for Thursday  March 15  2012 SUMMARYALSN builds automatic transmissions for commercial duty vehicles  It was bought from General Motors in August 2007 by the private equity firms of Carlyle and Onex It appears to us that ALSN will become an almost instant institutional favorite   We sat through the entire 45 minute road show presentation and found all of it interesting  which is highly unusual for us We like ALSN because is has a dominant market share  advanced technology with much more technology in process  branding even to the end user  through OEMs   is tightly focused on automatic transmissions and is positioned for significant growth in China and India  Also  ALSN s fully automated transmissions are premium priced  which is very good for gross profit margins Dividend policyEven though ALSN is highly leveraged in terms of price to tangible book value  it expects to start paying dividends in the June quarter  at the rate of   06 per share  an annual payout rate of 1  at the price range mid point of  23  We anticipate dividend increases over time CONCLUSIONWe believe ALSN is a buy on the IPO   However  because the market appears  toppy  right now  the actual IPO price may slide a little under the proposed range  and because ALSN is  just a private equity re cycled industrial company  it most likely will not  pop    Nevertheless  it appears to be a good longer term hold VALUATION NOTESALSN has  1 billion of present value tax savings  based on how the leveraged buyout was structured in August  2007  by Carlyle and Onex private equity funds Adjusted earnings were  305 million in adjusted earnings for 2011  as presented in ALSN s road show by the CFO   ALSN has reduced debt by  1 1 billion since it leveraged buyout in 2007 Capital expenditures are only 4 5  of sales  Operating working capital is less than 10  of sales Delphi IPO d November 16  2011 at  22  price range bottom  dropped to  19 22 and now trades up 50   around  BUSINESSALSN sells transmissions globally for use in medium  and heavy duty on highway commercial vehicles  with limited exposure to the Class 8 manual transmission tractor market   off highway vehicles and equipment and military vehicles Allison s customers include 250 OEMs of garbage trucks and city transit buses  military transports  and dump trucks  ALSN also makes electric drives for buses and shuttles  and is the world s  1 heavy duty hybrid producer    ALSN also remanufactures transmissions for aftermarket customers EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT MANDATESGovernments are mandating restrictions on emissions that lead to vehicle system changes  New emission standards increase overall vehicle cost relating to pollutant reducing systems  The emission standards and resultant compliance costs create uncertainty among vehicle owners about the quality  fuel efficiency and maintenance needs of the new engines  In anticipation of an emission regulation change  commercial vehicle buyers may  pre buy  vehicles with prior year emissions compliant engines in the year preceding the regulation change  The act of pre buying causes irregularity in transmission purchase patterns and creates forecasting challenges  In North America  a reduction in permitted emissions came into effect in January 2007  which resulted in a significant vehicle pre buy in 2006  Another tightening of emission standards took place in January 2010  which resulted in a significantly smaller vehicle pre buy in 2009  More emissions regulation is expected in 2013  Generally  the degree of pre buy in any end market directly correlates with the weight class of the commercial vehicle because the heavier the vehicle  the greater the cost to a buyer of complying with these new emission standards  Outside North America  engine emission level compliance varies by the levels established by European Union regulations  As countries change from one emission level to the next  OEMs must change their powertrain configurations and validate the resulting combinations  OEMs have cadenced their vehicle releases and product upgrades to incorporate emissions compliant improvements as they evolve and are regionally deployed  Supply agreements with key OEMs enhance ALSN s position with those OEMs as they adjust their products to comply with new regulations GENERAL MOTORSGeneral Motors   GM  actions may materially affect ALSN s business and results of operations Although ALSN is an independent company as a result of the Acquisition Transaction  General Motors  future actions may still have a material impact on business and results of operations  Pursuant to the Cure Agreement resulting from General Motors  emergence from bankruptcy in 2009  General Motors has assumed certain agreements from its predecessor  including the Asset Purchase Agreement  intellectual property and software license agreements  lease agreements  engineering services agreements  an employee matters agreement and a hybrid co branding agreement  General Motors  failure to comply with any portion of these agreements for any reason  including the indemnities therein  could inhibit ALSN from operating and expanding its business in the future Additionally  General Motors has received a non exclusive  royalty free  worldwide license to use the  Allison Transmission  name and certain related trademarks on General Motors  line of A1000 transmission for use primarily in Class 2 and 3 pick up trucks  If General Motors  or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities  or any third party uses the trade name  Allison Transmission  in ways that adversely affect such trade name or trademark  ALSN s reputation could suffer damage  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on ALSN s business  results of operations and financial condition In connection with the Acquisition Transaction  ALSN entered into a mutual non compete agreement with General Motors that restricts General Motors from competing with ALSN in non military vehicles in North America with gross vehicle weights above 5900 kilograms  typically Class 4 and higher  with some limited exceptions for certain General Motors light duty pickup truck and van platforms  It also restricts General Motors from competing with ALSN in military vehicles globally and in non military vehicles outside North America that exceed 3500 kilograms  generally Class 3 to Class 4 and higher  with some limited exceptions  The non compete periods extend until 2017 globally  except in Europe  where they expire in 2012  While ALSN does not expect the expiration of this non compete agreement in Europe to have an impact on its business  ALSN doesn t know if General Motors will not compete with ALSN in these markets in the future  Similarly  ALSN is restricted from competing with General Motors in weight classes below the above mentioned thresholds for similar periods of time  Upon expiration of the non competition periods  both Allison and General Motors will be permitted to compete with each other  but such expiration will generally not affect Allison s rights under the Patent and Technology License Agreement to use on an exclusive basis within its respective weight classes  subject to previously mentioned exceptions  the intellectual property that is licensed to Allison on an exclusive basis INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYIn connection with the Acquisition Transaction  General Motors granted ALSN an irrevocable  perpetual  royalty free  worldwide license under a large number of U S  and foreign patents and patent applications  as well as certain unpatented technology and know how  to design  develop  manufacture  use and sell fully automatic transmissions and H 40 50 EP hybrid propulsion transit bus systems for use in certain vocational vehicles  military vehicles and off road products  which we refer to as Patent and Technology License Agreement  With respect to the bulk of the intellectual property licensed to us under such license agreement  such license is exclusive with respect to the design  development  manufacture  use and sale of fully automatic transmissions and H 40 50 EP hybrid propulsion transit bus systems in vocational vehicles above certain weight rating thresholds  certain military vehicles and certain off road products and non exclusive with respect to certain other products that are within the scope of the licensed patents or to which the licensed technology can be applied  ALSN considers the patents and technology licensed under such license agreement  as a whole  to be critical to preserving its competitive position in the market  However  General Motors continues to own such patents and technology  and pursuant to the terms of such license agreement  General Motors has the right  in the first instance  to control the maintenance  enforcement and defense of such patents and the prosecution of the licensed patent applications  The Patent and Technology License Agreement permits ALSN to utilize the bulk of the intellectual property rights on an exclusive basis in non military vehicles with gross vehicle weights above 5900 kilograms  typically Class 4 and higher  with some limited exceptions for General Motors light duty pickup truck and van platforms  It also permits ALSN to utilize the bulk of the intellectual property rights on an exclusive basis in military vehicles that exceed 4250 kilograms  generally Class 3 to Class 4 and higher   General Motors continues to have the right under such patents and technology to utilize the licensed intellectual property for use in vehicles below the above mentioned rating thresholds as well as some light duty van and pickup truck platforms COMPETITION OVERVIEWALSN faces competition from numerous manufacturers of manual transmissions  AMTs  automatic manual transmissions  and fully automatic transmissions for commercial vehicles  Some of ALSN s customers are OEMs that manufacture transmissions for their own products  Despite their transmission manufacturing abilities  ALSM s existing OEM customers have chosen to purchase certain transmissions from ALSN due to the quality  reliability and strong brand of its transmissions and in order to limit fixed costs  minimize production risks and maintain company focus on commercial vehicle design  production and marketing COMPETITIVE POSITIONINGALSN sells substantially all of its transmissions in the North American on highway market to OEMs  including Blue Bird  Daimler  Hino  Navistar  NAV   PACCAR  PACCAR   Spartan Motors  SPAR   Volvo and many others  These OEMs  in turn  install ALSN s transmissions in vehicles in which ALSN transmissions are either the exclusive transmission available or specifically requested by end users who are choosing between a manual transmission  an AMT or a fully automatic transmission  OEM customers representing approximately 90  of ALSN s 2011 North American on highway unit volume participate in long term supply agreements with us  Generally  these supply agreements offer the OEM customer defined levels of mutual commitment with respect to growing Allison s presence in the OEMs  products and promotional efforts  pricing and sharing of commodity cost risk  The typical length of ALSN s customer agreements is five years  ALSN often competes in this market against independent manufacturers of manual transmissions and AMTs  and  to a lesser extent  against OEMs in certain weight classes that use their own internally manufactured transmissions in certain vehicles  For example  Ford Motor  F  offers its own fully automatic transmission in its Class 4 5 vehicles in North America  though ALSN supplies Ford with ALSN s fully automatic transmissions for their Class 6 7 trucks TRUCKSClass 4 5 TrucksThe largest Class 4 5 truck OEM is Ford  which offers its own transmission in these vehicles  Until 2009  Ford and General Motors were the largest OEMs in this end market with a combined market share of 88  in 2008  but General Motors exited the medium duty truck market after emerging from bankruptcy  Since Ford uses its own fully automatic transmission in this vehicle class  General Motors  departure from this market resulted in a decline in ALSN s sales of fully automatic transmissions for use in the Class 4 5 truck market  which ALSN had served almost exclusively through General Motors  To partially offset the loss of General Motors  presence in this market  ALSN is the exclusive transmission supplier to the new Navistar Class 4 5 TerraStar truck specifically targeted at this end market  ALSN also intends to pursue business with other OEMs  should they choose to participate in this end market Class 6 7 TrucksClass 6 7 trucks are generally used in urban applications  including larger distribution  commercial lease and rental  ambulance  rescue and fire trucks  While demand drivers for the Class 6 7 truck end market are generally similar to those of the Class 4 5 truck end market  economic and pre buy volatility are higher in these classes  The largest OEMs in this end market are Navistar  Daimler  Ford  Hino and PACCAR  ALSN s overall penetration of the Class 6 7 truck transmission end market was 68  in 2011  and ALSN supplies virtually all of the fully automatic transmissions sold in this end market  In this market  ALSN competes primarily with manual transmissions and AMTs manufactured by Eaton  ETN  Class 8 Straight TrucksThe most common vocations that utilize straight trucks are refuse  construction  fire and emergency  Primary drivers of Class 8 straight truck demand are general economic conditions and federal  state and municipal spending  which affect the purchases of many fire and emergency trucks  refuse vehicles and construction vehicles  and the purchases of other private refuse fleet operators  The largest Class 8 straight truck OEMs are Navistar  Daimler  PACCAR and Volvo  In 2011  ALSN s overall penetration of the Class 8 straight truck transmission end market was 54   and ALSN supplies virtually all of the fully automatic transmissions sold in this end market  In this market  ALSN competes primarily with manual transmissions and AMTs manufactured by Eaton BusesSchool buses have historically comprised 75  of the North American bus market by volume  While school buses vary in weight and engine size  the majority of ALSN s transmissions are used in Class 6 7 buses  The primary demand driver for school bus purchases is municipal spending  specifically school district budgets and the capital expenditure plans of private fleet operators  School bus demand is also affected by the number of school age children  which is driven by birth
