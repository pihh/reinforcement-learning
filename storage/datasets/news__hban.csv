Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings and welcome to the Huntington Bancshares Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  a question and answer session will follow the formal presentation   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mark Muth  Director of Investor Relations Mark Muth    Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Welcome  I m Mark Muth  Director of Investor Relations for Huntington  Copies of the slides we ll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website   This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call  Our presenters today are Steve Steinour  Chairman  President and CEO  Zach Wasserman  Chief Financial Officer  and Rich Pohle  Chief Credit Officer As noted on Slide two  today s discussion  including the Q A period will contain forward looking statements  such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes  risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially  We assume no obligation to update such statements  For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties  please refer to this slide and the material filed with the SEC including our most recent Forms 10 K  10 Q and 8 K filings Let me now turn it over to Steve  who will start on Slide three Stephen D  Steinour    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mark  and thank you to everyone for joining the call today  As always  we appreciate your interest and support  We re pleased with our full year 2019 results and the continued momentum across the bank  despite a challenging operating environment  For the full year  we ve reported earnings per common share of  1 27  an increase of 6  over 2018  Return on average assets for 2019 was 1 3   return on average common equity was 13   and return on average tangible common equity was 17  The bank achieved record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year  Our balance sheet is very well positioned with robust capital and liquidity and our comprehensive hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk  Credit quality remained strong with 2019 net charge offs at the low end of our average through the cycle target range  We ve remained prudent with our allocation of capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks  consistent with our aggregate    moderate to low risk profile 2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend  coupling the dividend with  441 million of share repurchases during the year  We returned over  1 billion to our shareholders in 2019  which represented a total payout ratio of 79   As we previously communicated on many instances  our capital priorities are  First to fund organic growth  Second to support the cash dividend  and finally  all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions  these capital priorities have not changed Now moving to the economy  we continue to see growth and our expectation for 2020 is for continued expansion  Consumers continue to perform well across our footprint with strong labor markets driving wage inflation  In the 12 months ending November 2019  unemployment rates declined or remain the same  of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington s footprint states  Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in the Midwest Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in Michigan  Indiana and Ohio  Additionally  consumer confidence in our region is generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000  The positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer lending businesses  Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full year 2019 and the 2019 fourth quarter Our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter and we expect another good year in 2020 for our consumer lending businesses  again driven primarily by residential mortgage and auto finance  Now we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity  consistent with the measured tone from some of our commercial customers  economic uncertainty  along with tight labor markets  remain headwinds for more robust economic growth in our footprint Overall Huntington is performing well with disciplined organic growth  our customers are generally confident about their performance for 2020 and we share that confidence in our performance  We continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals  mid corporate lending  technology  media and telecom  our practice finance area in which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan I m looking now into 2020  we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth  reduce our future expense growth and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses and technology  We repositioned  2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities  The rebalance resulted in  22 million of security losses on the    in the fourth quarter On the expense side  we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation of 30 in store branches  Now these actions along with the disposition of other properties and the technology system decommission resulted in unusual expense of approximately  25 million in the quarter  Our disciplined expense management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology and enterprise growth initiatives going forward I m confident in our positioning entering 2020 and our colleagues are focused and executing our plans  we are all aligned with our strategies of creating a high performing regional bank in delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns  Zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance  Zach Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve and good morning everybody  It s a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call with Huntington  Slides four and five provide highlights of our full year 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 results respectively  many of which Steve already touched on  Fourth quarter results include approximately  47 million of pre tax impact or approximately  0 03 per share after tax from previously announced actions that were taken to better position the bank for 2020  including the securities repositioning  workforce actions and the pending in store branch closures Let s turn to Slide six to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind that financial performance for the quarter  Average earning assets increased  2 3 billion or 2  compared to the year ago quarter  Average loans and leases increased  1 3 billion or 2  year over year with balanced consumer and commercial loan growth  Average commercial and industrial loans increased 3  from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our year over year loan growth  C I loan growth has been well diversified over the past year  with notable growth in specialty banking  asset finance and corporate banking Our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations as a portion of deals we expected to close at the end of the year  were pushed into 2020 and seasonal declines in line utilization at year end were larger than normal  Overall commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty  We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 2  year over year decrease driven by paydowns in refinancing activity Consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio  reflecting robust originations in the second half of 2019  Average residential mortgage loans increased 7  year over year  As we typically do we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products Now turning to Slide seven  Average total deposits decreased less than 1  year over year  while average core deposits increased 1  year over year  Note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by the June 2019 sale of the Wisconsin retail branch network  including approximately  725 million or almost 1  of core deposits  We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts  reflecting shifting customer preferences and we are focused    and where we are focused on promotional pricing  Average money market deposits increased 9  year over year  while savings decreased 9  and core CDs decreased 16   We expect this dynamic to continue in 2020  Average non interest bearing and interest bearing DDA accounts each increased 1  year over year As shown on Slide 32 in the appendix  we re very pleased that our commercial non interest bearing deposits increased 5  year over year in the quarter  This growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low cost deposit base through new customer acquisition and relationship deepening Moving now to Slide eight  FTE  net interest income decreased  55 million or 7  versus the year ago quarter  primarily driven by the 29 basis point decline in net interest margin  partially offset by 2  increase in average earning assets  Net interest margin was 3 02     3 12     excuse me 3 12  for the quarter  down 29 basis points from the year ago quarter  down 8 basis points linked quarter and in line with the guidance we provided at the Goldman Sachs Conference in December Moving to Slide nine  our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3 08  down 26 basis points from the year ago quarter  Purchase accounting accretion contributed 4 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 7 basis points in the year ago quarter  Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020  Please note that this quarter is the last quarter  we intend to provide core NIM and PAA breakouts  as the PAA is expected to have a relatively immaterial impact in 2020 Turning to asset    to earning asset yields  Our commercial loan yields decreased 52 basis points year over year  consumer loan yields decreased 8 basis points and security yields decreased 16 basis points  The decrease in our earnings asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the three federal reserve rate reductions that occurred during 2019 On the funding side of the balance sheet  our deposit cost continue to move lower  as CDs and money market promotional rates repriced lower and we actively manage commercial deposit costs  Total interest bearing deposit cost of 87 basis points for the quarter were up 3  year over year though down a 11 basis points sequentially Slide 10 summarizes the actions we ve taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment  Our hedging strategies reduce the downside risk from lower interest rates and have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest income  Our current interest rate risk modeling suggests  a little change to net interest income from either a 25 basis point increase or 25 basis point decrease in 2020  We continuously monitor and we will continue to prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment  balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate The graphs on the bottom left of the slide detail the mix of our loan portfolio as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with repricing events in the first half of 2020  These repricing events provide an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits  As these higher price CDs and promotional money market accounts repriced lower  through December the consumer deposit repricing activity is on track with our expectations  The success of our consumer deposit repricing and retention has provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in our commercial deposit pricing  particularly among the highest cost deposits The graph on the bottom right of the slide displays the impact of our actions  You can see the downward trajectory of our total interest bearing deposit costs by month since July  We expect this trend to continue given the significant deposit repricing opportunities that remain in the first half of 2020 Turning to Slide 11 you can see  it provides the detail on our non interest income  which increased 13  from the year ago quarter  The growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income which increased 152   primarily reflecting higher salable origination volume and secondary market spreads  as well as a  12 million increase in the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management  We also continue to see steady growth in card and payment processing income  trust and investment management and insurance In the 2019 fourth quarter  we repositioned  2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities prospectively at a cost of  22 million in Q4  while negatively impacting fourth quarter results  the prospective earnings pick up and the earn back on the positioning losses are very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio  The year ago quarter in 2018 included  19 million of securities losses from similar repositioning Slide 12 provides the components of the 1  year over year decrease in non interest expense  The 2019 fourth quarter included  25 million of expense related to the actions  which Steve discussed earlier while the year ago quarter included  35 million of similar branch and facility consolidation related expense  Adjusting for these items  non interest expenses were essentially flat  We continue to drive efficiency in our core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel our investments in digital  mobile and cyber technology  enhanced products and services and distribution capabilities  This disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios  the tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7 88   up 67 basis points from a year ago and common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ended the quarter at 9 88  or 23 basis points year over year  We continue to manage CET1 to the high end of our 9  to 10  operating guideline  During the fourth quarter of 2019  we repurchased 13 1 million common shares at an average cost of  14 96 per share  or an total of  196 million We plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital following the CECL implementation back to a CET1 level near 10  by the end of 2020 excluding the benefit of the CECL transition provision provided by the Federal Reserve  We feel managing internally to a CET1 level excluding the three year transition reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios  which we see as a position of strength for the organization  As a result  we are currently planning to repurchase less than a third of the remaining  249 million of share repurchase capacity on our 2019 capital plan in the first half of 2020 Now let me turn it over to Rich to cover credit including CECL  Rich Richard Pohle    Executive Vice President  Chief Credit OfficerThanks  Zach  Slide 14 provides an update on our CECL adoption  We estimate our allowance for credit losses or ACL will increase 44  from the year end 2019 ACL to  1 28 billion or 1 70  of total loans and leases on an adjusted basis  As we stated on the third quarter call  given our 50  mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans  the CECL lifetime loss methodology results in a higher allowance then the prior methodology  The increase in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio As we move forward into CECL  it is a new accounting standard with many variables  Our day to allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models and incorporate multiple scenarios  historical loss in recovery rates  borrower characteristics and other factors  As a result  we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning expense  Our parallel testing however indicates that key factors being held constant  the aggregate annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change from the current incurred loss methodology despite that higher quarterly variability Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter  despite challenges in our oil and gas portfolio our credit metrics remain strong  As we have noted previously  some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans  Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington s core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite Net charge offs remain near the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points  Net charge offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter  flat to the prior quarter and up from 27 basis points in the year ago quarter  The increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio  which made up approximately half of the total commercial net charge offs  This portfolio was primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity prices and limited capital markets activity  We have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio representing less than 2  of total loans and we believe we have it appropriately reserved for Consumer charge offs have remained fairly consistent over the past year  there is additional granularity on charge offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides  Annual net charge offs excluding the  67 million of oil and gas related losses were 26 basis points  and just 15 basis points for the commercial portfolio  The non performing asset ratio increased 2 basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year over year to 0 66   again primarily as a result of the stress in our oil and gas book  The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1 04   down 1 basis point versus the linked quarter Let me turn it back over to Zach Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Rich  Slide 16 illustrates our expectations for full year 2020  We expect 2020 to be another year of sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies  We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 3  to 4  with continued growth in both consumer and commercial portfolios  We expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side  focused on home lending and auto finance  We expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data Full year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3  to 4  as we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships  Specifically our expectation entails continued decline in CDs more than offset by growth in checking and money market  We expect full year total revenue growth of 1 5  to 3 5  on a GAAP basis  with growth in both net interest income and non interest income We are projecting the NIM to rebound in the first half of 2020 from the 2019 fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second half of the year  Given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning  we remain confident in our outlook for net interest income growth  while deposit pricing remains rational in our markets we are closely watching the competitive environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and opportunity for variance to our NIM forecast We expect non interest income on a GAAP basis to grow at a slightly higher pace than total revenue in 2020 driven by the continued focus on deepening customer relationships  Full year non interest expense is expected to increase 1  to 3  based on our active management 2019  we are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory  Our focus is on driving continued investment in opportunities to further differentiate Huntington and drive revenue growth As we ve told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions in our 2020 guidance  we remain committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage  We anticipate that the full year 2020 net charge offs will be within a range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points  As Rich just covered fundamentally our credit remained strong  We re taking decisive action to mitigate the risk in our oil and gas portfolio As a result we have expectations for oil and gas charge offs remaining slightly elevated in the first half of 2020  These charges are fully represented in our 2020 guidance  We believe we are adequately reserved at year end and with the life of loan CECL adoption  Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15 5  to 16 5  range Operator  we ll now take questions  We ask that as a courtesy to your peers  each person ask only one question and one related follow up  and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue  Thank you Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Thank you  Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC  Please proceed with your question Stephen D  Steinour    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jon Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  good morning  Well  a lot to ask about  but I ll just maybe start  Steve with just    you talked a little bit about headwinds in commercial  but we do have USMCA when China seemingly done  Just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on that and if you re seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial customers Stephen D  Steinour    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerJon  it USMCA just recently done and obviously there are other issues  distractions going on in DC  right now  so I don t think there is a meaningful change yet but I    from what we reported at the prior conference and I do    I do expect there is going to be a second half    I m optimistic lift    I m optimistic in that regard  but I think it s going to be a little    little hesitant  little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year We did see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year  so spot balances we re down a bit from where we expected them to be  that was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash flow on sheet  So I think that just reflects conservativism and just sort of  a wait and see approach  again in the Midwest we re hampered by lack of labor  So that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then just one more Zach or Rich  maybe Rich for you  just can you talk about the day to CECL impact  again  I think what you said is  you expect that provision to be roughly same in 2020 compared to 2019  I wonder    I wonder if I  you heard that right  and Zach  how you want us to think about provisioning in 2020  Thanks Richard Pohle    Executive Vice President  Chief Credit OfficerYeah  this is Rich  The testing that we ve done and again this is new  so we re kind of going through quarter by quarter  The testing that we did CECL to BAU showed that there were some quarterly volatility  but over the course of the year  It tended to level itself out  So we don t see a lot of    we see more volatility on a quarterly basis going forward  but we don t expect a material change in the overall provision under CECL than we have under the incurred loss methodology Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  all right  that s helpful  Thank you Richard Pohle    Executive Vice President  Chief Credit OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James  Please proceed with your question David Long    Raymond James    AnalystGood morning  everyone Richard Pohle    Executive Vice President  Chief Credit OfficerGood morning Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerGood morning David Long    Raymond James    AnalystWith your revenue outlook for the year  what is the rate backdrop that you are assuming right now Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThis is Zach  I ll take that question  David  I m good to talking to you  We re essentially assuming the forward yield curve as it existed in November although it s relatively consistent with where it looks right now  The fed funds expectation is relatively neutral  I think the actual forward rate  look at it precisely included    forecasted one rate cut sort of in the late summer time period  but I think as we noted in the prepared remarks  based on our hedging program  our net interest income and NIM is essentially neutralized from one rate increase or one rate decrease from today  So I would say sort of taking a step back sort of roughly flat from where we are today David Long    Raymond James    AnalystGot it  And if the    if the rate backdrop goes against you  do you have additional levers that you can pull on the expense side  so you can still produce positive operating leverage Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  we do  I think under most realistic rate scenarios  as I mentioned that the hedging program will keep our NIM pretty constant  So we re not expecting to have to pull those expense levers but as always  we do have a number of expense levers that we ve got at our disposal  I ll tick down a few of them  We can always look at the pacing and phasing of our strategic growth initiatives  We ve got the number one brand share in Michigan and Ohio and so looking at our branch network and the costs around few levers is an opportunity and    I think generally as we see revenue soften  we typically see  just the linked variable expense reduction from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that So those are the levers we ve got as well as we look at all the time  there are other levers like staffing contingency plans  which you saw us pull in the fourth quarter of 2019  which are at our disposal  but again it s not our expectation that we ll have to do that in 2020  The last thing I ll just say is  you commented a positive operating leverage  We are managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in 2020 David Long    Raymond James    AnalystGot it  Appreciate the color  Thanks Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore  Please proceed with your question Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  John Rahul Patil    Evercore    AnalystThis is Rahul Patil on behalf of John  Just have a two part question on your auto lending business  Considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in this space  Are you seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you had previously expected And then the second part is tied to CECL  the CECL implementation impact your appetite for auto loans going forward  Just trying to gauge  what s your 2020 auto loan growth outlook  following a flattish average balance in 2019 Richard Pohle    Executive Vice President  Chief Credit OfficerYeah  John  it s  Rich  I ll take that  So I ll take the second question first  So as it relates to CECL  the auto business is really neutral  The weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that much different than what we had under the incurred loss methodology  So it s a fairly benign impact from a CECL  As it relates to the overall business strategy  I think we have just a tremendous franchise across multiple states with thousands of dealers that we ve got the ability to drive volume  I think we are in a  a very high FICO band that tends to be more price sensitive than others  So I don t see us having any real issues and meeting the origination goals that we ve got from the indirect auto business in 2020 Rahul Patil    Evercore    AnalystOkay  And then last quarter  I believe you d indicated that the consensus NIM estimate around that time of 3 20  for full year  20 was reasonable  but I believe that you had assumed earlier a couple of rate cuts in that 2020 NIM guidance  Could you just discuss your updated thoughts  I know you talked about  rebound in first half and then stable  but are you still comfortable with that 3 20  level right now Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thanks for the question  This is Zach  I ll answer that one  So the answer is yes  we are still comfortable with the approximately 3 20  guidance that we talked about in December at the Goldman Sachs Conference and then just reiterated today in the prepared remarks  So we expect the trajectory of that to be ticking higher into the first quarter  sort of stabilizing around that level by mid second quarter and then oscillating around that level through the balance of the year  There s really a couple of big drivers of that  So the most substantial of which is the repricing of the deposit maturities that we talked about in the prepared remarks  there is roughly  5 billion repricing in Q1 and another  4 billion repricing in Q2 and so far  we re really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that which is proceeding according to our plans The other factor with a little smaller but still helpful is the 70 basis points of pick up we got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier  So  those two factors what s driving that and helping us to get the NIM to back to 3 20   with that being said  there s a couple of factors we re watching  Asset yields on new production all of your previous question around auto and residential  we continue to see them where we want them  but that s something we look at very carefully The other one is  as I mentioned in my prepared remarks  the volume and rate for the deposit costs  again  we re seeing the trend on our expectation  but it s something that we ll continue to watch  Those are the biggest factors that could cause the NIM to be higher or lower than that 3 20  Rahul Patil    Evercore    AnalystOkay  And then  I just want to clarify one thing and that is assuming a cut    rate cut in the summer of this year Zachary Wasserman    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s    assuming    essentially  the forward rate curve that exists in November as I mentioned  which if you look precisely at the fed funds expectation in that had one cut over the late summer time period  but even if it s flat  we re going to be roughly  Technical Issues Rahul Patil    Evercore    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Ken Huston with Jefferies  Please proceed with your question Ken Huston    Jefferies    AnalystHey  thanks guys  good morning  One more question on the deposit    good morning  One more question on the deposit side of things  see what you re expecting for total growth  I m assuming that s still coming from core customer growth  You mentioned the  5 billion that s going to reprice  underneath that  can you just talk about what s happening in your markets as far as just underlying core deposit pricing and if that s still also coming down aside from what you re just scheduled is going to reprice from the rollovers Stephen D  Steinour    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I think we re  as I said  we re seeing the repricing activity be pretty much in line with our expectations  ticking down but also being somewhat competitive  so we ve assumed and planned for the rate environment we ve got right now and we re seeing it trend in that way Mark Muth    Director of Investor RelationsYeah  Ken  this is Mark  I would say that generally  what we re seeing on the consumer side is very rational and as we would have expected and the repricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention has allowed us to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side  which we do see is more competitive  If you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there  it definitely is on the commercial side in particular with your large dollar deposit on the commercial side and we ve just allowed some of those to leave the bank as a result of the success we re having on consumer side Ken Huston    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  OK  And then one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet with pretty good loan growth and pretty good deposit growth  what do you see happening in terms of both the size of the securities portfolio  and can you talk about the underlying dynamics of  in a stable rate environment

196676,418192,HBAN,Why Bank ETFs May Soar In 2020 ,opinion,"Bank ETFs have been a tear lately after a period of volatility  A flattening yield curve was a major concern in mid 2019  But talks of a mini trade deal between the United States and China bode well for banks  Overall  the year has been great for banks as the Banks   Major Regional industry  up 32 4   has beaten the broader market this year  up 25 2   
The industry has added 11 2  in the past month  as of Nov 13  2019  versus 4 3  gains seen in IVV  The last three month performance has also been upbeat with banks  up 19 7   surpassing the S P 500  up 7 72    read    
Let s take a look how the space is evolving for 2020 
Deposits Are Rising 
Per   deposits across the largest U S  banks grew 5 8  year over year in the third quarter   the fastest pace since the start of 2017  according to Federal Reserve figures  As much as 89  of large U S  banks  total liabilities are now deposits  the highest proportion since 1979  according to Federal Reserve 
Since Autonomous Research expects interest bearing deposit costs at big banks to decline roughly 0 15 percentage point from the third quarter to the fourth  such huge deposits could act as a great source of funding for banks  Deposits are the cheapest form of liability versus bonds or short term borrowing 
Investors should also note that the noninterest bearing deposits grew by a median 0 1  sequentially in the third quarter across the biggest banks  marking the first sequential jump in at least five quarters  according to JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  analysts  quoted on Wall Street Journal 
Solid Dividend Payments
Bank stocks are often known for their dividends  Historical dividend growth of The Banks   Major Regional industry is 12 25  versus 5  boasted by the S P 500 ETF iShares Core S P 500 ETF   Dividend yield of the space is 2 85  against 1 84  of the S P 500 
Huntington Bancshares   NASDAQ HBAN    yields 4 08  annually   KeyCorp   NYSE KEY    yields 4 06  annually   and Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    yields 10 70  annually  are   
  many bank stocks offer dividend payout ratios in the range of 30  to 40   Analysts consider  current dividends and payout structures as stable  and believe that dividend payouts should not come under pressure in any occasion of economic slowdown 
  if at all there is any earnings pressure  if we go by the article published on morningstar  Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF  is a good way to play this trend  The fund yields 8 51  annually  read    
Cheaper Valuations
Major regional banking stocks are undervalued at the current level  The space currently has a P E of 12 30x versus 18 64x boasted by IVV  Price to Book ratio is 1 31x versus 5 00x of IVV  PEG ratio of big banks stands at 1 50x versus 2 10x of IVV 
U S  GDP Solid  if Not Great  Powell Unlikely to Cut Rates Ahead
The U S  economy grew an annualized 1 9  in the third quarter of 2019  surpassing expectations of 1 6   following a 2  uptick in the previous three month period  The unemployment rate is hovering around a 50 year low level  Against this backdrop  Fed chief Powell sees no need for a rate cut   No more Fed policy easing could be good news for bank stocks  read  U  
Against this backdrop  we highlight a few bank ETFs that have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund 
Vanguard Financials Index Fund ETF Shares 
First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund 
Any Wall of Worry 
No matter how big an amount a bank has in its deposits  utility of the same declines if there is limited loan growth  Notably  loan growth in the third quarter was 0 7   down from 1 1  in the second quarter  for the biggest banks 
Also  if customers are keeping so much cash in non interest bearing accounts  it could be a sign of an impending recession  Competitive environment among big banks for client acquisition will also remain cut throat  per the article published on Wall Street Journal 
Finally  a lot depends on trade  If there is no meaningful trade deal ahead  long term bond yields may slide  spelling trouble for banks  But if the opposite happens  bank stocks will soar

196700,418216,HBAN,Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 17 billion  up 1 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares 
For Huntington Bancshares  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  3 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Huntington Bancshares appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/huntington-bancshares-hban-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200474631,200474631

were concerns Citizens Financial Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlaySoft Net Interest Income  NII  Growth  The quarter witnessed slowdown in commercial and industrial  and real estate lending scenarios  Though consumer loans witnessed an uptrend  NII is expected to have received little support  Also  the Fed s decision to lower rates  flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas during the quarter are likely to have impacted net interest margin to some extent However  rise in earning assets is likely to have boosted interest income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  146 6 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates a 3 1  rise from the year ago reported figure The consensus estimate of  1 16 billion for NII suggests slight year over year growth Moreover  management expects average loans to have remained broadly stable in the quarter  Further  margin is expected to have declined on a sequential basis due to interest rate cuts Higher Capital Market Fees  Thethird quarter witnessed dismal capital markets performance due to several lingering concerns  including uncertainty related to the U S  China trade war and Brexit  and expectations of global economic slowdown  Also  despite a decent equity market performance  equity issuance is likely to have weakened While M A deal value and volume witnessed a fall due to subdued business investments amid trade tensions during the quarter  Citizens  might have charged higher advisory fees due to its solid business profile  The consensus estimate for capital market fees of  60 million indicates a 27 7  rise Rise in Fee Income  Per the Fed s   deposits improved in the third quarter  and are likely to have aided Citizens in bagging higher service charges and fees  Further  the trend of consumer spending was decent during the quarter  which is likely to have provided some support to the company s top line  The consensus estimate for card fees of  63 million indicates a 8 2  increase Due to lower mortgage rates  mortgage refinancing activities and fresh originations picked pace in the quarter  as a result of which Citizens is expected to have reported higher mortgage banking fees  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same is  65 million  indicating 32 7  rise Furthermore  given the decent equity markets  trust and investment services fees are

196704,418220,HBAN,U S  banks flex capital muscle in annual stress test,news,"By Lisa Lambert and David Henry  Reuters    Big U S  banks are proving themselves to be stronger and sounder in an annual regulatory stress test  even as the Federal Reserve changes doomsday scenarios to keep them on their toes  On Thursday  the Fed said each of the 33 U S  banks that underwent its standardized stress test were able to stay above minimum required capital levels in severe economic and market conditions  Banks that participated last year also passed  but their capital levels have largely improved since then  Overall  the 33 banks would suffer  385 billion in loan losses over nine quarters under the most severe scenario  the Fed said  In aggregate  a key ratio measuring high quality capital against risk weighted assets  known as the Tier 1 common equity ratio  would drop to a low of 8 4 percent  That is well above the 4 5 percent minimum set by regulators   Click here to see how the banks performed    Since the Fed started stress testing banks in 2009  capital levels have risen and credit quality has improved  with bad loans rolling off the books  The Fed creates new inputs for market and economic chaos each year  and shocked investors in January when it included negative interest rates in the worst case scenario   Today s results are particularly notable given the more stringent test assumptions above last year s test   said Richard Foster  senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the industry trade group Financial Services Roundtable   Banks now hold extremely high levels of capital and liquid assets as compared with historical averages   Analyst Steven Chubak of Nomura Securities said   For the big banks  the results were just incredibly robust   Capital levels surged from last year s results as the Fed gave the big banks credit for more revenue at the end of test period than some of the banks themselves expected  Chubak said  However  Thursday s results are just one part of the Fed s annual stress test process  and do not even offer a glimpse at what many investors really want to know  Will banks be able to use more capital for dividends and stock buybacks  This first test   called the Dodd Frank Act Stress Test  or DFAST   is part of the sweeping financial reform law passed in the wake of the 2007 2009 financial crisis  It relies on standardized assumptions about capital levels and distributions for the tested banks  allowing for a consistent view across the industry  Next week  the Fed will release results of a more nuanced examination known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  or CCAR  That test evaluates banks  individually tailored plans for surviving a crisis  The Fed gives each bank a pass or fail grade for CCAR  based not only on hard numbers  but also on qualitative measures  That means the Fed can fail a bank because it did not approve of how management went about the capital planning process   DFAST is sort of like a dress rehearsal for the CCAR   said Ernie Patrikis  a partner at the White   Case law firm and a former bank regulatory official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  Thirteen banks have failed CCAR since the Fed began disclosing results  according to research firm Trepp  In an analysis carried out before DFAST results were released  Trepp analysts predicted two thirds of the banks will likely be allowed to increase their dividends  The percentage approved for dividends has been ticking down from 72 percent in 2013 to 67 percent in 2014  and 61 percent in 2015   Banks generally are doing pretty well on earnings  so there is capacity to increase their dividends   said Matt Anderson  managing director at Trepp  NEGATIVE RATE PAIN The Fed will announce CCAR results on June 29  Failures are embarrassing  and the Fed allows banks to resubmit capital plans based on DFAST results to give them a second chance to pass  They have until Saturday to do so  Of the 33 banks that took part in DFAST  Huntington Bancshares  NASDAQ HBAN  Inc produced the lowest minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio  of 5 percent  under a severely adverse scenario   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  and BMO Financial Corp produced the weakest Tier 1 leverage ratio   another measure of capital strength relative to assets   of 4 9 percent  under that scenario  Banks also released their own stress test results  based on inputs set by the Fed  The figures did not necessarily match up  For instance  Morgan Stanley s own capital ratios under severe stress were higher than the U S Federal Reserve test result  as were  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co s and BMO s  Banks that look marginal in DFAST may well have submitted capital plans that include the issuance of securities that would dramatically affect their capital scores  And  banks with strong numbers can still fail CCAR because the Fed considered the quality of their capital planning faulty   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   for example  has had surprising results for both reasons in the past  This year  Citi racked up big gains  with its Tier 1 common equity ratio rising to 9 2 percent from 6 8 percent and its Tier 1 leverage ratio improving to 6 9 percent from 4 6 percent  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  saw its Tier 1 common equity ratio rise to 8 3 percent from 6 3 percent  Wells Fargo improved less  possibly because it relies more on consumer deposits for funding and therefore could have been hurt more by the negative interest rate scenario  The Fed generally assumes that banks would not be able to pass along negative rates to consumers by charging them for holding their deposits

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares 
For Huntington Bancshares  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Huntington Bancshares will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 32  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

196749,418265,HBAN,Why Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Huntington Bancshares in Focus
Headquartered in Columbus  Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 10 49  so far this year  The regional bank holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 14 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 25   This compares to the Banks   Midwest industry s yield of 2 32  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 56 is up 12  from last year  In the past five year period  Huntington Bancshares has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 24 15   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Huntington Bancshares s current payout ratio is 47   meaning it paid out 47  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
HBAN is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  1 33 per share  with earnings expected to increase 10 83  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  HBAN is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-huntington-bancshares-hban-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200405502,200405502

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 15 billion  up 6 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 01  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts

196782,418298,HBAN,Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 16 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 44  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares 
For Huntington Bancshares  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  3 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Huntington Bancshares appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/huntington-bancshares-hban-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376707,200376707

196793,418309,HBAN,Can Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Huntington Bancshares  HBAN   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Midwest industry 
This regional bank holding company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 29  
For the last reported quarter  Huntington Bancshares came out with earnings of  0 33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 32 per share  representing a surprise of 3 13   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 29 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 30 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 45  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Huntington Bancshares  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Huntington Bancshares has an Earnings ESP of  0 32  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-huntington-bancshares-hban-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200374861,200374861
196799,418315,HBAN,Will Controlled Expenses Aid Huntington  HBAN  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Huntington Bancshares   NASDAQ HBAN   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 24  before the opening bell  The company s revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year The company s first quarter results are expected to reflect the support from robust organic growth and benefits of strategic moves Rising interest rates might have worked in favor too  Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent  pressure on Huntington s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the rate hikes  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 10 billion for revenues indicates a 5 5  year over year improvement Huntington has a decent earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 2 1   Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Last quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Higher revenues  continual growth in both loan and deposit balances  and lower provisions were among the positives  However  elevated expenses were the primary headwind Activities of Huntington during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  Thus  over the last seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s earnings remained unchanged at 28 cents  Nevertheless  it reflects a year over year jump of 33 3  Notably  Huntington s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 3 7  for the three month period ended Mar 31  2018  outperforming 2 7  growth recorded by the industry Will the stock s rally continue post first quarter earnings release  Let s see how things are shaping up Earnings WhispersAccording to our proven model  we cannot conclusively predict if Huntington will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time  That s because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 77  Zacks Rank  Huntington currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsRevenues to Grow  Revenues are expected to grow in line with the company s long term financial goals  including synergies from the FirstMerit acquisition Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending   particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  real estate and consumer   might perk up interest income  Notably  management s projections of 2018 NIM to remain flat year over year on a GAAP basis as expansion in NIM is anticipated to offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well Credit Quality to Normalize  Overall  credit quality is expected to remain at the current levels  However  in the quarter to be reported  moderate volatility can be recorded given the reduction in problem assets and credit costs  and volatility in the commodities and currency market  Notably  loan loss provisions are likely to gradually normalize and net charge offs might remain below the long term target range of 35 55 basis points Expenses under Control  Though management remains focused on expense management  we remain apprehensive due to the company s continued investments in business  However  there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm s earnings unusually in the to be reported quarter  Notably  the company projects non interest expenses to be down 2 4  in 2018  the impact of which is likely to reflect in the first quarter results Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model  these have the

196814,418330,HBAN,Is Huntington  HBAN  A Feasible Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Huntington Bancshares Incorporated   NASDAQ HBAN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Huntington has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Huntington s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Huntington has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 7  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Huntington s P CF ratio of 11 6 is lower than the industry average of 19  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Huntington currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Huntington a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Huntington is just 1 8  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  HBAN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Huntington might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of c and a Momentum Score of B  This gives HBAN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current year estimate has seen two upward and six downward movements in the past two months This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year estimate has gone lower by 3 3  over the same time frame  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHuntington is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 36  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential

196816,418332,HBAN,Will Citigroup  C  Q4 Earnings Disappoint On Trading Slump ,opinion,The expected fall in Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   trading revenues will likely have an adverse impact on fourth quarter 2017 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source  Nevertheless  this may not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 16  Benefits of higher rates  decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments   mainly consumer banking   are anticipated to offset the trading slump In 2017  several political and geopolitical developments  interest rate hikes  tax act movements and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility  However  subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long term interest rates  along with absence of positive catalysts  have been on the downside Per John Gerspach  chief financial officer  CFO  of Citigroup  the low level of volatility in the fourth quarter  particularly compared to last year when market was reacting actively to the U S  election  is likely to take a toll on trading revenues  He projects high teens year over year decline in trading revenues  Fixed income and foreign exchange segments  on which the company depends significantly  are likely to have been affected the most Gerspach also said that he projects revenues from Citi branded credit cards in North America to be relatively flat on a year over year basis  Pressure has been put on the revenues due to the company s extensive marketing strategy Other Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth  In consumer  management expects continued modest year over year revenue growth  and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in fourth quarter 2017  In total  sequential growth in pre tax earnings in Global Consumer banking is recorded for the last two quarters and is anticipated to continue into the fourth quarter as well Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate  Continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom line numbers  Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line  As the interest rate hike is expected to continue  many U S  companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later  Therefore  debt origination fees will lead to solid gains Also  despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally  the fourth quarter turned triumphant  Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow on offerings  So  the related fees are projected to increase for banks  Thus  Citigroup is also likely to report an impressive quarter On the institutional side  continued year over year revenue growth in accrual businesses  including TTS  the Private Bank  Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated  Markets revenues are likely to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter Lesser scope of cost containment  As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank  expense reduction might not be a major support  However  some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup s earnings to an extent Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending   particularly in the consumer area   might perk up interest income Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively  Cost of credit is likely to be in line  quarter on quarter  driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG  offset by lower reserve builds in consumer  Net credit card losses are likely to worsen  Rate in the branded cards business is expected to be 285 basis points  bps  in 2017 and expand about 10 bps in 2018  Also  in the retail services business  rate is expected to be 470 bps in 2017 and increase to 500 bps in 2018 Adverse impact of new tax code  The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one time bonus payments  higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings  Notably  in early December 2017  before the passage of the tax act   Citigroup executive had noted that the U S  corporate tax overhaul will hurt earnings in the fourth quarter  The company had expected one time charge of  16  17 billion related to the write down of deferred tax assets  DTAs  and charge related to cash repatriation to be around  3  4 billion Here is what our quantitative model predicts Citigroup does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a

196873,418389,HBAN,Is Huntington Bancshares  HBAN  Stock A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Huntington Bancshares Incorporated   NASDAQ HBAN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Huntington Bancshares has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 08  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 28  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Huntington Bancshares  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks   Midwest industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 50  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Huntington Bancshares has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 48  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Huntington Bancshares stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Huntington Bancshares has a P S ratio of about 3 83  This is  however  higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 08 right now If anything  Huntington Bancshares is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Huntington Bancshares currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Huntington Bancshares a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Huntington Bancshares is 1 67  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 90  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 64  which is far better than the industry average of 13 40  Clearly  HBAN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Huntington Bancshares might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives HBAN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and one downward revision in the same time period Consequently  the current quarter consensus estimate as well as the full year estimate has remained stable in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHuntington Bancshares is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 32  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Banks   Midwest industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well

Looking to get a jump on the week  I ve decided to put together a list of the top momentum stocks at Zacks com  These are stocks which are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks which have Momentum Style Scores of  A  or  B  which are breaking out to new highs  With several bullish estimate revisions creating a tailwind for these stocks  the price breakout through to new highs should be sustainable  Here are the five hottest momentum stocks this week 
Allison Transmission  ALSN 
Allison Transmission Holdings  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  designs  manufactures  and sells commercial and defense fully automatic transmissions for medium  and heavy duty commercial vehicles  and medium  and heavy tactical U S  defense vehicles 

The stock has recently broken out from a consolidation range it was locked in since mid April  That range extended from  26 to nearly  31  Over the last couple of weeks  shares have broken out from the top end of the range  shortly after a bullish moving average crossover in early October  That s when the 20 day crossed over the 50 day  The signal was confirmed when the commodity channel index  CCI  pushed higher from oversold at  100 and up through the zero line in late October   
Huntington Bancshares  HBAN 
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated  NASDAQ HBAN  operates as a holding company for The Huntington National Bank that provides commercial  small business  consumer  and mortgage banking services  

Huntington has been in an uptrend since pushing above the 20 day moving average in mid July  However  it wasn t until the election that shares really started to rally sharply  breaking above  10 50 and getting to  12 50 the end of last week  Shares seem a little overbought with the CCI up at 108  I d be more comfortable getting back on board after seeing that CCI come down to the zero line 
Las Vegas Sands  LVS 
Las Vegas Sands Corp   together with its subsidiaries  develops  owns  and operates integrated resorts in Asia and the United States  It owns and operates The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel  Sands Cotai Central  the Four Seasons Hotel Macao  Cotai Strip  the Plaza Casino  and the Sands Macao in Macao  the People  s Republic of China  and iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore  The company also owns and operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino  The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino  and Five Diamond luxury resorts on the Las Vegas Strip  Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas  Nevada  and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  

Contrary to the other names on this list  the breakout in LVS started much earlier  Rallying off the lows in July  LVS broke out from the  54 level in mid September before consolidating in a much higher range for the last two months  Recent price action has followed a CCI  Buy  signal late last week as a new 52 week high was carved out  This could be the breakout stock of the week here 
Nvidia  NVDA 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  operates as a visual computing company worldwide  It operates in two segments  GPU and Tegra Processor  The GPU segment offers processors  which include GeForce for PC gaming  Quadro for design professionals working in computer aided design  video editing  special effects  and other creative applications 

I ve been very bullish on NVDA for a long time  In fact  here s me recommending a long call on NVDA in February of last year on Bloomberg  
To be honest  I didn t think the company had anything left in the tank this quarter and was looking to short out of the money calls  while staying long term bullish on the company  Needless to say  that trade did not work out but I m still pleasantly surprised with NVDA  The breakout on earnings has now taken shares to the mid  90s  This is a stock that was at  25 when I recommended it last February 
Teradyne  TER 
Teradyne  Inc  designs  develops  manufactures  and sells automatic test equipment worldwide  Its Semiconductor Test segment designs  manufactures  sells  and supports semiconductor test products and services for wafer level and device package testing in automotive  industrial  communications  consumer  computer and electronic game applications  and others 

It appears as if there was an exhaustion of selling on October 21st  The huge range that day shows that sellers tried to force the stock down but buyers ultimately stepped in and the stock finished higher on the day  From there  a CCI  Buy  was triggered and shares rocketed higher  Over the last two weeks  the stock has consistently made new 52 week highs nearly on a daily basis 
Bottom Line
The market is en fuego right now  You want to make sure that you ve got your money positioned in the hottest momentum stocks in order to take full advantage of the rally  By applying the power of the Zacks Rank to stocks showing fantastic price momentum in the middle of breakouts  you give yourself great odds of short term trading success

	Looking to get a jump on the week  I ve decided to put together a list of the top momentum stocks at Zacks com  These are stocks which are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks which have Momentum Style Scores of  A  or  B  which are breaking out to new highs  With several bullish estimate revisions creating a tailwind for these stocks  the price breakout through to new highs should be sustainable  Here are the five hottest momentum stocks this week 

Allison Transmission   NYSE         

	Allison Transmission Holdings  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  designs  manufactures  and sells commercial and defense fully automatic transmissions for medium  and heavy duty commercial vehicles  and medium  and heavy tactical U S  defense vehicles 

	The stock has recently broken out from a consolidation range it was locked in since mid April  That range extended from  26 to nearly  31  Over the last couple of weeks  shares have broken out from the top end of the range  shortly after a bullish moving average crossover in early October  That s when the 20 day crossed over the 50 day  The signal was confirmed when the commodity channel index  CCI  pushed higher from oversold at  100 and up through the zero line in late October 

Huntington Bancshares   Nasdaq         

	Huntington Bancshares Incorporated operates as a holding company for The Huntington National Bank that provides commercial  small business  consumer  and mortgage banking services 

	Huntington has been in an uptrend since pushing above the 20 day moving average in mid July  However  it wasn t until the election that shares really started to rally sharply  breaking above  10 50 and getting to  12 50 the end of last week  Shares seem a little overbought with the CCI up at 108  I d be more comfortable getting back on board after seeing that CCI come down to the zero line 

Las Vegas Sands   NYSE         

	Las Vegas Sands Corp   together with its subsidiaries  develops  owns  and operates integrated resorts in Asia and the United States  It owns and operates The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel  Sands Cotai Central  the Four Seasons Hotel Macao  Cotai Strip  the Plaza Casino  and the Sands Macao in Macao  the People s Republic of China  and iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore  The company also owns and operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino  The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino  and Five Diamond luxury resorts on the Las Vegas Strip  Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas  Nevada  and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania 

	Contrary to the other names on this list  the breakout in LVS started much earlier  Rallying off the lows in July  LVS broke out from the  54 level in mid September before consolidating in a much higher range for the last two months  Recent price action has followed a CCI  Buy  signal late last week as a new 52 week high was carved out  This could be the breakout stock of the week here 

Nvidia   Nasdaq         

	NVIDIA Corporation operates as a visual computing company worldwide  It operates in two segments  GPU and Tegra Processor  The GPU segment offers processors  which include GeForce for PC gaming  Quadro for design professionals working in computer aided design  video editing  special effects  and other creative applications 

	I ve been very bullish on NVDA for a long time  In fact  here s me recommending a long call on NVDA in February of last year on Bloomberg  

	To be honest  I didn t think the company had anything left in the tank this quarter and was looking to short out of the money calls  while staying long term bullish on the company  Needless to say  that trade did not work out but I m still pleasantly surprised with NVDA  The breakout on earnings has now taken shares to the mid  90s  This is a stock that was at  25 when I recommended it last February 

Teradyne   NYSE        

	Teradyne  Inc  designs  develops  manufactures  and sells automatic test equipment worldwide  Its Semiconductor Test segment designs  manufactures  sells  and supports semiconductor test products and services for wafer level and device package testing in automotive  industrial  communications  consumer  computer and electronic game applications  and others 

	It appears as if there was an exhaustion of selling on October 21st  The huge range that day shows that sellers tried to force the stock down but buyers ultimately stepped in and the stock finished higher on the day  From there  a CCI  Buy  was triggered and shares rocketed higher  Over the last two weeks  the stock has consistently made new 52 week highs nearly on a daily basis 

Bottom Line

	The market is en fuego right now  You want to make sure that you ve got your money positioned in the hottest momentum stocks in order to take full advantage of the rally  By applying the power of the Zacks Rank to stocks showing fantastic price momentum in the middle of breakouts  you give yourself great odds of short term trading success
