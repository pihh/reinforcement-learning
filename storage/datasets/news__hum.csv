141202,362717,HUM,Should Value Investors Pick Humana  HUM  Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Humana  Inc    NYSE HUM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Humana has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 04  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 83  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Humana puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 22 38  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 54  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Humana has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 62  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the stock has a P S ratio of about 0 78  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 60 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Humana currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes HUM a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall 
Though Humana might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives HUM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while current year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 9  in the past two months  while current year estimate has not shown any earnings movement in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below   Humana Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHumana is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 6  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ",2020-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-humana-hum-stock-right-now-200500536,200500536

141204,362719,HUM,Goldman Sachs  3 Healthcare Stocks to Snap Up Now,opinion,Stuck for fresh investing inspiration  You re not alone  After the stock market s record breaking performance in 2019  plenty of uncertainty lingers on Wall Street as we go forward into 2020  The U S  presidential election coupled with new fears related to the spread of the coronavirus  which pushed the S P 500 down 1 6  yesterday  have driven concerns that 2020 will see its fair share of volatility Against this backdrop  investment banking giant Goldman Sachs published a report containing valuable insights  Highlighting the healthcare services sector in particular  the firm notes that while it anticipates fourth quarter results will fall in line with expectations  the key area to watch is 2020 guidance  We believe 2020 outlooks will matter more  and see some potential for these updates to be overshadowed by political developments   speci cally  upcoming Democratic primaries  where investors seem braced for a win  or two  by Senator Sanders  a Democratic candidate who supports the elimination of private health insurance   analyst Stephen Tanal explained To this end  the analyst argues that any weakness in the firm s Buy rated managed care organizations  MCOs  will present investors with an attractive entry point Bearing this in mind   we ve pulled up three of Goldman s recent stock picks  and run them through TipRanks  Stock Comparison tool to confirm that Goldman is in the majority on Wall Street in recommending these equities   Based on the information provided by the platform  each of the names has also garnered substantial support from other analysts  enough to earn a  Strong Buy  consensus rating Humana Inc   HUM Healthcare is at the core of everything for medical insurance company Humana  whose goal is to not only improve healthcare  but also make it more accessible  While the company is off to a rocky start in 2020  Goldman Sachs believes several positives are in store Tanal points to the permanent repeal of the health insurance fee  HIF   which will go into effect in 2021  as standing to benefit HUM  According to the analyst  the repeal  will have a disproportionately positive impact on HUM s earnings given its group high exposure to Medicare Advantage   He added   We expect out year estimates to rise post 4Q and in the coming n months  as it appears that most sell side analysts have undershot the likely bene t of the repeal of the HIF  Even though Tanal acknowledges that the company could face headwinds related to higher reimbursement rates for dialysis patients on Medicare Advantage plans  he estimates that the repeal will cover the headwind by a double digit multiple Adding to the good news  Humana s fourth quarter results are expected to be favorable   We are comfortable with 4Q  too  At our recent healthcare CEO conference  HUM s CEO noted that investors should not be overly concerned by the potential impact of the most widespread  u season in years   Tanal wrote With the stock trading at a 9  discount to the S P 500  it seals the deal for Tanal  Given all that HUM has going for it  the analyst not only kept the rating as a Buy  but also added the name to the firm s Conviction List  In addition  the  425 price target implies that shares could climb 23  higher in the next twelve months   To watch Tanal s track record  click here Turning now to the rest of the Street  analysts are generally on board with HUM  14 Buy ratings and 4 Holds assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy Street consensus  Based on the  392 56 average price target  the upside potential lands at 13    See Humana stock analysis on TipRanks Cigna Corporation  CI  Another health insurance name  Cigna s approach has integrated the physical  emotional  financial  social and environmental aspects of health and well being  Even after a solid six month performance in which 16  was ticked on to the share price  Tanal thinks that there s still plenty of room for CI to grow As 2019 marked the first full year since its acquisition of Express Scripts  the Goldman Sachs analyst is expecting the company to post strong fourth quarter numbers  According to his projections  2020 adjusted EPS guidance could fall within the range of  18 05 to  18 55  This figure  should leave room for  beat and raise  quarters  in part because guidance typically excludes future capital deployment and any favorable prior period development  The analyst cites three possible catalysts that could propel shares higher in 2020  First and foremost  the ramp of synergies from Express Scripts could have a significant impact  with the year over year step up previously expected to be  273 million  or 3  of the midpoint of current 2019 guidance  On top of this  he points out that its deleveraging could generate a  154 million step down in interest expense year over year and the earn back of stranded costs related to the Anthem transition in 2019 stand to add  100 million to earnings Tanal added   Between the specialty launch pipeline  the Prime deal  the HIF repeal  proposed incremental capital deployment post the announced divestiture of the Group Disability and Life business and bigger than expected buybacks in 1Q 3Q 2019  we see a clear path to 2021 targeted adjusted EPS of  20 to  21  In line with his optimistic take on CI  the analyst maintained a Buy rating and  245 price target  Should the target be met  shares could be in for a 24  twelve month gain What do other analysts have to say  As it turns out  the rest of the Street generally sides with the bulls  A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 10 Buys  1 Hold and 1 Sell  In addition  the  232 75 average price target indicates 16  upside potential   See Cigna stock analysis on TipRanks HCA Healthcare Inc   HCA  Focusing on a different segment of the healthcare space  HCA operates hundreds of hospitals and clinics located throughout the U S  Thanks to its performance exiting the third quarter  the Goldman Sachs analyst has high hopes for the healthcare name Despite the investor concern ahead of its fourth quarter earnings release due to the volatility of the fundamentals in the  rst three quarters of 2019  Tanal notes that his bullish thesis is very much intact  Out of all the hospital and dialysis stocks he covers  HCA lands among the top two names expected to deliver the most potential upside compared to the adjusted EBITDA consensus estimate  Same facility adjusted upside could be the source of the beat For HCA  management s outlook for 2020 will be essential  in the analyst s view  He thinks the full year 2020 guidance will come in at around  10 260 million to  10 540 million  versus the Street s  10 354 million forecast  Labor costs are likely to be a focus heading into 2020 given continued robust job growth and low unemployment levels  Further  we will also be interested in any updated commentary on not for pro t M A opportunities  as recent acquisitions such as North Carolina based Mission Health have delivered strong performance vs  the company s initial expectations   Tanal wrote It also doesn t hurt that admissions could see an increase as a result of the current flu season  It should come as no surprise  then  that the Goldman Sachs analyst reiterated his bullish call and  165 price target  This target conveys his confidence in HCA s ability to surge 17  in the coming twelve months Looking at the consensus breakdown  it appears that other analysts are on the same page  With 12 Buys compared to a single Hold  the word on the Street is that HCA is a Strong Buy  At  161 45  the average price target brings the potential twelve month gain to 14    See HCA Healthcare stock analysis on TipRanks

141205,362720,HUM,Analysts Estimate Humana  HUM  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Humana  HUM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 4  
Revenues are expected to be  16 13 billion  up 13 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 31  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Humana 
For Humana  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Humana will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Humana would post earnings of  4 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 03  delivering a surprise of  9 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Humana doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-humana-hum-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200502796,200502796

141209,362724,HUM,How Humana Beat Expectations Again in Q4,news,"Humana  NYSE HUM  beat Wall Street s estimates on both the top and bottom lines when it reported its 2019 third quarter results in November  Investors were hoping for a repeat performance with the health insurer s fourth quarter numbers 
Those hopes were fulfilled when Humana announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Wednesday  Here are the highlights from Humana s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Humana announced Q4 revenue of  16 3 billion  a 15  increase from the  14 2 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year  This result topped analysts  average revenue estimate of  16 19 billion 
The company reported net income in the fourth quarter of  593 million  or  3 84 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This was big jump from Humana s net income of  436 million  or  2 58 per share  recorded in the prior year period 
Humana s adjusted non GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was  2 28 per share  down from adjusted net income of  2 65 per share posted in the same quarter of 2018  However  the company s Q4 adjusted net income was well above the consensus Wall Street estimate of  2 20 per share 
Behind the numbers
The brightest spot in Humana s Q4 update was the performance of its retail segment  which focuses primarily on Medicare plans  Revenue for the segment jumped 18  year over year to  14 2 billion  The retail segment s earnings  though  fell nearly 19  to  275 million on a GAAP basis and  279 million on an adjusted basis as medical costs rose 
Humana s healthcare services segment  which includes its pharmacy services business  delivered Q4 revenue of  6 7 billion  up 8  year over year  The segment s earnings rose 11  on a GAAP basis to  178 million and 8  on an adjusted basis to  241 million 
It wasn t as good of a picture for Humana s group and specialty segment  which markets health insurance products to employer groups and the military  plus specialty insurance products including dental and vision insurance  Revenue for the segment slipped nearly 2  year over year to  1 9 billion  The segment also generated a loss of  146 million on a GAAP basis and a loss of  145 million on an adjusted basis  
Looking ahead
Humana anticipates full year 2020 GAAP earnings per share  EPS  will be between  17 76 and  18 26  Non GAAP EPS is expected to be between  18 25 and  18 75  The company reaffirmed its 2020 individual Medicare Advantage membership year over year growth projection of between 7 5  and 9 2   It also changed its estimate for stand alone prescription drug program membership to a decline of around 550 000 members from its previous guidance of a decline of around 600 000 members 
CFO Brian Kane said   We enter 2020 with positive momentum from strong 2019 results and industry leading individual Medicare Advantage membership growth   He added   We expect 2020 to be another good year for the company with solid top and bottom line growth notwithstanding the return of the health insurance industry fee  
Perhaps the biggest unknown is the impact that the presidential election this year will have on healthcare stocks  Humana and other health insurers would be significantly impacted if a candidate advocating single payer healthcare is elected president ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prj76,2077043

line  Further  Prime is driving its holiday sales growth  Also  expanding content portfolio is encouraging Prime membership  Furthermore  strengthening AWS services and its growing adoption rate are aiding Amazon s dominance in the cloud space However  rising transportation cost related to its free one day shipping service remains an overhang and is likely to increase further  Also  Amazon

s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals over the past two year period   7 4  vs   17 9    But the Zacks analyst believes that the company s Consumer Healthcare joint venture with Glaxo  the Array acquisition and the pending merger of Upjohn unit with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   if successful  will make Pfizer a smaller company with a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines  The smaller Pfizer should see better revenue growth as the Lyrica LOE cliff will go away Pfizer expects continued strong growth of key brands like Ibrance  Xeljanz and Eliquis to drive sales in 2020  Pfizer also has a strong portfolio of new drugs  which will accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond  However  Lyrica generic erosion  currency headwinds and pricing pressure are the key near

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 64   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  4 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 03  delivering a surprise of 9 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Humana  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  16 30 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 87   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 17 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Humana shares have lost about 6 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 1  
What s Next for Humana 
While Humana has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Humana was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Amy  Good morning and thank you for joining us  Today  we reported adjusted earnings per share of  2 28 for the fourth quarter of 2019 and  17 80 for the full year  above our previous estimate of  17 75  We are pleased with our 2019 performance  particularly our success in balancing and executing on multiple priorities as we grew membership  improved the quality and productivity of our operations and continued to invest in the long term During 2019  we experienced significant membership growth in both Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  where we were able to serve our country s sickest and most vulnerable population in need of quality care and better health outcomes  For individual Medicare Advantage  we saw the highest growth we ve seen in a decade  with over 0 5 million seniors choosing Humana MA plans In addition  we have a record number of MA members in 4 Star and higher plans  Our Medicaid membership grew nearly 38  with our statewide Florida win for 2019  and we added approximately 140 000 members on January 1st  2020 under our Kentucky Medicaid contract that was previously fully ceded to CareSource  We also demonstrated the strength of our Medicaid capabilities through procurements  expanded our senior focused payer agnostic primary care centers  significantly advanced our home health capabilities  expanded our pharmacy operations and took significant initial steps toward creating an interoperable health ecosystem via technology partnerships As we begin to scale our clinical solutions in 2020  we are continuing to balance our strategic initiatives across five key areas of influence on a member s health journey  primary care  home  pharmacy  social determinants of health and behavior  Let me give you an update on the recent progression in some of these areas  In 2019  we opened 29 senior focused primary care centers under our wholly owned alliance and JV model bringing our center total to 262  and we continue to see the maturity of our value based care platform resulting in more providers in surplus and improve the operating performance of our legacy Conviva operations We are now evolving from proof of concept to scaling these senior focused value based primary care assets and just this week we announced an exciting strategic partnership with Welsh  Carson  Anderson   Stowe that will accelerate our payer agnostic center expansion giving more seniors access to quality  primary care built around their unique health needs  especially in geographies that lack the access today WCAS is an important strategic partner in Humana s journey of building an omni channel senior focused consumer platform and this new arrangement is a capital efficient approach to rapid expansion  WCAS together with Humana has committed approximately  600 million to create a joint venture that is expected to open a minimum of 50 payer agnostic senior focused primary care centers over three years beginning in 2020  WCAS will maintain majority ownership and Partners in Primary Care will manage the centers for a management fee  Similar to our innovative deal to acquire Kindred at Home  put in call options to provide Partners in Primary Care with a path to full ownership of the centers in 5 to 10 years We are excited to being able to work with WCAS to facilitate faster entry into additional community in need of senior focused primary care  We re also expanding our JV and alliance model and expect to add 35 centers in 2020 with these important partners  Today  we serve over a quarter of a million of our individual MA members in our owned  JV and alliance model  Our goal is to double the number of members served in this model over the next several years Our pharmacy operations just completed the acquisition of Enclara Healthcare  one of the nation s largest hospital benefit pharmacy and benefit management organizations  This acquisition provides Humana pharmacy the opportunity to expand our comprehensive care continuum strategy to cover the pharmacy related needs associated with hospice care  simplify the mail order pharmacy experience and advance the technology stack for in home pharmacy through areas such as enhanced mobile medication management and improved electronic medical record connectivity In the home  we advanced our transformational home health initiative with Kindred at Home and Curo through the implementation of a Companywide EMR and the extrapolation of best practices for  Technical Issues  to over 20 000 home health episodes  The next phase beginning in 2020 is to provide more care services in the home  including acute care and primary care in the home  so that we may begin to generate meaningful trend benders for our health plans in the future while improving clinical outcomes for our seniors We remain committed to improving the life of those we serve through our social determinants capabilities  which positions us strongly to serve the vulnerable populations Medicare and Medicaid and provide us with the experience needed to meaningfully participate in the MA value based insurance design program and Medicaid procurements  In 2019  we scaled social determinants of health screenings to over 1 million  more than doubled the number of screenings in 2018 and connected those in need to community resources  We will continue to expand our outreach and services around social determinants of health in 2020 and beyond Lastly  recognizing that healthcare continues to evolve and technology will be at the forefront of the evolution  we announced two key strategic partnerships in 2019 with Microsoft and Epic to leverage technology to develop a health ecosystem and enable a seamless and integrated experience  Our focus in 2020 will be migration to the cloud to enable interoperability and agility In addition  we are seeing nice uptick in provider engagement Encompass  our population health delivery platform and a higher direct to consumer sales completions in our digital  virtual  intelligent plan recommendation tool as compared to our standard online enrollment tool  We ve also seen that members use the virtual recommendation tool are significantly more likely to share their health information with us in ways that could improve their decision making and help us better onboard and engage clinically once they are enrolled  As a Company  we continue to emphasize the enduring need to drive efficiency and productivity across the organization while not losing focus on the key themes of providing a simpler experience for our customers and delivering better health outcomes As we discussed last quarter  the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2020 posed a significant headwind for the industry  reinforcing this need to drive productivity  As Brian will describe  we worked diligently to identify ways to improve our cost structure by leveraging technology to streamline processes and executing a reduction in our workforce including redeployment of individuals to open positions  which impacted approximately 2 000 jobs  While we were able to drive meaningful savings  it was not an easy task and there are still members who enhance    who experience an increase in premium or reduction in benefits for 2020 given the magnitude of the HIF  Given the significance of the headwind  particularly the  2 10 headwind from the non deductibility of the HIF  we are pleased to provide the ability    the initial adjusted EPS guidance in the range of  18 25 to  18 75  representing reasonable growth while also delivering solid expected MA membership growth  We expect to add 270 000 to 330 000 individual MA members in 2020  representing growth of approximately 7 5  to 9 2   which we believe at a minimum will be in line with the industry growth  These expected results reflect balanced growth across all segments with each segment projected to deliver meaningful pre tax or EBITDA growth in 2020 Brian will provide more detailed segment level guidance in his remarks  As we have discussed previously  given the HIF is a premium based fee  beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  the sicker and most vulnerable populations are disproportionately taxed  Despite that seniors continue to increasingly choose Medicare Advantage over original Medicare with compelling individual MA industry growth of 8 7  in 2019  excluding the impact of cost plans  compared to 7 2  in 2018 and 6 1  in 2017 MA penetration continues to increase  reaching 34  in 2019 and 2020 industry growth is expected to keep pace for 2019 even with the return of the HIF  a testament to the value the MA program provides and a model for other potential public private partnerships for additional populations needing affordable healthcare  Accordingly  we are pleased that Congress waived the fee beginning in 2021 recognizing that the imposition of the HIF falls disproportionately on Medicare beneficiaries and reduces affordability  The permanent repeal of the HIF is a significant win for consumers and we appreciate    are appreciative of the strong bipartisan support to repealing Looking ahead  we are committed to delivering strong short term performance while investing in transformative capabilities for the long term sustainability of the Company  To that end  we will continue to stay focused on three key priorities  expanding our local presence with primary care centers  the home and value based partnership models  modernizing our digital and analytics infrastructure including cloud migration  interoperability and the creation of a longitudinal health record and developing an enterprise clinical operating model built on technology and analytics to integrate our clinical assets focused on patient centered care and disease specific best practices In closing  I want to thank    personally thank our associates for their dedication to our strategy and operational excellence  We are pleased that because of their exemplary efforts in our success in 2019  including improved net promoter score  significantly individual MA membership growth and adjusted EPS growth in excess of our long term target  we are able to reward our associates with higher incentive based compensation  Our associates continued to demonstrate world class engagement which manifest in a better experience for our customers leading to a long term sustainability for the Company Over the next year  we expect political discussion to continue to focus on healthcare and results in market volatility  However  we are confident in the Medicare Advantage program which has significant bipartisan support and our opportunity to be part of the solution to both addressing the rising cost of healthcare and the need for quality outcomes With that  I ll turn the call over to Brian Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Bruce  and good morning everyone  Today we reported adjusted EPS of  2 28 for the fourth quarter of 2019 and  17 87 for the full year  ahead of our previous expectations  This represents 23  increase in adjusted EPS year over year  These 2019 results led by industry leading individual Medicare Advantage membership growth and better than expected MA utilization  provide positive momentum going into 2020  We expect 2020 to be another strong year for the Company with solid top and bottom line growth notwithstanding the return of the health insurance fee or HIF which is not deductible for tax purposes  As I discuss our 2019 results and our expectations for 2020 this morning  I encourage you to reference the waterfall slide provided on our Investor Relations website with the webcast materials As outlined in the waterfall  we expect 2020 adjusted EPS range of  18 25 to  18 75  which is consistent with our commentary last quarter  We believe we struck the appropriate balance between top and bottom line growth while investing for long term sustainability as we contemplated our 2020 pricing  recognizing the significant impact of the return of the non deductible health insurance fee  of which the after tax portion alone is worth  2 10 for the year  Our strong Medicare Advantage growth in both individual and group MA is driving our 2020 consolidated revenue growth of approximately 14  at the midpoint of our revenue guidance of  73 9 billion to  74 5 billion and we are forecasting strong and balanced pre tax and EBITDA growth across our three reporting segments  Additionally  as we contemplate the quarterly progression of earnings in 2020  we expect the first quarter to contribute a bit more than 24  of the annual total which contemplates unusually high workday seasonality in the quarter primarily due to 2020 being a leap year Before discussing the segment results  I would like to echo what Bruce said in his remarks regarding the exemplary performance of our associates this past year  We are pleased that we were able to reward our associates with higher incentive based compensation given the outperformance in 2019 aligning our associates  compensation with the exceptional value they provide for our customers  providers and shareholders  An important part of the work our team accomplished during 2019 was to drive significant productivity savings which took a great deal of effort and necessitated difficult decisions These important initiatives are part of our longer journey to drive cost efficiency over the last number of years  In fact  when you exclude approximately 170 basis points for the impact of the HIF in 2020  the midpoint of our guidance range for the operating cost ratio is 10 3   down 110 basis points versus last year  Even when you exclude the incremental investments made in 2019 that increased our operating cost ratio  the 2020 midpoint adjusted to exclude the HIF still demonstrates 70 basis points of improvement over the 11  midpoint of our initial guide for 2019  This improvement continues the compelling efficiency gains driven over the last five years  freeing up resources to help mitigate the impact on premiums and benefits for our members due to the return of the HIF  while also driving solid earnings growth and enabling us to invest in critical strategic areas I will now turn to segment results  And as I do  I will touch briefly on 2019 and then transition to how we are improving operating results in 2020  I will begin with the Retail segment  In 2019  we saw industry leading individual Medicare Advantage growth of approximately 525 000 members  the highest growth we have seen in a decade  We also experienced considerably lower utilization in Medicare Advantage than our expectations  which allowed us to end 2019 with a benefit ratio for the Retail segment  70 basis points below the midpoint of our initial guidance for the year  We have now experienced multiple years of declining inpatient admissions for 1 000 members or APTs in Medicare Advantage  driven primarily by better health outcomes from our clinical programs coupled with well controlled outpatient physician and pharmacy trends  The 2019 improvement allowed us to invest this outperformance into our 2020 bids which when coupled with our productivity efforts will enable us to grow our individual MA book at the market growth rate at a minimum  This is something we are quite proud of given the material headwinds we faced in 2020 and after coming off an exceptional growth year in 2019 Our Group MA business continues to perform well and we expect to grow Group MA membership by approximately 90 000 members or 17  in 2020  primarily driven by the addition of a large Group account from a competitor  As you know  Group MA membership growth can vary widely from year to year based on the pipeline of opportunities  particularly larger accounts going out to bid  We believe we are well positioned to capture these opportunities as they arise  For our stand alone PDP business  in 2019  we experienced a second consecutive year of significant declines in membership as we no longer were the low price plan in any market  As we ve discussed previously  this business is exceedingly price competitive with a win or take all dynamic  Accordingly  as you are aware  we made important changes in 2020 repositioning our PDP products to allow us to once again have the low price offering in most markets Our new low price Humana Walmart Value Rx Plan is seeing nice growth in 2020  in line with expectations  However  this growth is not enough to overcome the significant losses we are seeing in our Premier Rx Plan where most members experienced a significant increase in premium in 2020 because of our plan design changes caused by the 3 plan limit imposed by CMS and an aging population with more chronic conditions and higher pharmacy costs  Based on the final results of AEP  our expectations for 2020 PDP membership losses have improved relative to our prior guidance and we now expect to lose approximately 550 000 members compared to our previous estimate of approximately 600 000  While these losses are modestly higher than initially expected at the time of bids  the plan changes we made in 2020 were necessary to attract a balanced risk pool and stem the membership losses in our book going forward Lastly  our Medicaid business continues to perform well and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for this business  Effective 01 012020  we added approximately 140 000 members under the existing Kentucky Medicaid contract previously ceded to CareSource  We are pleased to be serving Medicaid members in Kentucky  Florida and Illinois in 2020  We look forward to the final resolution of both the Kentucky and Louisiana procurements where the award of both contracts demonstrated our strong Medicaid capabilities  All in  the Retail segment is expected to show strong operating improvement as demonstrated in the waterfall contributing an incremental  1 66 to adjusted EPS when you adjust for the reinvestment of approximately  0 70 of Retail outperformance from the first half of 2019 in the bids for 2020 to help offset the impact of the HIF While our Retail segment outperformed in 2019  our Group and Specialty segment did not perform well and we are taking the opportunity to significantly reposition the segment in 2020 and beyond  The segment faced a number of pressures  including membership migration out of our community rated product into a level funded ASO which drove unexpected adverse selection in our community rated block resulting in significant negative prior period development  Note that this negative prior period development also adversely impacted the starting cost baseline for 2020 given the unanticipated morbidity mix  Using our consistent historical reserving practices for the Group and Specialty segment  we acknowledged the negative prior year claims development we experienced in 2019 as we contemplated the adequacy of reserves as of December 31st  2019 The segment also experienced large numbers of provider settlements  IT system upgrades for the insurance and specialty businesses and investments in market infrastructure  Our core trend remained stable and we believe the investments we are making in systems and people will position the segment for growth in 2020 and beyond  Accordingly  we expect the segment to contribute approximately  0 55 of incremental adjusted EPS to the enterprise for 2020 For healthcare services  we had a strong year  as we saw growth in our pharmacy business  solid performance of Kindred at Home and continued improvement in our Conviva operations  partially offset by the cost incurred to continue to expand our owned  JV and alliance senior focused primary care centers  Notwithstanding the significant PDP membership losses  our pharmacy script volume grew year over year primarily due to higher Medicare Advantage and state based contract membership  For 2020  despite the expected PDP membership decline we anticipate strong EBITDA growth in the pharmacy business  As Bruce mentioned  we recently closed the Enclara transaction expanding our hospice pharmacy capabilities Our home business is also anticipated to perform well led by Kindred at Home in which the conversion to Homecare Homebase across home health and hospice in 2019 weighed on results due to the significant required one time investment but will drive EBITDA in 2020 notwithstanding the adoption of a new payment methodology PDGM  And in our provider businesses as Bruce described  we are working to meaningfully scale this opportunity and are very excited about the recently announced innovative venture with Welsh  Carson to open a minimum of 50 additional payer agnostic senior focused primary care centers over the next three years which will be managed by our Partners in Primary Care team under the Partners in Primary Care brand Finally  our Conviva primary care business is expected to continue improving its core operating performance  As a result of all these efforts  we expect meaningful year over year healthcare services adjusted EBITDA growth to contribute an incremental  1 03 to adjusted EPS Turning to cash flow and capital deployment  Our operating cash flow was a record  5 3 billion in 2019  reflecting strong earnings and the benefit of a significant membership growth we experienced for individual Medicare Advantage  In periods of increasing enrollment  operating cash flows are positively impacted because premiums are collected in advance of claims by a period of up to several months  While we expect solid MA membership growth in 2020  due to the significant membership increase we experienced in 2019 and timing of the related premium collections and claim payments as well as other working capital items  we expect our operating cash flows for 2020 to be in the range of  3 2 billion to  3 6 billion  Additionally  as we ve demonstrated through the various transactions we have pursued  we will continue to deploy our capital in an efficient manner with a target debt to capitalization ratio of 35  in order to maintain our investment grade credit rating with the ability to move higher than that for strategic M A Finally  our initial guidance for 2020 includes an assumption of some share repurchase in the back half of 2020 and our strategic M A priorities remain the same including the continued build out of our healthcare services capabilities to drive our integrated care model as well as tactical health plan acquisitions to the extent they become actionable With that we will open the lines up for your questions   Operator Instructions  Operator  please introduce the first caller Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen  Your line is open Charles Rhyee    Cowen and Company    AnalystHey  thanks for taking the questions  As we think further out maybe  obviously you ve given us the outlook here for  20  growth remains strong here and you continue to look further to invest  maybe two questions real quick  First in Retail  as we think about investing the HIF money in the future  how do you think    how much do you think that  that should we consider either being really driven for growth versus maybe some of that coming back into earnings And then secondly  you were talking about extending your primary care footprint here  can you give us a little bit more color on how your Partners in Primary Care efforts are going  say sort of not going to be really impactful to 2020  but when would you expect that to really start to have a more meaningful impact to the bottom line  Thanks Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  good morning  Charles  So let me take them in order  First  with regard to the HIF in 2021  As we ve said in prior settings  it s obviously early to be commenting on 2021  We do believe that the health insurance fee repeal will be a significant benefit to our customers and we would expect them to see increased benefits on account of that  But we will balance as we always do membership growth with EPS as well as making sure we invest for long term sustainability  And so you ll see us continue to invest in our integrated care model as we balance top and bottom line growth I would also say  as we think about 2021 and I know this has been a topic of conversation  we ll make sure we understand the impact of ESRD  We need to obviously see where the rate notice ultimately comes out and that s something that we re obviously eagerly anticipating and also will need to gain theory out what we think our competitors do with respect to the HIF repeal in 2021  But overall  we obviously are bullish on 2021 but it s really too early to provide specifics On the second question with regard to primary care  we feel very good about our primary care capabilities  In fact  both our Conviva operations  which are performing nicely and we re seeing good operational turnaround  but also the business we re expanding partners in primary care  we believe has an operating model that can be replicable and scalable across multiple markets in the US and so it s really a function of how do you fund this expansion  There is a significant J curve in these clinics  meaning that for the first few years they lose EBITDA  they lose money and then over time  they begin to make money and actually earn a nice return on investment and so how do we bridge that gap And so partnering with Welsh  Carson  who is an expert in healthcare and very  very good at what they do  we believe that we ll be able to scale this model very efficiently and really get us the capital we need to tie us over between for the J curve period where we re losing money  so where we can bring these back on balance sheet if we decide to do that when they re more profitable Joseph C  Ventura    Chief Legal OfficerJust to add to Brian s comment  We do see benefit from the clinics early on the insurance side  So if you think about the contribution to the Company  there is really two parts to it  One is the actual centers themselves and then the second part is enhancing and moving members more and more to value based payment models  which we see better star score  we see lower MER and we also see a better satisfaction there So in the    as Brian articulated in the J curve side  you ll see it more on the insurance side  As it grows  it continues to be on the insurance side  but then it becomes more on the clinic side  So in 2020  we will see benefits from these clinics and in the 200 some we have we ve seen benefits all along  but you ll see it more on the insurance side and more in the as we reference in trend benders as opposed to see it in the actual profitability of the centers themselves Charles Rhyee    Cowen and Company    AnalystSo basically you re able to direct your members to the primary care centers that you have and is that    when you re recruiting physicians for these centers  is it    are you bringing positions that already have full patient panels themselves or you kind of recruiting doctors who are interested in changing the way they practice in general and   Joseph C  Ventura    Chief Legal OfficerMost of these are exceptions  we will bring some physicians that have patients but the majority of them will be starting from scratch  And that s really the reason for the J curve as what Brian was talking about  In reference to steering the patients there we really    our design plans to make it affordable for people to choose the clinics  but obviously it s their choice and they from    to choose their physician  But we do find in areas where we locate and where they don t have primary care or hospital that we are the sort of the community choice there  So I would just emphasize both from plan and where we locate them is an important part of how our members choose them Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd Charles  was a great example of getting a lot of questions and please remember to limit yourself to one question  Introduce the next question please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of AJ Rice from Credit Suisse  Your line is open AJ Rice    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  everybody  I might just continue to just trying to flush out the strategy around these Partners in Primary Care  With this deal  will the growth all be in this joint venture or can you continue to do ones on your own or with other third parties and is there any restriction around the risk sharing  I know that s been a big part of the long term targeted savings for the health plan is to do risk sharing with these  Is there any restrictions given it s payer agnostic or what you can do there  And then maybe another thing you didn t mention is once you get to 50 up and running  how much of your Humana MA book will be covered by one of the    or have access to one of these clinics Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  let me try to go in reverse order  It will still be a relatively small portion of our MA book which is the reason why for what Bruce said we want to scale these up as quickly as we can  but still be a relatively small portion of our book  Remember from a risk perspective  each or from risk member perspective each clinic has about 2 200 or so risk members kind of varies  depending on the size  it could be as low 1 500  it could go to 2 500 members  And so you can do the math  It s still relatively small  which is why it s important that we take a balanced approach to our growth really getting to your first question We have partnerships with a number of players  They re very valuable partners that  that we will continue to expand with  Some we have equity investments in  some we do not  but we will look to continue to expand those joint venture and alliance models  But we have  I would say  the ability to expand as we see fit to continue to grow this footprint which we will do  We re obviously very mindful of the impacts on the income statement when we do this  So we re trying to be created with the use of our capital  But I would tell you that we have flexibility to execute our business plan And then on the risk sharing side  being payer agnostic is really important  It s important so that we can actually fill up these clinics  It s important so we can attract physicians  It s important to be able to really create the best in class experience for our members and to give them the ultimate    the patients to give them the ultimate choice what they need in their lives  But there is no restrictions with respect to risk sharing or the like  Obviously each risk contract is different and sometimes there are path to risk contract  So we may not go full risk day one but generally we sign at least path to risk deals with the various payers  but we re encouraged by the reception that we ve  that we ve seen from other payers and we re committed to making this payer agnostic Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Peter Costa from Wells Fargo  Your line is open Peter Costa    Wells Fargo    AnalystGood morning everybody  sort of on the same line  focusing on the Partners in Primary Care transaction  one of your competitors    one of your large competitors buys larger practices  physician practices and other    your larger competitors doesn t buy practices at all or run them and use contracts and there is smattering of that across the board  you guys seem to be the ones trying to grow practices  yet you ve had    you ve struggled with that  whether it be Conviva that has gone through a turnaround  Concentra  which never really grew the way you wanted to and now with Partners in Primary Care  it seems like you re pushing that off your books from an earnings perspective here in the short term while it grows  Can you explain why you still think this is the right strategy versus what your competitors are doing Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would maybe try to put those in boxes  Let me start with Concentra  I think Concentra was an urgent care model that had a small primary care part to it  But we ended up doing actually the genesis of Partners in Primary Care is out of Concentra and so we    what we did is we bought the company  then pulled the primary care out of it and then began this    the Partners in Primary Care  So that transaction we didn t want to be in the urgent care business going forward  Conviva  actually is interesting because Conviva today is probably one of the larger organizations in the country that has pure clinics with senior focused  It s got some 200 000 some Medicare Advantage lives in it and is performing well And when we talk about turnaround  it s really more bringing in the various different brands that were in South Florida and creating a brand of one of which that brand  some of those brands have been within the organization since 2008  2009 in that arena  So what you see is more making at a better brand  a holistic brand and growing and continuing to serve the organization well on the insurance side  has good Star scores  it has good MER  good satisfaction and growth  So I wouldn t make either one of those as the organization is sort of shunning or in and out of this I would say there is a philosophy difference between us and others in the country that you re referencing and our philosophy is the buying primary care and trying to convert them to Medicare Advantage value based care model is a highly risky proposition and we ve seen over the years that organizations that have tried to do that have not been totally successful  Now if you re going to keep them fee for service  you re going to keep them commercial  if you re going to keep them in that vein  I think you re going to be quite  quite successful in not having to deal with the change management  What you do see the organization doing is going through sort of stages with that  I think the first stage was around does this work for Partners in Primary Care and we ve been testing and learning that for the last few years and we ve come to the conclusion seeing the results that we ve had in the markets we ve opened that  that this is really working  We re seeing great Star scores  As I mentioned  we re seeing great satisfaction scores  we re being able to recruit doctors into it  we re able to fill them up in the time that we thought So the real question is how do we scale it and so we ve tried to scale out over the years through joint venture partnerships and you ve seen today we have 260  some clinics and serving about 10  or so about our    of our members and now it s just a question of scaling  And so what we chose is to scale it in a way that we can utilize a capital efficient way to be able to do it  Be able to set it as an independent entity but still have control over it over a period of time and be able to use that as a growth vehicle for us  But at the same time continuing to scale through our joint venture and alliance partners that we ve done in the past So I think what you ll see is  is more of a scale question as opposed to anything else and it s a question of how do we build a great base for this and I feel that the Company has matured in a way that is very bullish on this  but at the same time matured in a way to test and learn because of you articulating in different ways  owning and operating physicians is a very  very difficult task at times and it is also a risky task and we ve tried to navigate through this to ensure that the organization is able to both succeed but more importantly  scale this because of the end results Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Justin Lake  Your line is open Justin Lake    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning  A couple of questions on margins  Just first  can you give us an idea of where Medicare Advantage kind of settles out  I know you don t want to give specifics  but just relative to the 4 5  to 5   how close are we there  And also kind of how should we think about it in 2021 if you are going to reinvest some of the HIF as the next move downward in those margins  And then just in terms of the healthcare services business  same thing margins  really strong there looking like in the guide  is that all just improvement in those ancillary businesses that you kind of outlined and if so where do you kind of see the trajectory of those going forward from here  Thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Justin  On the MA side  I would say for 2019  we finished a little bit below our 4 5  to 5  margin  obviously a really strong year given where we started the year  For 2020  as I mentioned in my remarks and we ve discussed in the past  we invested some of that outperformance into    in 2019 into our 2020 bids and so obviously that s going to impact margins  But then we obviously improved the operations as well  So  all in  I would say the margins are relatively flat year over year 2020 versus 2019 and so we re still bit below the 4 5  to 5   With respect to 2021 again  really we re too early to give 2021  but it s fair to say whenever there is that tax impact on the after tax line  you can see the geography of where the earning shows up changes a little bit  So it s conceivable that  that we do have a decrease in margins for 2021 while obviously still growing EPS very nicely  So that s something we would have to work through  but typically  that is a dynamic that s at play when we ve seen tax rates change dramatically  whether because of the HIF or because of tax reform that occurred in 2018 On the healthcare services side  I would describe it as balanced growth  I think we feel very good about really all segments  The pharmacy side is showing a really nice improvement year over year  They continue to drive penetration on the mail order side  on the specialty side as well as we think this Enclara opportunity on the hospice side  will give them some runway as well  Kindred at Home is also performing well  We hope to continue to see strong EBITDA growth notwithstanding the change in the payment model  As you know we ve embraced this payment model because it gets us closer to chronic nursing versus solely focused on therapy But I think the team is doing a really nice job of mitigating any impacts there and also leveraging the benefits of implementing Homecare Homebase and  as Bruce discussed on our primary care business both Conviva and Partners in Primary Care  we see a nice turnaround there particularly in Conviva which is entirely on balance sheet  where we re seeing real improvement in the EBITDA performance  So really I think it s a real positive story on healthcare services and we hope that continues in the years ahead Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies  Your line is open David Styblo    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  good morning  It s Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley  I wanted to ask a question about the Group and Specialty business  just kind of looking at the bridge here  it looks like there s about  0 55 tailwind for 2020 that you called out  I m curious how much of that is from the absence of one time costs that happened in 2019 or settlements versus improvements in the core business  And then more broadly related to that business  how does commercial fit into the broader portfolio just given the fits and challenges that  that business has gone through Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerI would say it s on your first question  it s really a balance  Clearly  we don t have the repetition of one time items  but some of it is also improving in the core business  Some of the pricing actions that we ve taken  I think it s important  and we expect to hope to have gotten the baseline right  As I mentioned in my remarks  the adverse selection we saw in our book really hurt the 2019 performance because 2018 backed up  You sort of have a double whammy there  you have the  18 hit and then you have a    you re trending off the wrong baseline for 2019  So I think we ve    I m hopeful we ve gotten that right  We ll obviously see what happens in the coming months here  So I think it s really a combination of core improvement as well as the one timers not repeating Really to your second question  we continue to invest in this business  that s also weighing on the results for 2020  In other words  the results would have been higher were it not for that  We believe that there is a real opportunity to grow this business  become more of a player  a significant player in particular markets where we re strong in Medicare and where we think really number one  there is an opportunity to drive more relevance with our providers and we think when we have a commercial presence  particularly moving upmarket away solely from the small group and moving into the mid group and sort of larger group side not the jumbo side but more large group  gives us the attention of the providers in the local markets We also think there is a significant cross sell opportunity as members age into Medicare and also on the Group MA side  it s an area where our competitors have done a very nice job leveraging their commercial business  Because we don t have that same commercial business  it s hard for us to get those synergies and so we think there are opportunities there And then the final thing I would say is our specialty business is something that we don t talk a lot about but we re bullish on it and we really hope to grow it both on the Group side and also on the individual side  It s a business that is low capital requirements and good margins and so we think we can continue to grow that and cross sell that product  So for those reasons  we re committed to the business and we re hopeful for a better year this year in 2020 Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerJust to add to Brian  I think just emphasize we realize that having a national strategy in commercial is just not the right direction here and so we are picking markets where today we are strong and utilizing those markets to continue to build our local presence and commercial is one of those along with the other assets that we have and so you see a much more concentrated effort  Obviously as what Brian has talked about in 2019 was a rough year for the commercial business for a whole host of reasons  but we do believe in certain markets that makes sense to have a commercial product and that s what you see the team oriented to  but we need to make sure our infrastructure is prepared for that and that s what you see a lot of the investments and the work going on in 2019 Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Sandler  Your line is open Sarah James    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  Thank you  So just wanted to get a little bit better understanding of some of the non repeat items that are going on here  So you guys talked about negative prior period development related to the Group business but you can t tell on the press release it looks like for total Co  it s net positive  so how much negative group development was there and what would MLR have been without it  And then as we think about other non repeating items that are occurring in  20  is there any carrying costs related to Louisiana and then is there any start up costs related to what you guys are doing on the provider JV side that wouldn t continue as we think about run rate earnings Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Sarah  So I would  and it s    you could see in our press release  there is a breakout between Group PPD and Retail  So Group has gotten hit for the reasons I talked about  Retail was modestly positive  I think it was a good year for PPD  For Retail obviously less so for Group    so that is a    I would call that a one time item and I hope it s a one time item on the negative PPD side for Group  So I think that s one example  There are some modest start up cost in Louisiana  We have to plan for that  So that is in our numbers  in our costs  so we ve obviously scaled up to be ready for that  Again  it s something we re very proud of  The Medicaid team has done just a fabulous job winning that contract and we ll see where it goes  but we feel good about that And so it s important that we make sure we are ready to implement that contract when and if we get    we get that finalized and officially awarded  There are a few other things on the JV side  but a lot of those costs are going to come off our 2020 income statement because of the partnership that we announced  There is still some of that does not    not all that s coming off and we still have some assets on balance sheet  some assets off balance sheet  But really the opportunity here is to be able to scale as Bruce said to scale that business and be able to grow it more quickly so that we don t have additional losses going forward  The idea is to remove those losses  So hopefully  that answers your question Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood morning  guys  And I appreciate you taking the questions  Maybe switching gears for a second  talk a little bit about pharmacy  You ve seen some of your competitors kind of pursue some interesting partnership strategies and you guys have had the decline in Med D enrollment  I guess  do you feel like you need to partner up with somebody either on the rebate aggregation side or the pharmacy network side to get better economics out of your pharmacy business  And do you feel like the current partnerships that you have right now are delivering the rates that you need in net book Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would first say we are always looking for ways to bring a lower cost to our members  So whether it s in    and we do have some generic partnerships today that we buy with and through  So I would say the recent announcement that you re referring to is something that others do but I wouldn t say we are not    we are not exempt from that  but we just don t broadcast it  But we do orient to how do we have a cost of goods and we constantly are checking that and what we find is that we are very  very competitive in the marketplace  The Part D decline is not so much of a cost of goods conversation  it s more around just the pricing of the product itself and as Brian articulated with the unique aspect of Part D is you can start a plan without removing a plan and it gets complicated to do that and that s what you see happening  So I would say it s more on the plan design side for Part D than it is on the side of the cost of goods And related to the pharmacy  I d    we re constantly looking for ways to expand our capabilities whether that s from a delivery point of view to care and clinical point of view  like in specialty pharmacy and in addition in areas that are more oriented to rebates  I would just say that we are content today  but I wouldn t say that content is something that we are going to continue  We will continue as we did with Enclara and other things that we ve done this past year to like to advance that  But again I think the emphasis to the question is  I would not connect the Part D decline to capabilities within our pharmacy as a whole Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorNext question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America  Your line is open Kevin Fischbeck    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  I wanted to go back to the commercial conversation  I don t remember if you actually gave it but what was commercial trend in 2019  Just    I understand the concept of risk converting into ASO but you raised your MLR guidance multiple times through the year and then the fact that you experienced negative development almost every quarter through the year implies that in fact trend is rising and just trying to understand why that s not the case and I heard your comments about why you feel better about next year  but given that consistent MLR guidance increase and given the consistent negative development  how much confidence I guess do you really have in your visibility into that book right now Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Kevin  So again I would distinguish between core trend and sort of the net trend that we re seeing on account of sort of the morbidity mix in our book  Our core trends are relatively stable  I would say just like last year  6  plus or minus the 50 is    50 basis points is sort of a reasonable place to be  We ended up in that range for 2019  It s really the net trend once it sort of filters through and the membership that we have and our morbidity mix that s driving that  Obviously our commercial book is small and as a consequence  it s hard to extrapolate broader for those with larger books whatever it may be and since ours is very focused  it s almost entirely small group based  Well north of 50  of our premium it comes from lives under 100 or groups under 100 and so we re in this interesting part of the marketplace that I think is just been going through a lot of change with respect to the ACA community rated block the 250 block the migration to LFP  the grandmother  grandfather products  It s just    there s just been a lot of churn in that market and so that s really been where we ve been focused As Bruce said  we want to  we want to move upmarket a little bit into the    more mid Group  larger Group space to be more relevant in certain key markets and where it is a strategic objective of ours to do that  I would say we re always mindful of trend and where it s going  but we re less focused on the core trend side than we are in the business mix that we re attracting  So hopefully that distinction makes sense Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorNext question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research Your line is open Josh Raskin    Nephron Research    AnalystHi  thanks  Good morning  thanks for taking the question  Wanted to just get back to the primary care conversation and maybe just take a step back  you ve got a whole bunch of different assets and strategies around this broad strategy of physician enablement and I guess I want to understand what s the ultimate goal  Is this about growing your market share in Medicare Advantage  is this about improving the core profitability of your MA book or is this about controlling medical cost spend and sort of creating a new sort of business segment  business line that over time can kind of augment the overall Humana  I m just curious about sort of where this all starts in terms of and what the end game is Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Let me try to take that and put it in a few elements  It originates out we feel that this is a very effective care model and I think as Peter asked a while back  we ve been doing this for some time and we have a lot of proven results from this  And when you look at our members in these programs  as all the results there  the one thing I didn t mention is also retention is higher and so we see wonderful performance out of there  And if we could wave a magic wand we would want 100  of our members in these programs for all the reasons we ve talked about  The challenge we find in today s world is  is that the fee for service payment model and the model    the operating model within that is sort of what dominates the healthcare system and our ability to put seniors in these types of clinics is very    there isn t a lot of supply  I mean  as you well know  DaVita was probably the one and only that had more of scale there and so over the last few years we ve tried to find a way to scale it through joint ventures and alliances is what Brian was talking about And in addition to have our proprietary product because what we want to make sure of is  is over time  we have a product that when we re in a market that we have stability in our network and that we re able to fulfill that in these particular products allow us to both if we have ownership and other contractual rights that allows us to control our destiny in markets that we want to ensure our members have the proper providers to and that    so the first is great performance Second is the ability to have in the markets  protection around the    we call it the supply chain  And then the third is  is once you begin to go those two routes  then there is the question  how do you optimize that  that the performance of that business  And what you see us doing is saying it needs to be agnostic  it needs to be a business upon itself  it needs to be able to grow and serve the community there  which benefits us as both as an owner of the product  but also it benefits our plan because our plan is also being able to have a lower cost serving there and more effective And so  and then it turns into how do we maximize the business on itself but it originates from what s best for our member and then goes to how do we control and ensure that we have stability in the marketplace for our supply chain  And then the third thing it moves to is now how do we maximize the business there  Where it ultimately ends up is I think you re going to see as Brian said  we want to double our membership in this particular area over the next few years and you re seeing the Welsh  Carson is one of them  Along with our affiliates are another way to do that  But over time I think the investors will see that this will be another part of our business no different than when we started pharmacy years ago and it became part of that and no different than what you ll see with the home that it will be a business that will be profitable  It will be value    valuable from a shareholder point of view  but it also will be valuable for our members point of view Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorNext question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYeah  hi  good morning  My question focuses on the partnership with Microsoft and Epic  What are your kind of like the timelines on deploying Epic in patient EMR  it really captures the data  the member data across the Humana enterprise  And then as we think about this longer term  does this really become sort of a pre requisite for clinic partnerships outside can affect the Humana homegrown base Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll take that  Interoperability is at a core what we see enables value based payment models and the ability for us to manage complex patients  just because of the complexity of the system and the complexity of people s conditions  So to answer your first question  just where are we in that journey  Microsoft and Epic are really two different journeys but both are well along the way  In the Microsoft approach  we really have three different horizons  One is the cloud and moving everything to cloud and allowing a much more agile environment and at the same time  building a longitudinal health record that allows to use FHIR and interoperability inside the organization and outside the organization and both of those things are well on their way  We have  I think we announced last year    last quarter some partners that we ve already rolled out part of the longitudinal record and so that is now in structurally there  we just have to continue to add our partners to it This year we ll be bringing on all of Kindred and that relationship as a result of them completing their EMR install  There is a number of providers through the Compass product that we have that are using the longitudinal record along with some of our pharmacy areas including Enclara and that we just acquired  So we have a  a really good progress going on in both the cloud conversion I think cloud conversion is going to take about five years but what you see and most of that is the traditional technology that s been around for a long period of time taking the longest On the Epic side  what you see is we are in    we just really we have a number of hospitals today that we are now passing information back and forth through in the Epic conversion  I mean the Epic connection  That is in used case only  we re not really announcing what those used cases are but we are in market with a number of hospitals  These are integrated systems that we are passing information back and forth with the Epic area  But these are    these are the beginning of a long process no different than what we are talking with the clinics about the ability to have interoperability  which leads me to the third It is a standard we will imply employ and with our clinics of having interoperability  most of our clinics today already have that interoperability  you ll just see us continue to do it more  But more importantly through any kind of deep partnership  we are looking for interoperability to be a part of that partnership no different than the value based payment models and other mechanisms that we use but interoperability will be an important part of that Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Steve Tanal    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  guys  thanks for the question  Wanted to go back to the HIF repeal in  21  Obviously it s sort of all in worth over  9 00 EPS before any offsets and kind of a uniform magnitude impact to MAOs across the industry which tends to be concentrated at the local level  So I guess is there any reason to think that MA plans won t act rationally to use a portion of the pre tax tailwind to absorb any headwind the rule change on ESRD patients creates  And relatedly  if you could maybe comment on any advocacy efforts with CMS on this front  whether the agency has been receptive and gets the issue and your expectations for what we ll see there whether they will provide actuarially sound rates for ESRD patients in  21 on the advance notice that s tomorrow  kind of curious if this risk factor could actually turn into an earnings opportunity Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerHi  good morning  Steve  So I think it s fair to say obviously  the HIF tailwind would certainly help offset any ESRD headwind  And I think what we re trying to just understand is the magnitude of that headwind and over the coming months we re doing lots of modeling and various scenarios that would drive different levels of penetration in ESRD  which would will obviously impact the 2021 earnings profile  It won t be crazy to think that  that ESRD penetration could get to Medicare Advantage levels we ll see  We re modeling that  There s been a bunch of commentary on the Street about that by various analysts and so we are working through that  I think it s important to really break the population into two buckets  one  being duals  one being non duals to really understand the impact On the dual side  MA could have some appeal to them  just because of the supplementary benefits  particularly around transportation and some over the counter benefits and so that s one of the things we re looking at  And on the non dual side  particularly the under 65 ESRD population  you really need to look at where Med Sup is and understand what the Med Sup availability is for these various folks and in some states it s not available where it s not required to be available or there is significant premiums  And so  it s certainly a premium for someone to buy it  And so that s what we re really trying to understand what the impact will be Again  we feel good about where we are for 2021  Obviously the health insurance fee is a big positive  And on the advocacy side  clearly rates is one factor and we ll see where CMS comes out  I think it s just important for people to understand why the benchmark maybe understated and that s a function of the fact that there is not a maximum amount of pocket in fee for service while there is an MA and so that impacts the cost and also typically people    HMOs pay higher rates than original Medicare to the  to the large dialysis providers and so that also impacts the cost So obviously rate is one element  Making sure that there is competition in the marketplace is another in terms of the provision of dialysis care and so we re working with CMS on that both in terms of some of the CONs  state CON requirements around what  what people can build in terms of getting  getting the CON loss  getting  getting through those as well as basic conditions for coverage and what sort of innovative capabilities can we bring to bear in the ESRD space  whether it s around the home  whether it s around micro clinics  various alternative sites of care to provide dialysis But regardless  we re working very hard on it  We re standing up clinical teams  take these members and over the long term  we understand why it makes sense to bring ESRD into this population  We just need to manage the short term transition  So long winded answer to your question  We re taking it from multiple angles  modeling it appropriately  doing appropriate advocacy and then preparing the clinical side and working with our dialysis partners to come up with creative risk sharing mechanisms to help drive outcomes  Hopefully that s helpful Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsAll right  thank you  Next question please OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi  Your line is open Ralph Giacobbe    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  good morning  Just wanted to ask on the individual MA membership  you added almost 230 000 members during AEP  When I look at last year  you had almost 10  of total enrollment in OEP and then you saw further growth in sort of the AGN and D SNP  So I guess when I look at that 270 000 to 330 000 range  seems like you re trending closer to higher end if not even above that  Is that fair or help us with other consideration sort of this year versus last year that may not make that be the case  Thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerWell  obviously we hope you re right  but there s a lot of  lot of game up the play  I would say that we feel good about the 270 000 to 330 000 that we put out there  We finished AEP at around 229 000 for the January    the January lives and I think this year is different than last year and that are on a relative basis  we re not as strong from a benefit design as we were in a relative basis in 2019 and so you have to see what are the sales are going to be and what are the terms going to be  Obviously the sales opportunities are a little bit  a little bit less in the in the post AEP than the pre    than during AEP and you saw the terminations in your book and we have a larger book  And so if you have a similar term rate you actually lose more lives right  And so  so those are the types of things we re working through  We re closely monitoring OEP  it seems to be going well  we ll see where it ultimately shakes out  But I would just say we feel good about the 270 000 to 330 000 that we put out Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is open Frank Morgan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGood morning  I want to go back to the healthcare side of the business  I think you said  I want to confirm you said you had completed the Homecare Homebase conversions  so the    I m assuming that means the drag from that conversion should be completed and then what are sort of your early reads on PDG in the    on the home healthcare side  Are you seeing your rates higher or lower or flat  And then finally just what s the    what kind of financial drag would you be removing from your income statement and balance sheet with moving those assets into this partnership in primary care  Thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerOkay  So on Homecare Homebase  it is completed  It was a herculean effort  I think the team did it faster than any conversion that s happened before  Just the magnitude of an EMR conversion on both the home and hospice side is very significant  The team did an extraordinary job and so we re very excited about that and so that drag is no longer there for 2020  although it was meaningful for 2019 and that s part of the increase in EBITDA that you re seeing in the healthcare services side I think it s still too early to comment on PDGM  I think things are going as we planned and as expected  they were adjusting to the change in the payment model  The impacts of that are reflected in our 2020 numbers but I think the team feels good about mitigating the EBITDA impact of that  The important side for us in particular is the clinical side and we re excited about the movement of the model to much more as I said earlier  to much more of a chronic nursing model and so that s positive  But it does change the operating model when you have a payment model like this that is focused on these chronic conditions and so they re working through that and I think doing a very nice job We haven t called out the specific financial drag on the clinics  Broadly  depending on the size of the clinic to get to profitability  you re talking sort of high single  digits  million EBITDA to get to profitability over a several year period including the capex  so you can  you can multiply through and see some of the impact  I mean  ultimately the size of the facility  the  600 million facility is effectively over a period of P L burn that we re taking off our income statement  That the purpose of the facility is to fund those losses and so I think that gives you the order of magnitude over the life cycle of the investment what the impact is and typically by year four  year five  these things are really starting to breakeven and drive profitability  So I think that gives you a broad sense of the impact  which is why it s so important that we did this so we could scale the opportunity Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Frank and I know your question wasn t inferring this  but I d just like to emphasize it  The main reason why we re doing this with WCAS is to scale the business and that s really what Brian was articulating because we feel it s a great addition to the organization and the organization is ready to scale it  Some other things that Brian was talking about were some barriers to do it  so at the end of the day  we want to scale this and begin to start getting more and more members in our proprietary product Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerI would just add one more point  We get this question all the time  and want to make sure investors have this  There is    in terms of where the EBITDA per clinic can go because we get asked that all the time and it really can vary  so some of the smaller clinics could be  2 million   3 million   4 million  Some of the bigger clinics could be  6 million   7 million   8 million  So it really depends on the size of the clinic in terms of the EBITDA but when you look at the economics  just a return on capital on individual clinic  when these gets to profitability  it s a really good model Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays  Your line is open Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning  Bruce and Brian  So two questions around the first quarter of 2020  First  for the Group and Specialty segment  you re targeting 84  to 84 5  benefit ratio for the full year  but given that the jump off point in 4Q  19 is in the 95  range  I guess I m curious will that gradually trend back down throughout 2020 or will your improvement show up immediately such that 1Q  20 for the segment maybe in line with the full year range  somewhere in that mid 80  range  that s question one And question two  also around 1Q  I mean the stock is at  20 right now  so it s a focus on the slight negative but the    I mean the adjusted tax rate in 4Q  19 I think came somewhere in the mid single digits  probably due to the Group and Specialty segment results  but just given your comment around 1Q  20 earnings being 24  of the full year  should we assume the overall tax rate normalizes back to    call it 30  or so in 1Q  20  Thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerSure  So fair questions  We don t give quarterly MER guidance by segment  as you know  but I think it s fair to say the Group    the way the Group segment works is the MER is low in the first part of the year and then it increases as people get through their deductibles  So I think in terms of the way you think about the sort of quarterly progression of MERs  you can look at historical patterns and see what it is for the Group business and just use our annual number and frac it out accordingly  But just the way the benefit design works  it s lower MER at the beginning and then it ramps up through the year as people go through their deductibles and we start covering the cost On the tax rate side  really two drivers  one is  what s I guess known as the windfall tax  which is we have stock vestings in December  it s where when our stocks    stock annually vest and we had a big run up in our stock  And so the tax deduction is larger and that drives the improved tax rate  As you know  the stock moved a lot in the last few months and has been volatile  but when it occurred  when the vest incurred  we had the windfall benefit  We also saw profitability show up in different states  little somewhere lower tax states than we expected  So small moves in that can impact the tax rate a bit and so that was also driving it  So it s really for those two reasons that we had a lower tax rate Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerBut in general when you look at the tax rate on an annual basis  it remained relatively the same  I mean there is a 50 basis points change  So when you look at an annual side  it s    it had minimum impact on it Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsAll right  thank you  Next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Gary Taylor    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  good morning  Most of my questions answered  I ll just be real quick  When we go to the healthcare services EBITDA growth  I think 17  at the midpoint  I know you ve covered some of the one time investments you re lapping etc  Is it possible to help us think about organic versus acquisition  is it contemplated that any of the trailing acquisitions or any forward acquisitions are in that number or is that a pretty pure organic growth for 2020 Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Gary  There is some acquisition in there from the Enclara deal though I would say it s relatively small  so that would be acquisition  I do think there are some  as you said lapping investments on Homecare Homebase which helps  I would say most is organic improvement but if you re sort of trying to model beyond 2020 I wouldn t expect that kind of EBITDA growth beyond 2020  I think it will more normalize to a lower level  So I think that s a fair question  There are some good guys in there but the business organically is growing very nicely  I mean  really all elements  pharmacy  home and primary care are growing nicely organically  So it s    I would say it s a balanced EBITDA growth but there are some good guys in there for 2020 Gary Taylor    J P  Morgan    AnalystAll right  Okay  thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerYou bet Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS  Your line is open Whit Mayo    UBS    AnalystHey  thanks  Just a quick one on D SNP  the performance has been pretty impressive  Brian  maybe just any color around benefits  design plan strategy anything that s contributed to the recent performance and any expectations for the rest of the year  Is this a one time boost through open enrollment or do you see the momentum continuing throughout the year  Thanks Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerHey  good morning Whit  So we re certainly hopeful that the D SNP growth continues  we ll see where it goes  We are proud of the D SNP growth that we ve achieved  I think on the benefit side  we continue to emphasize some of the over the counter benefits and a few other things  I would say there wasn t anything dramatically different this year  I think it s really a focus of the organization  leveraging some of our distribution channels to make sure we are appealing to the D SNP population  It s also frankly offering D SNPs in more counties as well and so expanding that as well and so it s really a combination of things  But I would just say that it s certainly important  an organizational focus of ours and in driving the distribution and sales of that product Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorNext question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens  Your line is open Scott Fidel    Stephens    AnalystHi  good morning  Just wanted to toggle back over to Group and Specialty and definitely it sounds like you re still committed to the business in terms of the investments that you re making and hoping for brighter days ahead  When we look at the 2020 guide  it still is implying pre tax margin still sub 2  and top line growth sub 2  as well  So if we think that some of these bets that you re making around the investments do ultimately pay off  what type of growth rates do you think in pre tax margins are reasonable to think about being sustainable in the longer term Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s a fair question  Scott  I m really not prepared today to give details on margin and growth  I do think the margins are clearly not nearly where they need to be  We haven t given a margin target on Group and I m not prepared to do that today  but I would tell you that we do expect margins to improve  The ASO level funded margins are much better and we ll continue to get better as we mature in that product  And hopefully  as we move up market will also see some margin improvement as we leverage some of the unit cost benefits we can get by being a bigger presence in the marketplace  And again  we hope we can continue to grow with level funded product but also grow upmarket as well in terms of the top line And so the goal would be to start growing that top line in addition to getting the PMPM benefits that you get in the Group space  So we do think there s an opportunity there  but I wouldn t expect significant growth  I d just    we re hopeful that we can really turn it around and start getting measured growth as we move forward here on both frankly top end and bottom line  And also importantly  just a cross sell benefit that I mentioned on the Specialty side and on the Medicare side  that s an important part of this as well  That won t show up directly in the segment results Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Next question OperatorNext question comes from the line of Michael Newshel from Evercore  Your line is open Michael Newshel    Evercore    AnalystThanks  Maybe just going back to the HIF repeal and I appreciate you re not committing to anything in 2021  but I just wanted to confirm that long term  since you re still targeting that 4 5  to 5  pre tax margin  that s ultimately a higher net margin once HIF is gone  So is it just fair to say that the non deductible headwind will still drop back to margins eventually  but maybe just not all immediately if you favor enrollment growth more instead for a period of time  is that the right way to frame it Brian A  Kane    Chief Financial OfficerI think that s fair  We re committed to 4 5  to 5   Similarly  on the tax reform  we did the same thing  where it went below and then it came back up and so  yes  we re committed to 4 5  to 5  Amy Smith    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  I think that was our last question Bruce D  Broussard    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I ll just close it out  Again  thanks for our investors and especially today considering it lasted for an hour and a half  so

Though Cigna performed well in 2019 and closed the acquisition of Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   which expanded its healthcare offering  the stock seems to have taken a beating from the broader market and sector volatility 
Cigna expects to benefit from its strong business fundamentals  The company s current valuation also seems reasonable 
The stock is trading at a forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 10 99X  which is lower than its 5 year median level of 14 19X 
We believe Cigna s stock with a VGM Score of A is poised for gains in 2020 
Factors to Drive Growth in 2020
Business Streamlining  This month  Cigna announced to sell its Group Life and Disability insurance business for  6 3 billion  which is expected to fetch  5 3 billion  This move is in line with the company s efforts to reduce its debt level  Part of the fund will also be used for share repurchases 
This deal also gives a positive signal to investors regarding the company s commitment to work on deleveraging its balance sheet  Also  Cigna s priority is to focus on its core business related to healthcare  which expanded further after the purchase of Express Scripts  The company desires to strengthen its Medicare business  which presents a huge business opportunity on the back of its ever increasing demand from the baby boomer population 
Acquisition of Express Scripts  Cigna acquired the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts holding for  67 billion  including  15 billion in debt  The merged company is now a one stop shop for customers  healthcare needs  ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover 
It would benefit consumers by bringing together medical care and pharmacy benefits under one roof to improve treatment and lower costs  The combined company has improved its ranking in the health insurance industry  strengthening its competitive position 
Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from  18 to  20  21 in 2021  The merged company will generate free cash flow of at least  6 billion in 2021 
International Operations Provide Diversification  In the first quarter of 2019  Cigna acquired OnePath Life Insurance from ANZ Bank in New Zealand  This acquisition will enable Cigna to delve deeper into an existing geography  with an expanded set of solutions and capabilities to create more value for its customers and exemplify its continued focus on effective capital deployment to drive long term growth 
This will also expand its international operations  which have been boosting revenues over the years  Also  the company s broadening international business provides proliferation and shields against stiff regulations governing its businesses in the United States

141232,362747,HUM,Will Humana  HUM  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Humana  HUM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry 
This health insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 12 64  
For the last reported quarter  Humana came out with earnings of  5 03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 58 per share  representing a surprise of 9 83   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  5 24 per share and it actually produced earnings of  6 05 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 46  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Humana  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Humana has an Earnings ESP of  0 66  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 5  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-humana-hum-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200497371,200497371

141261,362776,HUM,New frontier in health fraud  Genetic tests of the elderly,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch
LAWRENCEVILLE  Ga   Reuters    The genetic screening sales reps turn out at health fairs  houses of religion  parks and elder enclaves  offering seniors a chance to learn if they or their loved ones are at risk of developing cancer  All they need  the reps say  is a free cheek swab 
In truth  U S  federal investigators say  some of the sales representatives are part of a burgeoning industry that threatens to become what multiple government investigators call the next big frontier in healthcare fraud  genetic testing  which is reaping millions of dollars from unnecessary tests that target senior citizens 
Shimon Richmond  assistant inspector general for investigations with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services  said his office has seen a steady stream of complaints into genetic testing  In 2018  the inspector general s office received about one or two complaints per week  Now  he said  the fraud hotline burns with as many as 50 calls weekly 
 We have investigations going on in this space across the country  It is not limited to one geographic region   Richmond said in an interview   This is touching every corner  
In all  more than 300 federal investigations  conducted by multiple law enforcement agencies  are examining genetic testing fraud schemes  said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiries are not yet public  The investigative crush was sparked in part by unusual Medicare billing data patterns that started to emerge in 2015 
In the United States  genetic testing has skyrocketed  For Medicare  the public insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans  payouts for genetic tests jumped from  480 million in 2015 to  1 1 billion in 2018  a Reuters analysis found  Those figures do not include invoices for spending by state Medicaid programs  which serve the poor  or supplemental Medicare insurance programs offered by private insurers 
The investigations are examining billings submitted to federal health insurance programs  By law  all diagnostic lab tests must be ordered by a doctor treating a patient for a specific condition 
In the cases under review  investigators and patients told Reuters  marketers get elderly residents to turn over their Medicare or Medicaid information  along with their driver s license and other identifying information  and tell them they will take a free cheek swab that can help them understand their risks of developing cancer or whether their genetics could unlock clues about how they will respond to drug treatments  They then get a doctor to sign off and approve the test and ship the swab off to a lab  which seeks Medicare payouts 
But many of the lab tests are not relevant to the patient s history  and some of the doctors sign off on the results without conferring with the patient  said investigators familiar with the operations and patients interviewed by Reuters  Suspect companies pocket thousands  with a cut going to doctors  but the seniors get little  if any  benefit  investigators say 
Brian Benczkowski  the assistant attorney general for the U S  Department of Justice s Criminal Division  estimated that fraudulent billings submitted over the last few years are expected to total  north of  1 billion   He called genetic testing of the elderly  the next big frontier in federal healthcare fraud enforcement  
 There is a huge pot of money that entrepreneurial criminals are trying to figure out how to access   Benczkowsi told Reuters 
Investigators say genetic testing became a ready target thanks to advances in medical technology and a rise in the technique s popularity  Companies such as 23 Me  which offers health and ancestry genetic tests directly to consumers for  199  have entered the mainstream  Their success  federal investigators say  has drawn the attention of scamsters looking to capitalize on the trend 
Rebecca Kinney  the acting director for the Office of Healthcare Information and Counseling  part of HHS  said seniors should be on the lookout for red flags and any genetic tests should be ordered by their own doctors   The thing that we really try to tell people to pay attention to in any kind of marketing scheme or fraud scheme are the phrases  Free to you  or  Free if you have Medicare     she said 
TARGETING SENIOR CITIZENS
In Delray Beach  Florida  Janet Putrah participated in a cheek swabbing event hosted by her condo building s social committee in February 2018 
She said none of the tests  which were sent to a lab called Clio Laboratories  made any sense to her  She was stunned to learn the lab billed her Medicare Part B insurance plan more than  30 000 and was paid more than  12 000 
The test results  were useless   she wrote in a complaint to the condo board   There were pages and pages with information about drugs  It listed 12 drugs that I may have an  unfavorable  response to  I don t take any of the drugs listed  
Putrah said she only participated because her grandmother had died of colon cancer and she was told the test would be paid for by Medicare  In July 2018  she contacted Medicare to raise concerns about her billing statement  and then in December 2018 she called the inspector general s fraud hotline and forwarded supporting documents 
 It s my money you re taking from me in taxes   she said   This is just insane  
Jean Stone  a Medicare fraud specialist who worked for the federal Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services and now often testifies as an expert witness  said the test results Putrah received appear  useless  
 They paid  12 000 they shouldn t have paid   Stone said of Medicare  calling the test  wasted taxpayer dollars  
 Who gets the test results   she asked   They don t even know who the woman s doctor is  
Another condo resident  Arlene Pallack  said her Humana  NYSE HUM  Medicare Advantage plan in 2018 paid for  2 225 17 of the  4 625 42 Clio charged for her cheek swab  Humana is concerned about the  growing health care issue  of testing fraud  a spokeswoman said  and targets misuse 
Until she was interviewed by Reuters this August  Pallack had never received the results  She only got them after calling the lab to inquire 
A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it uses an  aggressive  approach to address fraud prevention 
Janet Shaver  the current treasurer of the condo board where Putrah and Pallack participated in the cheek swabbing event  said the board s leadership has since changed  but that she intends to follow up  to make as many people as possible aware of this  
Victoria Nemerson  Clio s general counsel  said in a statement that the company s testing is proper and that it has  extensive experience providing important testing and laboratory services for physicians and patients   She added   We commit substantial time and resources to meeting our legal duties  
Other companies are also riding the genetic testing wave 
In California  Jean Reeves  Lura Tamm and Patti Falkenberg said they had their cheeks swabbed at a free event in February 2019 by a pleasant woman named Ronda Butman  a sales representative who later told Reuters she worked on contract with two different marketing companies  One of those businesses was called MyDNACancerTesting  the other marketing company went by MedMolecular 
The women said Butman told them the genetic test could help predict if they were at risk of developing cancer and tell them how their genetics could impact the way their bodies metabolize their medications   a scientific field known as  pharmacogenetics  
All three recall being told the cancer and pharmacogenetic screenings would only cost Medicare a few thousand dollars  All they needed to provide  they said they were told  was a swab of their DNA  their Medicare card number  and other sensitive information  which they shared 
But Medicare explanation of benefits statements  reviewed by Reuters  revealed that a lab in Arlington  Texas  called Spectrum Diagnostic Labs LLC had in two cases tried to charge Medicare more than  15 000 per patient  and received around  5 000 
 I m worried about my Medicare information and my Social Security out there  I thought  My gosh  they ve got all of this information     Falkenberg said 
The tests were approved  records show  by a physician the women say they never met  Dr  Cornelius J  O Leary  Before taking part in genetic testing  public records show  he had filed for bankruptcy in 2012  had been convicted of misdemeanor battery in 2015  and in two lawsuits in 2012 and 2014 had alleged law enforcement officials were harassing him and using counter terrorism units to sleep deprive him 
O Leary could not be reached for comment  He did not respond to emails or calls seeking an interview at multiple numbers listed for him  A relative declined to help Reuters get in touch with him 
Butman  the sales rep  said she later quit her job at MyDNACancerTesting  MedMolecular  the other company  later shut down its genetic testing business 
Butman has since gone back to those from whom she collected cheek swabs to warn them the billings for the tests might be improper  She said she has filed complaints with several state attorneys general against MyDNACancerTesting and some of the labs she fears were overbilling 
 I feel like a victim   said Butman  who said she got involved to help those at risk of cancer 
Jerry Pfeister  the founder of MyDNACancerTesting  told Reuters he contracted with a different company which dealt with the labs  but his company did not interact with labs or doctors  He said MyDNACancerTesting severed ties and stopped collecting cheek swabs for the company that dealt with the labs in April   We never had any interactions with any doctors or labs   Pfeister said 
Monique Deckter  formerly vice president of operations at the other company  MedMolecular  said her small marketing firm contracted with a larger distributor that helped facilitate the tests  which were later shipped to Spectrum Diagnostic  She said she closed MedMolecular in April 2019 amid concerns the telemedicine company she was told to use was not strictly following Medicare rules 
Justo M ndez  an attorney for Spectrum Diagnostic Labs  said every sample it receives comes with a medical order signed by a doctor and a patient consent form   Spectrum has processes in place to ensure compliance with the required documentation needed from the referring physician   he said 
The amounts billed are handled by a third party  he said  and the company has no financial relationships with doctors 
Perry Holloway  a company principal  said he was unaware of any problems  His attorney Samy Khalil said his client  did not know of or intentionally participate in any fraud  
In a common trend nationwide  sales reps were enticed by some marketing firms through ads on recruitment websites  with the promise they could earn from anywhere from  200 to more than  1 000 for every swab collected and sent to the lab  said investigators and several sales reps interviewed by Reuters 
In some cases  investigators warn  such payments could be construed as a kickback  Anti kickback laws prohibit medical referrals in exchange for a reward or anything of value in connection with federal healthcare programs  In 2018  Congress doubled the maximum prison term in such cases to 10 years per offense 
TANGLED TESTING WEB
A little explored world surrounds the marketing companies  laboratories and telemedicine companies involved in elder genetic testing  Among them is Spectrum  Another is Clio Laboratories  the Georgia based lab that is part of an interconnected network of labs  medical billing operations  a telemedicine firm and other healthcare related limited liability companies  company records show 
Several patients said they filed complaints with state or federal agencies against Clio and Spectrum  either by phone or through written complaints seen by Reuters 
In a handful of cases  the patients who had DNA samples sent to Clio or Spectrum said they never spoke with a doctor about why the cancer or pharmacogenetic tests were medically necessary  Moreover  when test results were completed  they were mailed directly to patients  homes  That is not the norm  say doctors and medical experts  Usually  the ordering physician receives results first  then reviews them with the patient 
Nemerson  the Clio lawyer  declined to comment on these specifics  citing her statement to Reuters that the company diligently follows testing rules 
Spectrum s lawyer said the company has not been contacted by the government concerning any patient complaints 
In 2017  the most recent data available  Clio billed Medicare  8 6 million for genetic testing and was paid about  4 6 million 
Clio Laboratories and a cluster of companies   including Elite Medical Laboratories  360 Laboratories and billing company Laboratory Experts   are connected to Jordan Satary  an entrepreneur in his mid twenties whose father once ran a lab that went bust  records show 
His father  Khalid Ahmed Satary  had earlier founded and led Confirmatrix  a Georgia toxicology lab  Satary started that company after his April 2008 release from federal prison  he had pleaded guilty to charges filed in 2003 involving fraud  trafficking in counterfeit products and copyright infringement related to a compact disc company he operated 
Confirmatrix was raided by federal investigators in 2016  media reports say  as part of a probe into a kickback scheme involving opioid pain clinic owners who were routing urine drug tests to toxicology labs  The lab was accused  but not charged  with being part of the scheme in a 2017 indictment filed in Tennessee  The investigation is ongoing 
Confirmatrix filed for bankruptcy November 4  2016  Some of the former employees of the defunct company now work for multiple other labs with ties to the Satary family 
Elite Medical Laboratories  for instance  lists its lab director as Stanley Wu  the former Confirmatrix lab director  Wu hung up on Reuters when it sought his comment and did not respond to an email seeking comment 
Reuters journalists stopped by Elite s office last month  From outside the offices through large front windows  they saw UPS and FedEx  NYSE FDX  boxes stacked inside  with cheek swabs and other DNA samples spilling out  Two men stood at a table sorting them 
Elite has  a long history of providing valuable services  and is  committed to upholding  its legal obligations  Nemerson said in a statement 
Khalid Satary did not respond to text messages or emails seeking comment  An attorney who previously represented Satary told Reuters he could not comment 
Son Jordan is listed in an April 2019 document as the CEO and CFO of a medical billing operation  GNOS Medical  which is located in the same business plaza with Elite and Clio  It has since changed its name to Laboratory Experts  public records show 
Jordan Satary lists Laboratory Experts as belonging to him on his own corporate website  He was separately listed in 2018 as a registered agent for Clio s Florida based location  which later merged with the Georgia office  The contact information on the website for Elite Medical Labs contained an email address as recently as August for his media company  Shufe Media  The reference was later removed  after Reuters inquiries 
Jordan Satary could not be reached for comment  When a reporter stopped by Clio Laboratories in August  the office said he was out of town and referred Reuters to Nemerson  the company s general counsel  He did not respond to subsequent emails listed for his various companies  or to a text message 
DISCIPLINED DOCTORS
Some of the doctors involved in the genetic testing wave also have checkered pasts 
One California doctor was signing off on genetic tests for patients even as two states had disciplined him or were preparing to do so after he was criminally convicted in Los Angeles 
Orthopedic surgeon Dr  Mitchell G  Cohen pleaded guilty in November 2015 to filing a false tax return in connection with an illegal kickback scheme  cooperated with the government s investigation  and later served more than eight months in a halfway house in central California through March 2019  court records show  Cohen was not charged with making an illegal kickback  but pleaded guilty to making a false tax return in a case federal authorities said involved kickbacks 
New York and California each took disciplinary action based on the conviction  with both placing him on probation in June 2018 and June 2019  respectively 
Cohen was approving genetic tests for Medicare patients during his stint in the halfway house and after his probation period ended  He approved the medical necessity of genetic tests handled by labs including BioConfirm in Georgia and Elite Medical Laboratories  lab records show 
He signed off on the genetic test for Elite in September 2018  as he was serving his sentence in the halfway house  records show  He approved the medical necessity of tests sent to Bioconfirm on May 10  2019 
Scott Grubman  an attorney for BioConfirm  said his client  relies in good faith on the information submitted to it by the ordering provider   complies with its legal obligations and is not aware of any issues related to Dr  Cohen 
Contacted by Reuters  Cohen said he was in surgery and hung up  Mark Werksman  his attorney  said Cohen stopped working for several telemedicine companies authorizing genetic tests for Medicare patients on May 20  2019  after the government suspended his Medicare billing privileges  an action that typically occurs after a doctor is convicted 




Under the probation terms  he said Cohen was allowed to work during the day while spending nights in the halfway house  He said Cohen consulted with patients before the tests and followed up to discuss the results 
 He believes he was providing a medically necessary and important service to his patients   Werksman said ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/special-report-new-frontier-in-health-fraud--genetic-tests-of-the-elderly-1986202,1986202
141262,362777,HUM,HMO Industry Outlook  Multiple Levers To Drive Growth,opinion,"The Health Maintenance Organization  HMO  industry comprises entities  either private or public  that take care of the basic and supplemental health services of its subscribers  Companies in this space primarily assume the risks involved and assign premiums for health and medical insurance policies  Industry participants also provide administrative and managed care services for self funded insurance Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers  called in network   which include primary care physicians  clinical facilities  hospitals and specialists  However  out of network exceptions are made in emergencies or when medically necessary  Health insurance plans can be availed by ways such as private purchase  social insurance or social welfare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid  funded by the government Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes      As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the total population  overall demand for health insurance for seniors will increase  According to the 2018 U S  Census  between 2010 and 2030  the number of individuals aged 65  is projected to nearly double from 39 million to 73 million  a growth rate nearly 5 times faster than the 17  increase expected for the total population  The census estimates this group to grow from 13  to 21  by 2030   one of the fastest growing within U S  population  This senior population has fueled demand for Medicare Advantage  MA   the private version of the government Medicare program  Medicare Advantage continues to be a popular choice  serving 35  of individuals eligible for Medicare  up from 25  since 2010  These plans have also led to considerable revenue growth for the likes of UnitedHealth Group Inc   NYSE UNH   Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  and Anthem Inc   NYSE ANTM  among other health insurers  The overall Medicare market is forecast to expand from  860 billion annually in 2020 to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2025  According to UnitedHealth  the market for Medicare Advantage could expand from roughly 35  of all seniors today to more than 50  by 2027      The HMO industry is rapidly consolidating with mergers and acquisitions  The most common takeovers in recent years have been in the nature of horizontal expansion in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid as the players seek to garner a greater share of the attractive MA market  Lately  however  the companies have shown interest in expanding vertically and add capabilities to its supply chain through mergers and acquisitions  The mega mergers of Aetna  NYSE AET  with CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS    CVS  and Cigna Corp   CI  with Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  are the best examples of inter industry deals that led to the union of a health insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager An increase in scale and size will place strong players to serve the health insurance market which is still underserved  According to UnitedHealth  with an estimated 85 million people representing approximately  900 billion in annual health care spending still not served in managed care inthe United States alone  players are well positioned for continued growth      The industry has also witnessed development in ancillary business to diversify revenue sources in the wake of tough regulations laid  via the ACA  on health insurance business  These businesses  mostly in the form of health care services  are growing rapidly  opening up avenues of growth and forming an increased proportion of the industry s total revenues  Health services business is an important growth area for HMOs as these provide unregulated cash flows and enable players to become comprehensive healthcare providers  Ample opportunities of growth exist in the health service business and continued investments are being made in this area  A poster child for the same is UnitedHealth s Optum  which provides a range of healthcare related services  including pharmacy benefit management  physician services  data analytics and more Zacks Industry Rank

141276,362791,HUM,Supreme Court to hear insurers  bid for  12 billion in Obamacare money,news,"By Nate Raymond  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether insurers can seek  12 billion from the federal government under a program set up by the Obamacare law aimed at encouraging them to offer medical coverage to previously uninsured Americans  The justices will hear an appeal by a group of insurers of a lower court s ruling that Congress had suspended the government s obligation to make such payments  The insurers have said that ruling  if allowed to stand  would let the government pull a  bait and switch  and withhold money the companies were promised  Moda Inc unit Moda Health Plan Inc and other insurers that sued to try to compel the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to make the payments have said the government was supposed to help them recover from early losses they suffered after the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act under Democratic former President Barack Obama  The law  dubbed Obamacare  has enabled millions of Americans who previously had not medical coverage to obtain insurance  Other insurers involved in the case include Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina  Maine Community Health Options and Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company  If the Supreme Court sides with the insurers  it could result in a significant one time cash infusion for major companies such as  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   Anthem  NYSE ANTM  Inc and  Centene   NYSE CNC  Corp  according to a note by Evercore ISI  The insurers had previously written off the value of the payments  Payments would have come through the law s so called risk corridor program that was designed to mitigate insurers  risks from 2014 to 2016 when they sold coverage to previously uninsured people who bought insurance on exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act  Robert Gootee  chief executive of Moda Inc  said he was encouraged that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case   We remain confident that the court will ultimately hold the government to its promise to pay those companies  including Moda  who answered the government s call to provide access to affordable health care for the neediest of Americans   Gootee said in a statement  HHS declined to comment  Under the risk corridor program  insurers that paid out significantly less in claims on policies sold through the exchanges than they took in from premiums provided some of their gains to the government  Insurers that paid out more were entitled to government compensation for part of their losses  Republicans  who have opposed Obamacare from the outset and sought numerous times to repeal it in Congress  have called the risk corridor program a  bailout  for the insurance industry  In December 2014  Congress passed an appropriations bill for the 2015 fiscal year that included a rider barring HHS from using general funds to pay the government s risk corridor obligations  As a result  the government could compensate insurers only with the money it collected from insurance companies that paid less than they took in from premiums  Congress enacted identical riders for fiscal years 2016 and 2017  Payments from insurers  though  could not fund all of the claimed risk corridor payments  In November 2017  HHS published statistics indicating that payments from insurers for the three year period fell short of claimed payments by  12 billion  The U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2 1 last year that Congress  in passing the appropriations riders  implicitly repealed its statutory obligation to pay the insurers  The insurers appealed  arguing that Supreme Court precedents require much more explicit legislative language to eliminate a previously adopted payment obligation

141280,362795,HUM,Week Ahead  Volatility To Rise After Robust Risk Rally But No Trade Accord,opinion,"Friday s record equity index trifecta resulted from U S  trade rhetoric  but conflicting weekend reports could pressure stocks lower
VIX near lowest levels since 2018
The dollar dropped on Friday along with safe havens but nervous investors could jump back in on Monday
It s unclear how much more risk investors will be willing to take on  after Friday s astounding trifecta of all time highs  The Dow  S P 500 and NASDAQ all finished the week at new records  with each benchmark closing at the very highest point of the session 
However  with any sort of trade resolution still unclear notwithstanding reports out of China on Saturday that  constructive talks  via a high level call had occurred with the U S  market volatility will likely intensify  Though reports on Friday cited a top White House official saying a signature was forthcoming  news over the weekend wasn t as encouraging 

Even with  constructive talks  being signaled by the Asian nation  both sides haven t been able to actually get past significant roadblocks  with some officials even indicating they re  not on the same page   Though the latest news provides a more optimistic tone  with numerous reversals in the ongoing trade resolution narrative having already occurred  how much longer will investors buy the encouraging news  which never actually leads to a significant conclusion  While the path to a trade deal has been a windy one  it has  nevertheless been the key market driver for risk during the past month 
Equities Jump  Safe Havens Slump
U S  equities bounced higher to close the trading week  vaulting into uncharted territory  The dollar fell  along with safe havens Treasurys  gold and the yen 
Global economic data remains mixed  with softer October retail sales and industrial production in China  but firmer than expected eurozone GDP  The global slump in manufacturing appears to be improving  the global manufacturing PMI has moved higher for three straight months  albeit from low levels  We believe underlying fundamentals could support further gains in stocks  but we don t expect the recent low volatility to persist indefinitely 

The VIX has reached its lowest point since Apr  12  which tends to make contrarian investors nervous 
The S P 500 rose 0 77  on Friday  with Health Care doing most of the lifting    2 13    after President Donald Trump talked about a new transparency in healthcare plan he d like to implement  forcing hospitals to reveal discounts they receive from insurers  Shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Humana  NYSE HUM   Anthem  NYSE ANTM  and Cigna  NYSE CI  initially enjoyed a boost but closed off session highs  as the plan is expected to be challenged in Congress  For the day  trade sensitive Materials was the only sector that slipped into the red    0 08   
On a weekly basis  the SPX climbed 0 89   with Healthcare once again in the lead    2 45    Energy underperformed    1 01    even as oil advanced on trade hopes  Financials were also in negative territory    0 3   
The benchmark index advanced for the sixth straight week its longest streak in two years  It hit another all time high alongside the NASDAQ    0 73   and the Dow Jones Industrial Average   0 8    which moved past 28 000 for the first time  The market hat trick was also a stunning a show of force  as no one dared take the opposite side of the trade 
Only the small cap Russell 2000 closed off its highs  though it too finished the week higher   0 47    as well  the index has hit no new record since August 

Technically  the small cap index may be forming a bullish pennant or falling flag  

Yields on the U S  10 year Treasury note advanced on Friday  even as they struggled at the crossroads of a rising channel since the September bottom and the long term downtrend line since November 2018  For the week  yields trimmed half of the previous week s gains 

The USD fell for a second day  on Friday  slipping for the week as well  Technically  it found support at the neckline of a small double bottom 

The yen slumped both on Friday and for the week  as it found resistance by the highs since August  nearing the downtrend line since the October 2018 high 
Gold fell for the first time in four sessions  on the way back from a falling channel bottom  edging higher for the week 
Crude jumped on Friday  ending the week higher for the second day in a row  after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow s comments late on Thursday that a partial trade agreement with China was close to being signed overshadowed supply concerns raised by the International Energy Agency on Friday

141298,362813,HUM,StockBeat   UnitedHealth Tumbles After CEO Sounds Alarm on Medicare for All,news,"Investing com   UnitedHealth fell Tuesday  giving up early post earnings gains as political concerns overshadowed solid results 
Among Democratic presidential hopefuls   healthcare for all  has proved a popular narrative  Proponents of a universal Medicare plan  where people could be guaranteed coverage without using private insurance  argue that a government led measure would iron out the administrative creases currently bedeviling the U S  health care system  But UnitedHealth Group CEO David Wichmann warned that a Medicare for All system would destabilize the health care system and ultimately fail to expand access to care 
The measures proposed by Democrats would  surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors  destabilize the nation s health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best   Wichmann said   And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs    all without fundamentally increasing access to care  
Wichmann s remarks served as a reminder that health care will likely continue to remain a focal point and stocks will be vulnerable to negative headline risk as the 2020 presidential race heats up  In recent weeks  the sector has been pressured as lawmakers considered plans to curb drug prices 
UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  fell 5 6  even as the company delivered above consensus earnings and raised its 2019 earnings per share guidance to  14 50 to  14 75 from  14 40 to  14 70  The earnings beat and raise led to some bullish calls from analysts on Wall Street 
But UnitedHealth s shares hit a 52 week low after the Wichmann comments and subtracted more than 80 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average  The shares are off more than 12  this year 
 We think UNH s strong growth in Q1 demonstrates its value to stakeholders across the health care system  and reinforces our view that any future reforms will still allow UNH to continue making its customers happy   CFRA said in a note

141305,362820,HUM,Humana  HUM  Reports Next Week  What To Expect,opinion,"Humana  HUM  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  16 15 billion  up 13 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Humana 
For Humana  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Humana will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Humana would post earnings of  5 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  6 05  delivering a surprise of  15 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

141311,362826,HUM,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Day Part 2  The Overanalyzing
Expect plenty of Monday  Thursday  morning quarterbacking following today s Federal Reserve rate hike 
At its face it appears that the market got what it expected  another boost of 25 basis points  and what it wanted  signs from the dot plot the Fed won t be as aggressive next year  
But  as often happens  the market decided what it wants isn t what it wanted in the first place  Investors were apparently hoping for much more dovish projections for 2019 and more dovish comments from Fed chief Jay Powell at his Q A 
The Dow swung from up 300 points shortly before the decision to close down about 350 
Traders will be looking closely at the Treasury yield curve tomorrow for more signs of flattening  with many saying that the Fed s decision to keep its policy of quantitative tightening  QT  by  50 billion per month on autopilot spooked equity investors 
The spread between the 10 Year and 2 Year yields was 11 basis points at the time of writing 
And for those burned out on the Fed  hey  the chances it keeps rates steady next month are currently 100  



2  Philly Fed and Jobless Claims Arrive
While the Fed is  somewhat  in the rearview mirror  the economic numbers keep rolling in 
At 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT   there will be the figures on weekly jobless claims 
Economists expect that claims for first time unemployment benefits rose to 219 000 last week 
At the same time the Philadelphia Fed will release its measure of December manufacturing activity  with economists forecasting the Philly Fed index to climb to 15 6 
3  Walgreen s Set to Report
Dow component Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  reports earnings before the bell tomorrow 
On average  analysts expect the drugstore chain to report a profit of  1 43 per share on sales of about  33 8 billion 
Shares looked to be on a roll in late November when there was speculation of a deal with Humana  NYSE HUM  that sparked a rally  but the stock joined the rest of the market in the recent selloff and is little changed in the last three months and the year 
Investors will be looking for details on its partnerships with companies like Kroger  NYSE KR  and  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   according to Briefing com ",2018-12-19,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1726833,1726833
141313,362828,HUM,Humana  HUM  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Humana  HUM  came out with quarterly earnings of  5 03 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 58 per share  This compares to earnings of  4 58 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 83   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  5 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  6 05  delivering a surprise of 15 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Humana  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  16 24 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 55   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 21 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Humana shares have added about 2 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for Humana 
While Humana has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Humana was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 51 on  16 13 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  17 67 on  64 62 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   HMOs is currently in the top 21  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/humana-hum-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-200482817,200482817

strategies to see what the future of the pharmacy might look like   Inside  we saw a makeup counter  shelves of over the counter medication and toiletries  and medical services like an eyeglasses store   One big goal is to create new reasons for customers to shop in stores  as more and more shopping moves online to competitors like    We re in transformation mode   Richard Ashworth  Walgreens  president of operations  told Business Insider   On the edge of a suburban lot in the Chicago area  next to a Whole Foods and across the way from a Barnes   Noble  NYSE BKS   sits a Walgreens   At first glance  it seems like any other drugstore  But upon closer look there are some differences  For one  there s a large beauty section right at the front of the store  For another  candy and other tempting snacks have been relegated to the back  along with seasonal decorations  There s more over the counter medications  supplements  and toiletries in the first few aisles  too   Another big change  the store offers lots of health services  such as hearing screenings    and    is using this store   not more than half a mile from its corporate headquarters   as its pilot for what future pharmacies might look like around the US  In a world where more and more shopping happens online  Walgreens is  what it ll take to get you to visit one of its 9 560 US stores   We re in transformation mode   Richard Ashworth  Walgreens  president of operations told Business Insider   Ashworth is doing all this to keep up with customer behavior  which has been changing much faster than it has in past decades  From 2010 2018  he said   Everything has changed    Ashworth says customers want to be able to shop more quickly and conveniently  And they re making lots of their purchases online  and having them delivered  Walgreens is up against stiff competition for customers  facing off against the  which is getting into the pharmacy business through its     which is making a big bet on the healthcare aspect of its business through the pending acquisition of insurer Aetna  NYSE AET   and of course retail giant   For its part  Walgreens might be looking to strike up a closer relationship with a health insurer as well  On Tuesday   that Walgreens and Humana  NYSE HUM  were considering taking equity stakes in one another  Walgreens is already partnering with Humana to run primary care clinics out of some of its stores in the     The pharmacy business model is under more direct attack from disruptive players than are health plans   Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut noted Wednesday  A stronger partnership with Humana  he said  could help Walgreens with its market share  while Humana could benefit from better branding and marketing that comes from being seen inside the retail pharmacy   Read more   The pharmacy giant is hanging on   the stock of its parent company is up  But same store sales of things like snacks  toothbrushes and laundry detergent were down 1 9  in the company s fiscal fourth quarter  Prescription drug sales did better  up 1 3   As competition heats up  Ashworth has faith that going to an actual store will still be a part of that picture    I think customers very much will enjoy brick and mortar retailing if we make it modern and experiential   Ashworth said   How Walgreens is trying to improve your experience in the store On the left side of the store as I walked in  I was greeted by a make up display presenting kits filled with bath bombs  brushes  and lip balm  There s a designated beauty consultant who staffs the section  Across they US  Walgreens has hired 3 500 beauty consultants  Ashworth said   On the right side  next to a FedEx  NYSE FDX  counter  was an optical store  There  I could browse for eyeglasses or pop into an eye exam room  The optometrist had previously worked at the  in Niles  Illinois  That Sears is among the locations  it would close    There was a place to get lab results as well  In October  Walgreens made an agreement with lab testing giant    All of the health services   including lab services  the pharmacy  and optical   are nestled under what Walgreens calls its health corner alongside a hearing station  Within the hearing station is a room built to test how well people can hear  which could dictate whether they might need a hearing aid   The pharmacy counter is in the back right corner  which looked standard apart from the express lane  Through the Walgreens app  you re able to check out remotely and then scan the QR code for a quicker check out process  Here s a closer look at the counter  As for whether it ll all look like the storefront in Deerfield  Illinois   Jury s not out on that   Ashworth said  What works for one community might not work for another

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Strong Operating Performance

The operating cost ratio of 14 8  improved 20 basis points year over year due to the deferral of the health insurance tax and continued effect of operating cost productivity improvements 
Strong Performance Across Segments
In the reported quarter  the company s health benefits segment  UnitedHealthcare  generated revenues of  48 1 billion  up 4 7  year over year  Revenue growth was driven by higher enrollment and increase in pricing

Our Take    
UnitedHealth s vast and diversified business operations  spanning from health benefit to health services  and a number of accretive acquisitions that have driven its performance over the years  will be the growth catalysts this year too 
Moreover  a solid balance sheet will enable acquisitions that should drive inorganic growth  Good command on controlling medical cost should aid its margins

141366,362881,HUM,3 Health Insurance Stocks Poised To Beat On Earnings In Q3,opinion,The health insurance industry delivered a stellar operating performance in the first six months of 2019 with most players reporting higher top and the bottom line numbers from the year ago quarter as well as beating estimates on both counts An increase in membership and premiums was the main catalyst for top line growth  leading to gains in the first two quarters of 2019  Medical cost management  better claims handling and cost saving initiatives among others contributed to the bottom line Leading players including the likes of Humana  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Cigna and Anthem also upped their respective earnings guidance for 2019  This reflects the companies  continued optimism on the operating environment Nevertheless  year to date  the health insurance  has declined 9 7  against the Zacks S P 500 composite s rise of 17 7   The industry s decrease was due to investors  supposed concern for various political uncertainties Factors to Influence Third Quarter EarningsProgress in Government Business  Medicare Advantage  MA  and Medicaid  Although MA remains one of the most attractive markets  it is underpenetrated and provides enough scope for expansion  These insurance plans are in huge demand from the baby boomers  which are rising by the day  Most health insurance giants  namely United Health  Humana  Aetna  NYSE AET  Anthem and Well Care Health have witnessed a secular uptrend in their MA business and the trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter Per The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS   Medicaid expenditures will exceed  540 billion by 2025 of which nearly 60  is expected to be serviced by managed care as state Medicaid programs increasingly turn to health insurers to take responsibility for the care of their most complex and chronically ill beneficiaries This shift toward managed Medicaid presents a growth opportunity for the industry players  Medical enrollment historically  from 2013 to 2018  has augmented for UnitedHealth  Centene  NYSE CNC   Anthem  WellCare Health Plans and is likely to shoot up further Gains From Pharmacy Benefit Management Business  The healthcare sector witnessed a transition in recent years with a string of mergers between entities from the two major industries  such as Pharmacy Benefit Managers  PBM  and Health insurers The integration of PBMs and Payors started with UnitedHealth building its own PBM business  Optum Rx  and other insurers following suit Last year  Cigna acquired the PBM major Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   Also  Aetna was bought by another PBM major CVS while Anthem is developing its own PBM platform called IngenioRx  Further  Humana functions through its own in house PBM Humana Pharmacy Solutions In the second quarter  revenues from the respective PBM businesses under UnitedHealth  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and Humana ascended 11 7   4 2  and 7   respectively  Players expect a spurt in adjusted scripts  which should aid revenues from this line of business   Share Buybacks  Given the surplus capital resource available at their disposal  major health insurers have been actively repurchasing their shares  Except Cigna and CVS  other players inclusive of UnitedHealth  Anthem and Humana bought back shares  only to bump up the bottom line in turn  Given the fact that the share repurchase authorizations of most companies are still pending  we expect more buybacks in the ensuing quarters   We are thus upbeat about an overall positive performance from the sector in absence of any significant headwind Stocks to Bet on for Q3 Earnings BeatBelow we pick up three stocks that are likely to deliver a third quarter positive earnings

141367,362882,HUM,S P  Dow Still Positive For September,opinion,"SPECIAL NOTE  We ve just released this quarter s Ultimate Four report which includes four stocks our team believes have the greatest upside potential over the upcoming quarter  This latest report features favorite stocks from Brian Bolan  Ben Rains  Dan Laboe and Tracey Ryniec  Log on to Zacks com to see these stocks today The major indices just finished a second straight week of losses  as the latest trade headline had investors nervous about next month s U S    China meetings 
	A strong Friday session could have gotten stocks onto the plus side for the week  The announcement that high level talks would resume in two weeks was hoped to provide that extra boost into the green 
	But that s not what happened 
	Instead  we got reports that the White House is thinking about limiting U S  investment in China  perhaps even delisting Chinese companies from U S  exchanges 
	This consideration is in the very early stages and may never come to fruition  but this skittish market doesn t need much to selloff these days 
	The NASDAQ took the brunt of this news and plunged 1 13   or about 91 points  to 7939 63  The S P was down 0 53  to 2961 79 and the Dow slipped 0 26   or nearly 71 points  to 26 820 25 
	All of the indices started the session in the green before dipping lower  However  they all came off their lows as well 
	The most important thing for the market in the short term is to get to those meetings next month  As long as they re still happening  then these day to day headline driven moves are just noise 
	Earnings season is also coming up in the next few weeks  Investors will be watching to see what kind of an impact the trade conflict and global economic weakness is having on companies

141372,362887,HUM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  UnitedHealth  Cigna  Anthem And Humana,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 30  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Cigna Corp    NYSE CI    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  3 Health Insurance Stocks Poised to Beat Q3 EarningsThe health insurance industry delivered a stellar operating performance in the first six months of 2019 with most players reporting higher top and the bottom line numbers from the year ago quarter as well as beating estimates on both counts An increase in membership and premiums was the main catalyst for top line growth  leading to gains in the first two quarters of 2019  Medical cost management  better claims handling and cost saving initiatives among others contributed to the bottom line Leading players including the likes of Humana  UnitedHealth Group Inc   Cigna and Anthem also upped their respective earnings guidance for 2019  This reflects the companies  continued optimism on the operating environment Nevertheless  year to date  the health insurance industry has declined 9 7  against the Zacks S P 500 composite s rise of 17 7   The industry s decrease was due to investors  supposed concern for various political uncertainties Factors to Influence Third Quarter EarningsProgress in Government Business Medicare Advantage  MA  and Medicaid  Although MA remains one of the most attractive markets  it is underpenetrated and provides enough scope for expansion  These insurance plans are in huge demand from the baby boomers  which are rising by the day  Most health insurance giants  namely United Health  Humana  Aetna  NYSE AET  Anthem and Well Care Health have witnessed a secular uptrend in their MA business and the trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter Per The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS   Medicaid expenditures will exceed  540 billion by 2025 of which nearly 60  is expected to be serviced by managed care as state Medicaid programs increasingly turn to health insurers to take responsibility for the care of their most complex and chronically ill beneficiaries This shift toward managed Medicaid presents a growth opportunity for the industry players  Medical enrollment historically  from 2013 to 2018  has augmented for UnitedHealth  Centene  NYSE CNC   Anthem  WellCare Health Plans and is likely to shoot up further Gains From Pharmacy Benefit Management Business The healthcare sector witnessed a transition in recent years with a string of mergers between entities from the two major industries  such as Pharmacy Benefit Managers  PBM  and Health insurers The integration of PBMs and Payors started with UnitedHealth building its own PBM business  Optum Rx  and other insurers following suit Last year  Cigna acquired the PBM major Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   Also  Aetna was bought by another PBM major CVS while Anthem is developing its own PBM platform called IngenioRx  Further  Humana functions through its own in house PBM Humana Pharmacy Solutions In the second quarter  revenues from the respective PBM businesses under UnitedHealth  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and Humana ascended 11 7   4 2  and 7   respectively  Players expect a spurt in adjusted scripts  which should aid revenues from this line of business   Share Buybacks  Given the surplus capital resource available at their disposal  major health insurers have been actively repurchasing their shares  Except Cigna and CVS  other players inclusive of UnitedHealth  Anthem and Humana bought back shares  only to bump up the bottom line in turn  Given the fact that the share repurchase authorizations of most companies are still pending  we expect more buybacks in the ensuing quarters   We are thus upbeat about an overall positive performance from the sector in absence of any significant headwind Stocks to Bet on for Q3 Earnings BeatBelow we pick up three stocks that are likely to deliver a third quarter positive earnings surprise These are the stocks with the perfect combination of a favorable Earnings

141380,362895,HUM,U S  to consider expanding Medicare drug price negotiation,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Michael Erman WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration is considering expanding Medicare s ability to negotiate the cost of drugs by giving private payers a role in setting the price of medicines administered in hospitals and doctors  offices  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday  Azar s comments provided more details on the plan to lower prescription drug costs for Americans announced on Friday by President Donald Trump   While Trump assailed  middlemen   an apparent reference to health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs   for pocketing negotiated rebates on drugs rather than passing savings to consumers  the proposal discussed on Monday appears to see them as part of the solution to high prices  Shares of leading PBMs and insurers rose on Monday  CVS Health Corp  N CVS  shares climbed 3 7 percent with Express Scripts Holding  up 1 2 percent  while  Humana Inc   N HUM  shares rose 1 7 percent and  Cigna Corp   N CI  closed up 2 2 percent   On the one hand we are talking about banning rebates  but on the other we are talking about how great the private market is at controlling costs   said Craig Garthwaite  director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University s Kellogg School of Management   Where exactly do we think those price reductions come from   Trump has vowed to tackle rising drug prices since running for office  but his plan spared the pharmaceutical industry from direct government negotiations to control costs  a proposal he endorsed during the 2016 presidential campaign  Shares of drugmakers rose for a second day on Monday as Wall Street analysts said the new policies were unlikely to hurt industry profits  Medicare is the national health insurance plan run by the federal government for Americans over the age of 65 and the disabled  Azar  a former pharmaceutical company executive  said Trump views tougher negotiation as key to the plan  Azar said his agency will consider an alternative system for buying Medicare Part B drugs  which are administered by a healthcare provider and covered directly by the government  such as many cancer treatments and infused biotech drugs  The administration would seek to allow private payers to negotiate the price of those medicines  as health insurers and PBMs already do in Medicare Part D  which covers drugs patients get at the pharmacy   We believe there are more private sector entities equipped to negotiate these better deals in Part B  and we want to let them do it   Azar said   More broadly  the President has called for me to merge Medicare Part B drug payments into Part D  where negotiation has been so successful   Health and Human Services senior officials said at a briefing with reporters on Monday that they could experiment with moving some drugs from Medicare Part B to Part D in a pilot program  but did not say when that might begin  HHS likely has authority to pilot or experiment with limited programs  health policy experts said  But Joe Antos  of the conservative American Enterprise Institute  said the bulk of expensive drugs will likely remain in Part B  limiting the proposal s ability to significantly lower drug prices   These are sophisticated drugs for complicated diseases   Antos said   It s a relatively small part of the Medicare population  but it s a big chunk of spending   Under the current system  drugmakers and physicians are incentivized to keep prices high in Medicare Part B  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said  
She said companies best positioned to participate in the new proposal would be insurers that have their own PBMs  Part D plans and Medicare Advantage business  such as UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   Humana  Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and Cigna if the Trump administration approves its merger with Express Scripts ",2018-05-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-considering-expanding-medicare-drug-price-negotiation-1445809,1445809
141381,362896,HUM,Colombia s leftist Petro  the candidate who wants to upset the status quo,news,"By Helen Murphy and Luis Jaime Acosta BOGOTA  Reuters    Gustavo Petro  a former insurgent turned rabble rousing mayor  is fighting to become Colombia s first leftist president  turning his humble beginnings and revolutionary past into a rallying cry for millions of the nation s youth and poor  The 58 year old economist ranks second behind right wing candidate Ivan Duque to replace President Juan Manuel Santos  If no candidate garners more than 50 percent in Sunday s election  a second round in June will decide the presidency  Petro s strong showing in polls   he has around 30 percent support  compared to Duque s 42 percent   has worried many in the traditionally conservative nation  where the right has kept a vice like grip on power  Proposals from Petro to change the nation s economic model by piling taxes on unproductive landowners and abandoning oil and coal for clean energy have spooked investors  Some fear his efforts to shift wealth from rich to poor could turn Colombia into another Venezuela  Known for his fiery speeches from the Senate against corruption and right wing paramilitary groups  Petro says his political awakening began in 1973 with the military coup that ended the rule of Chile s socialist President Salvador Allende  Colombia was descending into violence around the same time  as guerrilla groups began a wave of kidnappings and attacks on civilians  It was then that Petro  the son of a teacher  pledged to fight the  feudal  oligarchy enriching itself at the expense of Colombia s poor  he said   Twenty first century politics is between the politics of life and the politics of death   the father of six told Reuters in April   I represent the politics of life   Inspired as a child by political biographies  Petro reportedly raised the ire of his Catholic teachers by reading books by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels   Although never a combatant  Petro s years in the now defunct M19 rebel group   which stormed the Supreme Court in 1985  leading to the deaths of more than 100 people   have created fodder for critics  He was arrested that year for weapons possession and served 18 months in prison  where he has said he was tortured  Petro s 2011 election as mayor of Bogota  Colombia s second most powerful post after the presidency  was seen as proof that politics was the way forward for insurgent movements like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  FARC   which demobilized last year and formed a political party  In 2010 he came fourth in the presidential vote with 1 3 million votes  less than half of what he garnered in March s primaries   Petro represents a clearly populist project   said Andres Molano  director of the Hernan Echavarria Olozaga institute of political science   He presents himself as an outsider   an enemy of the elites   and has elaborated a messianic and anti liberal discourse that promises a kind of revolution both politically and economically    A win for Petro may help shore up Colombia s fragile peace process that ended five decades of war with the FARC  but angered many by giving their commanders a political voice instead of a jail cell  Petro promises Latin America s fourth largest economy will include all of society  creating a public banking system that guarantees cheap credit to small and medium sized businesses and expanding free education  That may be difficult  The economy remains weak  a new wave of drug trafficking crime gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the FARC and half a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia looking for food and work   Critics say his ideas are strikingly similar to the early days of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez s government in Venezuela   There are many echoes of the so called 21st century socialism that flourished in Latin America during the last two decades   said Molano   Petro has said he does not plan to expropriate property  but he raised eyebrows with his recent offer to buy a huge piece of productive land from billionaire sugar baron and media mogul Carlos Ardila Lulle to give to the poor  While it may be tough for Petro to push radical change through Congress   his Colombia Humana  NYSE HUM  party won just six seats in March s legislative election   he said he would seek alliances with center  left and other minority parties or attempt a change to the constitution through a constituent assembly  Known for his stubborn management style and ruling by decree  the bespectacled Petro has taken flack for living in a gated community and wearing  500 shoes  but his expensive lifestyle has not swayed voters or his discourse

141383,362898,HUM,Humana  HUM  Tops Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Humana  HUM  came out with quarterly earnings of  6 05 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 24 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 96 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15 46   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  4 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 48  delivering a surprise of 4 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Humana  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  16 25 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 26 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Humana shares have lost about 0 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for Humana 
While Humana has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Humana was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  4 91 on  15 93 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  17 48 on  63 74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

141384,362899,HUM,Outlook For Health Insurance Industry Looks Sanguine,opinion,"The Health Maintenance Organization  HMO  industry comprises entities  either private or public  that take care of the basic and supplemental health services of its subscribers  Companies in this space primarily assume the risks involved and assign premiums for health and medical insurance policies  Industry participants also provide administrative and managed care services for self funded insurance Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers  called in network   which include primary care physicians  clinical facilities  hospitals and specialists  However  out of network exceptions are made in emergencies or when medically necessary  Health insurance plans can be availed by ways such as private purchase  social insurance or social welfare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid  funded by the government Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes      As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the total U S  population  overall demand for health insurance for seniors will increase  According to the 2018 U S  Census  between 2010 and 2030  the number of individuals aged 65  is projected to nearly double from 39 million to 73 million  a growth rate nearly 5 times faster than the 17  increase expected for the total population  The census estimates this group to grow from 13  to 21  by 2030   one of the fastest growing within U S  population  This senior population has fueled demand for Medicare Advantage  MA   the private version of the government Medicare program  MA plans have proven beneficial for all concerned groups  customers  government and health insurers  Customers gains from better coverage and services  and government on the other hand gains from reduction in cost of care  These plans have also led to considerable revenue growth for the likes of UnitedHealth Group Inc   UNH   Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  and Anthem Inc   NYSE ANTM  among other health insurers      The HMO industry is rapidly consolidating with mergers and acquisitions  The most common takeovers in recent years have been in the nature of horizontal expansion in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid as the players seek to garner a greater share of the attractive MA  market  Lately  however  the companies have shown interest in expanding vertically and add capabilities to its supply chain through mergers and acquisitions  The mega mergers of Aetna  NYSE AET  with CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS    CVS  and Cigna Corp   CI  with Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  are the best examples of inter industry deals that led to the union of a health insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager      The industry has also witnessed development in ancillary business to diversify revenue sources in the wake of tough regulations laid  via the ACA  on health insurance business   These businesses  mostly in the form of health care services  are growing rapidly  opening up new avenues of growth and forming an increased proportion of the industry s total revenues  Health services business is an important growth area for HMOs as these provide unregulated cash flows and enable players to become comprehensive healthcare providers  Ample opportunities of growth exist in the health service business and continued investments are being made in this area  A poster child for the same is UnitedHealth s Optum  which provides a  range of healthcare related services Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates upbeat prospects in the near term  The Zacks   which is an 11 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  25  which places it at the top 10  of 255 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  In a year s time  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone up by 4 6  One Year Price PerformanceBefore we present a few HMO stocks that you

141389,362904,HUM,Should Value Investors Consider Humana  HUM  Stock Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Humana has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 81  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 78  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Humana s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Humana has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 86  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Humana has a P S ratio of about 0 67  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  HUM is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Humana currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Humana a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall    Though Humana might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives HUM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen eight upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period      This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 8 1  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Humana Inc  Price and Consensus
 
   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Humana is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 22  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated  150 billion in this industry every year  more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana Now that 8 states have fully legalized it  with several more states following close behind   Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand  One industry insider described the future as  mind blowing    and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge ",2019-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-humana-hum-stock-now-200456784,200456784

141399,362914,HUM,Is Humana  HUM  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Humana  HUM   HUM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value 
Another notable valuation metric for HUM is its P B ratio of 3 05  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 3 07  HUM s P B has been as high as 4 60 and as low as 2 90  with a median of 3 63  over the past year 
Finally  our model also underscores that HUM has a P CF ratio of 11 95  This data point considers a firm s operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 12 12  Over the past year  HUM s P CF has been as high as 25 05 and as low as 11 55  with a median of 17 06

141435,362950,HUM,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Humana  HUM ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Humana  HUM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 46   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Humana was expected to post earnings of  4 30 per share  but it reported  4 48 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 19   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 53 per share  while it actually produced  2 65 per share  a surprise of 4 74  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Humana  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Humana currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 62   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-humana-hum-200439345,200439345
141436,362951,HUM,Cigna Stock Gains Near 9  On Drug Rebate Proposal Pullback,opinion,"On Jul 11  Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   shares witnessed a rise  following the announcement made by the Trump administration about dropping its proposal to curb drug rebates to pharmacy benefit managers  PBM  
Cigna s acquisition of Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  for  67 billion helped it gain a huge exposure to the PBM business  However  its shares had been under pressure for some time since the administration had plans to ban the rebate on drugs in the hands of PBM  This proposal  if executed  would have dented the company s profitability 
While Cigna was up 9 24   other health insurers having PBM business such as UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   soared on the heels of the news 
PBMs basic role was to help manage prescription claims for insurers for Medicare Part D plans  But over time  they have evolved to play an extended role in drug supply chain by helping with formulary management  drug utilization review  determining which pharmacies are in network and how much those pharmacies will receive in reimbursement  Thus  they became more important carriers for insurers 
In recent years  health insurers like Cigna and others have integrated PBM functionality into their businesses  While some of them acquired PBM companies  others have developed their in house PBMs 
Cigna s acquisition of Express Scripts has been successful and its first quarter results post the buyout witnessed revenue growth of 192  and earnings beat of 4 3   The company also saw an increase in membership in its Medicare Part D segment due to the acquisition 
Following the strong first quarter earnings  Cigna raised its earnings projection for the year 2019 on the back of strong performance in its health insurance and pharmacy benefits businesses  The company expects the deal to increase earnings per share from  18 to  20  21 in 2021  The combined company will generate free cash flow of at least  6 billion in 2021 
Barring yesterday s gain  the company has declined 15 5  year to date  compared with the  s gain of 15  

 
Now  with the lifting of the proposed rebate ban  the company s share price should bounce back  Cigna s solid business positioning  good cost control is expected to place it in a good position going forward

141466,362981,HUM,4 Stocks To Buy Despite Year to Date Fall In Health Insurance,opinion,"In spite of strong fundamentals  the health insurance industry has underperformed so far this year due to regulatory noise The Zacks   industry  which comprises health insurance stocks  is down nearly 2  year to date compared with the Zacks S P 500 composite s gain of 11 2   The decline in the industry is mainly due to investors  apprehensions stemming from the proposal of  Medicare for All  by Democrats   an agenda for the 2020 presidential elections The proposal seeks to eliminate private health insurance and replace it with a universal Medicare plan on the premise that the same would reduce administrative inefficiencies and control costs in the health care system All the major industry participants are against the proposal  since it would replace the current private insurance plans and eat into the earnings of health insurers UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  Group s CEO said on the company s first quarter earnings call that Medicare for All would  surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors  destabilize the nation s health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best  Recently  another major health insurer Humana  NYSE HUM  opposed the proposal as it will not support any legislation   making private health coverage illegal Though nothing of this proposal gets transpired now  at least till 2021   when the election is finalized  the uncertainty caused by the proposal is enough to push investors away from the industry  which is highly policy regulated Medicare and Medicaid to Drive GrowthKeeping this noise aside  a look at the fundamentals shows the industry s going strong with rise in revenues and enrollment  solid balance sheets and stable growth in margins The most prominent factor driving growth for the players would be the changing U S  demography  which features the growing baby boomer population  which is driving demand for Medicare Advantage   MA   plans  a substitute for Government sponsored Medicare plan for retirees  The segment remains underpenetrated with large untapped market potential  Based on the CMS March 2019 Medicare monthly enrollment report  MA grew by 7 4  year over year  Furthermore  most of the players in the industry have expanded their MA geographic presence to capture market share  having done so mainly via mergers and acquisitions  and buyouts  The same has also trigged massive consolidation in the health insurance industry  in recent years Another attractive growth opportunity for health insurers is Medicaid  Over the past decade  states have continued to move toward managed care in an effort to better manage rising costs and as a result of ACA expansion  As many as 36 states have opted for Medicaid Expansion  with the remaining 14 apparently having very low chances given their republican control  Of these 14 states  Texas and Florida look most promising  though no substantial Medicaid development has been seen here A strong balance sheet has allowed players to consolidate through acquisitions  Recent mergers in the health insurance space have brought health insurers and pharmacy benefit  managers  PBM  together  In house PBM would allow health insurers to gain more control on drugs and therefore management of medical costs Though PBMs are also under government radar as they are working on cutting the role of middlemen to reduce the final pricing  nothing much has been achieved on this front either The regulatory developments will continue with the final rule nowhere near  In the meantime  let s take a closer look at some of the stocks worth considering in the space  It is important to note here that geopolitical uncertainty and trade war between the United States and China are less likely to upset the health insurance as most of its business is domestic oriented This provides one more reason to invest in stocks of this industry Stocks

141468,362983,HUM,Health Insurers Rejoice On Pullback Of Drug Rebate Plan,opinion,Yesterday  the Trump administration announced that it has pulled back its proposed rebate ban on pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs   Notably  PBMs act middle man between drug makers and health insurers  negotiating with the former to make drugs available at lower prices for the latter and grabbing part of the benefit in between The Rebate Ban PlanThe rebate ban was intended at passing down the benefit of negotiated drug prices among drug makers and PBMs and drug distributors to patients so as to make prescription drugs affordable One of the mainstays of Trump s political agenda has been to redo the health care system in America  which is one of the costliest in the world and is weighing on federal budgets The administration has been cracking down on drug manufacturers to lower drug prices  Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers came under intense criticism from employers  Congress and the Trump administration  Soon  PBM s share of rebates turned into a nationwide controversy  Thus  the rebate ban appeared one of the ways of achieving the goal of lowering drug cost Why the Reversal The highly promoted rebate ban proposal reached a dead end after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the plan would weigh on the federal budget by over  177 billion over the 10 years and that there would be no certainty on the main goal to control manufacturer drug prices The administration  however  clarified that although this measure would be repealed  other ways and means will be applied to control drug prices   Health Insurers RejoiceWhile the news was taken negatively by drug manufacturers  it was a clear positive for health insurers as they will continue getting drugs at lower prices  PBMs initial role post the formation of the Affordable Care Act was to help manage prescription claims for insures for Medicare Part D plans  But over time  PBMs have evolved to play an extended role in drug supply chain by taking care of functions such as formulary management  drug utilization review  determining which pharmacies are in network and how much those pharmacies will receive in reimbursement  They thus became more important carriers for insurers In recent years  health insurers have gone further to integrate PBM functionality into their businesses  with an aim of forward integration across the supply chain network  While some of them resorted to acquiring PBM companies  some others have developed their in house PBMs Insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   have their own in house PBMs named Optum Rx  IngenioRx  and Humana Pharmacy Solutions  respectively  Notably  UnitedHealth also acquired a PBM company  Catamaran  back in 2015  which further expanded its PBM capabilities Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   recently acquired the nation s leading PBM  Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   which now contributes more than 60  of the company s combined revenues Since most the leading insurers are also playing the role of a PBM  their stocks surged on the news  Cigna  UnitedHealth  Humana  Anthem each saw their stock price gain 9 24   5 53   4 58  and 5 54   respectively Big players in fact came under the pressure of rebate plan and announced that they would pass some of the pharmacy discounts they get from drug manufacturers  This news thus removes a dark cloud hanging over the health insurance industry This news came as a relief against the backdrop of regulatory noise in the industry  which led to a decline in the Zacks  industry  comprising health insurers which lagged the broader S P 500 Index  year to date Recent NoisesRecently  Trump declared an executive order to disclose hospital pricing of products and services to patients as well as contracts between insurers and hospitals  Also  a debate was held in the United States Courts of Appeals in front of a three member panel on the constitutionality of the ACA  which was declared as unconstitutional in December 2018 It is most likely that the case would go to Supreme Court  but if ACA is rendered unconstitutional  health insurers would suffer a major blow as they have greatly gained from an increase in business volumes since the passage of the act in 2010  Moreover  presidential candidate Joe Biden s Medicare for All proposal has also been disturbing health insurers since the plan aims to replace private health insurance by a single government controlled health plan Winners Till NowThe health insurance space is heavily regulated  Yet  over time  the players have accustomed themselves to frequent jerks caused by political and regulatory issues  Health insurers have nevertheless come a long way  building a formidable business by diversifying into different revenue lines  managing costs and keeping together a solid balance sheet This is also revealed by the Zacks Medical HMO Industry   gain of 430  since the passage of the ACA to date  The Zacks S P composite has grown 161  in the said period    Among the companies mentioned above UnitedHealth carries a Zacks

141482,362997,HUM,Exclusive  CVS eyes major expansion of health clinics with Aetna deal   sources,news,"By Carl O Donnell  Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    CVS Health Corp  N CVS  is planning to significantly expand health services at its retail pharmacies if it completes a more than  66 billion deal for insurer  Aetna Inc   N AET   a move that could save more than  1 billion annually  people familiar with the matter said   A key rationale is to use many of the U S  pharmacy chain s 9 700 brick and mortar outlets to improve access to preventative care and cut back on some emergency room visits for Aetna s roughly 23 million members with medical coverage  these people said   The full benefits of the strategy will take several years to realize  requiring billions of dollars in investment to increase the number of CVS clinics and provide the staff and equipment for a wider variety of treatments  the people said   Those funds would be diverted from planned investments in CVS retail facilities  and not amount to additional expenses  they said   Deal talks between the companies are still underway  and an agreement could be announced as early as Sunday or Monday  sources familiar with the matter told Reuters  It is also possible that a deal is delayed or does not materialize  they said   Health insurers have redoubled their efforts to cut costs in a time of steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act   Aetna last year tried to buy rival  Humana Inc   N HUM  to gain more leverage over costs  but that transaction  as well as a proposed merger between Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and  Cigna Corp   N CI   was shot down by antitrust regulators   Many insurers have already been encouraging patients to use urgent care centers  which can provide some of the same services as emergency rooms for as little as a tenth of the cost  said Laurel Stoimenoff  chief executive of the Urgent Care Association of America   MINUTECLINICS  The industry has grown to about 8 000 urgent care centers nationwide  as more hospitals  insurers and private operators open such walk in facilities  Stoimenoff said  with 400 to 500 centers added each year  They may be staffed by doctors and provide relatively advanced care including X rays   CVS operates more than 1 000 MinuteClinics  which offer more basic services ranging from flu shots to physicals and are mainly staffed by nurse practitioners   Combined with Aetna  the company would be able to seamlessly access medical records  offer certain preventive services to covered members for free and make drugs promptly available in adjacent CVS pharmacies  said Dan Mendelson  president of consultancy Avalere Health   The in store clinics could provide immunizations  check if a patient needs antibiotics  help manage chronic illnesses like diabetes or even administer medications by infusion  but are unlikely to offer acute treatment of serious injuries  healthcare experts said    It would probably be unsettling to people coming in to buy socks to have someone with a bleeding head come in for stitches   said Greg Burke of the United Hospital Fund  a non profit focused on improving healthcare in New York   Expanding the clinics could eventually save the combined company more than  1 billion annually by substituting low cost treatments in CVS stores for more expensive hospital visits  two people familiar with the matter said  The combined net income of Aetna and CVS is forecast to be about  9 25 billion in 2017  according to Thomson Reuters data   Aetna competitor UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  operates 230 MedExpress urgent care centers in 17 states in one of its fastest growing divisions  with nearly 20 percent compounded revenue growth per year   For CVS  which has seen non pharmacy sales decline at its stores  the clinics could have the added benefit of bringing in new customers and providing alternatives for less productive retail space   
 It s a tough retail environment  I think they re going to devote less space to it and more to different healthcare services and clinics   said Jeff Jonas  a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds which owns shares in Aetna and CVS ",2017-12-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-cvs-eyes-major-expansion-of-health-clinics-with-aetna-deal--sources-942813,942813
141483,362998,HUM,CVS Health to acquire Aetna for  69 billion in year s largest acquisition,news,"By Carl O Donnell and Caroline Humer  Reuters    U S  drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp  N CVS  said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U S  health insurer  Aetna Inc   N AET  for  69 billion  seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower cost medical services in pharmacies  This year s largest corporate acquisition will combine one of the nation s largest pharmacy benefits managers  PBMs  and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers  whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans   The deal comes after Aetna s  37 billion plan to acquire smaller U S  health insurance peer  Humana Inc   N HUM  was blocked in January by a U S  federal judge over antitrust concerns  A proposed combination of peers Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and  Cigna Corp   N CI  was also shot down   Aetna shareholders stand to receive  207 per share in the deal with CVS  the companies said  The consideration comprises  145 per share in cash and 0 8378 CVS shares for each Aetna share  Reuters first reported the terms of the deal earlier on Sunday   Aetna shareholders will own about 22 percent of the combined company  while CVS shareholders will own the remainder  The companies said that cost synergies in the second full year after the transaction closes    2020 if the deal closes in the second half of 2018 as they expect    would amount to  750 million  They foresee it adding to adjusted earnings per share by the low  to mid single digit percentage points  Their vision expands beyond capitalizing on CVS  existing MinuteClinic structure  which largely offers preventative services like flu shots  the companies  chief executives said in an interview    When you walk into CVS there s the pharmacy  What if there s a vision and audiology center  and perhaps a nutritionist  and some sort of care manager   CVS CEO Larry Merlo said   Aetna will be operated as a separate unit and Aetna s existing leadership is expected to run the Aetna businesses  Merlo said  Aetna will have two of its directors  in addition to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini join the board of CVS  The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to a shifting landscape  including changes in the Affordable Care Act  rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon com Inc  O AMZN    CVS plans to use its low cost clinics to provide medical services to Aetna s roughly 23 million medical members  In addition to health clinics and medical equipment  CVS could provide assistance with vision  hearing and nutrition   A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices  and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS s front of store retail business  The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services  largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments   That could eventually cut costs substantially  with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits  Meanwhile  deeper collaboration between Aetna s insurance business and CVS s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM s leverage with drugmakers  Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients  because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients   Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act  Large corporate customers of Aetna are taking a wait and see attitude regarding the impact on costs  benefits experts have said  Analysts have said the CVS Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega mergers  as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy   It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA  and Humana Inc  N HUM   or between Humana and Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT   Ana Gupte  analyst at Leerink Partners  said recently   VERTICAL MERGER  Although CVS and Aetna s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries  the U S  Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so called vertical mergers  where the companies are not direct competitors   Last month  the Justice Department sued to block AT T Inc s  N T  planned  85 4 billion merger with  Time Warner  Inc  N TWX   saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice  The CVS Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs  several investors said  asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press   But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved  although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off  It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy  said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon    The companies  want the FTC to get it  The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers   said Cantor  referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT T Inc  N T  from buying Time Warner Inc  N TWX    Barclays   LON BARC  and

141484,362999,HUM,CVS  Aetna executives defend  69 billion deal to skeptical Wall Street,news,"By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    CVS Health Corp  N CVS  and  Aetna Inc   N AET  said on Monday their  69 billion deal to combine the pharmacy and drug benefit manager and the No  3 U S  health insurer would transform healthcare and deliver cost savings  but investors took a pessimistic view of the combination in the short term  CVS and Aetna announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement for a deal that will allow CVS to expand cheaper medical services in its pharmacy based MinuteClinics and rein in soaring U S  healthcare costs for consumers  large corporations  and the government  CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on an investor call on Monday that he expects the deal to close in 2018 after an antitrust review  and that he expects  750 million in savings from eliminating duplicate corporate functions at CVS and Aetna and combining some drug health plan and drug benefit management areas  But investors on Monday described the savings as modest and worried that they will not kick in until 2020 at the earliest  Investors are also concerned that CVS earnings would not grow as much as expected next year due to deal costs   CVS shares fell 4 6 percent to close at  71 69 on Monday and Aetna shares fell 1 4 percent to close at  178 70  LONG TERM GROWTH  SHORT TERM PAIN CVS and Aetna envision a new healthcare system in which patient health is improved as the companies integrate pharmacy and medical claims and increase preventative services in clinics from the current emphasis on flu shots to include other areas such as vision  hearing and nutrition  Strategically  Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas said  he likes the idea  which could drive customer growth in CVS s MinuteClinics   Financially  though  it s really a stretch   he said  CVS s plan to cancel share buybacks likely means lower earnings per share next year and the deal   the biggest merger of 2017   will increase the company s debt costs  Two ratings agencies  Moody s and S P  said on Monday that the debt load from the deal could spur them to lower credit ratings on the companies  The companies are turning to several banks to provide  49 billion in financing to fund the cash portion of the deal  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said investors were increasingly skeptical  and that attaining the  750 million in savings would be difficult given the stiff competition with rivals and pricing pressure on health insurance products and pharmaceuticals  But she said the deal would probably be approved after regulators ask for small asset sales of Medicare drug plans to maintain market competition   Antitrust regulators last year blocked two separate mergers proposed by the large insurers  Aetna s plan to buy  Humana Inc   N HUM  and Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  acquisition of  Cigna Corp   N CI   saying they would hurt consumers   Unlike those deals  the CVS Aetna combination is a  vertical  integration in which the companies do not directly overlap operations  Several antitrust experts said they expected the CVS Aetna deal to gain approval for that reason  but that it would be scrutinized closely   Large corporate customers were a major factor in the antitrust litigation on the insurer mergers  and benefits consultants said they are taking a wait and see attitude about the companies  promises for the CVS deal  Addressing investor skepticism during a conference call with analysts on Monday  Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said the companies   which were already working together on pharmacy benefits and to expand MinuteClinics   needed to merge so that CVS could have more control on finding the savings and other opportunities    Owner economics matter here   Bertolini said when asked by a Wall Street analyst why the two companies did not simply partner  The payout from the deal for Bertolini  who plans to remain a director  could be worth as much as  85 million if he leaves the company  as he is due to receive  6 7 million in severance  more than  9 million in deferred compensation and his unvested stock awards vest  according to data from the company s filings  
That would be on top of the roughly  120 million from the 574 000 shares he already owns  as well as additional money from shares that will vest between now and the deal s closing ",2017-12-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cvs-aetna-executives-expect-to-save-by-reducing-redundancy-948412,948412

141488,363003,HUM,Obamacare insurance options dwindle for neediest U S  patients,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    Josh Brookhart has four health insurers to choose from in Seattle s King County for 2018  more than many Americans like him who buy coverage on the Obamacare individual market   Yet none of the plans cover all the complex medical care needed for his seven year old son  Gabriel   Born with an extreme form of Chiari malformation  Gabriel required surgery to reinsert a part of his brain into his skull  He lives with hydrocephalus  or extra fluid in his brain  and spina bifida  which causes abnormal development of the spinal cord  The Brookharts  insurer  Regence BlueShield of Washington  said in June it would exit the Obamacare markets in 2018  citing unsettled marketplaces across the country  a move common to many insurers uncertain about the program s future under President Donald Trump   All of Gabriel s specialists  who span multiple medical centers and practices and have been coordinating his care for five years  were covered under Regence   Based on the limited options for 2018 enrollment  the Brookharts plan to pick an insurer that will cover some of Gabriel s care and expect to pay tens of thousands of dollars for the rest of his needs   I would pay a high price for a good policy  It s just mind boggling to me that it doesn t exist no matter how much I would want to pay   Brookhart said  Gabriel s case shows how difficult it can still be to find adequate healthcare for very complex conditions four years after Obamacare took full effect  In many cases  an insurer will cover medical care but not certain prescription drugs  In other cases  an insurer may cover one specialist doctor but not others  or cut expensive academic medical centers out of their networks to lower costs   Patients with complex medical cases often take high cost prescription drugs  rely on specialists who sometimes coordinate their care and may require sophisticated surgeries  among other needs  The challenge of finding adequate healthcare on the Obamacare market is expected to intensify as the Trump administration strips away aspects of the law  healthcare experts say   Instability is just a very stressful thing for people dependent on a stable connection to the healthcare system   said Daniel Polsky  professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics   Even just a change of doctors could result in some difficult health consequences   RESTRICTED CHOICE U S  consumers have often complained that subsidized health insurance under former President Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act restricted their choice of doctors  or forced them to change providers  In some cases  that may mean switching primary care providers  But for patients with serious medical needs it can prevent them from seeing their specialists   The Obama administration attempted a fix  directing more federal oversight of the plans  requiring transparency from insurers on what they did  and did not  cover and setting guidelines for insurers to cover enough healthcare providers  Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare and is using executive powers to undermine it  including a rule finalized in April that allows individual states to determine whether insurers provide enough access to doctors   The administration has also proposed giving states more authority over their insurance markets and allowing them to water down some Obamacare benefits in 2019  That could create wide discrepancies in access to doctors among states  said Sabrina Corlette  an expert on health insurance markets at Georgetown University  There is no national estimate of how many people with complex medical cases may struggle to find a plan that covers their particular doctors  About 2 2 million people on the individual market have some form of a pre existing chronic condition  according to Avalere Health  a research and consulting firm   Seventy three percent of the Obamacare 2018 individual market is comprised of restrictive plans  or those that cover fewer providers  according to Avalere  up from 68 percent in 2017 and 54 percent in 2015  Research has shown that insurers are more likely to offer limited access to doctor practices in markets where they compete against one or more rivals  This helps keep insurer costs down  and therefore allows them to offer lower prices  Matt Slaby of Denver  Colorado  can choose between six Obamacare insurers  but none cover all the care for his genetic blood clotting disorder  called Factor V Leiden  He relies on the bloodthinner Xarelto  which costs about  400 per month without insurance  to prevent life threatening clots   His insurer from last year   Cigna Corp   N CI   dropped his plan from the Denver market for 2018    There are no plans that cover everything I need   Slaby said   Finding two or three  the intersection of things that keep me alive  that s the challenge    In U S  counties with a single insurer  there is less incentive to whittle down the provider list because there is no competition  The departure of major insurers including  Aetna Inc   N AET  and  Humana Inc   N HUM  from Obamacare markets has left about half of U S  counties with only one insurer selling plans  up from one third in 2017   But that does not guarantee that a sole insurer in a market will cover medical care at any specific hospital or physician practice  In Virginia s Chesterfield County  a single insurer  Cigna  is offering Obamacare coverage  presenting a tough choice for Jodi Smith Lemacks  whose son was born with a heart defect  The plan does not cover her son s specialists at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia  CHOP  five hours away  where Joshua Lemacks  14  has been treated since he was in utero for hypoplastic left heart syndrome   There is no cure for his condition  In three major surgeries  doctors at CHOP have rerouted Joshua s anatomy so that his blood can pump through one heart chamber instead of two  They have also provided medication  some through a clinical trial  to help prolong his heart s ability to function in this way  Lemacks spends  6 000 to  7 000 a year out of pocket for Joshua s medical expenses  and once had medical debt close to  100 000 due to the surgeries  She decided to put him on her employer s plan for 2018  but says if anything were to happen to her job at a nonprofit or she chooses to change jobs  she would need to return to the Obamacare market  
 You do everything you can to protect your kids but at the end of the day if you can t get coverage  you can t get coverage   she said ",2017-12-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/obamacare-insurance-options-dwindle-for-neediest-us-patients-963508,963508

141491,363006,HUM,Humana Stock Bulls Haven t Lost The Battle Yet,opinion,"Humana  NYSE HUM  climbed to an all time high of  356 in early November 2018  following a rally from as low as  18 57 in March 2009  In less than ten years  the company rewarded the patience of its investors with a total return of over 1820   not counting dividends 
Unfortunately  the last six months were nothing like the past ten years  In mid April  Humana dived below  223  down over 37  from its peak  Now  if this is the start of a bigger selloff  then it is time to stay aside  But could it actually be a buy the dip opportunity 

The weekly chart above allows us to put Humana s entire progress since the year 2000 into Elliott Wave context  The Financial Crisis of 2008 2009 is labeled as wave II  The phenomenal uptrend to  356 is a textbook five wave impulse in wave III 
Humana Bulls Aiming at  400 a Share Before Giving Up
This brings us to the present and the recent pullback  which fits in the position of wave IV  It has already touched the 38 2  Fibonacci level  where fourth waves often terminate  The missing piece of the puzzle is wave V  Provided it s not a truncation  the fifth wave is supposed to exceed the top of wave III  In terms of price  wave V s initial targets lie near  360 a share  but  400 is quite reasonable as well 
On the other hand  the bulls should tread very carefully  According to the theory  a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse  Investors hoping that the 2019 dip is going to fuel a rally similar to the one that followed the dip in 2009 are up for a disappointment 
If this count is correct  Humana is still in an uptrend and aiming at a new all time high  However  a bearish reversal near the  400 mark can open the door for a  50  plunge towards the support near  200 a share

141512,363027,HUM,U S  judge questions states seeking to restore Obamacare payments,news,"By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A U S  judge on Monday appeared skeptical toward a request from several states that want him to order the administration of Republican President Donald Trump to continue payments to health insurers under Obamacare   At a hearing in San Francisco federal court  U S  District Judge Vince Chhabria said he aimed to issue a ruling on Tuesday   The Trump administration earlier this month terminated the payments  which help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income Americans  as part of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor  Barack Obama   Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months  prompting health insurers such as Anthem Inc   Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  and  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  to raise premiums or exit insurance markets  Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump s move while the case is being litigated and argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates   But Chhabria on Monday suggested that California and other states had anticipated Trump s move and worked with insurers to make sure most consumers would not be harmed  That weakens the case for a court order forcing the payments  Chhabria said    Why should I be ordering the administration to make these payments in the next few months while we get the case adjudicated   Chhabria asked  Since cutting off the payments  Trump has alternately supported  and dismissed  an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  can be negotiated  While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare  the president argued that the subsidies made insurance companies  rich    In a court filing on Friday  the U S  Department of Justice pointed to a prior ruling from a Washington  D C  federal court that said Congress had never appropriated the money for the subsidies  An appeal of that ruling is currently on hold  Either side could appeal Chhabria s ruling to the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  which is weighted with Democratic appointed judges   
From there  any further appeal would go to the U S  Supreme Court ",2017-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-judge-to-review-trump-healthcare-payments-cut-545678,545678

141516,363031,HUM,CVS bid for Aetna  A  66 billion bet on cutting drug costs,news,"By Caroline Humer and Carl O Donnell NEW YORK  Reuters    The proposed merger between U S  pharmacy operator CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  and No  3 health insurer  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  represents a  66 billion bet that insurers can drive down high U S  drug prices by cutting out the middleman  The move is the most expensive effort to date that would enable a national health insurer to take back full control of prescription medicines for their customers by negotiating prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting customer out of pocket costs for each drug  CVS  one of the largest U S  pharmacy benefits managers  has offered to buy No  3 health insurer Aetna for more than  200 per share  sources said on Thursday  It could take at least several weeks for any deal to materialize  If the deal happens  it would likely pressure rival insurers  drugmakers  pharmaceutical benefits managers  and retail pharmacies to also consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins    It s an alternate model at this point  It s not clear that it s definitely a better one   BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said   More consolidation could lead to pressure on some of the brand name drug prices and a better counterweight to the big pharma companies    For years  insurers paid drug benefits managers like CVS and Express Scripts Holdings Co to negotiate down drug prices  with both parties taking a share of any discount by the time a medicine was paid for by consumers   But outrage over the high costs of drugs has grown as consumers have picked up a larger portion of the tab for drug costs and it is threatening profit margins all along the drug supply chain  from manufacturers to distributors  insurers and pharmacies  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  and  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  currently have in house pharmacy benefits businesses  and say that it has helped them keep medical costs down   Anthem Inc recently decided to go down that same path  It cut ties with Express Scripts during a  3 billion legal fight  and said it would use CVS to build its own pharmacy benefits business in the next few years  That tie up could now be at risk if CVS reaches a deal to buy Aetna  Leerink analyst Ana Gupta said       CVS also provides management services for Aetna rival  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   If CVS buys Aetna  that could revive Cigna s interest in buying Humana  analyst Christine Arnold of investment bank Cowen   Co said in a research note   Aetna earlier this year closed the door on a deal with rival insurer Humana Inc after antitrust regulators said that combination and a rival deal between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp were anti competitive  The pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  could need to match its business model closer to CVS to attempt to stay competitive  Arnold said in a note  and may look at buying Express Scripts   Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said that Express Scripts could also be a target for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc which is reported to be looking to get into the pharmacy business       SWINGING PENDULUM Over the past decade  health insurers have diverged on the value of the pharmacy benefits business   Anthem sold its pharmacy benefit manager to Express Scripts and outsourced almost all of the business in 2010   UnitedHealth took the opposite approach when it decided in 2011 to bring its pharmacy benefits management in house  then bought an even bigger standalone benefits manager  Catamaran  in 2015       Humana operates its own pharmacy benefit manager and Cigna and Aetna have hybrid approaches where they manage some parts in house and outsource others        Until recently  insurers sought to expand their profit margins by reducing their spending on hospital services  using their size to negotiate down what they pay to healthcare providers   But with those profits in hand  and with drug prices representing a bigger proportion of overall healthcare spending  they see new opportunity in targeting the pharmacy benefits  Leerink s Gupta said

141519,363034,HUM,UnitedHealth Stock Looks Strong Despite Uncertainty,opinion,"Whether Obamacare is unconstitutional or not is up to the policy makers  but the uncertainty surrounding the matter caused a broad selloff in the healthcare sector  Cigna  NYSE CI   Humana  NYSE HUM   CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  lost a significant chunk of their respective market caps after the DOJ sided with a December 2018 Texas district court ruling that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down 
Following the news  analysts at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  trimmed their price targets on UnitedHealth citing  fear of policy proposals  that could wreak havoc on the company s financial results 
On the other hand  where there is risk there is reward  We cannot know what the healthcare chatter is eventually going to produce  but at least we can look for recognizable Elliott Wave patterns on the related stocks  One such pattern can be found on the 2 hour chart of UnitedHealth below 

The chart reveals that UNH s pullback from  288 in  208 looks like a simple A B C zigzag correction with a triangle in wave B  This patterns gives us plenty of reasons to turn bullish on UnitedHealth stock 
A Base has been Formed in UnitedHealth Stock
Triangles are known to precede the last wave of the sequence  In that case  this is wave C down to  208 on April 17th  Once a correction is over  the larger trends resumes  Since UNH was clearly in an uptrend prior to December 4th  2018  it makes sense to expect the bulls to return 
Another reason for optimism is provided by the fact that the A B C retracement developed within the parallel lines of a corrective channel  The lower line of the channel caused a sharp bounce to  232 a share so far 
If this analysis is correct  all the uncertainty in the U S  healthcare sector has created a good buying opportunity in UnitedHealth stock  The anticipated rally should exceed the previous all time high  making  300 a share a very realistic target

141545,363060,HUM,Exclusive  T Mobile  Sprint plan merger without selling assets,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Anjali Athavaley  Reuters    T Mobile U S  Inc  O TMUS  and Sprint Corp  N S  plan to announce a merger agreement without any immediate asset sales  as they seek to preserve as much of their spectrum holdings and cost synergies as they can before regulators ask for concessions  according to people familiar with the matter  While it is common for companies not to unveil divestitures during merger announcements  T Mobile s and Sprint s approach shows that the companies plan to enter what could be challenging negotiations with U S  antitrust and telecommunications regulators without having made prior concessions   Reuters reported last week that some of the U S  Justice Department s antitrust staff were skeptical about the deal  which would combine the third and fourth largest U S  wireless carriers  However  regulators can only begin reviewing a corporate merger once it has been agreed to and announced   T Mobile and Sprint are preparing a negotiating strategy to tackle demands from regulators regarding asset sales  including the divestment of some of their spectrum licenses after their deal is announced  the sources said   The companies  announcement of a merger agreement  currently expected to come either in late October or early November  will focus on the potential benefits of the deal for U S  consumers  including the advancement of next generation 5G wireless technology  which requires considerable investment  the sources added   The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  T Mobile and Sprint declined to comment   It is better for Sprint and T Mobile to listen and learn the concerns of regulators first  and see whether there is anything that can be done to address those concerns   MoffettNathanson research analyst Craig Moffett said  A combination of T mobile and Sprint would create a business with more than 130 million U S  subscribers  just behind  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T    Companies often chose not to make any pre emptive announcements on divestitures when they announce mergers  For example  when U S  health insurers Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and  Aetna Inc   N AET  separately announced deals two years ago to acquire peers  Cigna Corp   N CI  and  Humana Inc   N HUM   they did not reveal which assets they would be willing to divest  U S  federal judges shot down both mergers on antitrust grounds earlier this year  Some media and telecommunications deals in recent years have been announced with divestitures  such as U S  cable operator Comcast Corp s  O CMCSA  proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable in 2014  which was later called off after regulatory pushback  When U S  TV station owner Sinclair Broadcast Group  O SBGI  announced its acquisition of peer  Tribune Media Co   N TRCO  in May  it said it might sell certain stations to comply with regulators  Companies often also choose to place caps in their merger agreements on the size of divestitures they would be willing to accept in their negotiations with regulators  T Mobile and Sprint have not yet agreed to include such a cap in their merger agreement  though it is possible they will do so  one of the sources said  SPECTRUM HOLDINGS UBS research analyst John Hodulik said in a research note earlier this month that the U S  Federal Communications Commission will likely force T Mobile and Sprint to make some divestitures of spectrum  since the combined company would have the most airwaves in its sector with more than 300 MHz  putting it ahead of Verizon s and AT T s holdings   T Mobile spent  8 billion in a government auction of airwaves earlier this year  Sprint stayed out of the auction  touting its holdings of high band spectrum  which it says can move large volumes of information at high speeds   Having access to a lot of spectrum is particularly important for the 5G wireless offerings that AT T and Verizon hope to launch to better compete with high speed Internet services from cable companies  T Mobile and Sprint believe that the U S  antitrust enforcement environment has become more favorable since the companies abandoned their previous effort to combine in 2014 amid regulatory concerns  according to the sources   The two companies have not yet introduced a breakup fee in their merger negotiations that would compensate one side if regulators reject the deal  though it is possible one will be agreed to by the time the deal is signed  the sources said  Investors have been waiting for the deal to be announced since Reuters first reported last month that T Mobile and Sprint were close to agreeing tentative merger terms  Sprint shareholders are expected to receive little to no premium in the deal  meaning that Japan s SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984   which controls Sprint  and other Sprint shareholders will own around or more than 40 percent of the combined company  T Mobile majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn  and the rest of the T Mobile shareholders will own the remainder   
It is still possible that the negotiations between T Mobile and Sprint will conclude without a deal  the sources have cautioned ",2017-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-tmobile-sprint-aim-to-announce-merger-without-asset-divestitures--sources-541695,541695

141547,363062,HUM,White House says Trump opposes Senate s bipartisan Obamacare deal,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON  Reuters    A bipartisan deal from two senators to stabilize Obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers suffered major setbacks on Wednesday with the White House saying President Donald Trump now opposes it and senior Republicans speaking out against it  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  Senate Republican leadership member John Thune and others expressed hostility to the deal announced on Tuesday by Republican Lamar Alexander and Democrat Patty Murray  It was uncertain if it would ever come to a vote in a Congress controlled by Trump s fellow Republicans  The agreement would shore up Obamacare by reviving billions of dollars of federal subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower income Americans obtain medical coverage  Alexander said on Wednesday that Trump had  completely engineered  the bipartisan proposal  but the president backed away from support he had expressed a day earlier  On Tuesday  Trump said the White House was involved in the negotiations and that the agreement was  a very good solution  for a short term approach  but said on Wednesday he could  never support bailing out  insurance companies  Trump has cut off subsidies to the companies  saying Congress has not provided money for them and that they enrich insurers  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump did not support the deal in its current form  although she called it  a good step in the right direction    Look  we ve said all along that we want something that doesn t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans   she said at a briefing   And this bill doesn t address that fact   BILL S FATE AN  OPEN QUESTION  The confusion among lawmakers in both parties over Trump s position on the healthcare deal and the lack of trust some of them have in the president come as Congress is entering a crucial period when important bills on federal spending  the U S  debt limit and tax cuts are due for consideration  Thune said the agreement might have  stalled out  and that its future was an  open question   Republicans have a 52 48 Senate majority  but other than Alexander only a few have publicly embraced the plan  including Senators John McCain  Susan Collins  Lisa Murkowski  Mike Rounds and Bob Corker   No way to pay for it   Hatch said   Oh my gosh  give me a break  I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right  But it doesn t help   Trump  who campaigned on a promise to get rid of Obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to do so  also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law   Lamar Alexander s working on it very hard from our side  And if something can happen  that s fine   Trump told reporters at the White House   But I won t do anything to enrich the insurance companies      They ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody s ever seen before   Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act  former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature legislative achievement dubbed Obamacare  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people  Ending the subsidies  which are called cost sharing reduction payments  could create chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare  Some leading insurers  including UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH    Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  and  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   have largely exited those markets  citing financial losses  Others including Anthem Inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state based markets  Ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the Alexander Murray agreement   The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare   Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said   HOW HIGH   The proposal drew broad Democratic support  Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer ripped Trump for his shifting stances on the Alexander Murray deal   This president cannot govern if  whenever the hard right frightens him and says   Jump   he says   How high    Schumer told reporters   The president is pointing fingers   Schumer said   He blames  Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell for obstruction  He blames the Democrats for obstruction  He s the obstructionist in chief because he cannot stick to a position   The proposal would meet some Democratic objectives  such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring  106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans  In exchange  Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in California to direct the administration by Thursday to continue the payments  Murray  speaking to Reuters on Wednesday  said her agreement with Alexander was still very much alive  
 Absolutely   Murray said   Lamar and I are working to have a good set of co sponsors   and hope to formally introduce it as a Senate bill on Thursday ",2017-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senate-backers-of-deal-to-stabilize-obamacare-seek-to-build-support-543315,543315
141548,363063,HUM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  McDonald s  Enterprise Products Partners  Charles Schwab  BB T And Humana,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   April 12  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Enterprise Products Partners   NYSE EPD    Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW    BB T Corp   NYSE BBT   and Humana   NYSE HUM   
Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
Top Research Reports for McDonald s  Enterprise Products   Charles Schwab
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including McDonald s  Enterprise Products Partners and Charles Schwab  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
McDonald s shares have gained  17 1  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained  19 4  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks high labor costs and currency headwinds remain major concerns 
Moreover  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  McDonald s margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases 
However  McDonald s impressive earnings surprise history  various sales and digital initiatives  as well as positive comparable sales  bode well  In fact  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 14 quarters 
Furthermore  increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance  These apart  efforts to drive growth in International Lead   High Growth Markets bode well 
Shares of Buy ranked Enterprise Products have gained  6 9  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Oil Production Pipeline MLP industry s increase of  5 4   The Zacks analyst likes Enterprise Products  extensive network of pipelines that is spread across nearly 50 000 miles 
Importantly  the pipeline network  which is connected to every major U S  shale play  provides services to producers and users of commodities by transporting gas  liquids  and refined products  At present  Enterprise s  5 1 billion pipeline of fee oriented midstream projects positions it to enjoy above average growth in distributable cash flow over the next two years  in turn expanding its distribution coverage ratio 
Most importantly  its ethane export facilities in the Gulf Coast  which link domestic producers to the overseas market  should drive further growth as the use of ethane is rapidly increasing to manufacture plastic instead of naphtha  As such  the partnership holds tremendous upside potential 
Schwabshares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past year  declining  14 5  vs   19 4   The Zacks analyst likes Schwab s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s first quarter 2019 earnings release 
The company remains well positioned to gain from the higher interest rates and its initiatives to strengthen trading income  Also  the company s efforts to improve operating efficiency will go a long way to support profitability  Its efficient capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position 
However  continuously rising operating expenses are likely to hurt bottom line growth to an extent  Moreover  the company s significant dependence on fee based revenues remains a major concern as it might hamper financials

141549,363064,HUM,Why Humana  HUM  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Humana  HUM   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 75  
For the most recent quarter  Humana was expected to post earnings of  2 53 per share  but it reported  2 65 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 74   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 29 per share  while it actually produced  4 58 per share  a surprise of 6 76  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Humana  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Humana has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-humana-hum-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200407343,200407343

141577,363092,HUM,Senator McCain opposes Obamacare repeal bill  a possible fatal blow,news,"By Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Senator John McCain said on Friday he opposes the latest Republican bill to dismantle Obamacare  dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party s slim Senate majority  With several other Republicans still undecided on the measure  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote next week  though he did not promise to do so  A vote would set the stage for another dramatic Capitol Hill decision on the 2010 law that brought health insurance to millions of Americans and became former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature domestic achievement  For seven years  Republicans have hammered Obamacare as an unwarranted government intrusion into American healthcare  President Donald Trump made repealing Obamacare one of his top campaign promises in 2016  Democrats have fiercely defended it  The announcement by McCain  a Republican who has often been at odds with Trump and who cast a crucial  no  vote in July that helped defeat an earlier Republican repeal bill  had the potential to up end McConnell s plans  McConnell s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment  At a rally in Alabama  Trump said McCain s decision was  totally unexpected  terrible   Despite the setback  Trump said   We still have a chance  We re going to do it eventually   Republicans have only a narrow Senate majority and cannot afford to lose many votes on the bill  They are also on a tight timetable  McConnell has been trying to schedule a vote on the bill by Sept  30  the last day on which the bill could pass with only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate  A vote taken any later than that would have to garner at least 60 votes for passage  Weeks after the humiliating defeat in July  when the Obamacare repeal fight seemed to be over  the current bill was introduced by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham  a close friend of McCain s  and seemed to gain momentum  MCCAIN SAYS DETAILS ON IMPACT NEEDED But McCain on Friday laid out his opposition in a statement   I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham Cassidy proposal   He said he took no pleasure in announcing his opposition and noted that the bill s authors  are my dear friends   McCain complained about the rushed process Republicans used to push the bill forward  He said he would consider supporting a bill like it if it had emerged from extensive hearings  debate and amendment   But that has not been the case   he said   McCain  who cast his  no  vote in July just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer  said he could not support the bill without knowing how much it would cost  how it would affect insurance premiums and  how many people will be helped or hurt by it   information that will not be available until the non partisan Congressional Budget Office provides a full assessment at the end of September  The Graham Cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled  as well as subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance  and divvy it up to the states in block grants  Advocates say that would give states more discretion to manage their own healthcare schemes  Although the CBO has not yet fully assessed the bill s effects  independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money  generally with Republican leaning states benefiting and Democratic leaning states losing  largely because a majority of the states that opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare were Democratic leaning  A Washington Post ABC News opinion poll said Americans prefer Obamacare to the Graham Cassidy alternative by 56 percent to 33 percent  Graham said in a statement he was not giving up   We press on   he said  Shares of health insurers turned up after McCain announced his oppositions  Centene ended 1 6 percent higher while Humana  NYSE HUM  closed up 0 2 percent  reversing earlier losses   WINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG STATES  State by state impacts from Graham Cassidy would vary  the Axios news website reported on Friday  citing a study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   the unit of the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees Medicaid and the Obamacare program  The CMS study found that by 2026  Alaska would lose 38 percent of its federal funding for insurance subsidies and Medicaid  Arizona would lose 9 percent  Maine would gain 44 percent  Ohio would lose 18 percent  and West Virginia would lose 23 percent  Axios reported  These states are home to Republican senators who are under pressure on healthcare  Both of Alaska s Republican senators  Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan  are still on the fence over Graham Cassidy  The CMS had no immediate comment on the Axios report  Besides McCain  Kentucky s Rand Paul is the only other Republican senator who has publicly said he opposes the bill  Maine s Susan Collins said she was leaning against the bill  the Portland Press Herald newspaper reported on Friday  Kansas  Jerry Moran is also undecided  No Democrats support the bill  To pass Graham Cassidy  the Republicans need at least 50 votes in the 100 seat Senate  which they control 52 48  with Vice President Mike Pence casting a potential tie breaking vote  The insurance industry  hospitals  medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association  American Heart Association and American Cancer Society  the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill  
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  a liberal think tank in Washington  estimated the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance ",2017-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/senates-mccain-opposes-obamacare-repeal-bill-532004,532004

141614,363129,HUM,Is Humana  HUM  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
Humana  HUM  is a stock many investors are watching right now  HUM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 16 98  while its industry has an average P E of 17 24  Over the past 52 weeks  HUM s Forward P E has been as high as 22 59 and as low as 15 66  with a median of 19 42 
We also note that HUM holds a PEG ratio of 1 16  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  HUM s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 27  Over the past 52 weeks  HUM s PEG has been as high as 1 81 and as low as 1 07  with a median of 1 41 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Humana s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that HUM is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-humana-hum-stock-undervalued-right-now-200380020,200380020
141615,363130,HUM,Humana  HUM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Humana  HUM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 8  
Revenues are expected to be  13 92 billion  up 5 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 19  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Humana 
For Humana  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Humana will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Humana would post earnings of  4 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 58  delivering a surprise of  6 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Humana doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/humana-hum-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381231,200381231
141616,363131,HUM,BioTelemetry  BEAT  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of BioTelemetry  BEAT   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 26 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  77 58 in the previous session  BioTelemetry has gained 28 1  since the start of the year compared to the 5 9  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 15 8  return for the Zacks Medical Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 30  2018  BioTelemetry reported EPS of  0 53 versus consensus estimate of  0 32 
For the current fiscal year  BioTelemetry is expected to post earnings of  1 78 per share on  398 9 million in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 98 per share on  439 18 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  1 38  and 10 1   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
BioTelemetry may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
BioTelemetry has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 43X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 40 9X versus its peer group s average of 19 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 4 3  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  BioTelemetry currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if BioTelemetry passes the test  Thus  it seems as though BioTelemetry shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does BioTelemetry Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of BioTelemetry have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including UnitedHealth Group  UNH   Anthem  NYSE ANTM   and Humana  HUM   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BioTelemetry  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotelemetry-beat-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200383687,200383687
141617,363132,HUM,Humana  HUM  Tops Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Humana  HUM  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 65 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 53 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 06 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 74   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  4 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 58  delivering a surprise of 6 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Humana  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  14 17 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 76   This compares to year ago revenues of  13 19 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Humana shares have added about 5 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 2  
What s Next for Humana 
While Humana has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Humana was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  4 13 on  15 42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  17 56 on  61 61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

141646,363161,HUM,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Humana  HUM ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Humana  NYSE HUM  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this health insurer is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Humana is 14 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 21 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 13 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Humana has an S TA ratio of 1 83  which means that the company gets  1 83 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 61  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Humana looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 8 2  this year versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Humana  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Humana has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Humana is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-humana-hum-200376089,200376089

141674,363189,HUM,Can Humana  HUM  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Humana  HUM   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 5 62   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Humana was expected to post earnings of  4 29 per share  but it reported  4 58 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 76   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 79 per share  while it actually produced  3 96 per share  a surprise of 4 49  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Humana lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Humana currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 22   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 6  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-humana-hum-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200373355,200373355

141703,363218,HUM,4 HMOs Likely To Cruise Ahead Of Industry In 2019 ,opinion,"With an estimated 85 million people representing more than  1 trillion in annual health care spending still not served through managed care in the United States alone  players in the HMO industry are well positioned for continued growth  New markets continue to emerge around areas like social determinants  specialty and supplemental coverage  and global opportunities which should create business opportunities in 2019 and beyond Recently  a federal court judge in the state of Texas declared the Individual Mandate clause in the Affordable Care Act  ACA or Obamacare  unconstitutional  thus challenging the constitutionality of the ACA overall  This decision  which is being repealed by more than a dozen states  will cast uncertainty over the viability of the ACA   The ACA  which was enacted in 2010  led to a decline in the uninsured population thus aiding the earnings of the HMO players  Repealing or holding the Individual mandate unconstitutional will be like breaking the backbone of the ACA  This might lead to an increase in uninsured population and soaring of health insurance premiums Nevertheless  the recent ruling by the federal judge is not very disappointing since this is the initial step of a likely lengthy appeals process  One of the health insurers  Molina Healthcare said  regardless  the ACA will remain in effect for 2019  and we are optimistic that it will remain in effect thereafter Brokerage Evercore ISI said it expected no immediate impact from the ruling  calling it only a declaratory judgment and not an injunction Keeping this in mind  let s see the likely factors affecting the industry in 2019 In 2019 and beyond  players should see potential for sustained growth across the markets  particularly in expanding government programs   With more baby boomers reaching retirement age  the number of people eligible for Medicare is projected to reach 72 million by 2025  up from about 63 million at present  with gross spending for Medicare expected to surpass  1 2 trillion by 2025  up from more than  800 billion projected for 2019  Medicare Advantage continues to be a popular choice  now serving more than one third of those enrolled in Medicare  Players like UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH   Anthem and Humana are positioned for strong growth as the Medicare Advantage market continues to expand and evolve Another government business  Medicaid should continue to grow as states continue to expand coverage and as traditional fee for service offerings move to managed care  Medicaid players in the industry should witness continued intense competition in Request for Proposals  RFP  in 2019 and beyond  The dependence of states on innovation and fiscal discipline of managed care has resulted in increased RFP activity  as states are vying options to provide health care coverage to as many people as possible in effective ways Business combinations will continue to be one of the many ways that players should improve their capacities to serve more people in more geographies as well as continue to diversify business and achieve scale and service efficiencies The Health Insurer Tax  HIT  deferral combined with CMS rates for 2019 resulted in meaningful benefit investments from most managed care organizations  This should lead to Medicare Advantage expasion in 2019 Players in the HMO industry expect utilization of services to increase at a consistent rate in 2019  They should continue to mitigate medical cost increases with their medical management strategies  further adoption of value based reimbursement and advancements in consumer decision making due to their use of market leading engagement tools Other than these  investment in technological investment and upgrade  application of blockchain technology  growth of new business units  international expansion  better claims handling  medical cost management  mergers and acquisitions  and healthy balance sheets should fuel overall growth of the industry The stabilization of health insurance exchanges is another positive  Administrative actions  such as encouraging people to maintain continuous coverage and attracting younger and healthier people to join the market  taken last year by the CMS  have paid off as the some of the players that exited the health insurance exchanges in many markets in 2016 and 2017 have now returned to markets  Some of the returning companies are Anthem  Wellmark  Molina and Cigna The  industry has gained 19 41  year to date compared with the Zacks S P 500 Composite decline of 2 7   The HMO industry is slated for another good ride in 2019 and therefore picking some good stocks from this space should be a good investment move  Each of these stocks has witnessed an upward revision in earnings estimates for 2019 and carries a strong Zacks Rank Our PicksAnthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   operates as a health benefits company in the United States  The company should see top line growth from an increase in enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans  A strong balance sheet with positive cash flows should help it to invest in growth The company currently has a Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score of A  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings has moved up by 2 9  in the last 60 days  Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   should gain from its growing Medicare

141742,363257,HUM,Humana To Gain From Share Buyback  Raise Membership Outlook,opinion,"Shares of Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   have gained by more than 6  in yesterday s trading  after the company announced an accelerated share buyback program and revised 2019 Medicare Advantage  MA  membership outlook  The company also reaffirmed its 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of  14 40 
Humana plans to repurchase its common stock worth  750 million through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement  the  ASR Agreement   as part of the  3 0 billion share repurchase program  announced by the company on Dec 14  2017 The ASR Agreement is consistent with the company s previously anticipated capital deployment plans for the remainder of 2018 and 2019  This should aid the bottom line The company increased its membership growth outlook for Individual MA in 2019 from 350 000 to 400 000 members  This represents an increase of 100 000 members from its initial estimate  and 11  to 13  increase from the expected year ended Dec 31  2018 membership level of approximately 3 07 million members The upward revision was driven by better than expected retention of existing members during the Annual Enrollment Period  AEP  and higher than expected sales For Group MA  net membership gains for 2019 are expected to increase approximately 30 000 members year over year 
However  for Prescription Part D  PDP   the company now estimates a net membership decline of 750 000 to 800 000 members for the year ended Dec 31  2019  compared to its initial estimate of a decline of approximately 500 000 members  The net decline is primarily attributable to the competitive nature of the industry and the erosion of the pricing discipline enjoyed by the company so far 
Humana generates more than 50  of its premiums from MA and an increase in membership in these lines of business definitely bodes well for the company  Moreover  a favorable MA reimbursement is another tailwind 
Year to date  stock of the company has gained 33  compared with the  s growth of 26  

 
Earlier during the week  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   also provided strong guidance for 2019  The health insurance industry has performed very well this year and is slated for further growth from expected Medicaid expansion  increase in Medicare Advantage and overall improvement of regulatory climate

141743,363258,HUM,HMO Industry Surges Almost 4 Times S P 500  4 Picks,opinion,"The Health Maintenance Organization  HMO  industry has been one of the solid gainers so far this year  despite the stiff regulations binding it  Interest rate hike and trade war disturbances  which caused far and wide fluctuation to returns of many industries like utilities  banks  automobiles  manufacturing  have little or almost no effect on this industry of the health care sector The S P 500 Managed Health Care Index has gained 23 7  in a year s time compared with the 6 12  rise in the S P 500 Index The ruling factors of the HMO industry are the many state and federal regulations that monitor their working and affect their business performance  The most stringent regulatory reform was the Affordable Care Act that was enacted in 2010  But insurers have synced their operations in line with the regulatory mandates  which are now paying off The year also saw many trials by the Trump administration to repeal the ACA  which however  failed to take place  The changes  if would have taken place  would have led insurers to again adapt to new regulations  thus subjecting them to again redo some parts of their business workings But mid term elections  which saw the change in Republican control in the house of representatives  have now further pushed backed or almost put off the table any changes that would be made to the ACA in the near term  This implies that the existing regulations would continue and health insurers will not have to commit resources to fine tune their operations at least for now An increase in employment has also induced demand for health insurance from employers for their employees  aiding revenue growth for the health insurance companies  Also  changes in demography with baby boomers retiring in hordes each day  have driven up demand for Medicare plans of the HMOs Moreover  business growing outside the health insurance realm has diversified earnings of the players in the industry  The poster child of the same is the development of the Optum unit of UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH   which has contributed to an increasing proportion of revenues to its consolidated revenues and falls outside the regulations that bind the business of health insurance  Other companies such as Humana and Anthem have also been consistently growing their health service business Zacks

with the easing out of regulatory uncertainty  investment in technological investment and upgrade  application of blockchain technology  growth of new business units  international expansion  better claims handling  medical cost management  mergers and acquisitions and healthy balance sheets Also  the midterm elections  which saw the passage of ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid under the ACA  are a positive for the industry  This bodes well for HMOs as increasing member enrollment in Medicaid should aid their top line The stabilization of health insurance exchanges is also favorable  Administrative actions  such as encouraging people to maintain continuous coverage and attracting younger and healthier people to join the market  taken last year by the CMS  have paid off as some of

141767,363282,HUM,Anthem and Blue Crosses loom large in Obamacare talks,news,"By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    Anthem Inc   N ANTM  and other U S  health insurers complained to the White House for more than a year that they were losing money on people who waited to sign up for Obamacare coverage until they were sick  They pleaded with the Obama administration to stem their losses by tightening up on the enrolment rules  When their pleas went unmet  UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH    Humana Inc   N HUM   and  Aetna Inc   N AET  pulled out of most of the government subsidized health insurance market  But now that the new Trump administration and Republican lawmakers control the future of healthcare  the industry is getting a new hearing  And Anthem   the last national insurer playing big in the Obamacare market   is the loudest industry voice in meetings with policymakers who all have pledged to overthrow former President Barack Obama s signature law  President Donald Trump  who has said Obamacare coverage is too costly for customers and taxpayers  is set to meet with insurance industry executives today  Since the election  lobbyists for Anthem and affiliated Blue Cross insurers have met  24 7   with Republicans leading the change effort  including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  according to one healthcare industry lobbyist  They are there  every time Senators and staffers are on the Hill   the lobbyist said  Another industry source who attended some of the meetings said lawmakers and aides were keen on hearing what the insurers needed to stay in the market  That clout may explain Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish s optimism in comments to investors earlier this month that policymakers would introduce new enrollment rules limiting when people can opt into coverage   We do have some positive indicators that stabilization could very likely occur   Swedish said   I am again hopeful that our recommendations will be looked at very carefully and adopted   A day later  the Trump administration took its first concrete stab at Obama s Affordable Care Act  proposing regulations that would shorten the enrollment period  establish a new eligibility verification process and force members to pay delinquent premiums if they want to return to the same insurer  The so called stabilization proposal addressed many of the industry s top demands for shoring up the individual market and came after Anthem said it was considering whether it would remain in 2018  Anthem is the largest insurer among the Blues  a collection of companies that share a governing board  a brand and networks  As a group  they cover the vast majority of people covered by Obamacare  That means they have the most at stake and a lot of influence in shaping the future of an insurance market that covers more than 10 million people  according to people close to the negotiations   Blue Cross Blue Shield does have a larger role in discussing changes   said an aide to a key Republican Senator  TRUMP S 3  R s  REPEAL  REPLACE  REPAIR Trump has said he wants to jettison the 2010 law that created Obamacare and replace it with legislation that would change access to individual insurance and the Medicaid program for the poor  A copy of the administration s Feb  10 working draft leaked out Friday  But it was not clear whether there was enough support for all of the measures or how it would evolve  Any major changes aren t likely to affect consumers before 2019  In the meantime  Republican lawmakers are hammering out tweaks to Obamacare they view necessary to preventing any more insurers from exiting  They are looking at ways to limit monthly premium increases  For 2017  the average premium went up 25 percent in these Obamacare plans  which incensed many consumers  Anthem and other Blue Cross plans dominated the individual market before Obamacare coverage took effect in 2014  Obamacare remade that market and sought to stimulate competition by financing the start up of about two dozen smaller insurance co ops  The Obama administration also courted big players  such as Aetna and UnitedHealth  by forecasting rapid enrolment growth to more than 20 million people  which failed to materialize  Anthem operates the BCBS license in 14 states and insures more than 800 000 people in the Obamacare exchanges   the single biggest portion  It said it was making a slight profit on that business  Its rivals exited after losing hundreds of millions of dollars last year  Wall Street analysts said Anthem was better at pricing and benefited from a well known brand  Its huge pool of members also helps Anthem drive good deals with doctors and hospitals  Still  Anthem s business is mostly in the employer based market  Obamacare customers comprised only about 4 percent of its members at the end of 2016  Ethan Lovell  co portfolio manager at the Janus Global Life Sciences fund that owns Anthem shares  said without changes to the exchange rules  the company would likely have to raise the average premium 20 percent in 2018  as it did for this year  to keep from losing money  In addition to the enrolment rules  Anthem is seeking changes in the way payments for the sickest patients are calculated  It also wants an extension to the planned discontinuation at year s end of plans that were issued before Obamacare and that don t meet the law s coverage requirements  Ed Haislmaier  senior health policy research fellow at The Heritage Foundation  helped draft the proposed stabilization rule Trump announced Feb  2  He said he expected the Trump administration to also address Anthem s older plans  Swedish also wants the elimination of one of Obamacare s most controversial revenue sources   an industry wide premium tax that insurers say has driven up premiums in all private U S  health insurance and that lawmakers agreed last year to set aside for a year

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 76   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  3 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 96  delivering a surprise of 4 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Humana  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  14 21 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 73   This compares to year ago revenues of  13 28 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Humana shares have added about 33 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 1  
What s Next for Humana 
While Humana has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Humana was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 58 on  13 88 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 18 on  56 37 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

141813,363328,HUM,Trump administration proposes stricter Obamacare rules,news,"By Caroline Humer and Yasmeen Abutaleb
NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed changes to the Obamacare individual insurance market that insurers welcomed as a good start but that raised the possibility of higher out of pocket cost for consumers 
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have promised to scrap the 2010 healthcare law that is a key legacy of Democrat Barack Obama s presidency  But they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law  which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans 
The proposed new rule  issued by a division of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  sets out changes that are meant to shore up the system developed by Obama  and comes after  Humana Inc   N HUM  on Tuesday said it would pull out of this market in 2018  It is unclear which elements of Obamacare could survive in the Republicans  replacement 
The rule does not address changes that must be made by law  such as for Obamacare s income based subsidies 
The changes would tighten enrollment processes and allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments  making it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans  Insurers say  gaming the system  has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers 
The Affordable Care Act aimed to chip away at soaring healthcare spending  but data shows costs are still rising  The U S  government reported separately on Wednesday that total U S  medical spending in 2017 is estimated to rise 5 4 percent to  3 36 trillion after a 4 8 percent spending uptick in 2016 
The administration on Wednesday also backed off implementing tougher oversight of the individual mandate  the requirement for all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine  that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes 
The U S  Internal Revenue Service said as a result of Trump s executive order to reduce regulatory burden  it will not reject tax filings for the year 2016 that fail to indicate whether they had health coverage or paid the penalty set under Obamacare  This is a return to the policy for 2015 taxes  the IRS said 
The mandate was supposed to bring in healthy customers but Republicans have vowed to overturn it and insurers say it has not worked 
Aetna  N AET  CEO Mark Bertolini on Wednesday said during a Wall Street Journal forum that the Obamacare exchanges had entered a  death spiral  in which rising premiums pushed out the healthiest customers  which in turn raises rates 
Aetna cut back offering new plans for 2017 and it and Anthem Inc   N ANTM  have said that without changes  they might not take part after this year 
Bertolini said in a statement that new Health Secretary Tom Price and the Trump administration have  taken some good initial steps with the proposed regulation   The top two industry groups  America s Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  echoed that view 
Shares of insurers were mixed in the early afternoon on Wednesday with Aetna gaining 1 percent to  127 01  Cigna  NYSE CI  off less than 1 percent at  146 07 and Humana off 0 3 percent to  205 34  Anthem fell less than 1 percent to  162 90 
TOUGHER TO ENROLL
The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  which are part of the Department of Health and Human Services  on Wednesday proposed the new rule that includes verifying the status of enrollees outside of the usual enrollment period 
It also proposes insurers can collect unpaid premiums from members when they sign up with the same issuer again  an incentive for people to always have insurance 
In addition  it proposed lowering the amount of guaranteed coverage for some  silver  level plans in the program  which it said could raise out of pocket spending and cut premiums 
It would give the states oversight of doctor and hospital networks included in the plans  reflecting a Republican theme that healthcare oversight be reduced at the federal level 
The rule proposes shortening the open enrollment period for the individual market to Nov  1 through Dec  15  similar to employer sponsored insurance market and Medicare 
The weakening of the mandate and the new CMS rule making it tougher for people to sign up would have contradictory effects on premium pricing  according to Jonathan Gruber  professor of economics at MIT and one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act 
 You re basically saying on the one hand  we have to weaken the mandate for political reasons but we have to lower prices  so we have to kick people out of the exchanges   Gruber said 
Patient advocate Families USA said the new rules would discourage younger  healthier people from enrolling  reduce financial assistance for families and make it harder for them to find networks that include their doctors 
Republican lawmakers  who are working on an Obamacare replacement  said the rule was a start 
 If we don t take more steps like that  having an Obamacare subsidy will be like having a bus ticket in a town where no buses run  because there will be zero choices to buy   Senator Lamar Alexander  chairman of the Senate health committee  told reporters outside the Senate 
Wall Street said the proposed changes could help insurer profitability but it was not clear by how much 

 As one would expect tightening special enrollment periods  shortening the open enrollment period to six weeks and mandating payment of premiums before coverage should lead to an improvement in the risk pool   Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said ",2017-02-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-administration-proposes-stricter-obamacare-rules-460136,460136

141820,363335,HUM,Triple S Management  GTS  Soared To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Triple S Management   NYSE GTS    Shares have been on the move  with the stock up 14 7  over the past month  GTS hit a new 52 week high of  41 92 in the previous session  Triple S Management has gained 67 9  since the start of the year compared to the 2 3  move for the Medical sector and the 13 7  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 8  2018  Triple S Management reported EPS of  0 60 vs  the Zacks Consensus of  0 24  while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4 93  
For the current fiscal year  Triple S Management is expected to post earnings of  1 90 per share on  3 04 billion in revenues  This represents a 0 53  change in EPS on a 4 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 20 per share on  3 17 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 15 79  and 4 27   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Triple S Management may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for GTS  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Triple S Management has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 5X versus its peer group s average of 15 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 2  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Triple S Management currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Triple S Management fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though GTS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Triple S Management Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Triple S Management have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including WellCare Health Plans   NYSE WCG    Anthem   NYSE ANTM    and Humana   NYSE HUM    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Medical HMOs industry is in the top 24  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GTS  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/triples-management-gts-soared-to-a-52weekhigh-time-to-cash-out-200326880,200326880

141852,363367,HUM,U S  blocks health insurer Aetna s  34 billion Humana acquisition,news,"By Diane Bartz  Reuters    A U S  judge blocked on Monday health insurer Aetna  NYSE AET  Inc s proposed  34 billion acquisition of smaller peer  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   raising the stakes for rival Anthem Inc as it battles to close a  54 billion deal to buy  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   The ruling is another victory for the U S  Justice Department  whose antitrust enforcement became much more aggressive during former U S  President Barack Obama s eight years in office  which ended last week   Obama s successor  Donald Trump  and a Republican controlled legislature are seeking to undo much of the Affordable Care Act  better known as Obamacare  The law reshaped the U S  healthcare industry by mandating health insurance and creating online exchanges where consumers can shop for individual policies and get subsidies  Aetna  Humana  Anthem and Cigna had cited Obamacare as one of the main reasons their industry needed to consolidate to cope with the costs of expanding coverage  Their shares ended trading on Monday at levels that suggested that investors continued to see little chance that the two mergers would happen   The U S  Justice Department filed a lawsuit last July to block Aetna s acquisition of Humana and Anthem s acquisition of Cigna  arguing that the two deals would lead to higher prices   Anthem and Cigna are still waiting for a judge to rule on whether their merger can proceed  Investors have long been skeptical that this deal can be approved  and Leerink Research analyst Ana Gupte reiterated on Monday that she expected to also see this deal blocked  In his ruling  Judge John Bates of the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia said the proposed deal would  substantially lessen competition  in the sale of Medicare Advantage plans in 364 counties in 21 states that the Justice Department had identified in its complaint  and on the Obamacare exchange in three Florida counties    We re reviewing the opinion now and giving serious consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case   Aetna spokesman T J  Crawford said  Humana did not respond to a request for comment  Humana stands to receive a  1 billion breakup fee from Aetna should the deal be abandoned  Jeffrey Jacobovitz  a litigator at law firm Arnall Golden Gregory LLP  said that appeals at the D C  Circuit succeed about one third of the time and can take a year to resolve  He added that it would be difficult  though not impossible  for Aetna to wait for Trump s new antitrust enforcers to be named and then strike a settlement to save the merger  perhaps by offering to divest more assets  Bates dismissed Aetna s argument that there was plenty of choice for consumers because Medicare Advantage  which is managed by insurance companies  competes with traditional Medicare for the elderly and disabled  which is managed by the government   In that  Medicare Advantage  market  which is the primary focus of this case  the merger is presumptively unlawful   a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head to head competition as well  The companies  rebuttal arguments are not persuasive   Bates wrote in a 158 page decision  Humana shares ended trading up 2 2 percent at  205 02  as investors brushed off the widely expected ruling  Shares of Cigna  the other health insurer to be acquired  were almost flat at  145 31 SEVERAL DEALS TORPEDOED Several big deals were torpedoed by antitrust regulators last year  including the  35 billion merger between oil field service groups Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co and Baker Hughes Inc and the  6 billion combination of  Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS  and Office Depot Inc    Bill Baer  the former head of the Justice Department s antitrust division who initiated the lawsuit to block the Aetna Humana deal  called the decision  a strong affirmation of the role that competition plays in health insurance markets   Doctors and hospitals had urged the Justice Department to block the deal  fearing it would erode their pricing power  Some large employers also opposed the combination    Today s ruling is a decisive victory for jobs  consumers  and healthcare  Mega mergers like the proposed consolidation of Aetna and Humana raise prices  lower health care quality   and kill jobs   said Senator Richard Blumenthal  a Connecticut Democrat   Aetna had offered to sell a portfolio of about 290 000 Medicare Advantage members in 21 states to smaller peer Molina Healthcare Inc for  117 million  but that deal failed to appease Judge Bates   We are disappointed by the court s ruling today  However  whatever the ultimate outcome of that litigation  we remain committed to growing our Medicare Advantage product line   Molina spokeswoman Sunny Yu said  Humana is the second largest Medicare Advantage insurer while Aetna is the fourth  and the two compete in more than 600 counties  the government said in its complaint  Despite the adverse regulatory environment  some analysts suggested that an acquisition of Humana by someone other than Aetna was possible

141925,363440,HUM,Aetna warned it would cut Obamacare if Humana deal was blocked,news,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK  Reuters     Aetna Inc  s  N AET  top executive said in a letter to the U S  Department of Justice during the review of its deal to buy rival  Humana Inc   N HUM  that the insurer would exit much of the individual Obamacare insurance market if the agency challenged the merger 
News of the letter came after Aetna said on Monday that it would pull out of selling individual insurance on the government run websites in 11 states  citing financial losses on the business 
In the July 5 letter  Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said it would be some time before the company recouped the investment it had made over the past 2 1 2 years in the government subsidized insurance plans created under President Barack Obama s national healthcare reform law 
 Our ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the Humana acquisition   Bertolini wrote  according to a copy of the letter posted on the Huffington Post website  which obtained the document though the Freedom of Information Act 
 Unfortunately  a challenge by the DOJ to that acquisition and or the DOJ successfully blocking the transaction would have a negative financial impact on Aetna and would impair Aetna s ability to continue its support   he wrote 
UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  and Humana Inc  N HUM  have cited similar concerns about financial losses on the Obamacare exchanges and have also cut back most of their plans for 2017 
The Justice Department moved on July 21 to block Aetna s acquisition of Humana and Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  purchase of  Cigna Corp   N CI   saying the two deals would lead to higher prices 
Bertolini s letter followed Assistant Attorney General William Baer s request to Aetna on June 30 for information on the consequences of not completing the deal 
A copy of that document shows the Justice Department asked for data on costs such as the breakup fee  the impact on Aetna s business strategy  including participation on the Obamacare exchanges  and documents related to a June board meeting and the Humana deal or the exchanges 
Aetna spokesman TJ Crawford said in an emailed statement that since the company submitted the letter to the Justice Department  it had a better view of the business line s second quarter performance 
 That deterioration  and not the DOJ challenge to our Humana transaction  is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year   Crawford said

141930,363445,HUM,Obama says his departure may fix what ails Obamacare,news,"By Roberta Rampton MIAMI  Reuters    President Barack Obama said on Thursday that his departure from office in January might be what it takes to begin to heal the political scars over Obamacare and allow for needed fixes to his signature healthcare law  The 2010 Affordable Care Act tipped off a long and bitter political and legal battle between the White House and Republicans in the U S  Congress who said the 2010 law creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry  Republicans have been quick to highlight a recent barrage of negative headlines about rising health insurance premiums and shrinking doctor networks for people participating in subsidized insurance plans offered under the law  Obama acknowledged the law is not working perfectly  but said the problems could be fixed by legislation  encouraging lawmakers to create a government run health insurance option to help U S  states where there is little or no competition among private insurers   Maybe now that I m leaving office  maybe Republicans can stop with the 60 something repeal votes they ve taken and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative     and just work with the next president to smooth out the kinks   he said in a speech at Miami Dade College   They can even change the name of the law to Reagancare  or Paul Ryan care   Obama said  evoking the name of the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives   I don t care  I just want it to work   But Ryan  in a written response  said he would continue to seek to repeal and replace the law   At this point  one thing is clear  this law can t be fixed   Ryan said  Obama was later slated to headline a rally in Florida  a battleground election state  for Hillary Clinton  the Democratic candidate in the Nov  8 presidential election  Clinton has said she would add a public option and expand tax incentives for healthcare costs  Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal and replace the law  The government forecasts 13 8 million people will sign up for Obamacare plans in 2017  up 1 1 million from 2016  There are 10 7 million uninsured people who are eligible for the exchanges but have not enrolled  and about 40 percent of those are young  Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Wednesday  Obama said that nationwide  not enough young and healthy people have signed up to provide a revenue stream that offsets the costs of covering members with serious illnesses  As a result  several big insurers  including UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH    Aetna Inc   N AET  and  Humana Inc   N HUM   are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans  citing bigger than expected financial losses  Monthly premium prices have climbed  which further discourages some people from signing up   Next year will tell whether those are growing pains  or they are more serious issues   Drew Altman  chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation  said in an interview  Analysis conducted by the nonpartisan foundation suggests at least 16 million people need to enroll before the online Obamacare insurance marketplaces stabilize  Obama said expanding insurance coverage for millions of people and reforming the healthcare system was a key reason he ran for office  He said he gets letters from Americans every day thanking him for the difference it has made in their lives  The law cut the number of uninsured Americans from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2015  Much of the decline is due to the law s provision allowing states to expand Medicaid health coverage for the poor  The law also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to Americans for existing medical problems  and allowed parents to keep children insured on their health plans until age 26  Some health policy experts on both the political left and right say Congress may be more receptive to bipartisan efforts to fix the Affordable Care Act after Obama leaves office  Some Republican governors who refused to expand Medicaid may also be more willing to do so after the election   a change that would expand coverage for about 4 million people  
 I think the piece of Obamacare that people don t like is Obama   Kathleen Sebelius  Obama s former Health and Human Services secretary  who oversaw the program s launch  said in an interview   This has become a very personal battle about this president  which is I think really unfortunate  ",2016-10-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/obama-to-give-his-diagnosis-for-what-ails-obamacare-433512,433512
141931,363446,HUM,Obama rallies Obamacare troops at  critical time  for program,news,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Barack Obama on Thursday urged more than 25 000 volunteers and advocates who dialed in to a White House conference call to pull out the stops to boost the number of people signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans  Obama warned it will be challenging to overcome the skepticism about the plans given an onslaught of headlines about surging premium prices  but he said the stakes are high   I think we re at a critical time where we have to show that this program works for people  if they just see what their options are   he told the volunteers  who work in their communities to encourage and assist enrollment  Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid programs shop online for subsidized insurance plans starting Nov  1 until the end of January  The average premium for benchmark 2017 plans sold on healthcare gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016  Obama said tax credits will help more than seven in 10 shoppers get a plan for less than  75 per month  but said many may not bother looking because they have heard about spiking costs   We re going to have to clear the bugs off the windshield so people can see the road ahead  and that s where you guys come in   Obama said  The law has been fought by Republicans in Congress  who said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry  Several big insurers  including UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH    Aetna Inc   N AET  and  Humana Inc   N HUM   are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans  citing bigger than expected financial losses  Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Thursday that the earliest his company may return to the marketplaces would be 2019  Obama said more young and healthy people need to sign up for plans  That would offset insurers  costs of covering members with serious illnesses  Obama has said there are a series of improvements that could be made to his signature domestic policy achievement   the 2010 Affordable Care Act   if Congress and the next president  who will take office on Jan  20  can work together  
 Part of what we can do this time is to overcome the skeptics  to prove people wrong  and to provide momentum so that when the next administration comes in  they are starting from a position of strength   Obama told the conference call ",2016-10-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/obama-rallies-obamacare-troops-at-'critical-time'-for-program-435422,435422

141965,363480,HUM,Medicare Advantage grows  but provider choice is limited,news,By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    Medicare enrollees are moving in greater numbers than ever to the program s managed care option as a way to save money  But the tradeoff is much less ability to use their preferred doctors and hospitals  Seniors can choose between traditional fee for service Medicare   which is accepted by most healthcare providers   or a Medicare Advantage plan  The latter encompasses health maintenance organizations  HMOs  or preferred provider organizations  PPOs   which control costs by creating healthcare provider networks that enrollees must use  In theory  prospective Advantage enrollees can review lists of in network providers before opting into a plan  But a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation  KFF  finds that provider data often is very difficult to review  can be out of date and frequently contain inaccurate information  KFF s review also found shortcomings in the quality of providers in some Medicare Advantage provider networks  One out of every five plans did not include a regional academic medical center   institutions which usually offer the highest quality care and top specialists  And only 40 percent of Advantage provider networks included top quality cancer centers  as indicated by membership in the National Cancer Institute s network  NCI designated cancer centers offer cutting edge treatments and tend to have greater access to clinical trials  They are especially important for patients with rare and advanced cancers  or other complicating conditions  said Gretchen Jacobson  KFF s associate director of the program on Medicare policy and co author of the study   The upshot  Medicare Advantage may be just fine if you are healthy  but problems may crop up if your healthcare needs become more complex and you have very specific healthcare provider preferences   This year  31 percent of Medicare enrollees are in Advantage plans  up from 11 percent in 2010  That number is expected to hit 41 percent by 2026  according to a forecast by the Congressional Budget Office  When Medicare enrollees join Medicare Advantage plans  their Part B premiums continue to be paid to Medicare  which then makes a monthly capitated payment to the Advantage plan  The payment is based on the plan s estimated cost per enrollee  the plan s quality rating and the health status of the enrollee  The largest providers are UnitedHealthcare   Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  and Blue Cross Blue Shield  One often hears critics claim that healthcare providers are bailing out of traditional Medicare in large numbers   but that is not actually the case  Last year  14 percent of Medicare enrollees who were seeking a new primary care doctor reported major problems in finding a physician who would treat them  according to survey data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  an independent congressional agency  Among those seeking a new specialist  6 percent reported major problems  In both cases  that represents 1 percent of the total Medicare population   ADVANTAGES  PITFALLS  Advantage plans often offer extra benefits  such as health club memberships  vision care and some limited dental care  Cost sharing is often lower  and many plans provide prescription drug coverage with no extra premium   It can be very attractive to many seniors who are living on a fixed budget   Jacobson said  The trade off is limited provider networks   and the challenges prospective enrollees face in determining who they are allowed to see for healthcare  and who is off limits  KFF reviewed 409 Advantage plans  including 307 HMOs and 102 PPOs  Researchers found provider directories often were riddled with errors  omissions and outdated information   There s no reason in this era of technology why this needs to be as difficult as it is   Jacobson said   People should be able to simply tell the system who their doctors are  the illnesses they have  and get a recommendation for a plan that will work for them   KFF also found that Advantage provider network quality differs significantly  For example  Los Angeles has three NCI designated cancer centers  Most of the Advantage plans there do not include any of them  but one plan includes all three  A report last year by the U S  Government Accountability Office found that the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS   which runs Medicare  needs to improve its oversight of Advantage plans to assure that provider networks are robust  The report also criticized CMS for doing too little to assess the accuracy of Advantage plan provider lists  Even when Advantage enrollees are able to confirm participation by their healthcare providers  there is no guarantee that will continue  Advantage plans are free to add or drop health providers during the course of an enrollment season   That became an especially hot issue in 2014 when UnitedHealthcare dropped providers who covered thousands of the insurer s patients  including the prominent Yale New Haven Hospital system  Democrats in Congress have proposed legislation that would prohibit Advantage plans from dropping providers without cause during the middle of an enrollment year  Under current rules  plans must provide 30 days  notice to enrollees when providers are dropped  Enrollees who lose access to a provider can make a midyear plan change only under very limited circumstances   You can do it only if you are receiving ongoing care from a provider that is terminated   Jacobson said   Otherwise you need to wait until the next open enrollment period   The annual enrollment period for Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans are held from Oct  15 to Dec  7 each year  At that point  a beneficiary could switch to a different Advantage plan  or shift back to traditional Medicare  But a serious diagnosis in January would leave you hamstrung until the following year  Said Jacobson   It can be a roll of the dice    This version of the July 7 story corrects paragraph 8  An earlier version of this column said that the enrollee s Part B premium  goes to the insurance company providing the plan

141967,363482,HUM,U S  government s bid to block insurance mergers could spawn new ones,news,By Carl O Donnell and Caroline Humer  Reuters    The potential bust up of two mega deals among America s largest health insurance companies may have an unintended result   more mergers   The U S  Department of Justice on Thursday sued to block Aetna Inc s  N AET   37 billion purchase of  Humana Inc   N HUM  and Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  proposed  54 billion buyout of  Cigna Corp   N CI   arguing that they would cut competition and boost rates for patients   If no settlement is reached for one or both deals  the fallback strategy for the four insurers to ensure future growth would likely be a familiar one  Another buying spree  this time of smaller insurers less likely to raise the ire of regulators   Unless the market changes drastically  I don t see another major deal going through   said Norman Armstrong  a partner at King and Spalding LLP who focuses on antitrust   But with smaller deals there s more potential to get something done    The most obvious targets are midsized  national players in government healthcare plans such as  Centene  Corp  N CNC    Molina Healthcare Inc   N MOH   or WellCare Health Plans Inc  N WCG   according to analysts and investors  Although acquiring these companies would not produce the big boost to earnings sought by the planned mega mergers  they would offer a foothold in markets likely to grow rapidly in coming years  such as Medicaid health plans for the poor and Medicare Advantage coverage for the elderly   Both Molina and Centene have large exposure to private Medicaid plans  a more than  100 billion market that is benefiting as states outsource more responsibility for the government insurance program to private companies  Molina and WellCare were also said to be interested in Medicare Advantage plans that Aetna sought to divest to win approval for its Humana deal  according to a source familiar with the matter   Anthem has already expressed interest in acquiring Medicare and Medicaid members  In 2014  it purchased Simply Healthcare Holdings  a managed care company for government health insurance in Florida  In the case of Centene  the biggest impediment to a deal is that the company is not likely ready to sell  Centene sees itself as an acquirer  not a target  according to spokeswoman Marcela Manjarrez Hawn  Earlier this year  Centene acquired peer HealthNet for  6 3 billion    We believe it will be difficult for anyone to pay what we will be worth in the next 12 months   she said in a statement  Another option would be Magellan Health Inc  O MGLN   an insurer that focuses on niche types of patients  according to Ana Gupte  an equities analyst at Leerink Partners   Buying Magellan could help insurers build out their capabilities in dealing with specialty products  at a time when high prices for specialty drugs are attracting increasing attention  Gupte said  Aetna  Cigna and Magellan declined to comment  Anthem  Molina  Humana  and WellCare did not immediately respond to requests for comment   Even these smaller deals may not clear antitrust approval   For example  WellCare  with a market capitalization of under  5 billion  may be too much for Humana to swallow  largely because both companies have significant presences in the Medicare Advantage space    The  Justice Department  is on  high alert  right now  so maybe even a smaller deal is harder than in the past   said Gupte   To avoid the most intense regulatory scrutiny  any follow up deals are likely to be delayed until after the U S  presidential and congressional elections in November  when the prospect of big health insurance combinations will be less politically charged  according to a shareholder in Humana who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media  In the interim  Aetna  Humana  Anthem and Cigna may seek to placate investors with share buybacks   Between them  the health insurance companies could buy back more than  14 billion worth of shares  providing an immediate boost to earnings per share to help offset the impact of the lost mergers  Christine Arnold  an analyst at Cowen and Company  wrote in a research note ,2016-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-government's-bid-to-block-insurance-mergers-could-spawn-new-ones-416148,416148
141968,363483,HUM,Walmart Seeks To Buy Humana  Good Idea  Walmart The Godsend  ,opinion,"Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT  is in negotiation with Humana  There is a range of options  including a direct buyout 
The Wall Street Journal reports  

Walmart Inc  is in preliminary talks to buy insurer Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    according to people familiar with the matter  a deal that would mark a dramatic shift for the retail behemoth and the latest in a recent flurry of big deals in health care services 
It isn t clear what terms the companies may be discussing  and there is no guarantee they will strike a deal  If they do  the deal would be big  Humana currently has a market value of about  37 billion 
Should there be a deal and should regulators and shareholders bless it it would transform Walmart overnight into one of the nation s largest health insurers  It would immerse the company in a complicated industry  one that continues to evolve eight years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted and as Washington remains deeply divided over health care policy 
The talks come as  particularly pharmacy chains are looking to diversify and bulk up in the face of the competitive threat from e commerce giant Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc 
In December  VS Health  NYSE CVS  Corp  agreed to buy Humana rival Aetna  NYSE AET  Inc in a  69 billion deal aimed at allowing the drugstore chain to capture more of what consumers spend on health care  In March  health insurer Cigna Corp  NYSE CI     Co    the biggest administrator of prescription drug benefits in the U S   for  54 billion 
Walmart has a vast pharmacy business  with locations in most of its roughly 4 700 U S  stores and in many of its Sam s Club warehouse locations  Humana is a Medicare focused insurer that could deepen Walmart s relationship with a key demographic seniors at a time when the retailer is being threatened by Amazon on several fronts 
Humana  which had  53 8 billion in revenue last year  is the second biggest provider of the private Medicare plans known as Medicare Advantage  Humana has about 17  of the Medicare Advantage market  according to a tally by analysts at Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   with about 3 5 million participants  Medicare is viewed as a growth engine in the insurance industry  as the baby boomers age into the program 
Many of the biggest health insurers are pairing up with others outside their industry to create behemoths with a far larger role in the health care sector after two attempted health insurance mergers were blocked in early 2017 by courts on antitrust grounds  Aetna Humana and Anthem Inc   Cigna 

Good Idea 
My simple question has many possible answers  It does not explain what I am after 
Good idea for whom  Shareholders  bondholders  Consumers 
I am concerned about the consumer  If a merger would lower costs for the consumer  I wholeheartedly endorse the merger 
I believe it will  but I am not positive it will 
Going one step further  I would like to see Walmart start competing directly with doctors and hospitals for all kinds of non emergency medical services 
It would not bother me one iota if Walmart operated as a bank  again assuming it would lower fees  ATM costs could drop quickly if we were to see such a move 
Walmart the Godsend 
Unlike many  I cheer Walmart and Amazon for bringing lower prices 
For example Barry Ritholtz moans  
American fast food workers receive more than  7 billion dollars in public assistance  says Ritholtz 
He resents those workers being partially subsidized  If Ritholtz would bother to think  he would understand that Walmart and McDonalds provide hundreds of thousands of jobs that would not otherwise exist at all 
Ritholtz s  simple solution  is to hike the minimum wage  Of course the price of food at fast food restaurants  already ridiculously overpriced would have to rise even more  Fewer stores would be build and fewer people would be employed 
Not once I have seen or heard Ritholtz address the fact that the Fed is hell bent on forcing up prices in a technologically deflationary world 
One Way Titanium
Ritholtz perpetually provides superficial non solutions with total disdain for the real economic problem 
The problem is not the lack of a minimum wage  but how far the dollar goes  I have pointed this out many times before  but Ritholtz has a mind encased in one way titanium  Bad ideas transmit freely  but sound economic ideas cannot enter or leave ",2018-04-01,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walmart-seeks-to-buy-humana-good-idea-walmart-the-godsend-200302177,200302177
141969,363484,HUM,What s Walmart s Gameplan With Humana ,opinion,"Rumors are circling that Walmart  NYSE WMT  might be acquiring Humana  NYSE HUM  or  at the very least  deepening its partnership with the health insurer 
I have my own thoughts on the matter  As I shared with Reuters  Nandita Bose 

 The end goal here is to get more people in their stores  get them to buy drugs and make an additional purchase while they are in the store   said Charles Sizemore  founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC  who owns shares of Walmart 
If Walmart can offer  competitive rates  on primary care and other health services  he said  it  can grow traffic and push store visits  
To view full article see 

Walmart has been the master of cutting out the middle man for its entire multi decade history  and the company is well known for squeezing its suppliers  By acquiring or partnering with a major health insurer  Walmart can guarantee rock bottom pricing for prescription drugs  And if their ultimate goal is to simply attract more foot traffic to their stores  they can sell the drugs at breakeven  and it still makes economic sense 
Looking at the bigger picture  the government has failed miserably to contain health costs  And this is not a partisan complaint  the failure is shared by both parties  Yes  ObamaCare has been a disaster and accelerated healthcare inflation  but there would have never been political demand for the flawed program if either party had been successful in containing costs over the past several decades 
The private sector is stepping in where the government has failed  Walmart is potentially partnering with Humana  while Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  and JP Morgan  NYSE JPM  are working on a collaboration of their own to lower costs 
All of this is fantastic for consumers  Some of these attempts will almost certainly fail  success is created by trial and error  after all   but the important thing is that we re seeing the beginnings of innovation  That s good  because we sorely need it

141970,363485,HUM,Walmart Takes On Amazon Again  Look What It s Done This Time,opinion,Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT   does it again  It looks like this omni channel retailer is leaving no chance to strengthen operations and remain in focus   as evident from its latest plans to launch  Walmart2World  money transfer service  In a move to ease payments  the company plans to introduce this  game changing model  in collaboration with MoneyGram International   NASDAQ MGI    which is a money transfer service provider across the United States and globally Apart from this  there was a lot of buzz about Walmart being in talks to take over pharmacy start up  PillPack   a news that broke out just few days after sources revealed chances of the big box retailer to strengthen ties with Humana   NYSE HUM    Though some analysts are skeptical about the Walmart   Humana deal  which could also be the reason behind the supermarket giant s fall of 3 8  during yesterday s trading session  many remain hopeful about the prospects In fact  Walmart s robust headways in healthcare space seem to have rattled investors of Rite Aid and Walgreens  as these stocks declined nearly 3  and 3 6   respectively yesterday  Moreover  all these moves highlight Walmart s assiduous efforts to take on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    which dropped 5 2  on Apr 2  The e commerce giant  which has taken retail competition to the next level  has also been making efforts to grab a hold in the healthcare space Walmart2Walmart to Walmart2World  Lets Delve DeepWell  Walmart s plans to launch Walmart2World  also marks another initiative to enhance consumers  experience  which may help the company combat competition from Amazon  In fact  this is not the first time when Walmart has undertaken such a move  The retail giant introduced a low cost Walmart2Walmart money transfer service about four years back  which generated customer fees savings worth about  700 million since then While Walmart2Walmart serves customers on a domestic level  Walmart2World will help them send money to any MoneyGram agent location across about 200 countries in a jiffy  and at a low cost  Sources revealed that this global wire service  slated to hit all Walmart stores this month itself  is aimed at serving those U S  customers who are classified unbanked per the World Bank s Global Findex Further  with an exclusively transparent pricing structure  favorable exchange rate and speedy deliveries  this service stands apart from other international transfer services  Clearly  such features are likely to steer more traffic to Walmart s stores  thus being a boost for its top line  Talking of boosting traffic  Walmart also opened its first high tech supermarket in China  per a Reuters report issued on Apr 2  In this small supermarket  customers can use smartphones to make payments for products that are usually sold on Walmart s stores on JD com PillPack to Enhance Walmart s Healthcare Business Moving to the rounds about Walmart buying online medication delivery provider PillPack for less than  1 billion  we note that both Walmart and PillPack remained silent for any comments  However  media sources  PillPack  which raised nearly  118 million as venture funds  is likely to ease Walmart s customer orders and prescription management processes Apart from filling prescriptions  PillPack also sorts pills according to individual doses  provides timely deliveries of refills and offers non stop customer service  These services  particularly the pre sorting as per time and date  is a benefit for customers taking miscellaneous medicines including aged customers  In fact  the company also introduced a prescription management software last year  called PharmacyOS   which is a boon for customers with complicated medications  Thus  we believe that PillPack s acquisition will help Walmart drawing customers and enhance its healthcare services  The company operates pharmacies in most of its stores and Sam Club locations  while it also has in store clinics in Georgia  South Carolina and Texas   per media sourcesWill These Efforts Keep Walmart Firm Against Amazon Markedly  these constant initiatives should keep Walmart well placed against Amazon  which is planning to adopt a different way to ease experiences of potential customers with no bank accounts  Sources revealed that the online giant was in talks with J P  Morgan Chase and other such financial institutions to serve young and unbanked shoppers  In fact  there were rounds that Amazon also approached PillPack at some point  which along with other strategies underscores its quest to dominate the healthcare space too  Nevertheless  Walmart has been neck to neck with Amazon  so much so that the company emerged as an omni channel retailer officially earlier this year  In fact  with strength across its stores and online  this world s largest retailer has rallied 21 7  in a year  in comparison with the  s growth of 20 9   We expect such dedicated endeavors to help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company continue taking on Amazon  You can see The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All             Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave

141971,363486,HUM,Medicare Rate Up More Than Expected  Health Insurers To Gain,opinion,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services   CMS    a division of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  has decided to raise 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3 4   Notably  CMS previously proposed a hike of 1 84  in February but this rate increase is higher than expected Following the announcement  shares of companies with exposure to the MA business like UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   and Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   rallied 
Medicare Advantage   MA   plans were initiated by the government some years ago to control the rising cost of Medicare  a government program for the retirees  Notably  this MA plans were administered by private insurance companies  The health insurers often add extra benefits to make these plans more appealing to consumers  thus justifying its name   Medicare Advantage  The government reimburses a certain amount per enrolee to the health insurers in return of the care provided 
Why Is Government Pitching for High Reimbursement Rates 
MA reimbursement rates for private plan increased by 0 45   0 85  for 2018  and  2017  respectively  The higher than expected increase in reimbursement rate for 2019 is meant  to attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing managed care participation  This move will alleviate government healthcare which is reeling under high Medicare costs 
According to CBO  total Medicare spending is expected to increase from  708 billion to  1 4 trillion from 2017 to 2027   Medicare spending is anticipated to rise more rapidly relative to GDP owing to a number of factors  including the aging population and faster growth in health care costs compared with growth in the economy on a per capita basis  In an effort to decrease the government s burden of rising healthcare costs  it intends to rope in health insurers who are effective in managing costs 
In fact  the government has actually witnessed cost reduction by delegating Medicare to the private players and is encouraging customers to opt for Medicare Advantage  The recent higher than expected rate highlights the government s efforts to stabilize these plans and provide enough resources to the insurance companies to support beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicare plans 
A Cash Cow for Health Insurers
Meanwhile  these plans have been highly profitable for the health insurers  Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates  they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members  This trend has aided top line growth of the companies engaged in MA  Further  the health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations  This business has proven to be boon for the health insurance industry 
In a year s time the  has gained 33 7  compared with the S P 500 growth of 11 9  

MA   the Catalyst Behind Mergers and Acquisitions in the Industry
The lucrative nature of this business along with the players  intention to stake a claim in this rapidly growing market has fueled a number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry 
According to KPMG  MA has only been around since 2003 but it is rapidly gaining popularity as a health plan and also among seniors dissatisfied with traditional Medicare  MA plans are in great demand amid the baby boomers  a rapidly growing generation  presenting an immense business opportunity   KPMG projects the baby boomers population to be nearly 72 million by 2030 and almost 87 million by 2050  Per Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux  11 000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population ever single day 
Analysis from Strategy   PwC s strategy consulting business  projects annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US 215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than  500 billion by 2025 
The most recent merger speculation doing rounds is that of Walmart s intention to buy Humana  which has nearly two thirds of its revenues coming from MA   Notably  this buyout also hinges around the coveted MA business  Its crystal clear that Walmart  NYSE WMT  is planning to cash in on the MA business via Humana  an established player in this field 
Recently Anthem stated that it is working to capture its fair share of the MA market 
Other big acquisitions in this arena in  were UnitedHealth Group s buyout of XLHealth Corporation  Preferred Care Partners and Medica HealthCare Plans  Further  Cigna  NYSE CI  s acquisition of HealthSpring  Humana s takeover  of MD Care and Aetna Inc  s   NYSE AET   buyout of Genworth s Medigap business are also noteworthy   In the same vein  WellCare Health Plans  Inc  acquired Universal American Corp  last year and is still on hunt for MA opportunities 
Bottom Line
Given that MA is one of the few areas which has a bipartisan support  its future remains bright  Industry analysts believe that the recent increase in reimbursement rates will lead to strong enrollment growth in this business in next five years 
Also the players thirst for MA business still remains unquenched  consequently we expect more mergers and acquisitions on this front

141972,363487,HUM,Check These 3 Health Insurers To Reap High Returns In Q2,opinion,The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment  product development  business diversification  cost control efforts  increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position  All these led to both top and bottom line growth for most players in the field  Many in the

competition  stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare  the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018   We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs  The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3 4  also proves that  This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation  Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers  their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth Apart from this upside  an increasing focus on preventive and value based care  growing accountable care organizations  international business expansion  mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry s growth trend alive Thriving Economy  Rising Interest Rates  Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics  increasing income  low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks  A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers  An ageing U S  population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans  especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs  This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground Additionally  the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers  The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels Consolidation in the IndustryOf late  increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry  This in turn leads to market concentration  which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market

Over the past decade  WINA has grown revenue 8  compounded annually while after tax profit    has grown 21  compounded annually  Increased profit growth can be attributed to WINA s NOPAT margin rising from 11  in 2007 to 35  in 2017  The company has also improved its ROIC from 8  in 2007 to 42  in 2017

WINA Valuation Provides Upside
Despite outperforming over the past two years  up 31  vs  29  for the S P 500   WINA remains undervalued  At its current price of  130 share  WINA has a price to economic book value    ratio of 1 0  This ratio means the market expects WINA s NOPAT to never meaningfully grow from its current levels  This expectation seems rather pessimistic given that WINA has grown NOPAT by 13  compounded annually since 1996 
If WINA can maintain 2017 NOPAT margins  35   and grow NOPAT by just 4  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  185 share today   a 42  upside

DAR Provides Poor Risk Reward Tradeoff
Over the past five years  DAR has significantly unperformed the S P 500   3  vs  S P  70    Even now  shares still hold significant downside risk given the deteriorating fundamentals 
To justify its current price of  17 share  DAR must maintain 2017 NOPAT margins  3   and grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for the next 17 years  This scenario seems overly optimistic after years of margin decline and the fact that DAR s NOPAT has fallen by 8  compounded annually since 2011

142035,363550,HUM,Republicans win Obamacare legal challenge  add to insurer concerns,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  judge on Thursday handed a victory to congressional Republicans who challenged President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  ruling that his administration overstepped its constitutional powers relating to government spending  U S  District Judge Rosemary Collyer  based in Washington  ruled that the administration cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds to provide subsidies under the law known as Obamacare to private insurers without the approval of Congress  At issue in the case  brought by the Republican led House of Representatives  are reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law requires them to make to customers  out of pocket medical payments  The ruling will not have an immediate effect on the law because the judge put the decision on hold pending an expected appeal by the administration  But it adds to uncertainty over the future of Obama s signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the Nov  8 presidential and congressional elections  including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program  Insurers have sustained losses from their Obamacare business  saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members  Two of the largest players  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year   If you re going to lose more money  why participate   asked Steve Halper  an analyst with FBR Capital Markets  Shares in hospital operators such as Community Health Systems Inc fell sharply  while insurer stocks including  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET   which plans to remain in at least 15 Obamacare markets next year  also declined  In court papers  the administration had warned that a court victory for the House Republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for Americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy holders  As part of an appeal  the administration is likely to press its argument that the House lacks legal standing to sue    This suit represents the first time in our nation s history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute   White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters   It s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer funded lawsuit to re fight a political fight that they keep losing   Earnest added   They ve been losing this fight for six years  and they ll lose it again   REPEATED CHALLENGES Conservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act since it was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition  Collyer was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W  Bush  The law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of Americans who previously had none  subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits  In addition  the federal government helped defray consumers  out of pocket costs  The House Republicans argued that the administration s action violated the U S  Constitution because it is the legislative branch  not the executive branch  that authorizes government spending   BIG win for the Constitution   House Speaker Paul Ryan wrote on Twitter  Jonathan Turley  the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit  in a blog post called the ruling  a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole   The appeals court in Washington may be more receptive to the administration s arguments  in part because seven of its 11 active judges are Democratic appointees  including four picked by Obama  The case focuses on a cost sharing provision of Obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co pays  Insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government  Cost sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower income households   The Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress  The House Republicans who filed the challenge disagreed  Collyer ruled that the cost sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law  The judge rejected the administration s contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to  absurd economic  fiscal and healthcare policy results   
The U S  Supreme Court in June 2015  in a ruling authored by Bush appointed Chief Justice John Roberts  rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted Obamacare  upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law  Roberts also wrote a major 2012 ruling preserving Obamacare ",2016-05-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-judge-hands-win-to-republicans-in-obamacare-challenge-401671,401671

142042,363557,HUM,Health Insurance Stock Outlook   January 2018,opinion,"The year gone by was a tumultuous one for health insurers as the industry reeled under constant uncertainty stemming from President Trump and the Republican Congress  efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare  Toward the end of the year  the individual mandate  which required most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a fine  of Obamacare was stripped from the GOP tax bill Apart from political tumult  tough regulatory oversight led to the blockage of two mega mergers  Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  with Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    HUM  and Cigna Corp   CI  with Anthem Inc   ANTM  On an operational level  rising medical costs  public exchanges woes  increased investments in technology  higher operating costs and stiff competition were some of the headwinds that prevailed  Nevertheless  the players emerged as winners with most of them reporting a rise in revenues  membership and margins  Factors such as low medical utilization  greater emphasis on value based care  diversification of operations  product and service development  cost control efforts and strong capital levels worked in their favor  Rapid evolution is being witnessed in the health insurance industry as the players are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of traditional payers  This metamorphosis is being driven by growing consumerism  changes brought about by healthcare reform  more focus on value based care  the need to control rising medical costs and being more competitive  Another wind blowing across the industry is cross sector collaboration  wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care industry such as pharmacy benefit management  ambulatory care and physician services These combinations that qualify as lateral integrations are catching the eye of insurers since such deals enable them to broaden their service and product portfolio  and become a comprehensive healthcare company  Some of the mega deals in this vein are UnitedHealth Group s  UNH  acquisition of Catamaran and the pending merger of Aetna with CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS    CVS   Despite all the ambiguity  the  remained an outperformer by growing 54  in a year s time compared with the S P 500 index s 24  gain What s in the Cards in 2018 The year 2018 will be fraught with risk and uncertainty as the repeal and replace conundrum continues  Though the individual mandate has been stripped off  legislators will have to come up with some replacement policy for the individual mandate Nevertheless  since insurers have been paying high tax  the tax reform pursuant to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 should come as a breather  Recently  UnitedHealth reported that it has gained  1 22 per share non cash benefit for 2017 from the revaluation of its net deferred tax liability due to the tax reform The savings from a lower tax rate will most likely be utilized in accelerating investments in data analytics  technology and innovations to better serve consumers and care systems and to advance new and existing business platforms The year 2018 should see more of vertical integration via mergers and acquisitions as players will look for suitable targets to a  strengthen an existing business or platform  b  provide a new platform for future growth  c  bring tools  technologies or skills that cannot be otherwise obtained or developed more efficiently  We also see the potential for sustained growth particularly in expanding government programs  Medicare and Medicaid  Increasing demand for Medicare plans from baby boomers and migration by more states to manage Medicaid have created huge growth opportunities in this line of business Is Further Upside Potential Left While the industry has outperformed the broader market  valuations remain a bit stretched and leave limited or no room for further upside The

142043,363558,HUM,Health Insurers Bask Under Rising Insured  Medicare Business,opinion,"Despite industry disruptions  health insurers have managed to keep on their feet over the past year of disruptions  Rising enrollment and top line growth  development of ancillary business  product modifications  improved service  demographic changes  expansion of international operations  better claims handling  growth of new business units  mergers and acquisitions and a strong capital position have better armed insurers to fight industry woes and emerge as winners 
The same is evident from a strong stock market performance by the   as seen by the 54  gain in a year s time compared with the S P 500 s gain of 24  
Let s take a look at how insurers fared recently 
Decline in Uninsured Rates 
Over the past six years  the nation s uninsured rate has gone down  thanks to the Affordable Care Act  ACA  mandates  According to a recent report from Gallup  the percentage of U S  adults without health insurance was 12 2  in the fourth quarter of 2017  
It remains well below its peak of 18 0  measured in the third quarter of 2013  prior to the implementation of the ACA s healthcare exchanges and the requirement that most adults have health insurance or be subject to a fine  commonly known as the individual mandate 
Health insurers have capitalized on this surge in insured rates by raking in members  who added to their top line growth  Most of the insurers have reported a secular rise in enrollment and revenues since 2010  confirming the fact Medicare Advantage  a Cash Cow
Medicare Advantage  MA  plans  which were introduced by the government some years ago to rein in rising costs of Medicare  the main government program for retirees  are administered by private insurance companies  The plan is rightly called Medicare Advantage  because of the extra frills provided in it by health insurers to make it more appealing  compared to the traditional Medicare  to customers 
Health insurers are reimbursed a certain amount per enrollee from the government in return for the care provided by the insurer  This reimbursement has been quite attractive  and insurers    via their measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations    have been able to maintain profitability in these plans  This business has proven to be a cash cow for the insurance industry 
Players  attractiveness for MA business is increasing  fueled by demographic changes  With more baby boomers reaching retirement age  the number of people eligible for Medicare is projected to surpass 70 million individuals by 2024  up from 60 million at present  with gross spending for Medicare expected to reach  1 2 trillion by 2024  up from  770 billion projected for 2018 
Medicare Advantage continues to be a popular choice for approximately one third of those enrolled in Medicare  Players have ample scope of growth as the Medicare Advantage market continues to expand and evolve  
While two public providers  UnitedHealth Group Inc   UNH  and Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    HUM   are the biggest players in this space  others are in the race to win Medicare Advantage market share  The fastest way of achieving this is by acquiring a company in the same business 
Players have been resorting to mergers and acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships in an effort to deepen their reach in the Medicare market  Some of the biggest deals in this space were the acquisitions of HealthSpring by Cigna Corp   CI   XLHealth Corp  by UnitedHealth Group  and Health Net by Centene Corp   CNC   Recently  Anthem Inc   ANTM  announced to buy Florida based Medicare Advantage insurer HealthSun and America s 1st Choice  a privately held Medicare Advantage plan International Markets Hold AttractionExcessive competition and pressure on profit margins in the U S  market have compelled U S  health insurers to look to foreign markets for business diversification  sustained growth and profitability  International markets appear attractive  as these are less penetrated and more competitive  Notably  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for U S  health insurers Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity  They re followed by Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  and Humana  The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies Some of the deals made by players in this field echo the emerging trend of globalization   Recently  Aetna acquired UK based Bupa Group s Thai business  Bupa Thailand  which will significantly increase Aetna s presence in Asia  Earlier  it bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe 
Another insurer  Cigna  penetrated the market in India through a joint venture with TTK Group 
UnitedHealth s purchase of a stake in AmilParticipacoes of Brazil and its recent announcement of buying Chilean company BanMedica points at the increasing trend of insurers going international 
Shift to Value Based Care
The industry is witnessing a change from volume based care to value based care in recent years which has led to the emergence of Accountable Care Organizations  ACOs   These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the like  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population The ACOs are appealing to insurers as these reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACOs because these track and collect patient data  enabling an evaluation of patient care  
Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers Under health care reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as the exclusion of pre existing conditions 
The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on the current cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses  Private commercial payers  such as Cigna  Anthem and Aetna are thus supporting ACO formation  CIGNA and UnitedHealth have one of the most established track records in the group for ACOs 
This ACO wave is expected to continue as players scramble to protect their margins in a very competitive market place  which offers limited scope for top line growth  
Developing Ancillary BusinessesInsurers are eyeing growth and expansion opportunities that accompany the critical challenges of modernizing the health care system  They are branching out to the non traditional areas 
Over the last few years  several large insurers have acquired companies that fall outside the realm of traditional health insurance yet complement it 
Humana  Aetna and UnitedHealth have all been enthusiastically developing their health services businesses  These players have made several acquisitions both big and small to achieve fast paced growth in this space  UnitedHealth s Optum  for example  is a poster child of the growth of health services business that provides tremendous business diversification 
Players have well understood that sustainability over the long run would be possible only by branching out to a new business to relieve pressure on traditional health insurance  which is already saddled with huge competition  Areas such as data and analytics  pharmacy care services  ambulatory services and nursing services are on the radar of health insurers to expand 
Healthy Balance Sheet
Despite incurring heavy expenditures  most of the players in the industry boast solid capital levels  This reflects their profitable operations which have outpaced expense rise  leading to balance sheet growth 
Armed with enough capital  most of the players have resorted to share buyback to aid earnings in an environment when top line growth is a challenge  Strong cash reserves have also enabled players to make acquisitions and mergers to achieve growth  along with positioning them well to face industry issues

142044,363559,HUM,Disruptive Forces To Keep Health Insurers On Their Toes,opinion,"The year 2017 was beset by debate over U S  health care reform and the future of the Affordable Care Act  Finally  toward the end of the year  the individual mandate was repealed  The year 2018 should also be lined with continued policy changes and ongoing uncertainty  Against this backdrop  players in the health insurance industry will continue to work toward making their enterprise more resilient to the dynamic industry 
On an operating front  U S  health plans are expected to carry on their business in a lowered margin environment  given pricing pressure  rising medical costs  and regulatory compliance costs  Increased competition and general marketplace uncertainty are some of the headwinds faced by the players in the industry 
What Does the Individual Mandate Repeal Mean for Insurers 
In December  Obamacare s Individual Mandate  which required most Americans to be covered under health insurance or to pay a fine  was stripped away  This provision will no longer be in effect from 2019  This policy change might lead to healthy individuals opting to remain uninsured only to buy an insurance cover when sick  This should lead to an adverse change in customer mix with insurers getting sick customers mostly  which might increase their risk pool and cause high claim incidence 
Insurers have been lobbying against this repeal  fearing its unfavorable outcome  This might also destabilize the public exchanges where more sick customers would flock to buy insurance  causing an increase in insurance premiums  or lead the insurance companies to exit from exchanges if the businesses don t look sustainable  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has stated that repealing Obamacare s individual mandate would cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027  This implies an increase in the uninsured rate  which is inversely proportional to insurers  earnings growth 
Mounting Pressure to Deliver in Medicare Advantage Business
Medicare Advantage has been a cash cow  but players are facing increased pressure to deliver on government quality ratings and gain operational efficiencies  which if not achieved may drive some insurers out of the market  In an effort to attract more customers  the players have to make smart strategic investments in customer experience designed to appeal to the growing baby boomer population which is technologically literate 
Customers have become conscious of choosing the plan from a company that can successfully address and take care of their individual needs  Also  in order to be more attractive to customers  companies are supposed to have strong ranking from the CMS   which depends on their provision of quality of care and customer service  among other factors  
The success of players in the Medicare Advantage market to a great extent depends on their Medicare Star ratings  which can only be achieved by investment in infrastructure  Some of the players that have invested are reaping the benefits  but for others it is imperative to make necessary investments to risk losing out to competitors   
Tough Regulatory Oversight to Prevail
Tough oversight of the Department of Justice  DoJ  led to the death of two mega mergers  Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  with Humana inc   HUM  and Cigna Corp   CI  with Anthem Inc   ANTM   These mergers  which were in the form of horizontal combination  would have made the surviving entities to become mammoth players in the insurance market  but would have also nixed competition  While these combinations would have been highly beneficial for these entities from the business point of view  providing them with enough heft and size to bargain with their suppliers and customers  these were perceived to provide little good to the consumer 
Mergers and consolidation are rife in the sector  triggered by the changing industry environment  which calls for the businesses to grow in size in order to better command the market and remain leaders  and the best way for insurers to achieve this status is to engage in mergers and acquisitions  But these will not be easy to come by  given regulators  opportunities to strip down deals  which would go against the interest of consumers and throttle competition  Thus  the ride may not be easy for insurers on this front 
Margins to Stay Under Pressure
Minimum MLR rebate requirements limit the level of margin insurers  can earn in their Commercial Insured  Medicare Insured and Medicaid Insured businesses while leaving them  exposed to higher than expected medical costs  This has kept health insurers  margins under pressure lately  a trend that will likely continue in the coming quarters  A host of factors  including compliance costs related to health care reform regulation  increased fees and taxes  pricing pressure  stiff competition and rising medical costs   are also at play in compressing margins 
The industry is also witnessing a general shift in patient mix from commercial insurance to government  Medicare  Medicaid and state subsidized marketplace or exchange  which is another major dampener of insurers  profitability  Premiums for Medicare  Medicaid and state subsidized policies tend to be higher due to serious health issues for many enrollees  However  they carry smaller profitability margins compared to commercial insurance 
High Cost
Regulatory reforms sweeping through the sector have hit insurers with high compliance costs  Expenditures involved in redoing the internal systems have led to a spike in expenses  There has been huge spending on health information technology   HIT   as the system is going through a challenging transition to electronic medical records  which is expensive and requires expertise 
Increased Capital Expenditures  
Health insurers operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry that is subject to significant ongoing changes from marketplace pressures brought about by public policy forces  the ACA  changes to or repeal or replacement of the ACA  Insurance Exchanges  customer demands  demographic shifts  new and expanding health care capabilities  business consolidations  strategic alliances  new market entrants and marketing practices  As a result of these and other factors  their ability to grow profitably through the sale of traditional insured health care and related benefits products in the United States may be limited 
In order to grow profitably in the future  insurers need to diversify their sources of revenue and earnings and transform their business models  This includes developing and expanding Consumer Health and Services  making investments in consumer engagement capabilities and technology and other services for health systems and provider organizations  including joint ventures  ACOs and collaborative provider networks   optimizing business platforms and expanding internationally 
Achieving these goals will require significant senior management and capital resources to make acquisitions or other transactions  This required huge capital before any significant revenues or earnings are generated from such initiatives  
Stiff Competition 
The environment is particularly challenging for small insurers  Large employers having operations across states prefer to contract with insurers that can serve all of their employees throughout the country  Scale economies have therefore become imperative for acquiring business  The implication of these trends is an expectation of increasing consolidation 
Challenges from International OperationsInternational expansion has exposed insurers to political  legal and compliance  operational  regulatory  economic and other risks in foreign countries  A fragile economy in many parts of the world presents another headwind for insurers  One of the largest insurers  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   made an acquisition to reap benefits from the Brazil market but is now facing slowing growth rates in that country 
Also  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to have an impact on revenues  operating results and cash flows from international operations 
To Sum Up
Continued uncertainty will command the industry in 2018  Insurers will have to stay on their toes to constantly take stock of their business workings and build a resilient enterprise  This will require an increase amount of investment and talent  Players can only emerge as winners when they act proactively

142046,363561,HUM,Amazon Is Building Its Own Healthcare Company  With The Help Of Berkshire   JPMorgan,opinion,"In some market shaking news  e commerce giant Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    that they are partnering with Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   and JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U S  employees and improve worker satisfaction 
As a result  shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading  Insurance players like Anthem   NYSE ANTM    Cigna   NYSE CI    Aetna   NYSE AET    and Humana   NYSE HUM   are all down between 2 5  5 5   while pharmacy giants CVS Health   NYSE CVS    Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   and Rite Aid   NYSE RAD   each dipped around 5   Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts   NASDAQ ESRX   is down nearly 6  as well 
The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce  and the future entity will not aim to make a profit  but instead focus on the technology that will provide  simplified  high quality and transparent healthcare  
Amazon  Berkshire  and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long term  and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line 
 The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy   said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett   Our group does not come to this problem with answers  But we also do not accept it as inevitable  
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that  Hard as  forming a new healthcare company  might be  reducing healthcare s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort   while JPMorgan s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to  create solutions that benefit our U S  employees  their families and  potentially  all Americans  
There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now that so called Amazon Effect so this announcement is not entirely a surprise  The healthcare company is still in the  early planning  stages  though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization

142071,363586,HUM,3 Outperformers From Health Insurance In 2017,opinion,"The year 2017 witnessed a lot of regulatory noise surrounding the Affordable Care Act  ACA   Also  health insurers scaled back their participation due to continued loss on public exchanges  Rising consolidation was another major issue 
The ACA had brought more Americans under health insurance plans  It largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population  consequently adding to medical enrollment 
However  everyone was focused on President Trump s decision to abolish the act  Although the ACA is still not repealed  Trump signed the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  into law on Dec 22  which would make significant changes to the law 
The tax act ends the  individual mandate    a major component of ACA   that requires individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty fee  In the absence of the individual mandate  healthy people are likely to opt out of medical insurance  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would increase the count of uninsured Americans by 13 million and push premiums up by an average of around 10  from 2018 to 2027 
Despite facing stringent regulations  health insurers have shown impressive operating performance in 2017  with most of the top players clocking solid top line  bottom line and membership growth  Companies like WellCare Health Plans Inc    NYSE WCG    Anthem   NYSE ANTM    Humana   NYSE HUM    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   have kept raising their full year guidance at the end of each quarter  indicating their rising operational excellence 
Increasing consolidation in the health insurance industry has led to a reduction in the number of players  Although the effect of market concentration might not have been good for consumers due to higher medical cost  it has helped the players enhance the scale of their operations and gain market share 
In 2017  although two big merger deals   Anthem with Cigna  NYSE CI  and Humana with Aetna  NYSE AET    have been blocked by the U S  Department of Justice  mergers and acquisitions activities continued to be rife 
The recent merger deal between two of the industry stalwarts   Aetna and CVS Health  NYSE CVS    is worth a mention here  The deal  if finalized  would join two branches of the industry  in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management 
However  public exchanges  formed to serve the underprivileged and patients  have not been much profitable for the insurers  They failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individuals  which was required to balance the risk return trade off  Health insurers like Humana  Aetna  UnitedHealth and Anthem have already started scaling back their participation from these exchanges after incurring mounting losses 
Increasing operating costs related to regulations  investments in information technology  levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers  margins  The insurers  however  are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations  ACOs

142106,363621,HUM,4 Attractive Stocks To Buy In An Evolving Healthcare Space,opinion,"The healthcare sector has been under the spotlight for quite some time for a host of reasons  regulatory uncertainty  increasing consumerism and consolidation being the most prominent 
The recent deal of merger between two of the industry stalwarts Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and CVS Health  NYSE CVS   once again points to increased activity in healthcare  The deal also testifies to the trend of joining two branches of the industry  in this case health insurance and pharmacy benefit management  to achieving diversification and economies of scale for affordable and convenient care 
Increasing Consolidation in Healthcare
Changing demographics  increasing regulatory restrictions  growing consumerism  need to control cost and attain speedier growth have necessitated unprecedented mergers and acquisitions in all subsectors of healthcare like hospitals  insurance and pharmaceutical 
The changing nature of the healthcare industry has encouraged companies to spread their operations so as to provide a bouquet of products and services and save cost at each touchpoint  The recent deal between Aetna and CVS Health is an excellent example of this  It qualifies as vertical integration  which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover 
A similar deal was made in 2015  when another insurance major UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  acquired Catamaran  a pharmacy benefit management company  The acquisition has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth Group and contributed meaningfully to its results 
Changing demographics  which has resulted in an increase in the baby boomer population  which has fueled demand for Government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid  has also led to a number of mega mergers in the industry in recent years  The failed mergers of Anthem Inc  with Cigna Corp  NYSE CI   and Humana Inc  NYSE HUM   with Aetna Inc  also belonged to this bracket 
Who Is the Real Gainer 
Increasing consolidation has led to a reduction in the number of players  greater market concentration and reduced competition  and increasing barriers of entry in the industry 
Though there s a bit of ambiguity as to whether increasing consolidation has brought about welfare  in real terms  for consumers  However  the companies certainly stand to benefit from their increased size  putting them in a powerful position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers 
U S  healthcare is a highly sensitive issue that has been gaining huge attention  Healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs  a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve  Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs

Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6 3   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
The company s two segments  Acute Care and Behavioral Health  have been performing strongly over the past many quarters  The segments have been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions  licensed beds as well as patient days that have significantly resulted in higher revenues   This yet to be reported quarter is also likely to see the same bullish trend 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue is pegged at  2 6 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 8    Our consensus estimates for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments are currently pegged at  1 4 billion and  1 2 billion  up 10  and 6 4  respectively  year over year 
Since 2012  the average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing and the trend is expected to continue in the third quarter   Our consensus estimates for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health are pegged at 6 1 billion and 23 1 billion  up 3  and 6  year over year  respectively 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73 1 billion and 120 7 billion respectively  up 5  and 7  year over year  respectively  This in turn is expected to aid the company s top line in the third quarter significantly 
Other Factors
Universal Health s efforts to enhance shareholders  value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count 
Nevertheless  rising costs related to interest payment  reserves for settlements  legal judgments and lawsuits  plus impairments of long lived assets might have put pressure on margins

a result  the medical stocks continue to be in focus The U S healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicare expansion under Obamacare  Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast paced growth  In addition  new product launches  improving service  expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line However  medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt  demand for increasing investments in technological innovation  integration cost related to

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is currently pegged at 12 1 billion  reflecting 6 1  year over year growth The major contributor to this rising membership is Centene s continuously growing Medicaid base  Medicaid expansion one of the provision of Affordable Care Act  has benefitted Centene  This was driven by Centene s intention to continue on exchanges while other health insurers like Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   and many more are exiting it The third quarter is also likely to witness further expansion of its Medicaid business  In the third quarter  the company successfully reprocured a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia and Nevada  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medicaid membership presently stands at 5 8 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 3 6  Moreover  Centene has been taking several cost saving initiatives that are reducing the level of expenses  The margin is likely to be aided by lower expenses in the third quarter  The Zacks

142178,363693,HUM,Will High Costs Dent Envision Healthcare  EVHC  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Envision Healthcare Corp    NYSE EVHC   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 31  after market close 
Last quarter  this health services company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 7   However  earnings declined year over year due to an increase in expense  which outdid revenue growth 
The company does not have an impressive surprise history  Though it missed estimates in only one the last four quarters  the average is a negative earnings surprise of 0 7   This is depicted in the graph below 
Q3 Flashback
The company is likely to see lower revenues from its Ambulatory Services segment  which experienced soft business volumes in the past few quarters 
Moreover  the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters  due to higher salaries and benefits expenses  Most alarming is the rate of increase in operating expense  which has overshadowed the revenue growth rate  thereby thwarting bottom line growth  The same is expected to be seen in the to be reported quarter 
A huge debt load is also niggling Envision Healthcare  Its total debt has been swelling since 2013  leading to a spike in interest expense  This  in turn  will dent its operating margins 
The quarter is likely to see increased interest expense as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions 
We  nevertheless  expect to see an increase in revenues from the company s Physician Services segment  which contributes nearly 84  of the company s revenues   driven by synergy from recent acquisitions as well as organic growth  Revenue growth is expected to come from higher patient volumes as well as improved pricing  We also expect to see improved EBIDTA which must have benefited from merger related synergies 
The company s Ambulatory service segment will likely report a decline in revenues due to disposal of centers 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Envision Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Envision Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of  10 98   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 78 cents per share is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the health care sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the third quarter Aetna  Inc    NYSE AET   is set to report results on Oct 31  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 68  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

142205,363720,HUM,Anthem confident  but experts see antitrust hurdles to Cigna deal,news,"By Caroline Humer and Diane Bartz NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  health insurer Anthem Inc  N ANTM  on Monday dismissed concerns that buying smaller competitor  Cigna Corp   N CI  would be considered anti competitive  even as antitrust experts said the combination would earn regulatory scrutiny  Any merger could require asset sales and would be complicated by potential deals among other insurers  which after years of change due to President Barack Obama s healthcare reform are now scrambling to tie up  Insurers are seeking to use scale to trim administrative costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors  moves they say will make plans more affordable but which regulators will closely scrutinize for the opposite effect on consumers  Besides the possible Anthem deal   Humana Inc   N HUM  is considering a sale  possibly to Cigna or  Aetna Inc   N AET   a source familiar with the situation previously told Reuters  The Wall Street Journal also reported that UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  was interested in Aetna  The U S  Department of Justice will look at how the proposed combinations   with deal values estimated in the tens of billions of dollars   would increase market share in each county or region for each type of health insurance plan that the companies offer  antitrust experts say   If two deals were announced in the insurance industry  that would likely trigger more scrutiny from antitrust enforcers  said Barak Richman  who teaches at Duke University School of Law    The economics of the health insurance market makes it a complicated analysis  These are not doomed transactions   Richman said  The Justice Department has been aggressive  one expert said  pointing to Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  s failed bid for Time Warner Cable  NYSE TWC   It would likely be concerned if the number of competitors in the product market of any county dropped to three or fewer  said Andre Barlow  a Justice Department veteran now at Doyle  Barlow and Mazard PLLC       Any time you re down to two players or less you have a problem that needs to be resolved   said Barlow   Three  you may still have to divest   The mergers of the No  2 insurer with the No  5 insurer  and the No  3 with the No  4 insurer  could spark a change in the way they review deals  he said    There s no guarantee that they would review transactions within an industry similar to how they ve treated them in the past   Barlow said  Anthem  which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states  disclosed on Saturday that it had offered to buy Cigna for  47 billion but said the deal was held up over issues like the role of Cigna s CEO at the merged company  Cigna on Sunday confirmed rejecting the offer  citing its own concerns about Anthem s management and saying the combination would run afoul of the rules governing members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is made up of 37 different health plans  of which Anthem is the largest  who work together to create a national network of health insurance coverage    We believe there is a consensus of where there is overlap between our companies and that no substantive antitrust or insurance regulatory issues are present that would prevent completion of the transaction   Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said Monday  By most measures  U S  insurance markets are extremely concentrated  Using a measure called the Herfindahl Hirschman Index  which defines a  highly concentrated  market as over 2 500 points  the U S  market for small group insurance is 3 841 and 4 038 for large groups  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  Kaiser Family Foundation data of insurers in the large group and small group market show that in no instance is Aetna and Humana in the top three in any state  Anthem and Cigna overlap in just one state   New Hampshire  where their combined share for large groups is 67 percent   Both Aetna and Humana are in nine states in Medicare Advantage  Combined  they would have market share of 88 percent in Kansas  80 percent in West Virginia  58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri  Anthem and Cigna are not the top three providers in any state for Medicare Advantage but do overlap in counties in a handful of states   The insurers don t compete the way they should and premiums are higher than they should be   said Leemore Dafny  an expert on the insurance industry at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University   If past is prologue  insurance consolidation is unlikely to lead to lower premiums  In fact the contrary is true

142206,363721,HUM,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Humana  Alibaba Group Holding  Honeywell International  AGNC Investment And Wintrust Financial,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 10  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Humana Inc   NYSE   NYSE HUM        Alibaba Group Holding Limited  NYSE   NYSE BABA        Honeywell International Inc   NYSE   NYSE HON        AGNC Investment Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ AGNC       and Wintrust Financial Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ WTFC       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Low Leverage Stocks That Can Be Part of Your PortfolioIn the complex world of investment  debt financing is a well known strategy adopted by the majority of corporations for expanding their business operations from time to time  Dearth of ample funds is the primary driving force behind this strategy  Yet  resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments In particular  companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario  Of course  companies may resort to equity financing as an alternative option to boost their financial resources  However  it is the easy and cheap availability of debt that makes it more popular among corporations In fact  statistics indicate that America  the richest economy in the world  is the biggest borrower too  Notably  huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150  of the economy s GDP in 2047 from 77  currently Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks  since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country stands atop others  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  thus avoiding those that carry high debt loads Here comes the significance of leverage  better to say financial leverage  which indicates the degree to which a company utilizes debt to boost its operations and earn escalated profit margins  Usually investors tend to avoid companies bearing higher degree of financial leverage The next question that comes to our mind is that how can we measure a company s degree of financial leverage  To this end  several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments The most popular among them is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the Q3 reporting cycle set to gain steam in the coming weeks  an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks  Blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move  As  uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time  it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyIn theory  the optimal capital structure for a company is one with the ideal debt to equity ratio that maximizes its value and minimizes its cost of capital  Since  in practice  screening stocks based on these criteria is a bit difficult  herein  we choose low leverage stocks as these are considered safe bets However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 46 stocks that made it through the screen Humana Inc   NYSE       It is a health services company that facilitates the delivery of health care services through networks of providers to its medical

Companies  Inc   NYSE    NYSE GBX       and Thor Industries  Inc   NYSE    NYSE THO       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Believe in Driehaus Strategy and Buy These 5 Momentum StocksInvestors  who generally have a high risk appetite  focus on momentum stocks to eke out strong gains  In this context  Richard Driehaus  investing strategy  which is based on the  buy high and sell higher  principle  Driehaus earned a place in Barron s All Century Team following the success of the investing strategy The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks   Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5  Positive EPS surprise indicates potential   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend   Momentum Score equal to or less than B Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7 863 stocks to only 11 Here are five of the 11 stocks Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE       is a retailer of branded women

142244,363759,HUM,Public Exchange Woes Hit Health Insurers  Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Public exchanges  formed to serve the underprivileged and patients  have not been too successful in serving the insurers  This is evident from losses incurred by most of the health insurers participating in these exchanges 
Affordability Risk Pool Trade Off
The exchanges saw a deluge of very sick patients buying insurance cover online  thanks to the subsidies provided to the enrollees  They  however  failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individual  which was required to balance the risk return trade off  This led to increase in claims on business conducted on these exchanges 
Let us discuss how the big four insurers have been affected by this public exchange business 
Aetna Inc   NYSE AET    one of the nation s largest health insurance companies  recently announced that it would pull back its participation from public exchanges  expecting a loss of  200 million in 2017  Aetna incurred pre tax operating losses of  450 in 2016 
Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Anthem Inc   NYSE ANTM    a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  is another big insurer offering plans on Affordable Care Act  ACA   Anthem suffered a decline in enrollment in 2016 and the same continued in the first half 2017 
This prompted the company to scale back its participation in this loss making business for 2018  It pulled out of exchange plans in 11 states for 2017 Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market as well as a smooth transition for consumers  uncertainty remains 
UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   lost more than  1 billion on the exchanges in 2015 and 2016  After two years of losing money from plans sold on the ACA insurance exchanges  it exited nearly all of the exchanges for 2017  UnitedHealth presently carries a Zacks Rank  3 
Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   has already declared that it will exit its Individual Commercial business in 2018  After incurring mounting losses in this business in 2015 and 2016  Humana pulled back its participation from 11 states in 2016  The insurer anticipates incurring a modest  45 million loss on ACA exchange plans in 2017  excluding the effect of which  it estimates the earnings per share for 2017 to be at least  11 50  The company also carries Zacks Rank  3 
Continued Uncertainty
The health insurers that have been making significant losses on ACA exchange plans are uncertain about thefinal verdict from the Trump administration  This is because the administration has been vocal about removing cost reduction subsides that help insurance companies pay claims of patients buying coverage on public exchanges 
These players have been lobbying to keep these subsidies intact  which would otherwise lead to the health plan enrollees facing cost increases of 20 25  for 2018 coverage 
The U S  Senate is working on a bipartisan approach for shoring up the ACA s public exchanges by funding cost sharing subsidies for low income patients 
The uncertainty on the CSR funding puts a question mark on the sustainability of these  exchanges  In the event of an unfavorable outcome  it will not be surprising to see an exodus of insurance companies from these exchanges   This exit will lead to more Americans finding themselves with fewer healthcare options  causing an increase in uninsured rates  defeating the central tenet of the Health Care Reform Act

Fundamental headwinds   The company is suffering from a subdued pace of birth across the country  which has slowed growth of one of its core businesses   neonatology   which has in turn stressed revenue growth   Moreover  a change in payor mix in its anesthesiology business has pressurized its commercial volumes  This segment also suffers from growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists 
Additionally  Mednax s results have suffered due to huge investments made in diversification  These investments might create volatility in its quarter over quarter performance  before reaping long term growth 
Markedly  increase in expenses as a proportion of revenues owing to growth in compensation expense for supporting acquisition related growth further pressurized the margins  Also  growth at existing units including compensation for non physician clinicians increased at a faster pace than in the previous periods In fact  the company has been witnessing a dent in its bottom line led by a spike in its interest expenses for more than three years   It is also suffering from an increase in overall expenses  which has outpaced revenue growth compared with the last many years 
Lackluster Earnings Guidance   Mednax expects earnings per share for the three months  ending Sep 30  2017  to be in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents  down from  1 04 per share in the year ago quarter  Adjusted EPS will likely be in the range of 83 cents to 88 cents  down from  1 09 per share in third quarter of 2016 
The range for its third quarter guidance assumes anticipated same unit revenue of negative 2  to flat year over year  For the third quarter of 2017  the company expects EBITDA to decline by 17  to 21  year over year  as against growth of 7 7  in last year period 
Going Forward
Per management  the challenges in its business are expected to continue in the near term  We thus expect shares of the company to remain under pressure in the coming quarters 
Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks from the medical sector include Aetna Inc    NYSE AET    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and WellCare Health Plans  Inc    NYSE WCG    each holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Aetna surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 19  Centene delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 7 7  WellCare Health Humana  NYSE HUM  topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 47 4

Large diversified insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc   UNH   Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET   Cigna Corp   CI   Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    HUM  and Anthem Inc   ANTM  are well placed  given that their earnings are buffered to a large extent from industry disruption 
Let s take a look at how insurers fared recently 
Decline in Uninsured Rates 
Over the past six years  the nation s uninsured rate has gone down to single digits  thanks to the Affordable Care Act mandates  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in 2016 the uninsured rate was around 9  compared with 16  in 2010  The decline since 2010 corresponds with the passage of the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare 
Health insurers have capitalized on this surge in insured rates by raking in members  who added to their top line growth  Most of the insurers have reported a secular rise in enrollment and revenues since 2010  confirming the fact Booming Medicare Business 
Demographic changes in the United States have fueled growth of Medicare Revenues from the managed care plans of Medicare Advantage are expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire  Medicare Advantage is a privately run version of the government s Medicare insurance program for the aged and disabled 
The Kaiser Family Foundation states that since the ACA was passed in 2010  Medicare Advantage enrollment grew 71  as of Mar 31  2017  Medicare Advantage enrollment is projected to continue to grow over the next decade  rising to 41  of all Medicare beneficiaries by 2027 
While two public providers  UnitedHealth and Humana  are the biggest players in this space  others are in a race to win Medicare Advantage market share  The fastest way of achieving this is by acquiring a company in the same business 
Players have been resorting to mergers and acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships in an effort to deepen their reach in the Medicare market  Some of the biggest deals in this space were the acquisition of HealthSpring by Cigna  XLHealth Corporation by UnitedHealth Group  and Health Net by Centene  Recently  Anthem announced that it will buy Florida based Medicare Advantage insurer HealthSun 
International Markets Hold AttractionPressure on profit margins in the U S  market has compelled American health insurers to look to foreign markets for sustained growth and profitability  International markets seem attractive as these are less penetrated and more competitive  Notably  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for U S  health insurers Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity  They re followed by Aetna and Humana  The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies Some of the deals made by players in this field echo the emerging trend of globalization   Recently  Aetna acquired UK based Bupa Group s Thai business  Bupa Thailand  which will significantly increase Aetna s presence in Asia  Earlier  it bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe 
Another insurer  Cigna  penetrated the Indian market through a joint venture with TTK Group 
UnitedHealth s purchase of a stake in AmilParticipacoes of Brazil  and its recent announcement to buy Chilean company BanMedica  point toward the trend of insurers going international 
Managing Costs via ACOsThe industry is witnessing a change from volume based care to value based care in recent years  which has led to the emergence of Accountable Care Organizations  ACOs   These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the like  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population The ACOs are appealing to insurers as these reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACOs because these track and collect patient data  enabling an evaluation of patient care  Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as the exclusion of pre existing conditions  The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on the current cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses  Private commercial payers    such as Cigna  Anthem and Aetna    are thus supporting ACO formation  CIGNA has one of the most established track records in the group for ACOs 
Developing Ancillary BusinessesInsurers are eyeing growth and expansion opportunities that accompany the critical challenges of modernizing the health care system  They are branching out to non traditional areas 
Over the last few years  several large insurers have acquired companies that fall outside the realm of traditional health insurance  yet complement it 
Players  Humana  Aetna  UnitedHealth have all been enthusiastically developing their health services business  These players have made several acquisitions  both small and large  to achieve fast paced growth in this space   
Recently  UnitedHealth Group announced the acquisition of Surgical Care Affiliates  It also announced that it will take over the health care business of The Advisory Board Company  ABCO   It also recently acquired Catamaran  These acquisitions and several others have been made in its health services business  Optum 
Healthy Balance Sheet
Despite incurring heavy expenditures  most of the players in the industry boast a solid capital level  This reflects their profitable operations which have outpaced expense rise  leading to balance sheet growth 
Armed with enough capital  most of the players have resorted to share buyback to aid earnings in an environment when top line growth is a challenge  Strong cash reserves have also enabled players to make acquisitions and mergers to achieve growth  along with positioning them well to face industry issues

via ACOsThe industry is witnessing a change from volume based care to value based care in recent years  which has led to the emergence of Accountable Care Organizations  ACOs   These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the like  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population The ACOs

 Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical

142248,363763,HUM,3 Anti Trumpcare Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"Yesterday  I broke news of the FAANGs  coming takeover rampage  and how you could mint a fortune  
But the FAANGs aren t the only ones flush with cash 
America s largest health insurance companies   Aetna  NYSE AET   Cigna  NYSE CI   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Humana  NYSE HUM  and Anthem Inc  NYSE ANTM    are also printing money 
With collective profits of  10 3 billion through two quarters  a record shattering year is afoot 
More favorable still 
Now that Obamacare has survived the GOP s onslaught  the printing presses will run even hotter 
I suppose we should bless these despised health care providers with their own acronym 
Let s go with something cringe worthy  like  ACUHA    Sounds like a punch to the gut  
But can you bury your hate for five minutes 
Let me explain 
ACUHA is about to go on a historic acquisition spree 
To fuel growth  its eyes are fixed upon certain microcaps 
Of course  when buyouts are made public  the announcement stands to  break  the charts of the smaller companies 
Keep these  chartbreaking  opportunities in mind as you read our most appetizing takeover targets 
Ignore the Sob Story
Few industries get more hate from Americans than health insurance 
But the fact is  without them  many of us would go bankrupt paying off medical bills 
And while many insurers complain that Obamacare has made them unprofitable  their financial statements tell a different story 
Last quarter  America s top six health insurers earned a combined  6 billion in profit  according to CNBC 
And according to Thomson Reuters I B E S data  that represents a 29  jump from the same period last year 
So don t be fooled by their sob story 
Instead  do as they do  That is  keep an eye out for explosive companies with disruptive technology to buy up 
Here s one such company leading the pack 
iRhythm Technologies Inc  NASDAQ IRTC  is a health care company that s changing the game for medical biosensors 
The company s flagship product  Zio  is a continuous monitor patch that records weeks of a patient s heartbeat data 
IRhythm s patented machine learning algorithms analyze the recorded data and compile the conclusions into a readable 15 page report for a patient s doctor 
The goal  Diagnose heart arrhythmias faster and more accurately than traditional methods 
The less time it takes to diagnose the ailment  the faster a patient can be treated effectively 
And a swifter diagnosis can also result in lower medical costs for everyone involved 
Better still  because Zio s software is powered by machine learning  the larger iRhythm s database gets  the smarter the algorithms get 
This innovative company just went public last December  and its stock has nearly doubled on surging sales since then 
It s flush with cash with  110 million on the books and just  32 million in debt 
Best of all  with a market value of  1 1 billion  iRhythm is a cheap takeover target for virtually all of the health care giants 
Management Shakeup Greenlights Potential Takeover
With health care reform off the table for now  ACUHA companies can focus on expanding their network 
Now  the failure of the Republicans to cut back Obamacare makes it likely that future health care changes will focus on expanding service to currently uninsured or underinsured communities 
State subsidies to insurers covering these communities are likely to expand rapidly as the health care system attempts to serve them more cost effectively 
That makes Molina Healthcare Inc  NYSE MOH  a prime takeover target for larger health care companies 
Molina was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Long Beach  California  The company offers clinic services with locations in 15 states  And it serves nearly 5 million patients 
The company also provides health care plans to individuals with state coverage  Molina focuses on the minority  immigrant and underserved communities that receive health care funding from Medicaid  Medicare and other government funded sources 
Molina recently ran into profit problems  with losses of  230 million in the second quarter of 2017  after which it announced 1 500 layoffs  This resulted in the departure of founding family members Mario Molina as CEO and John Molina as CFO  who were regarded as the biggest barriers to a sale of the company 
With a market capitalization of  3 8 billion  a business focused on an attractive market   and not to mention management turmoil   Molina represents an excellent takeover opportunity for ACUHA companies seeking to expand into the state subsidized health care market 
With revenue of  17 8 billion  four times its market value  Molina s potential for a big  is high 
Riches in Niches
Large  bureaucratic health insurers share a debilitating weakness 
That is  they re not nimble enough to expand into underserved  yet highly profitable niche markets 
That doesn t mean they re locked out altogether  It just means they have to expand into these markets via acquisitions instead of organically 
Such a reality puts the  382 million market cap Independence Holding Company  NYSE IHC  firmly in the cross hairs 
Founded in 1980  the company makes a mint focusing on specialized health insurance products  Sales and profits for the first six months of the year hit  154 1 million and  19 3 million  respectively 
This is no accident  either 

As the company plainly reveals in SEC filings   Our business strategy consists of maximizing underwriting profits through a variety of niche specialty health insurance  pet and group disability and life products and through distribution channels that enable us to access specialized or underserved markets in which we believe we have a competitive advantage  

The company s foothold in these highly profitable niches is so strong that large health insurers recently started reselling some of IHC s products to share in the riches 
It s only a matter of time before one of these insurers buys the company outright so it can reap all the rewards  To that end  IHC has been making all the right moves to up its takeover appeal 
In March 2016  it divested a valuable  but unrelated business segment  It then used the proceeds to pay off all its outstanding debt and aggressively invest in its fastest growing product lines 
To top it off  the never ending turmoil surrounding Obamacare plans supercharged demand for IHC s products  Indeed  the company is expected to  report significantly higher earned premiums and income in this segment in 2018  
Add it all up and the time is ripe for an acquirer to pounce while shares are still trading on the cheap 
At current prices  the stock sports a price earnings  P E  ratio of 13 6  That s a staggering discount of 35 60  compared with large cap health insurers like Cigna Corporation  NYSE CI  and Aetna Inc  NYSE AET   It certainly won t last forever 
Even management knows it  as they recently repurchased over  42 million worth of stock 
Bottom line  I don t expect Independence Holding Co  to maintain its independence much longer  Bet on it  And if I m wrong  you ll still be positioned to profit  as the company ranks as one of the cheapest and fastest growing providers of specialty insurance products

142249,363764,HUM,5 Low Leverage Stocks That Can Be Part Of Your Portfolio,opinion,In the complex world of investment  debt financing is a well known strategy adopted by the majority of corporations for expanding their business operations from time to time  Dearth of ample funds is the primary driving force behind this strategy  Yet  resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments In particular  companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario  Of course  companies may resort to equity financing as an alternative option to boost their financial resources  However  it is the easy and cheap availability of debt that makes it more popular among corporations In fact  statistics indicate that America  the richest economy in the world  is the biggest borrower too  Notably  huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150  of the economy s GDP in 2047 from 77  currently Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks  since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country stands atop others  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  thus avoiding those that carry high debt loads Here comes the significance of leverage  better to say financial leverage  which indicates the degree to which a company utilizes debt to boost its operations and earn escalated profit margins  Usually investors tend to avoid companies bearing higher degree of financial leverage The next question that comes to our mind is that how can we measure a company s degree of financial leverage  To this end  several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments The most popular among them is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the Q3 reporting cycle set to gain steam in the coming weeks  an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks  Blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move  As  uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time  it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyIn theory  the optimal capital structure for a company is one  with the ideal debt to equity ratio that maximizes its value and minimizes its cost of capital  Since  in practice  screening stocks based on these criteria is a bit difficult  herein  we choose low leverage stocks as these are considered safe bets However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that

 NEW YORK  Aug 1  Reuters    U S  stock index futures surged
more than 1 percent on Monday on relief over a deal in
Washington to raise the debt ceiling  avoiding an unprecedented
default 
 Lawmakers were expected to vote on Monday on the White
House backed agreement  which includes budget cuts of  2 4
trillion  The deal was seen passing the Democratic led Senate 
but it faces tougher opposition in the U S  House of
Representatives  where both conservative Tea Party supporters
and liberal lawmakers have criticized it  For details  see

 Even though a default was considered unlikely by many
investors  equities grew increasingly volatile as Washington
was stalemated  Wall Street ended its worst week in a year last
week 
  While no one could imagine there being no compromise
passed  no one could also imagine it taking this long to get
one  So there s justification for the rally because it takes
that anxiety away   said Oliver Pursche  president at Gary
Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern  New York 
 Gold   seen as a safe haven in times of economic
uncertainty  fell 0 7 percent following the deal  while U S 
crude oil  climbed 1 1 percent 
 Even with a deal  many investors remained concerned about a
possible downgrade of the United States  AAA sovereign debt
rating  as well as continued issues over European debt  Some
analysts said Monday s rally in futures could be short lived 
The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top shares was up 0 6
percent   ID nL6E7J10BR 
  Based on the comments Standard   Poor s has made so far 
they ve backed themselves into a corner  making it very likely
that we could see a downgrade   Pursche said   However  since
that is partially priced in and rating agencies don t have as
much credibility as they used to  I don t know how big of a
material impact it will have  
 S P 500 futures  rose 15 4 points and were above fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  soared

 NEW YORK  Aug 1  Reuters    U S  stocks fell a sixth day on
Monday as weaker than expected U S  manufacturing data and
uncertainty over the debt deal in Washington kept the mood
skittish on Wall Street 
 Healthcare stocks  including United Health   were
among the worst performers as investors feared the debt ceiling
deal could lead to cuts in Medicare and other federal health
programs  analysts said  For details  see  ID L3E7J11R2 
 Early gains over the deal aimed at avoiding a U S  default
quickly faded after the Institute for Supply Management  ISM 
reported the U S  manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace
in two years in July  The ISM report also showed new orders
contracted   ID nN1E7700HA 
  One has to carefully consider this economic data point as
an indication of a continuing slowdown which will perhaps bleed
into earnings   said Chad Morganlander  portfolio manager at
Stifel  Nicolaus   Co in Florham Park  New Jersey   It
indicates a lack of vitality that would improve employment  
 If lawmakers approve the debt deal before the Tuesday
deadline  it may end months of debate over whether the United
States can avoid a debt default

 Even though a default was considered unlikely by many
investors  the threat of a credit rating downgrade continued to
weigh on sentiment after Wall Street s worst week in a year
last week 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 106 68
points  or 0 88 percent  at 12 036 56  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 14 49 points  or 1 12 percent  at
1 277 79  down for a sixth day  The Nasdaq Composite Index
 was down 35 16 points  or 1 28 percent  at 2 721 22 
 The S P 500 was well below its 200 day moving average at
1 285 37  which had been pegged as support 
  We re moving toward the lower end of  a trading  range  so
investors are getting more nervous   said Michael Sheldon 
chief market strategist  RDM FINANCIAL in Westport 
Connecticut 
 The S P health care index  fell 2 5 percent  leading
losses among S P 500 sectors 
  Medicare is the one that s on the chopping block    the
one that s getting all the threat of a cut if they can t
agree   said Marc Pado  U S  market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald   Co in San Francisco 
 Shares of United Health were down 4 3 percent at  47 48
while shares of Humana Inc  dropped 3 1 percent to
 72 26  despite Humana reporting a higher than expected
second quarter profit 
 Among other health care stocks  shares of Pfizer 
were down 1 7 percent at  18 91 
 Defense related shares also declined  with the iShares Dow
Jones US Aerospace and Defense Index Fund  down 2
percent 
 U S  congressional leaders on Monday tried to get the votes
needed to pass the White House backed deal  which emerged after
heavy negotiations over the weekend 
  It was a patched compromise deal  with still a lot of
uncertainty  so people don t want to get their hands on this
issue  If the deal passes  we ve averted the threat of a
default  but I always thought that was unlikely   said Carl
Kaufman  who helps manage just under  2 billion at the

 NEW YORK  Aug 1  Reuters    The S P 500 fell for a sixth
day on Monday as time runs out for the government to pass a
deal to avoid default and the economy showed further signs of
stalling 
 The market pared losses late in the day before Congress was
expected to vote on Monday on a debt deal backed by the White
House  which includes spending cuts of  2 4 trillion over 10
years  For details  see  ID nN1E76U0F5 
 The deadline for a deal  which includes raising the U S 
borrowing limit  is Tuesday at midnight 
  It s an on again  off again market  and it reflects the
on again  off again nature of these debt ceiling
deliberations   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of
Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany  New York 
  Investors now believe that the debt limit will be raised 
that the vote will be positive in the Senate and positive in
the House  but there s still a bit of skepticism or caution  
 Stocks fell after the Institute for Supply Management said
the U S  manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace in two
years in July  The ISM report followed similarly weak reports
from much of Asia and Europe   ID nN1E7700HA 
 The defense and health care sectors  which would be
subject to U S  budget cuts if a deal is not reached  were
among the hardest hit  The iShares Dow Jones US aerospace and
defense exchange traded fund  fell 1 1 percent while
S P s healthcare index  lost 1 7 percent 
 Healthcare stocks also fell after the Centers for Medicare
  Medicaid Services said Friday that it will cut payments to
skilled nursing facilities by 11 percent  Kindred Healthcare
 fell 30 percent and Skilled Healthcare  lost
more than 43 percent   ID nN1E7700Z3 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 10 75
points  or 0 09 percent  to 12 132 49  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  fell 5 34 points  or 0 41 percent  to
1 286 94  The Nasdaq Composite Index  lost 11 77 points 
or 0 43 percent  to 2 744 61 
  Today s trading has exposed the market  It apparently was
hiding behind the  debt ceiling  curtain  but now that that has
been pulled back  we find that there are other problems   
namely  the economy   said Larry McMillan  president of
McMillan Analysis Corp 
 The S P 500 rallied back above its 200 day after dipping
sharply below that  The level has acted as strong support over
the last two months and the fact that S P 500 was able to rally
back above it was a comfort to investors 
  The S P which sliced through the 200 day moving average at
1 285  has taken that back in the last half hour  of trading   
said  Elliot Spar  market strategist at Stifel  Nicolaus   Co
in Shrewsbury  New Jersey  noting that as a sign of underlying
resilience 
 Stocks traded in a wide range  A rally in equity markets
that began in Asia last night on optimism over a debt agreement
eroded as the outcome seemed to struggle throughout Monday to
bring the deal to a close 
 If lawmakers approve the debt deal before the Tuesday
deadline  it may end months of debate over whether the United
States can avoid a debt default 
 Even though a default was considered unlikely by many
investors  the threat of a credit rating downgrade continued to
weigh on sentiment after Wall Street marked its worst week in a
year last week 
 Shares of United Health  slid 3 2 percent to  48 02
while Humana Inc  dropped 3 percent to  72 36  despite
Humana reporting a higher than expected second quarter profit 
 Among other health care stocks  shares of Pfizer 
shed 1 2 percent at  19 01 
 Some 8 3 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  above the daily average of
around 7 48 billion 
 Advancers outweighed decliners on the NYSE by about 9 to 8 
while on Nasdaq losers outpaced winners by about 5 to 4

142270,363785,HUM,Obamacare rescue ruled out by some states  others weigh options,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Five Republican state governors say they will not rescue a crucial part of Obamacare if it is struck down by the Supreme Court  underlining the prospect for a chaotic aftermath to a ruling that could force millions of Americans to pay much more for coverage or lose their health insurance  The Supreme Court is due to hear opening arguments in the case known as King v  Burwell on March 4  marking the second major challenge to President Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act  ACA  after the justices ruled in 2012 against a claim that it was unconstitutional  The latest case tests the tax credit subsidies at the core of Obamacare  In its ruling expected by June  the high court could bar the federally run insurance marketplace from providing the subsidies in at least 34 states  That could throw the insurance system into turmoil as states respond in starkly different ways  In response to Reuters  queries  spokespeople for the Republican governors of Louisiana  Mississippi  Nebraska  South Carolina and Wisconsin said the states were not willing to create a local exchange to keep subsidies flowing  Republicans argue that Obamacare is unacceptable government intervention that raises costs for consumers and businesses   State exchanges are the federal government s way of sticking states with the cost and responsibility of a massive new bureaucratic program   said Chaney Adams  a spokeswoman for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley    The right decision was made for South Carolina  and Governor Haley would make it again today       State government officials in Georgia  Missouri  Montana and Tennessee   a mix of Republicans and Democrats   said that opposition by majority Republican state legislators could make it all but impossible to set up a new exchange   Those nine states combined are home to 1 4 million people who have signed up for subsidized coverage in 2015  according to government data  The fate of 5 1 million residents in the remaining 25 states that have signed up for subsidized benefits on the HealthCare gov exchange is also unclear   Six states   Delaware  Maine  Ohio  Pennsylvania  South Dakota and Virginia   are discussing contingency plans to keep the subsidies but each faces substantial logistical or political barriers  according to officials   Ten states did not respond to Reuters queries  while three others had no comment  Iowa  Wyoming  Oklahoma and West Virginia said they were not currently considering setting up exchanges  Alaska said it has not ruled it out  and Arkansas said it was moving toward creating a state exchange in 2017   Republicans are opposed to Obamacare  but such a ruling could have a political cost in their states if hundreds of thousands of low to middle income people are priced out of health coverage  Even if states say they don t plan to set up exchanges  that could change closer to the ruling or afterwards as they come under pressure to avert spiraling insurance costs   We can say with some confidence that the insurance markets are likely to melt down  because only the sick people will stay in them and the others will find it unaffordable   said Drew Altman  who heads the non partisan Kaiser Family Foundation  STATES WEIGH WORKAROUNDS     The plaintiffs in King v  Burwell contend that the Affordable Care Act allows subsidies to be distributed only through state based exchanges  Thirteen states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges from October 2013   The remainder of states either opposed the law or could not find ways to make their own exchanges work  so the federal government stepped in  Insurers includ  NYSE AE  NYSE AET T ing Aetna Inc  Cigna Corp a  NYSE HU  NYSE HUM M nd Humana Inc are major players in the HealthCare gov markets  About 87 percent of enrollees in those states qualify for Obamacare subsidies  which can reduce a family s healthcare bill by thousands of dollars annually  A Milwaukee family of four earning the median U S  household income of  53 000  for example  could receive  7 800 a year in subsidies  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  A ruling against Obamacare would raise their monthly premium payments by at least  652  Congress could respond to a negative ruling with legislation to keep subsidies in place  But partisan gridlock would make any action a challenge   Health policy experts say the most likely fix to a ruling against the administration would involve a new type of partnership with the federal government or between states         Maine and Delaware have considered a model in which the state creates the exchange in name but still relies on the federal government s technology systems to run it  Marketplaces for Nevada  New Mexico and Oregon have operated in that fashion   But experts say this model could be rejected by the Supreme Court  because the ACA does not list the federal government as an entity with which states can By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Five Republican state governors say they will not rescue a crucial part of Obamacare if it is

stay in them and the others will find it unaffordable   said Drew Altman  who heads the non partisan Kaiser Family Foundation  STATES WEIGH WORKAROUNDS     The plaintiffs in King v  Burwell contend that the Affordable Care Act allows subsidies to be distributed only through state based exchanges  Thirteen states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges from October 2013   The remainder of states either opposed the law or could not find ways to make their own exchanges work  so the federal government stepped in  Insurers including Aetna Inc  Cigna Corp and Humana Inc are major players in the HealthCare gov markets  About 87 percent of enrollees in those states qualify for Obamacare subsidies  which can reduce a family s healthcare bill by thousands of dollars annually  A Milwaukee family of four earning the median U S  household income of  53 000  for example  could receive  7 800 a year in subsidies  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  A ruling against Obamacare would raise their monthly premium payments by at least  652  Congress could respond to a negative ruling with legislation to keep subsidies in place  But partisan gridlock would make any action a challenge   Health policy experts say the most likely fix to a ruling against the administration would involve a new type of partnership with the federal government or between states         Maine and Delaware have considered a model in which the state creates the exchange in name but still relies on the federal government s technology systems to run it  Marketplaces for Nevada  New Mexico and Oregon have operated in that fashion   But experts say this model could be rejected by the Supreme Court  because the ACA does not list the federal government as an entity with which states can contract for exchange services       Other workarounds that have been discussed include setting up regional exchanges that cover multiple states  or keeping the HealthCare gov website operating as a place to sign up for insurance but allowing states to disburse the federal subsidies      At the very least  states that are open to setting up their own exchange hope the Supreme Court allows for a transition period if it rules against the administration   
     A state based exchange from scratch in six months is probably not doable  We re trying to see what other states are doing and what may work and may not work   said Eric Cioppa  Maine s leading insurance official ",2015-02-17,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/obamacare-rescue-ruled-out-by-some-states,-others-weigh-options-328336",328336

   Monsanto tumbles as 2010 forecast below Street views
   Dow  S P up 0 5 pct  Nasdaq up 0 6 pct
  Updates to early afternoon  changes byline 
 By Chuck Mikolajczak
 NEW YORK  Sept 10  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Thursday
as a brighter outlook from consumer product company Procter  
Gamble and a successful Treasury debt auction put Wall Street
on pace for a fifth straight session of gains 
 Procter   Gamble was the Dow s biggest lift  climbing 3 7
percent to  55 77  after it affirmed its earnings forecast for
the current quarter and said sales would improve in the next
quarter 
 A third straight strong Treasury auction relieved concerns
about the U S  government s ability to fund its deficit 
 The sale of  12 billion of 30 year bonds  shows the U S 
ability to finance the deficit and its budget in light of the
supply and     the weak dollar  That is why stocks are trading
up   said Peter Boockvar  managing director and equity
strategist at Miller Tabak   Co 
 The potential for rising retail sales was encouraging for
investors  who view consumer spending as a critical component
to an economic recovery 
 Optimism was contained  however  by a 5 6 percent drop to
 78 79 for Monsanto after the world s biggest seed company
forecast fiscal 2010 earnings below Wall Street s estimates 
The S P materials index  shed 0 1 percent 
  This is just kind of a holding pattern   said Kevin
Kruszenski  head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets
in Cleveland   We ve had an advance  we ve drifted higher 
volume in August was very light  so it s hard to put too much
credence into the move 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 46 78 points  or
0 49 percent  to 9 594 00  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index   
 rose 4 85 points  or 0 47 percent  to 1 038 22  The Nasdaq
Composite Index  climbed 11 70 points  or 0 57 percent  to
2 072 09 
 Chip companies Texas Instruments and ASMLboth boosted their
sales outlooks in a signal consumers are spending cash on
personal technology and helped lift the PHLX semiconductor
index 1 percent 
  Now you are going to have to see a follow through in not
only economic data  but in companies  earnings and commentary
along those lines   Kruszenski said 
 If the market maintains its gains  it would mark five
consecutive advances and push the S P 500 index to its highest
level in nearly a year 
 Health insurance stocks rose 2 5 percent after analysts
said President Barack Obama s speech urging Congress to act on
health care reform contained nothing unexpected and indicated a
government run insurance option opposed by the industry was
less likely to pass 
 Cigna Corp rose 4 4 percent to  30 70 and Humana Inc gained
3 1 percent at  39 23 
 Yahoo Inc added 3 9 percent to  15 35 after Banc of America
Securities Merrill Lynch Research upgraded the company  saying
growth in user traffic continues to outpace growth in the
Internet as a whole 
 U S  traded shares of ASML rose 1 4 percent although Texas
Instruments shares slipped 0 3 percent to  25 06 
 Airlines stocks added 6 percent after J P  Morgan said
fundamentals for the U S  airlines sector are on the mend  and
upgraded UAL Corp and U S  Airways Group Inc 
 United airlines parent UAL Corp shares jumped 12 6 percent
to  4 03 while U S  Airways shares surged 17 5 percent to

142339,363854,HUM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Anthem  Cigna  Aetna  Humana And Molina Healthcare,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 06  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Health Insurance  Part 2  including Anthem Inc   NYSE        Cigna Corp   NYSE         Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    NYSE         Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    NYSE        and Molina Healthcare Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Health Insurance  Part 2

	Link  

	Though the health insurance industry has always faced regulations  the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare   enacted in 2010  was so heavy on regulatory oversight that it made health insurance almost synonymous with regulations  The reform  with its numerous provisions  took away working flexibility from insurers who were at ease before it was enacted 

	The industry did eventually adjust to the new regulatory regime  but they likely have to go through that process all over again as the GOP comes through on its  repeal   replace  mandate  The new law  called American Health Care Act  or AHCA  has been passed by the House of Representatives already and is currently in the Senate 

	A lot is still up in the air at this stage  but the overall expectation is that the new regulatory framework will provide for a relatively lighter regulatory touch and will be friendlier to the industry  That said  the expected change would have some negative effects on the industry as well 

	The year so far has been an eventful one for the industry  which saw two mega mergers   Anthem Inc   NYSE        with Cigna Corp   NYSE        and Aetna Inc   NYSE        with Humana Inc   NYSE          being blocked by regulators on antitrust concerns  The industry has also been receiving jolts from executive orders and the initial bill drafted by President Trump s aides in March 

Key AHCA Changes

	The new proposed law  AHCA  is a major departure from the existing statute  with some of its provisions potentially net negatives for the industry 


			AHCA gets rid of the individual mandate that required everyone to have health insurance 



			The new law changes the way Medicaid gets funded   from an open ended program to one with block grants or fixed amounts  Please note that Medicaid expansion was the primary avenue through which ACA expanded health coverage 



			Cutting down subsidies that were provided under the ACA to people enabling them to subsidized policies  The AHCA aim to replace these subsidies with tax credits  which is dependent on the age of the customer 


	Changes to the way Medicaid get funded represent the biggest change that the proposed law makes in the country s healthcare system  Changing Medicaid from an open ended entitlement to a fixed annual amount could potentially force states to become creative in how they administer this system  though most non partisan analysts expect the move to reduce the number of insured 

	A report from PwC estimates that insurers likely would lose most of the  1 9 trillion in federal ACA related subsidies slated to be doled out over the next 10 years  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates that 23 million people would lose health coverage by 2026 

	Per the CBO  AHCA would cause 14 million more people to be uninsured in 2018  The number is expected to reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026  In 2026  about 51 million people under the age of 65 would be uninsured compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under Obamacare  This is a potentially negative development for companies with Medicaid centric businesses such as Molina Healthcare Inc   NYSE        

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

Increasing business diversification  with ancillary services and products forming a growing portion of insurers  revenues  is also shielding insurersrom stiff regulations  mostly outside of the purview of the ACA   Credit also goes to growing international operations that have brought in geographical diversification  Despite these positives  health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges  Business underwritten on these exchanges resulted in significant losses for most of the players  consequently leading to a downsizing of this business 
Increasing operating cost to comply with regulations  investments in information technology  levy of fees and taxes have exerted pressure on margins 
The industry also continues to reel under regulatory uncertainty  with the proposed repeal and replacement of the old law with Donald Trump s American Health Care Act  The bill  which is currently awaiting approval in the Senate  has some provisions favoring the players  However  with some other provisions seeming unacceptable  a lot is still up in the air 
Despite the ambiguity and chaos in the sector  there are some companies with strong business fundamental that make up for attractive bets 
How to Pick the Right Stock
Value investing is always considered wise and is one of the best investing practices that can lead to long term gains  Value investing calls for betting on bargain stocks which are trading at prices below their inherent value  stocks that are cheap   but have strong businesses  These stocks take no time to jump when the markets goes up  thus giving investors a chance to gain from value appreciation of their holdings  The trick to successful long term investing is in picking value stocks 
But how do we find a value stock 
There are certain parameters that can gauge a value stock  These stocks may have low valuation meaning low price to book ratio  low price to earnings ratio or a low price to sales ratio  They may also have a high dividend yield  While it can be a daunting task to specifically look at each parameter and hunt for a value stock our search can be made simpler by the use of the new   designed by Zacks 
The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Value Style Score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  offer the best investing opportunities  Further  we have selected value stocks that have estimated earnings per share growth rate of 10  or more this fiscal year 
Three Picks  
WellCare Health Plans  Inc    NYSE WCG    providing managed care services targeted exclusively at government sponsored healthcare programs  has a long term earnings growth rate of 13 2   and a Value and Growth Score of  A  each  The company surpassed earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 59 23  
In the last one year  this Zacks Rank  1 stock has returned an impressive 62 2   while the Zacks categorized  industry has gained 32 4   The company has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 18 4  for 2017   You can see  
Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM    a healthcare company providing medical products  has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 3   and a Value Score and Growth Score of  A   The company beat earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 8 36  
In the past one year  this Zacks Rank  2 stock has enjoyed a bullish run and surged roughly 49 2   while the Zacks categorized Medical HMO industry has rallied 32 4   Anthem has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 8 18  for 2017 
Cigna Corp    NYSE CI    providing health care services and products  has a long term earnings growth rate of 13 2   and a Value Score and Growth Score of  B   The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 1 35  
In the past one year  this Zacks Rank  2 stock has gained 32 5   almost in line with the Zacks categorized Medical HMO industry s rise of 32 4   The company has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 20 3  for 2017 
Bottom Line
Despite the volatility in the healthcare sector  we suggest these stocks with positive attributes  a strong estimate revision trend and solid earnings growth forecast  These could be good bets for investors

142377,363892,HUM,Health Insurance Industry Outlook   June 2017,opinion,"The health insurance industry has been embroiled in a regulatory web since the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare  was passed in 2010  Even though industry players eventually warmed up to the law over the following years by adjusting their operations to the changed environment  they may have to go through the process all over again as the Trump administration attempts to replace ACA with its own version   
Many in the market doubt Congress s ability to repeal and replace ACA  but the U S  House of Representatives has already passed the American Health Care Act  ACHA  that would replace Obamacare  The bill is now in front of the Senate  though many suspect that the upper chamber plans to come up with a version of its own instead of starting out with the House version 
In the meantime  the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has estimated that while the proposed legislation will bring down the deficit and cut government spending  it will also cause the loss of insurance for 23 million people over the following 10 years  The CBO projections have likely made it difficult for a number of GOP senators to easily stand behind the House version 
The health insurance industry s strong performance this year reflects the market s understanding that these healthcare operators remain well placed  irrespective of the legislation s fate  Many other operators in the healthcare space  like hospital operators and drug companies  are not in that category 
The Zacks HMO industry is currently up  14  in the year to date period  outperforming the S P 500 index s  8 1  gain 
Why Health Insurance Stocks Still Have Some Upside Left
While the industry has outperformed the broader market lately  but valuations are far from stretched and leave room for further upside going forward 
The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at 16 7X forward 12 month consensus EPS estimates  which compares to 18 2X for the S P 500 index as a whole  Over the last 5 years  the industry has traded in a range of 8 6X to 18X  with a median of 14 3X  Please note that the low valuation point  8 6X multiple  was in mid 2012 when there was all around uncertainty about the impact of ACA on the industry s business 
What this shows is that while HMO stocks aren t cheap  they are not nose bleed expensive either

142379,363894,HUM,Will Health Insurers Have To Rework Under ACHA ,opinion,"Though the health insurance industry has always faced regulations  the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare   enacted in 2010  was so heavy on regulatory oversight that it made health insurance almost synonymous with regulations  The reform  with its numerous provisions  took away working flexibility from insurers who were at ease before it was enacted 
The industry did eventually adjust to the new regulatory regime  but they likely have to go through that process all over again as the GOP comes through on its  repeal   replace  mandate  The new law  called American Health Care Act  or AHCA  has been passed by the House of Representatives already and is currently in the Senate 
A lot is still up in the air at this stage  but the overall expectation is that the new regulatory framework will provide for a relatively lighter regulatory touch and will be friendlier to the industry  That said  the expected change would have some negative effects on the industry as well 
The year so far has been an eventful one for the industry  which saw two mega mergers  Anthem Inc   ANTM  with Cigna Corp   CI  and Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  with Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    HUM    being blocked by regulators on antitrust concerns  The industry has also been receiving jolts from executive orders and the initial bill drafted by President Trump s aides in March 
Key AHCA Changes
The new proposed law  AHCA  is a major departure from the existing statute  with some of its provisions potentially net negatives for the industry AHCA gets rid of the individual mandate that required everyone to have health insurance The new law changes the way Medicaid gets funded   from an open ended program to one with block grants or fixed amounts  Please note that Medicaid expansion was the primary avenue through which ACA expanded health coverage Cutting down subsidies that were provided under the ACA to people enabling them to subsidized policies  The AHCA aim to replace these subsidies with tax credits  which is dependent on the age of the customer Changes to the way Medicaid get funded represent the biggest change that the proposed law makes in the country s healthcare system  Changing Medicaid from an open ended entitlement to a fixed annual amount could potentially force states to become creative in how they administer this system  though most non partisan analysts expect the move to reduce the number of insured 
A report from PwC estimates that insurers likely would lose most of the  1 9 trillion in federal ACA related subsidies slated to be doled out over the next 10 years  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates that 23 million people would lose health coverage by 2026 
Per the CBO  AHCA would cause 14 million more people to be uninsured in 2018  The number is expected to reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026  In 2026  about 51 million people under the age of 65 would be uninsured compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under Obamacare  This is a potentially negative development for companies with Medicaid centric businesses such as Molina Healthcare Inc   MOH   Centene Corp   CNC  and WellCare Health Plans  Inc   WCG  
While the AHCA has yet to reach its final shape  let s look at the challenges facing the industry players  particularly with reference to ACA related issues 
Public Exchanges Woes
Public Exchanges made their debut in Oct 2013  and were considered one of the signature achievements of Obamacare  aimed at providing subsidized insurance to millions  The insurers were also sanguine about the exchanges  hoping to make big business out of them  but are struggling now 
These insurers are saddling high medical expenses of individuals who bought the subsidized policies under the health care law  The public exchanges attracted a disproportionate number of unhealthy individuals compared to healthy ones  A higher percentage of unhealthy patients led to higher claims for the insurers  thus leading to losses from the policies sold to these groups of people 
Big players like UnitedHealth Group Inc   UNH  and Aetna have significantly reduced their presence on these exchanges  Other players are also considering doing this  as well 
Margins Under Pressure
Health insurer margins have been under pressure lately  a trend that will likely continue til ACA related issues get addressed  A host of factors    including compliance costs related to health care reform regulation  increased fees and taxes  pricing pressure  stiff competition and rising medical costs    have been exerting pressure on the bottom line 
A general shift in patient mix from commercial insurance to government  Medicare  Medicaid and State subsidized marketplace or exchange  has also affected profitability to a large extent  Premiums for Medicare  Medicaid and state subsidized policies tend to be higher due to serious health issues for many enrollees  however  they carry smaller profitability margins compared to commercial insurance 
High Regulatory Cost
Regulatory reform sweeping through the sector has hit insurers with high compliance costs  Expenditures involved in redoing the internal systems has led to increased expenses  There has been huge spending on health information technology  HIT  following the implementation of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  or Recovery Act  which contains the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act  or the HITECH Act  Notably  HIT includes electronic health records or EHRs  health information exchanges or HIEs and other initiatives 
The federal government s emphasis on the use of health IT  which helps providers communicate better with each other about patient care  reduces medical errors  paperwork and needless duplicate screenings and tests  leading to better coordinated patient care and lower health care costs  These have increased health care information technology spending  Financial incentives offered by regulators to providers and hospitals for the implementation of the meaningful use of health care IT products are primarily driving IT spending 
Global Economic Woes and Regulatory ChallengesA fragile global economy presents a headwind for insurers looking to expand their international operations  One of the largest insurers  UnitedHealth Group  made an acquisition to reap benefits from the Brazil market but is now facing slowing growth rates in that country In the case of India  which remains one of the most profitable opportunities for insurers  the regulatory environment is still somewhat challenging  China    which merits the highest risk adjusted opportunity ranking  largely because of its immense scale    poses significant investment restrictions to foreign insurers entering and operating there

A lot of investors were probably looking at their calendars on Monday and wondering if it was another market holiday  After rallying in the final two sessions last week to give the major indices their second straight week of gains  stocks couldn t get it together today 
Despite a solid ISM Services report  the market had no momentum on Monday  The S P was down 0 12  to 2436 1  the Dow was off 0 10  to 21 184 and the NASDAQ slipped 0 16  to 6295 7  Nevertheless  the indices are still one moderately good day away from putting together another round of all time highs  With 2 400 in the S P now behind us  the next target is 2 480  let s round it up to 2 500 since the market likes its round numbers   I think that should come relatively quickly   said Kevin in today s Options Trader 
Stocks weren t alone in taking a breather today  so too did the editors  Activity in the portfolios really picked up along with the market last week  but it didn t carry over to today  The only moves came from the weekly realignment for Black Box Trader  However  the highlights section below offers some analysis from the portfolios and this week s Zacks Confidential Today s Portfolio Highlights Black Box Trader  Only one swap in this week s adjustment  The portfolio got out of Humana  NYSE HUM  with a 1 9  profit  and then replaced the name by buying The Chemours Co   CC   Read the Black Box Trader s Guide to learn more about this computer driven service designed to take the emotion out of investing Zacks Confidential  EVERYONE knows that tech is one of the hottest spaces in the market right now  But there s another industry that may be even hotter and practically NOBODY is paying attention  In this week s Zacks Confidential  Steve hands the keys over to Tracey Ryniec  who explains why the housing market provides one of the best buying opportunities out there  The space has recovered from the collapse nearly 10 years ago  so read her detailed article and get three recommendations by clicking  What s Hotter Than Tech  The Housing Market Reitmeister Trading Alert   Stocks closed above 2400 for the 7th straight session  That leaves very little doubt that a breakout is under way with likely more gains ahead   On Monday  the indices stalled out for the session  This is more about taking a breather than anything that is truly negative  In fact  the economic positives continued to roll in as ISM Services put up its 3rd best reading since the start of 2016   This is another in a string of strong economic reports which explains why GDP is looking like  3  in Q2 and explains why stocks should be heading higher in the days ahead      Steve ReitmeisterMomentum Trader   Stocks couldn t keep last week s momentum going on Monday  This week is setting up to be a bit of a snoozer with the FOMC next week  Until then it s likely to be  Thin to win  for equity markets   The market peaked around lunch time then faded off into the end of the session  The selling wasn t anything extraordinary but rather a slow trickle south   In terms of earnings and economic data it should be a slow week  Next week is the main event  That s when we ll get the Fed s decision on interest rates  Odds are they go ahead and hike for the second time this year  Until then  I expect more slow accumulation across the major market averages      Dave Bartosiak

142406,363921,HUM,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  TrimTabs Float Shrink ETF  Deckers  BestBuy  Humana And Kroger,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 10  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  TrimTabs Float Shrink ETF  BATS            Deckers  NYSE           BestBuy  NYSE           Humana  NYSE          and Kroger  NYSE          

Free Cash Flow  An Overlooked Metric for Finding Stocks 

	Since the presidential election in 2016  U S  stocks are posting a pretty solid performance including a roughly 13  gain for SPY  NYSE SPY   But while this double digit percentage performance is quite impressive  there are plenty of funds that have easily beaten out this gain 

	One that you might not be too familiar with  but has posted a 15  gain since the election  is the TrimTabs Float Shrink ETF  BATS            This fund focuses on companies that are reducing their share count but are also generating free cash flow 

	To get more information on this approach  I recently spoke with Ted Theodore  the Vice Chairman and CIO of TrimTabs  for some insights  In particular  we take a closer look at free cash flow and why focusing on this metric could be a good strategy for investors seeking quality stocks going forward  also read     

	What follows is the Q A we had on the topic  which should hopefully give investors some insights into this process 

Eric Dutram  What is  free cash flow  and why should investors put importance on this metric  

	Ted Theodore  Free cash flow is derived in several steps  Changes in working capital are subtracted from operating earnings in order to focus on actual changes in cash balances of the company  Then the amounts shown as depreciation and amortization expense are added back because no cash was utilized for those items during the period 

	The cash outlay for the items needing depreciation and or amortization were actually incurred prior to the current period  These calculations result in  cash flow   The amount the company spent on capital expenditures in the period is also subtracted  This final number is called  free cash flow  as it means the company s cash balances reflect not only changes in cash from operations  but also takes into account the necessity of the company to provide for its future growth through capital investments 

	In all regards  shareholder value is enhanced  Clearly  investors will have the sense of a much stronger  higher quality company where free cash flow is strong  Companies that generate strong free cash flows also can be potential takeover or merger candidates  In fact  one of our holdings   Swift Transportation   just announced a merger with another trucking company and the stock rose considerably after the announcement 

	Investors should care about this because companies that can string together years of free cash flow growth are able to outpace the S P 500  Unfortunately  those companies that have periods of sustained free cash flow declines see their stocks underperform the market 

Eric  What kinds of activities can companies engage in when they have strong free cash flows   Ted  The excess over free cash flow itself is available for any number of uses  Some of this amount can stay in the company and contribute to improving its fundamental balance between assets and liabilities  Some of the excess free cash flow can be used to acquire other companies and some of it can be returned to investors in the form of increased dividends 

Eric  Do you have any examples of companies with  strong  or  weak  free cash flow right now  

	Ted  Two companies we own that have strong free cash flow are Deckers  NYSE         and BestBuy  NYSE          Interestingly they are both in the consumer sector that has been under pressure from online shopping  Each company however has been able to steadily increase their presence in that channel as well as provide stronger merchandising than their competitors 

	At the other end of the spectrum  Humana  NYSE          and Kroger  NYSE         are struggling with competitors as well  but the challenges are even more daunting  In the case of Humana  regulatory uncertainties are contributing to having to cover more contingencies than the company is likely to desire  Kroger competes in an environment of both declining food and staples prices as well as brand new kinds of competition even from the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  

Eric  Are certain sectors industries more  or less  prone to companies with strong free cash flows  Is a good free cash flow in one industry a poor one in another  

	Ted  As it turns out  banks have historically chosen a particularly wide variety of ways to provide the basic accounting building blocks for calculating cash flow  While bank managers have been granted perfectly acceptable discretion to report in these different manners by their auditors  most other industries share common approaches to these values 

	On the other hand  and except for banks  we have not found much industry bias in the calculation of free cash flow to either accept or eliminate them from consideration  For that reason  free cash flow is a particularly useful metric to separate good and bad performers within and between industries 

	The actual portfolios are designed to equally weight each security at the time of purchase  Additionally  on average we invest in 100 companies  The resulting sector allocations just reflect these three guiding factors  rather than a top down sector preference  As we use an equal weighting process with a large number of stocks  it is clear we want the benefits of diversification  But recognizing the chance that this approach could result in a truly unbalanced portfolio from a sector perspective  we actively monitor that bet  Yet  as implied here  it is a secondary consideration 

Eric  How might investors utilize this strategy in today s uncertain market environment  

	Ted  While very few companies are completely isolated from the impact of the general environment for the economy  companies that have exhibited strong free cash flow have built something of a cushion should times become uncertain  These are companies likely to be relatively the last to feel an overall downturn 

Eric  How does a product like TTAC fit into an investor s portfolio  

	Ted  Over the years our process implies the portfolios will likely have about the same risk as the market  And given the large number of stocks in the portfolio and the fact that they are not weighted by market capitalization  we tend to create returns which have similar risk to the overall market  So  we consider our strategy to fit into the  core  category rather than one of the satellite kind  But even with market risk  our emphasis on strong long term fundamentals  implemented with quantitative disciplines  gives the chance to outperform the broad market

142407,363922,HUM,Aetna  AET  Calls It Quits On Unsustainable Public Exchanges,opinion,"In the wake of continued loss incurred by its public exchange business  health insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   has announced to pull back its presence in all the remaining states where it is operates now The company will now make an exit from the public exchanges in the states of Delaware and Nebraska  Last month  the company called it quits on Iowa and Virginia  With the exits  the company will now be virtually absent from the public exchange business Losses to the tune of  700 million from 2014 2016 from the public exchange business drained the company s bottomline  Despite having curbed its exposure  the company still anticipates a loss of  200 million in 2017 These losses and other headwinds such as merger led uncertainty have led shares to gain 31 7  over the past one year  However  this compares favorably with the  Zacks categorized  industry which has gained 34 4  Aetna joins other players  with UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   being the frontrunners  in folding up the public exchange business  It was the first health insurer in the industry to cut its exposure to the painful public exchange business  It was present in only three states in 2017  down substantially from 34 states last year  Other insurers like Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   and Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   are also cautious of this business Individual Public Exchange  a signature achievement of Obamacare was created to provide insurance to individuals and offer subsidies based on income levels  Insurers were hopeful of making gains out of the provision that was anticipated to provide steep membership growth between 2015 and 2019  But it did not turn out as expected  Soon the public exchange business started losing sheen as it attracted a greater number of old and sick population in comparison with the young and healthy ones  which increased the overall risk profile of the members insured on public exchanges  It therefore led to higher than expected claim cost and consequent losses Public exchanges are now detested all the more as this provision has come under the critical eye of Donald Trump  who via his repeal and replace plans has created significant uncertainty related to its future  The GOP s plan calls for the elimination of Obamacare subsidies  which are refundable tax credits based on a person s income and cost of coverage in their area  The subsidies made it easy to buy insurance on exchanges  The scrapping of these subsidies will drive them away from the exchanges

142440,363955,HUM,Stocks To Watch Ahead Of GOP Healthcare Vote,opinion,"After seven long years of promising to repeal President Obama s landmark Affordable Care Act  House Republicans finally think that they have enough votes to pass their replacement bill  Representatives are scheduled to vote on the new American Health Care Act on Thursday following several last minute changes that convinced key moderates and conservatives to support it 
The House vote will likely come down to the wire  and it s even more likely that the Senate makes key revisions to the bill  but getting the law out of this chamber of Congress would be a clear political victory for Republican leadership and the Trump administration 
Although some pundits expected the GOP to delay its healthcare reform after the original version of the AHCA was canned  the current iteration of the bill garnered centrist and right wing support relatively quickly 
The GOP s new plan would eliminate Obamacare subsidies which are based on income and cost of coverage in their area and replace them with refundable tax credits based mainly on age  The credits would be worth around  2 000 for those in their 20s to  4 000 for those in their 60s  Credits for people making more than  75 000 would begin to taper our  while people making more than  215 000 would not be eligible for the credits at all 
The AHCA would also do away with the individual and employer mandates  two staples of Obamacare  The individual mandate requires that people have a health insurance plan or face a tax  and the employer mandate requires companies with more than 50 employees to offer an affordable plan to their full time workers 
These mandates would be replaced by continuous coverage requirements  which levy surcharges on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for a certain amount of time  An amendment to the bill now allows states to seek waivers that would replace these requirements with one that allows insurance companies to charge people who had a coverage lapse based on their health 
Critics of the new law claim that the state waiver process weakens coverage for those with pre existing conditions  While Obamacare absolutely bars any insurer from denying coverage based on a pre existing condition  the new law allows states to seek waivers that could allow insurance companies to set premiums based on one s medical background  States would also be able to apply for waivers that would allow insurers to sell plans that don t include benefits mandated by Obamacare 
Another point of controversy is the plan s overhaul of Medicaid  The law includes several major changes to Medicaid  including a general shift in responsibility from the federal government to the states  This would likely result in less overall funding for the program  which could result in coverage rollbacks 
A Congressional Budget Office study projects that the AHCA would cut the federal government s Medicaid spending by 25  by 2026  The CBO also said that the new law would result in 24 million more uninsured people by that year 
So how should investors approach today s monumental vote  Well  like with anything that brings uncertainty into play  it s best to approach with caution 
Of course  the most important stocks to watch will be the massive insurance companies  including UnitedHealth   NYSE UNH    Anthem   NYSE ANTM    Humana   NYSE HUM    Aetna   NYSE AET    and Cigna   NYSE CI   
If you glance back at their historical prices  these stocks didn t have a massive immediate reaction to the passage of Obamacare in March 2010  but they have all been climbing higher since  In fact  insurers are hitting new highs despite their struggles to profit on Obamacare enrollees 
Investors should also keep an eye on the major health related ETFs  Those that could see an effect from today s vote include the iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF   iShares U S  Medical Devices ETF   MT IHI    iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF   SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF   and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  
All of these industries will be impacted  as the GOP plan has wide ranging repercussions for overall access to care  as well as taxes imposed on companies and consumers  However  the same could be said about Obamacare  and historical price data shows that these tickers were all relatively flat during the week that the law passed 
Investors will likely display some sort of initial reaction  but the market could be hesitant regardless of whether the vote passes or not  As mentioned  the Senate will likely make changes  and there seems to be a certain lingering uncertainty about how the AHCA will look in practice as there also was with Obamacare

142441,363956,HUM,No Fear   but No Rally Yet Either,opinion,"The election of Emmanuel Macron as France s new President this weekend was only the latest bit of reassuring news that the market has enjoyed in recent days  Last week  we received a strong jobs report following an alarmingly weak one in the previous month  and the House showed that it can still do something when it passed a healthcare bill  All of this comes amid a solid earnings season and mostly encouraging economic data 
And yet the major indices couldn t get a rally going on Monday  The S P was up only 0 09 of a point  or 0   to 2399 4  The Dow and NASDAQ could each climb only 0 03  to 21 012 3 and 6102 7  respectively 
However  it is important to know that the VIX  a k a   the fear gauge   is at its lowest point in more than 20 years   The VIX is our biggest clue to determining if last night was some kind of top   said Jeremy in Counterstrike   Falling well under 10 and the lowest close since  93  the VIX tells us there is absolutely no fear out there and it s only a matter of time before we grind higher  
Speaking of Counterstrike  the portfolio added a company on Monday that moved lower after a triple digit earnings surprise  Jeremy knows it s the work of high frequency traders  and he plans to ride this stock back up when they re done  Meanwhile  Black Box Trader replaced six names this week  and one of the sells was a double digit winner  Take a look at the highlights section below 
Today s Portfolio Highlights 
Zacks Counterstrike  When a company reports a 188  positive surprise and then dips by double digits shortly thereafter  there s a good chance that the high frequency traders are playing some games  Such was the case with Boise Cascade  BCC   a Zacks Rank  1 wood products manufacturer and building products distributor  Jeremy sees a great opportunity here  so he added BCC to the portfolio on Monday with a 13  allocation  The full write up has more on this company s earnings and a look at its chart

Reitmeister Trading Alert   Small caps are losing again this year  Just like 2014  Just like 2015  Just like most of 2016 
 This is very odd for a bull market since small caps generally lead the charge  The only time in recent memory they have been in the lead is right after the election through the end of 2016 when small caps beat large caps by 3 to 1 spread  Since then large caps have flipped the script leading by nearly 4 to 1 
 Yes  one could look at this information and say the momentum is on the side of large caps  But the value oriented contrarian in me sees the exact opposite  That large caps are getting played out and small caps are about ready to shine  I would even bet that once the market finally breaks above 2400 is exactly when small caps take the lead      Steve Reitmeister

142482,363997,HUM,Dark Clouds On Humana s Horizon,opinion,"It was a nice run  but Humana s upside potential is limited from now on
The last eight years must have been great for Humana Inc  NYSE HUM   investors  From its March 2009 bottom at  18 57  the stock has gained over  200 a share or roughly 1077   That is 36 2  compounded annually  which is a great return in anybody s book  Humana closed slightly below its all time high yesterday  which is a strong indication that investors are felling as if the uptrend is going to last forever  But is it  Of course not and our job is to try to determine what is left of it by applying the  to Humana s weekly price chart given below 
The chart above shows the stock s entire rally since 2009  According to the theory  a five wave  is what every trend is made of  Humana seems to be confirming that by drawing a clear impulsive pattern  whose wave V is still developing  Unfortunately  every five wave sequence is followed by a three wave correction of similar magnitude in the opposite direction  This means that once wave V exceeds the top of wave III  a major bearish reversal would be likely  In our opinion  investors should not get too carried away by Humana s impressive performance in the last eight years  The  of wave IV near  150 a share is a reasonable target of the anticipated decline  It looks like the bull party is approaching to its end and in the stock market  latecomers always suffer the most ",2017-03-14,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dark-clouds-on-humana’s-horizon-200178843,200178843
142483,363998,HUM,Aetna  AET  Hurt By Exchange Business  High Medical Costs,opinion,"Shares of health insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   underperformed over the past one year  While the stock returned 17 7   the Zacks categorized  industry gained 24 3  
The underperformance is likely to have resulted from a number of issues bothering the company of late  Its merger with Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   was ripped apart recently on regulatory concerns  The deal would have positioned Aetna as a major Medicare provider   a market coveted by all other players in the industry 
Aetna has been troubled by its public exchange business  After incurring loss on public exchanges in 2015  Aetna bore a pre tax operating losses of  450 in 2016  Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017  Based on its current view of open enrollment  the company projects that its first quarter Individual Commercial membership will decline to 240 000 from approximately 965 000 at year end 2016  The company also projects losses on its Individual Commercial ACA compliant products in 2017 
Aetna s membership has also been under pressure  The company ended 2016 with medical membership of 23 1 million  down from 23 49 million in 2015  It is witnessing continued pressure in membership growth in the middle market and small group businesses due to its previous pricing actions to improve margins  The company  expects 22 2 to 22 3 million medical members in the first quarter of 2017 
Aetna is also facedwith an increase in medical benefit ratio  MBR   which measures medical cost as a percentage of premium revenues  Total MBR for full year 2016 was 81 8   up from 80 8  in 2015  The increase was driven by an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products and lower favorable development of prior period healthcare cost estimates for Government business  The company projects full year 2017 total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio in the range of 84  to 85   representing an increase of 270 basis points year over year at the midpoint of the range 
Despite these challenges  we believe the company will achieve long term growth on the back of its strongly performing government business  cost control measures  growing accountable care organization initiative  expanding international markets and a strong capital position 
Aetna carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks from the medical space are UnitedHealth Group  Inc    NYSE UNH   and Inogen Inc    NASDAQ INGN    While Inogen sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   UnitedHealth holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Inogen beat earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 49 08  UnitedHealth beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3 80

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Aetna Earnings Beat Estimates in Q4  Revenues MissAetna reported fourth quarter 2016 earnings of  1 63 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 45 and improving 19  year over year  The earnings upside was primarily driven by higher fees and other revenue in Aetna s Health Care segment Better than expected earnings drove up the share price by 1 92  in pre market trading Aetna posted operating revenues of  15 72 billion  a tad below our consensus estimate of  15 9 billion  but up 4  year over year Revenue growth was primarily led by higher premiums in Aetna s Health Care segment Total operating expenses were  3 6 billion  12 8  higher year over year  due to increased health care cost  and higher selling expense  and general and administrative expense Adjusted operating expense ratio was 19 8   down from 20 5  in the year ago quarter  The reduction in operating expense ratio was due to the increase in revenue coupled with the company s focus on expense management that paid off Fourth quarter pre tax operating margin was 6 4   up 40 basis points year over year Medical membership at Dec 31  2016 remained flat sequentially at 23 1 million Full year 2016 earnings per share of  8 23 increased 7  year over year  while revenues of  63 05 billion were up 5  year over year Segmental PerformanceAetna s Health Care segment recorded operating revenues of  15 billion  up 4 2  year over year  The revenue increase was primarily due to higher premium yields and membership growth in Aetna s Government business  This was somewhat offset by membership loss in Aetna s Commercial insurance business Operating earnings increased 18 3  from the year ago quarter to  582 million Aetna s Group Insurance operating revenues were up by just 0 3  year over year to  621 million  Operating earnings  however  increased 50  year over year to  33 million  due toimproved underwriting margins in Aetna s long term care products  partially offset by lower underwriting margins in life products At Large Case Pensions  operating revenues were down 4 5  year over year to  64 million  Operating earnings were up 25  year over year to  5 million Financial PositionTotal assets were  39 2 billion as of Dec 31  2016 compared with  53 5 billion as on Dec 31  2015 Total debt to consolidated capitalization ratiowas 53 6  at Dec 31  2016 compared with 32 6  at Dec 31  2015  due to the issuance of  13 billion of senior notes to partially fund the proposed acquisition of Humana  NYSE HUM  Days claims payablewere 54 at Dec 31  2016  down 3 days sequentially 2017 GuidanceThe company expects 2017 operating earnings of  at least  8 55  per share

142511,364026,HUM,Will Health Insurers Suffer From Trump Presidency ,opinion,"One of the biggest campaign promises made by President elect Donald Trump was the dismantling and replacing of Obamacare  officially known as the Affordable Care Act  or ACA   the signature legislation passed through Congress and enacted during President Obama s two terms in office  Health insurance companies provided a major overhaul of their business plans to comply  and now they look to be put on a new road forward 
So yesterday  in lieu of an actual replacement policy being made public as of yet  healthcare insurance companies have put forward a list of ACA benefits they do not want to see removed  if when Obamacare is officially taken apart  First is a commitment to offset some healthcare costs for low income Americans  They also consider young people signing up for health insurance is crucial to keeping costs low for the companies 
Already tough sledding for insurers to provide appropriate care for its customers  without these provisions made by the incoming administration   and Trump and his team have been mum on this issue to this point   insurers will be abandoning the system en masse  and complete failure of the ACA would eventually amount to more than 22 million Americans currently insured for healthcare thrown out into the cold 
Healthcare insurers   including the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Humana  NYSE HUM    The Joint Corp  and WellCare    do not want this to happen  But America s Health Insurance Plans  a leading industry trade group  and presumably the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  which has not yet issued a public statement on this matter  are concerned about dire consequences in the industry should the ACA be removed without a suitable replacement  At very least  the organizations would like three years to re set the table for their businesses and their shareholders 
With tens of millions of new customers on the rolls  health insurers are in no mood to go back to the way things were  Yet what course the new law   assuming there is one   takes going forward will have major consequences on the  4 2 trillion Health Care industry ",2016-12-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-health-insurers-suffer-from-trump-presidency-200168711,200168711

142513,364028,HUM,Stock Exchange  Diverse Ideas  But A Presidential Veto ,opinion,"Last week s  illustrated how human traders could call upon models as  consultants   effectively creating their own trading room  If you missed the post  please check it out  This week the gang is short on fresh ideas   and I vetoed one of them  We never reach for new trades  and that itself is a good tale 

My crew varies widely in reading skills  Felix reads everything   and very carefully  Oscar reads the sports section  Holmes is a dog  Athena does not read since she already knows everything  It is my job to keep up with relevant world events  and our modeling guru s  Vince  to create and monitor systems  One way that we judge our team is by comparing our approach to the recommendations of Brett Steenbarger  He is the world class leader when you want to combine the theoretical and the practical  This  why trading methods need a deep foundation 


  S uccessful traders must be able to innovate at two levels  First  they must find new ideas and fresh opportunities  Second  they must cultivate new sources of ideas and opportunity  The first involves exploiting the edges we already possess  the second involves identifying additional edges  The successful trader is never static  never dependent on one type of market condition to make a living  Just as research and development is the lifeblood of technology and pharmaceutical companies  it is the source of long term success for traders 
When successful traders aren t trading  they are researching  developing  and innovating  When unsuccessful traders aren t trading  they re staring at screens and forcing trades  There is nothing better for trading psychology than being at the cutting edge of a growing business 


This is great advice  Traders who sit staring at a screen when nothing is happening are simply wasting time  It also illustrates the usefulness of having teammates to provide other ideas and spark the thought processes  Let s take a look at this week s ideas  As usual  I will conclude with a brief observation

This Week When to Reject a Trading Idea

Holmes

This week I m buying Fomento Economico Mexicano  NYSE FMX   a distributor of soft drinks  owner of small format stores  and investments in the Heineken Group 

For the last year this stock has  until Nov 7th  bounced between the mid 80s and mid 90s piquing my interest in a trade  Then  and fortunately  before I had the chance to pull the trigger  it swooned down to 75 and has been basing there for the last 2 months  I don t really understand why it dropped so quickly and so precipitously  but now that it s basing I don t care 

So  I m buying here with tight stop  72  and looking for a move back into the mid 80s  It is a nice risk reward setup 




J  You said that you are buying  Did you come into some money 

H  Uhh   I meant that I am recommending to our clients 

J  It is an interesting idea  but we are not making the trade 

H  Why not  It fits my criteria very nicely 

J  On rare occasions  we humans override decisions from the trading models 

H  Why would you ever do that 

J  Because we know the criteria you use and monitor facts that you might not be seeing 

H  I see the stock price  volume and other technical indicators  What more do I need to know 

J  Sometimes there are dips that do not really provide a near term rebound potential  In this case  our new President is talking tough on trade with Mexico  The Peso is lower  A time to buy may come  but there are much better opportunities right now 

H  What is a President 

J  That is exactly what I mean 


Athena

I admit it  I have nothing new this week  The current market has not generated fresh  strongly trending stocks 

J  That is fine  As you know  it is a mistake to reach for trades  Stick to those that have significant edge  How about reviewing one of your recent choices 

A   hasn t done much yet  You were skeptical from the beginning  You said that you liked the sector but it had gone too far  too fast  I had originally planned to hang on for a few weeks at most  Part of me feels like it s time to get out of this holding and move on to the next thing 

J  This is another name caught up in the Trump transition speculation  When the expectations for short term interest rates get some clarity  the bank stocks will react  This holding is OK   for now 




Felix

I will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list 

My list provides rankings within each zone  as well as the basics about buy  hold  and sell  The list includes the top overall vote getters from our  free  subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week 

J  The stocks are about the same as last week 

F  The list changes  but only as the reader favorites change  I encourage my fans to submit requests 

J  The order of the ratings has changed  Are you going to resume showing us the week over week comparison 

F  I am thinking about that problem  Some of the stocks were not rated last week  For the moment  readers must follow their favorites each week 

J  Maybe we ll get some good new suggestions  What is your featured stock for this week 

F  You will not like my answer  I have nothing new this week 

J  That is what you said last week  Aren t we still reviewing your request for a raise 

F  Yes  but you should base your decision on my results  not the number of picks  My holding period is longer  As you know I have had the best performance since you added me in September  I have been better than the dog  and a lot better than Oscar 

J  The lawyers say that we cannot discuss performance online   only when we have an investor request  Instead  how about reviewing one of your recent selections 

F  My recent pick of PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  is sure to make Athena jealous  Since  on December 29  the price has popped a tasty 3   Of course   short term returns aren t really my thing  I ll probably be holding on here for another few months  at the very least 

J  That has worked out well  I agree that it is consistent with some of your other long term holdings 




Oscar


Here are my ratings for the top reader interests  There are still three open slots  so keep the questions coming 

J  Interesting  What do you have for us this week 

O  I m getting into a new sector this week  Healthcare Services  Just look at the chart for Humana  NYSE HUM   It s ridiculous  I don t think I ve ever seen a 50 day moving average shoot up at a 45 degree angle before  Now you are the public policy guy  not me  so does this really make sense 

J  No one really knows just yet  We know that there will be a  repeal and replace  policy on ObamaCare  The outlines of this are still pretty vague  I have written on this subject several times  I am standing back until there is more clarity 

O  You cannot always sit on the sidelines  This is worth a shot  As far as timeframes are concerned  I almost certainly won t hold onto this for longer than a month  That is  unless someone who reads something other than the sports section can find a reason to do otherwise  BTW  I think there could be some upsets this weekend 

J  Isn t your fantasy football season over 

O  Yes  I am working on becoming an NBA expert while I wait for March Madness

142514,364029,HUM,4 Trade Ideas In Humana  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Humana  NYSE HUM   stock price had moved mainly sideways for more than a year into early November  The last 3 months of that was a very tight range consolidation  It started to move higher after the election and continued until the calendar turned to December  It pulled back for 3 days  in a 3 Black Crows candlestick pattern  but quickly found support at the round figure 200  Since then it has been consolidating under resistance at 207  in an expanding triangle  That hit the 100 day SMA last week and quickly rose to the top of the range where it now sits 
A break higher would give a target to 247 on a Measured Move  Momentum indicators back a break higher  The RSI is rising and on the edge of a move back over 60 in the bullish zone  The MACD is crossed up and starting to rise into positive territory  The Bollinger Bands  are running flat though  neither supporting a move higher nor deterring it 
There is resistance above the 207 level at 217  This was also the high in May 2015  Support lower comes at 200 and 197 followed by 192 50 and 180  Short interest is low under 1   The company is expected to report earnings next on May 3rd  It pays a dividend of just over 0 5  and went ex dividend last January 10th  so is not likely to declare another until April  A positive picture in the chart 
The options chains show large open interest this week at the 200 strike and then also on the call side at 220  In March monthly options there is not much open interest built yet but what is there is spread from 190 to 200 on the put side and focused at 210 on the call side  April monthly options show the biggest open interest at the 170 put and then some at the 215 call 
May options  the first beyond the next earnings report  show the biggest open interest below the current price  at the 200 strike  Farther out  the August chain shows a large 185 215 risk reversal or strangle  while the January 2018 expiry has largest open interest at the 240 call strike  A neutral to short term bearish picture and then longer term bullish one in the options 
Humana  Ticker  HUM
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 207 with a stop at 198 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 207 and add an April 205 190 Put Spread   6 90  for protection while selling an April 215 Call   5 30 credit  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the August 205 215 Call Spread   7 40  and sell the August 185 Put  8 20 credit  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 2018 Expiry 210 240 Call Spread   14 90  and sell the 190 Put   15 70 credit  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into February Options Expiration week sees the equity markets looking strong if not moving towards getting overheated 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil churns marking time  The US Dollar Index is looking stronger while US Treasuries consolidate in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look strong and ready for more upside 
Volatility looks to remain at extremely low levels keeping the wind at the back of the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts all look great and ready for more upside in the longer timeframe but the SPY and QQQ are getting a bit hot in the short term and may need a rest  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  126  and Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  206  announced that they have mutually ended their merger agreement following a ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granting a United States Department of Justice request to enjoin the merger  AET will pay HUM  1 0 billion as a result of the termination and AET has terminated its previously announced agreement to sell certain Medicare Advantage assets to Molina Healthcare Inc  NYSE MOH  59   AET was higher  while shares of HUM dipped

Fed Chief keeps March rate hike on the table
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered the first of her two day semi annual Congressional economic and monetary policy testimony in front of the Senate Banking Committee  Yellen noted that changes in U S  fiscal and other policies are sources of uncertainty  while reiterating that waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise  potentially requiring the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  to eventually raise rates rapidly  which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession 
Yellen pointed out that incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent  consistent with the FOMC s expectations  Yellen added 

At our upcoming meetings  the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations  in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate 

If economic data continues to surprise on the upside  a March rate hike is likely to be on the table  while there is an additional risk that the Fed may be forced to speed up the tightening process should inflation accelerate from here 
The Producer Price Index  PPI  showed prices at the wholesale level in January were up 0 6  month over month  m m   above the Bloomberg expectation calling for a 0 3  gain and December s downwardly revised 0 2  rise  The core rate  which excludes food and energy  increased 0 4   versus forecasts of a 0 2  advance and December s downwardly revised 0 1  increase  Y Y  the headline rate was 1 6  higher  north of projections of a 1 5  increase  and the core PPI rose 1 2  last month  versus estimates of a 1 1  gain  In December  producer prices were up 1 6  for both the headline and core rates 
The National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index for January ticked higher to 105 9 from December s 105 8 level  compared to forecasts calling for a decline to 105 0  This was the highest reading since December 2004 
Treasuries were lower  as the yields on the 2 year and the 10 year notes  as well as the 30 year bond  rose 3 basis points  bps  to 1 23   2 47  and 3 06   respectively 
Stocks remain at record highs  while Treasury yields and the U S  dollar continue to regain some upward momentum in the wake of Yellen s comments  While markets may exhibit increasing volatility  we believe the bull market is being supported by tangible and effective indicators of global growth 
Tomorrow  the U S  economic calendar will ramp up sharply  with the Q A session of Fed Chair Yellen s two day Congressional testimony being accompanied by MBA mortgage applications  the Empire Manufacturing Index  the Consumer Price Index  industrial production and capacity utilization  the NAHB Housing Market Index  and business inventories  However  the headlining report could be the release of January retail sales  given the importance of the consumer on domestic economic output 
The headline figure is projected to show sales ticked 0 1  higher m m  after December s 0 6  increase  Excluding autos  sales are forecasted to rise 0 4  after December s 0 2  gain  while stripping out autos and gas  sales are anticipated to show a 0 3  increase  after being flat in the prior month  The retail sales control group  a figure used in the calculation of GDP  is expected to rise 0 4   doubling December s gain 
The outlook for American consumer spending appears to be improving  with consumer confidence rising and wages ticking higher  However  spending on traditional retail items has been cautious and competition among retailers may limit profitability  resulting in our marketperform rating for the consumer discretionary sector 
Europe mixed amid data and Yellen s testimony  Asia finished lower 
European equity markets finished mixed and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed after a five session winning streak  Traders digested some equity and economic data  along with today s Congressional testimony from U S  Fed Chief Janet Yellen  where she kept the possibility of a March rate hike on the table  The global markets have rallied as of late as sentiment has shifted to optimism regarding U S  President Donald Trump s reflationary polices from concerns about trade and immigration  Also  the markets have shrugged off festering political uncertainty in the region ahead of some key elections 
Eurozone 4Q GDP growth slightly missed expectations  while UK consumer price inflation fell to weigh on the British pound  The euro was lower as the U S  dollar reversed to the upside on Yellen s comments  while bond yields in the region gained ground 
Stocks in Asia finished lower following the recent global market rally on resurfaced optimism of U S  President Trump s reflationary policies that has taken some of the focus off of exacerbated trade and immigration concerns  The markets were cautious ahead of today s beginning of U S  Fed Chair Yellen s Congressional testimony  Japanese equities fell  with the yen regaining some of yesterday s drop  while stocks in China and Hong Kong both finished flat amid lingering liquidity uncertainty and as traders digested hotter than expected reads on January consumer and wholesale price inflation figures  After the closing bell  China reported mixed lending statistics for last month 
Elsewhere  securities traded in Australia and South Korea declined  while India s market finished little changed in the wake of yesterday s hotter than anticipated wholesale price inflation report  which added credence to last week s decision by the Reserve Bank of India s to move to a neutral monetary policy stance from its previous accommodative position 
Unlike the U S   tomorrow s international economic calendar will be fairly light and include consumer sentiment from Australia  CPI from Spain  employment data from the UK and the Eurozone s trade balance ",2017-02-15,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-finish-higher-despite-march-rate-hike-hint-200175720,200175720
142542,364057,HUM,Rate Hike Possible,opinion,"Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer spoke in Chile this morning at a central bank conference  in which he said the case for removing accommodation  raising interest rates  is  quite strong   He said he is optimistic a rate hike would be manageable abroad  and that a stronger U S  economy should help other countries 
	Fischer also said that  over time  rates can be expected to plateau at lower levels than normal  Which would mean the vice chair does not expect inflation nor interest rates to run out of control in the months and years ahead 
	These statements come even after we all absorb the initial plans from President elect Trump   borrowing for massive infrastructure spending  which is innately inflationary  That Fischer still looks toward modest growth domestically overall may say something about the larger scope of the U S  economy over the next year or two 
	This would tend to lead to a discussion over expected tariffs with foreign nations the U S  does lots of trading with  Take China  for instance   if goods manufactured there are suddenly faced with big import costs  that country s government may  more than  may   choose to make it harder for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   or Facebook  NASDAQ FB   to make inroads there 
	Meaning growth in some sectors like construction and materials looks to essentially be transferred from others like technology  Not to say the U S  economy is a zero sum game   historically  it definitely is not   but that gangbusters growth in all industries for the dawning of the Trump Era is not very realistic 
	After the bell Thursday  Disney  underperformed Q3 earnings estimates on both top and bottom lines  Earnings per share of  1 10 missed the consensus by 5 cents and fell 8  year over year  whereas  13 14 billion in revenues was lower than the  13 47 billion expected  Declining subscriber numbers in the company s ESPN division looks to have played a big part in the miss 
	That said  the entertainment conglomerate is bullish on digital bundle offerings in the future  and CEO Michael Iger said he intends to  look expansively  at  opportunities to create more value  for Disney  What might this mean  Dare we speculate Disney buying Twitter  might help synergies between bolstering ESPN and utilizing the troubled social media company s algorithmic value  Or  keeping the Trump initiatives in mind  would Disney do better investing in raw materials for building a giant wall 
	In other earnings highlights  Humana  NYSE HUM   posted solid Q3 numbers and upwardly revising guidance  hitting a new 52 week high in the process  AstraZeneca  saw sales slow in its Q3  but earnings beat estimates in the quarter  JCPenney  posted another quarterly loss  but narrower than expected ",2016-11-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rate-hike-possible-200164229,200164229

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Bet on Stocks with Rising P E to Enjoy Growing Gains

	Betting on bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a convenient investment approach  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher is the value of the stock  This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run 

	But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 

Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 

	Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 

	So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 

	Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth

Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero

	 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  

Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks

Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks

	 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  

Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 

Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500 

	 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  

Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100  

	 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see     

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000    High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 39 

	Here are five out of the 39 stocks 

Edgewell Personal Care Company   NYSE          This is a personal care products company with aZacks Industry Rank in the top 33   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1 

Cambrex Corporation   NYSE          This is a manufacturer of specialty chemicals presently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28

142569,364084,HUM,After Obamacare  How Will TrumpCare Treat Insurers ,opinion,"Now that the presidency of Donald Trump is certain  Obamacare is shrouded in uncertainty  In any case  Trump s intention of repealing this law was clear from the very beginning  The Healthcare Reform Act  which was formed in 2010 by Barack Obama faced constant friction since its inception  This time  it is being opposed by the President elect himself The sense of urgency to replace the law was evident in Trump s comment in the final week of his campaign  He had declared   We will do it  and we will do it very  very quickly  It is a catastrophe  Trump proposed to repeal and replace Obamacare with Health Savings Accounts  HSAs  and a series of offers encouraging free market competition  These include encouraging the sale of insurance policies across state lines  and making individual health insurance premium payments fully tax deductible Trump is however  favoring one key mandate of the law which prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to people with preexisting medical problems or from over charging them  Though some of the changes proposed by Trump will encourage healthy competition among health insurers  the proposal to cover patients with a preexisting condition will be a major hurdle 
Insurers have already said that covering preexisting diseases turns out costly for them unless healthy patients enroll en masse to offset the cost of insuring the sick population  which can only be achieved by an individual mandate  a feature of Healthcare Reform the Trump wants to undo Reaction of InsurersStocks of the insurers had a mixed reaction to the outcome  While insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   gained on hopes that the new governance will help them through the merger  other players such as Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   carrying a Zacks Rank   2  Buy   Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and Molina Healthcare Inc    NYSE MOH   suffered  You can see  Medical   HMOs Industry Price Index

Will a Repeal Be Easy Modifying Obamacare will bring its own set of woes  It is likely to raise the number of Americans without insurance by 24 million and increase the deficit by  353 billion over 10 years  according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office How Did Insurers Fare Under Obamacare Obamacare was one of the most sweeping changes experienced by the health care industry  Its numerous provisions put a bridle on the players and changed the face of the industry  After opposing vehemently to the law initially  the players somehow embraced it  This resulted in significant modifications to their business that included new product launches  geographical diversification  growing ancilliary business  and resorting to mergers and acquisitions These business changes led to additional cost of investment  This was offset by an increase in revenues that came on the back of membership growth as a result of individual mandate  which forced the uninsured to get insurance cover Now  after sharing space with Obamacare for six years  insurers will have to start afresh to comply with the sea change that TrumpCare will bring  We wait to see  how they fare under the changed regulation

The sole factor that has shaken the healthcare industry and changed it wholly is the Health Care Reform or Obamacare  enacted in Mar 2010  Though initially intensively lobbied against by the players  health care reform did not turn out as worse as expected  Despite the share of headwinds that the reform brought  it has helped the companies to grow their top line by increasing membership

142592,364107,HUM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  WellCare Health Plans  Aetna  UnitedHealth Group And Humana,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 20  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Health insurance  Part 3  including WellCare Health Plans  NYSE       Aetna  NYSE AET   NYSE     UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH    NYSE     and Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    NYSE      

	Industry  Health insurance  Part 3

	Link  

	Amid global economic volatility  the U S  health insurance industry provides investors a level of defense thanks to the high degree of its domestic business exposure  Players like Cigna  NYSE CI   UnitedHealth Group  Centene and Aetna with business in international markets also have limited exposure  accounting for 3   4   1  and 0 5  of revenues  respectively 

	The sole factor that has shaken the healthcare industry and changed it wholly is the Health Care Reform or Obamacare  enacted in Mar 2010  Though initially intensively lobbied against by the players  health care reform did not turn out as worse as expected  Despite the share of headwinds that the reform brought  it has helped the companies to grow their top line by increasing membership 

	Total revenues of the top eight players  UnitedHealth  Aetna  Cigna  Molina Healthcare  Centene  WellCare Health Plans  Anthem and Humana increased to  437 billion in 2015 from  383 billion in 2014 with medical enrollment rising to 150 million in 2015 from 145 million in the prior year  Along with posting strong operating numbers  most of the players guided strong earnings for 2016  pointing to the fact that despite hurdles  the industry presents enough growth opportunities 

	Now  after sharing the space with Obamacare for almost six years  insurers have embraced the law  Most of the players are now looking for newer avenues to expand their business  They are reassessing their business model from the perspective of product  pricing  risk management  distribution and claims to fraud management for a realistic pace of growth 
	Let s discuss some of the opportunities provided by the changing industry landscape Higher Enrollment   Higher Revenues

	Thanks to ObamaCare  the nation s uninsured rate has gone down to single digits  Before ACA  around 47 million lacked health coverage  Current data shows that the uninsured rate is around 9   According to an ongoing NHIS CDC study  the current uninsured rate of 9  for 2015 is the lowest in over 50 years 
	The data also shows that Obamacare has led to increased coverage provided by health insurers that would in turn add to their top line  Most health insurers have reported a secular rise in their revenues from membership gains because of the law Baby Boomers Presents Medicare Growth
	According to the U S  Census data  the population of Medicare beneficiaries will grow by 36  by the end of this decade led by a vast aging baby boomer population  In fact  in the next 25 years  the compounded annual growth rate of the Medicare population is expected to increase to 2 7  from 1 5  at present 
	Revenues from the managed care plans of Medicare Advantage are expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire  Medicare Advantage is a privately run version of the government s Medicare insurance program for the aged and disabled  Until now  only two public providers    UnitedHealth and Humana    control more than 10  of the market  Carriers in the health insurance sector are in a race to win Medicare Advantage market share and the fastest way of achieving the target is by acquiring a company in the same business International Markets Seems Lucrative
	Pressure on profit margins in the U S  market has compelled American health insurers to look to foreign markets for sustained growth and profitability  International markets seem attractive as these are less penetrated and competitive than the U S  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for the U S  health insurers 
	Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity  They re followed by Aetna and Humana  The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies 
	Some of the deals made by players in this field echo the emerging trend toward globalization  In Apr 2014  Aetna bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe  Prior to that in Feb 2014  Cigna announced its debut in India s underpenetrated health insurance sector  in a joint venture with an Indian conglomerate TTK Group  In 2013  UnitedHealth bought a stake in AmilParticipacoes of Brazil for a nearly  5 billion  It already had a presence in Australia  the Middle East and the U K Managing Costs via ACOs

	Health insurers are trying to clinch accountable care payment contracts following the healthcare reform law s inclusion of Accountable Care Organization  ACO  tests under Medicare  The law s emphasis on providing accurate and efficient health care service rather than volume of service has led to the emergence of ACOs  These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the likes  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population 
	The ACOs are appealing to insurers as these reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACO because these track and collect patient data  enabling an evaluation of patient care  Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers 
	Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as exclusion of pre existing conditions  The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on current cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses  Private commercial payers  such as Cigna  Anthem and Aetna are thus supporting ACO formation  CIGNA has one of the most established track records in the group for ACOs 

Developing Ancillary Businesses
	Insurers are eyeing growth and expansion opportunities that accompany the critical challenges of modernizing the health care system  They are branching out to the non traditional areas 

	Over the last few years  several large insurers have acquired companies that fall outside the realm of traditional health insurance yet complement it  Humana acquired Antiva in 2011 to provide analytics services  Aetna invested in Health IT by acquiring Medicity and UnitedHealth has the broadest approach to and the greatest potential in cross selling synergies via its health benefits business via Optum  The Optum division is the poster child of UnitedHealth s successful diversification 

Healthy Balance Sheet

	Health insurers are also well poised with respect to their balance sheet  The risk based capital ratio of Anthem  Cigna  Aetna and UnitedHealth stands north of 500   substantially higher than the statutory level of 200   A low utilization rate  which has reduced claim payments  has helped to strengthen the balance sheet of these players Stocks Worth Adding

	Investors can consider the following HMO stocks that have solid fundamentals along with a favorable Zacks Rank

Bottom Line
	In a changing industry  which is witnessing the shift of power from insurance players to consumers  the need of the hour is to understand what consumers want and need  and provide quality service at the right time  Only those health players that modify their business strategy in tandem with the changing market will prevail and flourish in a consumer centric health insurance industry

142641,364156,HUM,5 Healthcare Players Poised To Beat Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"The third quarter earnings season is round the corner  Let s find out how the health care sector  which includes diversified industries like managed care organizations  clinical  laboratories and diagnostics research  medical equipment  hospitals  and more  is likely to perform this time 

Since the start of this year  the managed care industry or the health maintenance organizations  HMOs   which includes the medical insurance group  has been displaying weakness  Factors like disappointing public exchange business  stringent regulations regarding the proposed mega merger of Anthem Inc   ANTM  with Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   and Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  with Humana Inc   NYSE HUM   increasing medical ratio to name a few  have been the primary reasons behind the bearishness  Also  the different stance of the presidential candidates regarding the ObamaCare and the changes likely to be implemented upon getting elected  added to the uncertainty 
We note that the situation is no different in the third quarter  The Department of Justice has filed suits against the proposed mergers  The mergers  which were scheduled to be completed this year  have now been delayed  In fact  the closure of these deals is now shrouded with uncertainty 
This apart  issues related to the public exchanges business have been adding to the woes  Most insurers incurred losses from this business in the first half of the year and the trend is unlikely to reverse this quarter  Although insurance companies had expected better profitability in 2016 after making meager profits in 2015  the individual exchange business disappointed the firms  Major players incurred losses in this business and are now reducing their participation on the exchanges by exiting unprofitable markets 
However  all is not lost for this sector  In the quarter  HMO industry players are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium from the government businesses   Medicare  Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies  In 2015  about 55 million people were enrolled in Medicare  This number is expected number to climb to 75 million by 2026  courtesy of the aging of the baby boomers  Humana  Cigna  Aetna  UnitedHealth Group Inc   NYSE UNH  had earlier projected growth in their government business 
In addition  higher number of enrollees in the Medicare  Medicaid and Medicare Advantage businesses is expected to have driven membership growth in the third quarter  However  this upside might have been partly offset by a decline in membership on the public exchange business 
The insurers are also likely to see earnings growth on the back of their international operations  Players like Aetna  Cigna and UnitedHealth Group have extended their business worldwide in the wake of stringent regulations on the home turf  However  a strong U S  dollar will be a drag on the quarterly earnings 
Moreover  strong balance sheets with low leverage and attractive organic cash flow generation  along with excess capital in the form of statutory reserves and parent cash continue to make this sector attractive 

Another healthcare sub sector  which provides clinical services for pets  is poised for growth as the veterinary market continues to strengthen  Also  healthy competition in the lab market continues to drive growth  Higher demand for veterinary services owing to increase in pet population  more knowledge and awareness  better medicines for pets  highly trained doctors  more technology  and improved diagnostics have been catalysts behind earnings growth of this sub sector 

Diagnostic and laboratory research companies are also slated to see earnings improvement owing to a greater health care access  which fuels demand for these services  Growth in the industry is influenced by aging populations and rising demand for preventive care and personalized medical treatments  Small medical labs are competing effectively by providing specialized analyses and establishing their presence in regions with fewer medical facilities 

Owing to these positives  we believe that the health care sector might still be a good bet as there exist some stocks that are likely to deliver positive earnings surprises this earnings season  How to Pick the Attractive Stocks 
Given the large number of industry participants  selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates appears to be a daunting task  Nonetheless  our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple 
One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   Notably  a positive Earnings ESP helps to identify stocks that have high chances of surprising estimates in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  
Below are five health care stocks that we believe are best positioned to stand out this earnings season UnitedHealth Group Inc     is a major health insurance company providing health insurance and health benefits services   It has an Earnings ESP of  0 96  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Oct 18  You can see VCA Inc     operates as an animal healthcare company in the United States and Canada  It operates through two segments   Animal Hospital and Laboratory  It has an Earnings ESP of  13 61  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Oct 26 Quintiles IMS Holdings  Inc     provides biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services in the Americas  Europe  Africa  and the Asia Pacific  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 01  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Oct 26 ICON Public Limited Company     is a contract research organization that provides outsourced development services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and medical device industries in Ireland  rest of Europe  the United States  and internationally  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 7  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Oct 20 Aetna Inc     operates as a health care benefits company in the United States  It operates through three segments   Health Care  Group Insurance  and Large Case Pensions  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 49  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Oct 27 Where Do Zacks  Investment Ideas Come From

142642,364157,HUM,Anthem Gets High Medicare Star Quality Ratings From CMS,opinion,"Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   recently announced that it has received high Medicare Star Quality Ratings from the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services   CMS    The ratings have been assigned for the insurer s Medicare Advantage  MA  plans for 2017 
The superior ratings from CMS acknowledge the company s continued investments to strengthen its Medicare program  The ratings take into account that approximately 51  of Anthem s MA members will be enrolled in plans with four stars or higher for 2017 as against 22  members enrolled in such plans in 2016 
Anthem regularly undertakes initiatives to improve the quality and reach of its MA plans  The frequent restructuring of its product portfolio to meet the changing health insurance demands of customers is also notable  Anthem s prioritization on continuous reframing of its MA plans has not only helped it to retain its existing customers but also has paved the way to achieve a bigger market share 
In order to deliver high quality services to its customers  Anthem has been investing in its MA programs   Moreover  the company has working to broaden its product portfolio  expand its services area  increase the number of staffs  involved in practicing the local health plan and strengthen provider and member engagement 
Anthem believes that its efforts have been correctly identified by CMS as is evidenced by the aforesaid star quality ratings  We expect these ratings to further motivate Anthem to continue delivering services to ensure complete customer satisfaction 
ANTHEM INC Price
   CMS  Medicare Star Rating system is based on two parameters   quality and performance of the concerned business segment  Hence  MA plans are rated on the basis of their ability to help members stay healthy  the extent to which they assist members in managing chronic diseases  their ability to ensure positive member experiences and member satisfaction as well as their capability of providing effective customer service 
On the other hand  Medicare Prescription Drug plans are rated on their performance on drug plan customer service  the frequency and extent of member complaints  member experience with drug plan and the safety assured by the drug  A scale of one to five stars  with five being the best  is used for the calculation of star ratings 
Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   too has received high Medicare Star Quality Ratings for its Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug  MAPD  plans for 2017 from the CMS  This upgrade reflected Aetna s increased member base in plans with a star rating of four or higher than 91   representing a 4 percentage point increase from last year 
Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    however  witnessed a downgrade in the CMS star quality ratings for 2018  This is because Humana s membership in four star or higher rated plans as of Jul 31  2016 has declined to 37  from the year ago level of 78  
Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   has also received star quality ratings from CMS as approximately 20  of MA customers were in a four stars or higher rated plan  However  it is unlikely to have any financial impact in 2016 or 2017 as these ratings apply to plans for 2018 
Anthem presently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   You can see

142643,364158,HUM,Health Insurance Industry Outlook   October 2016,opinion,"In the first nine months of the year 2016  the U S  health insurance industry was largely dominated by issues related to the underperforming public exchange business and stringent regulatory intervention relating to the two proposed mega mergers  Notwithstanding these  the companies performed favorably  with most of the players reporting an increase in the top line along with membership growth 
The Department of Justice filed lawsuits against the proposed mergers of Anthem Inc   ANTM  with Cigna Corp  NYSE CI    CI   and Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  with Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    HUM   The mergers  which were scheduled to be completed this year  have now been delayed  In fact  the closure of these deals is now uncertain 
This apart  concerns related to the public exchanges business have been adding to the woes  Most insurers incurred losses from this business in the first half of the year  and the trend is unlikely to reverse anytime soon  Although insurance companies expected improved profitability in 2016 after making meager profits in 2015  the individual exchange business disappointed the firms 
Major players incurred losses in this business and are now reducing their participation on the exchanges by exiting unprofitable markets  For 2017  the players have very little exposure on the public exchanges 
Nevertheless  the companies have managed to record higher revenues on the back of an increase in premium from the government businesses   Medicare  Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  A surge in baby boomer retirees has led to higher demand for these policies  In 2015  about 55 million people were enrolled in Medicare  The number is expected to climb to 75 million by 2026  courtesy aging baby boomers  Humana  Cigna  Aetna  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH    UNH  have expanded their government businesses and are very optimistic about it 
In addition  a higher number of enrollees in the Medicare  Medicaid and Medicare Advantage businesses drove membership growth across the board  However  this upside was partly offset by a decline in membership on the public exchange business 
The insurers are likely to see earnings growth on the back of their international operations  Players like Aetna  Cigna and UnitedHealth Group have extended their business worldwide in the wake of stringent regulations on the home turf  However  a stronger U S  dollar will be a drag on earnings from international operations 
Strong balance sheets with low leverage and attractive organic cash flow generation  along with excess capital in the form of statutory reserves and parent cash continue to make this sector attractive 
Factors that might impact the industry significantly in the coming months are the Presidential election  the Public Exchange Business  and mergers and acquisitions 
The industry has caught the attention of the presidential candidates who are vowing to make major changes to the legislation that gave the industry a complete makeover  Insurers who have strived hard to adapt to the numerous changes brought about by the reforms may have to readjust their businesses if the new president brings in his her desired changes 
Industry Flashback
The industry witnessed a massive overhaul following the Health Care Reform Act which came into effect in Mar 2010  The reform changed the face of the industry  so much so that the once successful strategies and business practices of the players were no longer sustainable 
The players enjoyed no interference from government entities from the early 1980s til 2010  The health insurers were fully autonomous in conducting their business  many a times refusing to grant coverage to people with pre existing diseases and also rejecting genuine claims  But with the implementation of Obamacare  things have changed substantially

Public Exchanges Woes
Public Exchanges made their debut in Oct 2013  and were considered one of the signature achievements of Obamacare aimed at providing subsidized insurance to millions  The insurers were also sanguine about the exchanges  hoping to make big business out of them  But health insurers are now struggling to profit from the public exchange business 
These insurers are saddling under high medical expenses of individuals who are buying the subsidized policies under the health care law  The public exchanges attracted a disproportionate number of unhealthy individuals compared to healthy ones  A higher percentage of unhealthy patients led to higher claims for the insurers  thus leading to losses from the policies sold to these groups of people 
In Nov 2015  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   UNH  disclosed concerns about losses incurred on its individual business from the public exchange Compelled by the loss suffered from the individual insurance policies sold on the exchanges  the health insurer announced that it will not entertain such losses and may exit this unprofitable market completely by 2017  The company has already scaled back its marketing efforts for individual insurance policies sold on exchanges 
Another insurer  Aetna  also suffered losses from its public exchange business in 2015 and reduced its operations to 15 states this year from 17 states last year  It is  however  taking measures such as re pricing and product modification to generate profits in 2016  
Yet another player  Humana  is contemplating dropping individual insurance coverage through exchanges in the states of Alabama  Kansas  Wisconsin and Virginia  The company is considering to exit this business which brought in meager profits in this years  first quarter and would likely result in a loss for the full year 
If the players realize that the exchanges are not seeing profitable business opportunities  a mass exodus may happen which may hamper the functionality of the exchanges and cause a failure of the Obamacare exchanges  thus defeating the basic aim of providing coverage to millions of uninsured Americans 
Some of the other challenges faced by the industry are briefed below Margins Under Pressure
Health insurers are expected to witness lowered margin environment  A host of factors including compliance costs related to health care reform regulation  increased fees and taxes  pricing pressure  stiff competition and rising medical costs will squeeze the bottom line 
A general shift in patient mix from Commercial insurance to Government  Medicare  Medicaid and State subsidized marketplace or exchange  will also affect profitability to a large extent  Premiums for Medicare  Medicaid and state subsidized policies tend to be higher due to serious health issues for many enrollees  however  they carry smaller profitability margins compared to commercial insurance 
High Regulatory Cost
Regulatory reform sweeping through the sector has hit insurers with high compliance costs  The expenditures involved in redoing the internal systems can pinch them hard  There has been huge spending on health information technology   HIT    following the implementation of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009   ARRA    or  Recovery Act   which contains the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act  or the  HITECH Act   Notably  HIT includes electronic health records or EHRs  health information exchanges or HIEs and other initiatives 
The federal government s emphasis on the use of health IT  which helps providers communicate better with each other about patient care  reduces medical errors  paperwork and needless duplicate screenings and tests  leading to better coordinated patient care and lower health care costs  These have increased health care information technology spending  Financial incentives offered by regulators to providers and hospitals for the implementation of the meaningful use of health care IT products are primarily driving IT spending 
Consumer Has Upper Hand
Rising consumerism is the reality of the health insurance industry  Until the implementation of the ACA  the insurance companies had an upper hand in choosing to whom to provide coverage  and consumers  people receiving health care  had no active role in the decision making process 
But now the trend has changed  Health insurance reform has put consumer power and choice in the hands of the people  and ensures that all Americans receive the health care services that they need  Consumers  increased purchasing power and access to information to take health care decisions are the major threats to insurers Prior to reform  big insurers dominating large markets hardly ever bothered to provide consumers with even basic information  such as the performance of health insurance policies  procedures to claim  the size of the provider network and cancellation processes  Now  customers demand transparency  value and convenience  leaving insurers grappling for innovative ways to satisfy these unmet needs  The new mission  however  will not be easy to execute Global Economic Woes and Regulatory ChallengesA fragile global economy presents a headwind for insurers looking to expand their international operations  One of the largest insurers  UnitedHealth Group made an acquisition to reap benefits from the Brazil market but is now facing slowing growth rates in that country In the case of India  which remains one of the most profitable opportunities for insurers  the regulatory environment still remains somewhat challenging  China    which merits the highest risk adjusted opportunity ranking  largely because of its immense scale    poses significant investment restrictions to foreign insurers entering and operating there

Why the Downgrade Anthem witnessed downward estimate revisions over the past 60 days  The stock seems to be bothered by a number of factors working against it such as uncertainty over the Cigna deal  weak public exchange business and low interest rates Anthem s proposed acquisition of Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   has drawn friction from regulators  The Department of Justice  DoJ  has blocked the merger of Cigna over concerns that it could stifle competition in the industry  The merger of Anthem and Cigna would mean more power in the hands of the surviving company   Anthem   which will gain in size and scale 
Though Anthem will challenge the lawsuit filed by the DoJ  it will entangle both parties in months of litigation  dragging the deal that was announced about a year ago  If the merger with Cigna falls apart  the company will have to pay a breakup fee of  1 85 billion ANTHEM INC Price and Consensus

   Anthem is also witnessing losses on its public exchange business like UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   to name a couple  For 2016  the company expects membership declines of approximately 300 000 in its individual business  It also expects to see  mid single digit  margin loss in this business The persistent low interest rate environment has also taken a toll on Anthem s investment income  In 2015  net investment income declined 6 5  year over year to  677 6 million  For 2016  the company projects investment income of approximately  650 million  which translates into a year over year decline of 4  from the actual 2015 level Anthem also expects medical loss ratio in the range of 84 9  plus or minus 30 basis points for the year  reflecting higher than previously expected claims rates in its Individual ACA compliant plans as well as its Medicaid businesses remain at elevated levels  This includes worse than expected results in the newly entered Iowa market The share repurchase suspension in the wake of the Cigna deal has affected the bottom line 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate have moved down by a penny for 2016 and 14 cents for 2017 in the last 60 days  The same is currently pegged at  10 91 and  11 85 for 2016 and 2017  respectively 
Stocks to ConsiderNot all consumer discretionary stocks  however  are performing as poorly as Anthem  Some better ranked stocks in this space are UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  You can see

is currently present Aetna will reduce its individual public exchange participation to 242 counties from 778 for the 2017 plan year  This development comes after Aetna suffered pretax loss of  200 million in the second quarter and total pretax loss of more than  430 million since Jan 2014 in its individual products sold via public exchanges Aetna is now expecting losses  pretax  north of  300 million on policies sold on public exchanges for 2016 Another player Humana Inc   HUM  recently announced it will sell plans through public exchanges in 11 states in 2017  down from 15 states this year because of losses  Anthem Inc   ANTM  also witnessed huge claims in its public exchange business in the second quarter While at the outset it seemed that public exchanges would add to the topline of the players by bringing in more enrollments  it did not turn out that straight  Insurers witnessed an adverse mix of population signing up for insurance on these exchanges  Those who sought insurance were mostly sick who went on to utilize healthservices  therefore causing a spike in claim ratio  In short  the premium paid by these members did not compensate for the care they sought  thus giving rise to losses on these policies Medical Sector Price IndexFriction with RegulatorsUp next  the players might see the axing of the mega mergers of Aetna with Humana and Anthem with Cigna announced last year  These mergers have drawn flak from regulators on concerns that the deals will stifle competition and reduce the number of players in the industry from five to three  The Department of Justice is closely scrutinizing the deal and has sued each of the four parties involved to block the merger The cause of concern for the regulators is that the mergers would mean more power in the hands of the surviving companies Anthem and Aetna as theywill gain in size and scale  It is feared that the companies if equipped with more strength will bother less to serve its customers  It is also being contemplated that these insurers will have lesser incentive to improve the quality of their product and service since there will be fewer and smaller players to compete against them  They might also hike premium and increase out of pocket costs  and in turn harass customers Merger was the most sought after strategy by these players to grow faster in the rapidly changing health insurance industry  The players wanted to gain in scale and size in one shot via these mergers which would have given them an upper hand in negotiating claims with hospitals  Investment in technology from cost savings  expanded reach to care by gaining quick access to new markets were other advantages of the merger cited by them The health insurers are being caught up in a series of events one after another  The presidential election that is coming up is the next major event for the industry What does Presidential Election Hold for Insurers Obamacare has become a political fodder with a contentious election around the corner  Both candidates have spoken length and breadth about the law displaying their varied opinion The presidential candidates are looking at ways to fine tune the provisions of the healthcare legislation  which  if implemented  will upend the business models of insurers     Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s priority includes a crackdown on insurers to limit out of pocket costs  These costs are expenses like deductibles  coinsurance and copayments for covered services among others that aren t reimbursed by insurance Also on Hillary Clinton s agenda is giving more power to lawmakers to reject undue rate hikes by health insurers Donald Trump on the other hand proposes to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that would require a lot less money  He wants to propose a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles  Trump s plan will provide choice to buyers  provide individual tax relief for health insurance and keep plans portable and affordable  The plan will break health insurance company monopolies and allow individuals to buy across state lines  Health insurers will have a rough ride if Trump wins the election since he commented that  The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare  The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health  We are going to end that  As it is insurers seem to have no respite from the series of events unfolding one after another  Now  we have to wait and see how these players turn the tide in their favor ,2016-08-22,Zacks Investment

142711,364226,HUM,Forget Cigna  CI   Buy These HMO Stocks Instead,opinion,"Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   is going through a rough patch with niggling concerns like an underperforming Life and Disability segment  CMS sanctions on the sale of Medicare Advantage policies  a weak public exchange business and uncertainty surrounding the Anthem   NYSE ANTM   merger  These compelled the company to cut its full year 2016 earnings guidance to  7 75  8 10 per share from  8 95  9 35 Cigna has one of the greatest shares in the Disability market  But this business has become increasing unpredictable and volatile in recent years  The segment suffered due to modifications made to the disability claim process  The modification includes upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations  deeper medical history reviews and enhanced documentation  These modifications resulted in longer claim cycles  thereby increasing disability durations and claim inventory which did not favor its business in the first half of 2016  Investments are being made in this segment to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will lead to improved customer experience and lower claim volatility  The life subsegment suffered from a spike in claims  Though the company is taking necessary steps to restore profitability of the segment  we would remain cautious until we see it posting favorable earnings Another friction faced by the company is the blockage of the deal to merge with Anthem by the Department of Justice  The deal may now be delayed to 2017  The merger  which would have raised the rank of the company in the industry is now shrouded in uncertainty  Any delay would adversely impact the company and come in the way of its desired operational performance  In fact  in 2015 the company incurred a loss of  57 million in connection with the anticipated merger and  62 million in the first half of 2016  Unfavorable refinancing expenses and unexpected costs associated with the delay can be a matter of concern The company also faces restriction from the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services   CMS   regarding the sale of Medicare Advantage policies  Effective Jan 21  2016  the CMS imposed sanctions suspending Cigna s enrollment and marketing activities related to all Cigna Medicare Advantage and standalone prescription drug plan contracts   To date  it remains unclear as to when these might be lifted  The sanctions point directly to failure to comply with coverage determinations  appeals and grievances  and Part D administration which CMS characterized as  systemic  and  longstanding  and unchanged even several years after warning the company  Cigna won t be allowed to market or sell Medicare Advantage policies or Part D drug plans to new clients in the open enrollment season that will start in mid October  If Cigna is unable to address these issues prior to open enrollment  its MA membership will be hit hard and be a drag on its earnings Moreover  Cigna is currently losing money in its public exchange business  It is mulling over discontinuing operations in the Texas market  Though the company said that it has intentions to selectively expand its public exchange presence to a few new geographical regions in 2017  we view this as quite unlikely in the light of similar comments coming from Aetna  NYSE AET  and UnitedHealth just after pulling back from the exchanges citing increasing losses While Cigna  which carries a Zacks Rank   5  Strong Sell  remains mired in its problems  we take this opportunity to look at other health maintenance organization  HMO  stocks in the space providing better investment opportunities  These include Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    United Health Group Inc    NYSE UNH   and WellCare Health

individual Medicare Advantage and other government sponsored plans remain the highlights  Also  its Healthcare Services business is well poised and will contribute to its growth  Last month  Humana won a contract from the U S  Department of Defense to administer TRICARE benefits to about 6 million people  which nearly doubles the number of military beneficiaries served by Humana However  challenges in its individual commercial medical business pose as concerns  Also  its merger with Aetna remains uncertain  Nevertheless  the company raised its 2016 earnings guidance to at least  8 56 from  8 32 predicted before  Humana has also witnessed a 4 3  increase in its Zacks Consensus Estimate to  9 23 per share for 2016  over the past 60 days  with 11 out of 12 analysts covering the stock raising their estimates  Its long term EPS growth rate is 13 5   It has a Value Style score of  B  HUMANA INC NEW Price and Consensus   UnitedHealth  with a Zacks Rank  2  is the most diversified health maintenance organization  Though the company remains troubled by its public exchange business and has exited most of the markets  it  is still attractive given the strength in its other business segments  Instead of its heavily regulated Health Benefits business  the company is focusing on investing and growing its health services business branded as Optum To this end  the company acquired Catamaran last year  The acquisition is evidently fruitful thanks to the revenue accretion from it  Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and is expected to contribute about 42  to UnitedHealth Group s consolidated operating earnings this year Also  the company s membership has grown over the past five years by nearly 13 5 million or 40  well diversified across commercial  government programs and international offerings  The company s membership is further set to grow in Medicare Advantage  Medicaid as well as commercial plans  UnitedHealth also has a strong balance sheet and generates handsome cash flows which allow it to increase dividend payments and make regular share buybacks Moreover  UnitedHealth witnessed an increase in the 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate to  7 90 per share from  7 88  over the past 60 days  with eight out of 14 analysts covering the stock raising their individual estimates  Its long term EPS growth rate is 13 4   It has a Value Style

second quarter  it closed the Advicare transaction  gaining greater Medicaid presence in South Carolina  The company is taking both organic and inorganic steps to fuel its growth and trying to double its revenues between 2017 and 2021 The company also increased its 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of  4 95 to  5 05 from its previous guidance of  4 55 to  4 70 WellCare Health also witnessed a 7 5  increase in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to  5 01 per share for 2016  over the past 60 days  with each of the nine analysts covering the stock raising their individual

142741,364256,HUM,Why Are Health Insurers Ditching Obamacare  ,opinion,"Health insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   announced its second quarter financial data after the bell Tuesday  and despite beating our estimates for both earnings and revenue  the company highlighted some troubling signs about the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act 
Aetna said that it expects to lose about  300 million dollars on its Obamacare business this year  The company also announced that it is cancelling plans to expand its Obamacare offerings to five new states  and it will reassess its existing business in the 15 states it already covers 
 While we are pleased with our overall results  in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges  we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans  and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15 state footprint   said Aetna CEO Mark T  Bertolini 
Aetna joins a growing list of health insurance companies that are struggling to make money from the new law  United Healthcare   NYSE UNH    the country s largest insurer  already announced that it will be scaling its Obamacare business down from 1 200 counties in eight states to just 156 counties across 11 states 
Insurance companies are also requesting higher premium hikes for next year  On average  insurers have requested that premiums for the benchmark silver plan  which federal subsidies are based upon  increase by 9   with some requests hitting double digits in several markets  In 2016  premiums for this benchmark plan increased by 2  
A large number more than half of the co op insurers created and funded by Obamacare have also failed  As insurance providers disappear from markets  individuals have limited choices and often must pick from only one or two companies 
 Insurers are saying that premiums are simply too low to cover the new patients  who tend to get sicker and be more costly to cover  People who are covered under Obamacare plans are more prone to serious diseases and  on average  cost 22  more per month to cover than those with employer plans 
As a result  insurance companies need to either raise premiums or cut their own costs  One method that we ve seen insurers look towards to shave costs is consolidation  Two massive mergers have been attempted  with Anthem   NYSE ANTX   looking to purchase Cigna   NYSE CI   for  54 billion and Aetna attempting to buy Humana   NYSE HUM   for  37 billion 
By consolidating their businesses  these companies are looking to increase efficiency and cut down on operating costs  This would  however  reduce the amount of major players in the industry from five to just three 
In an effort to protect competiveness in the market  the Department of Justice recently sued the companies involved in these deals to block the mergers  The DoJ is presumably most concerned with the effects that these new insurance giants would have on smaller companies in the industry  The mergers could also result in more expensive prices as individuals have less options to choose from 
Both Anthem and Aetna have already responded to the DoJ s suits by promising to fight the blockage  As for right now  it looks like these massive mergers and or increased premiums will eventually come as a result of the difficult climate for Obamacare providers ",2016-08-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-are-health-insurers-ditching-obamacare-200145849,200145849

Benefit ratio was 78 8   down 260 bps year over year due to favorable current year medical claims development  Moreover  favorable risk adjustment accruals in the second quarter contributed to this increase Healthcare Services  Revenues from this segment increased 6  year over year to  6 24 billion  mainly due to growth in the company s individual Medicare Advantage and stand alone PDP membershipOperating cost ratio was 95 3   down 20 bps year over year

The reason why each of these insurers is retreating from the public individual on exchange markets is because of the losses incurred which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually   The lack of profitability has lead to many insurers exiting the state run exchange market  According to a   insurers offering individual state run health plans have been on a decline  and since 2013  the number of insurers  public individual plans decreased from 395 to 287 
Aetna is lowering its participation in Affordable Care Act  ACA  individual public exchanges in light of a Q2 pretax loss of  200 million from its individual products   55  of individual on exchange memberships are new in 2016  and the company saw individuals who needed high cost care taking up a larger portion of their on exchange population   This has lead to an unbalanced risk pool among policyholders  and Aetna now questions the sustainability of its state run exchanges 
The US Department of Health and Human Services recently announced that it will seek to find ways to modify the risk adjustment programs in the hope that they will be able to work on making a more sustainable public exchange model   Aetna is a proponent of public exchanges as a way to help the uninsured  and CEO Mark Bertolini says that he is encouraged by the Department of Health and Human Services  announcement  
The four states where plans will continue to be sold on state exchanges include Iowa  Delaware  Nebraska  and Virginia   Aetna is reducing its public exchange participation from 778 to 242 counties in the 2017 plan year   For most of the counties where public products were offered in 2016  the company will offer an off exchange individual product option for 2017   Aetna s decision to lower its public on exchange participation will not affect people who are covered by the insurer this year   Pay attention to earnings estimate revisions from analysts and whether they move upwards or downwards over the near term   Aetna stock is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Industry  Health Insurance  Part 2

Link  

In a volatile global economic environment  the U S  health insurance industry provides investors a micro defense thanks to high degree of its domestic business exposure  Players like Cigna Corp      UnitedHealth Group Inc     and Aetna Inc      with business in international markets also have limited exposure  accounting for 3   4   1  and 0 5  of revenues respectively   More importantly  the sector is largely insulated from headwinds   low oil prices  interest rate hikes  strengthening dollar  China s economic slowdown   which have been plaguing other sectors of the economy 
	The sole factor that has shaken the healthcare industry and changed it wholly is the Health Care Reform or Obamacare  enacted in Mar 2010  Though initially intensively lobbied against by the players  health care reform has turned out beneficial  Courtesy of Obamacare  insurers have witnessed meaningful gains in their membership enrollment  which has beefed up their revenues 

Total revenues of the top eight players  UnitedHealth   Aetna  Cigna  Anthem Inc     and Humana  Inc      increased to  437 billion in 2015 from  383 billion in 2014  with medical enrollment rising to 150 million in 2015 from 145 million in the prior year  Along with posting strong operating numbers  most of the players guided strong earnings for 2016  pointing to the fact that despite hurdles  the industry presents enough growth opportunities 

Now  after sharing the space with Obamacare for almost six years  insurers have embraced the law  Most of the players are now looking for newer avenues to expand their business  They are reassessing their business model from the perspective of product  pricing  risk management  distribution and claims to fraud management for a realistic pace of growth 

Let s discuss some of the opportunities provided by the changing industry landscape 

Extensive Consolidation

The Affordable Care Act  ACA  has heightened the drive toward market consolidation  The influx of the previously huge uninsured population into the space has increased overall membership  Now  the players are scrambling to maintain and grow their member enrollment further  and the best way to achieve this is by growing in size  With the health care law emphasizing value based care  it becomes imperative for health insurers to have a large number of patients to dilute risk  and of course ensure premium dollars to cover the expenses of their sick enrollees  thereby improving overall health outcomes 

Moreover  a bigger size would help in leveraging fixed cost and reducing overall administrative cost  increase cost of compliance with the new health care law   A bigger market share will also equip them better to negotiate harder with hospitals   Get big or get out  has therefore become the trend in the industry 

The merger frenzy hit a fever pitch with Anthem agreeing to acquire Cigna  Aetna seeking the Humana buyout and Centene s recent acquisition of Health Net  The market is speculating that consolidation will lead to the  big five  insurers transforming into the  big three   likely comprising Aetna  Anthem and UnitedHealth 

Higher Insured Population   Top Line Growth

Thanks to ObamaCare  the nation s uninsured rate has gone down to single digits  Before ACA  around 47 million lacked health coverage  Current data shows that the uninsured rate is around 9   According to an ongoing NHIS CDC study  the current uninsured rate of 9  for 2015 is the lowest in over 50 years 

The data shows that Obamacare has to a large extent accomplished its purpose which also points to the increased coverage provided by health insurers that would in turn add to their top line  Most health insurers have reported a secular rise in their revenues from membership gains because of the law 

Baby Boomers Present Medicare Growth

According to the U S  Census data  the population of Medicare beneficiaries will grow by 36  by the end of this decade led by a vast aging baby boomer population  In fact  in the next 25 years  the compounded annual growth rate of the Medicare population is expected to increase to 2 7  from 1 5  at present 

Revenues from the managed care plans of Medicare Advantage are expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire  Medicare Advantage is a privately run version of the government s Medicare insurance program for the aged and disabled  Until now  only two public providers    UnitedHealth and Humana    control more than 10  of the market  Carriers in the health insurance sector are in a race to win Medicare Advantage market share and the fastest way of achieving the target is by acquiring a company in the same business 

Shift to International Markets

Pressure on profit margins in the U S  market has compelled American health insurers to look to foreign markets for sustained growth and profitability  International markets seem attractive as these are less penetrated and competitive than the U S  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for the U S  health insurers 

Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity  They re followed by Aetna and Humana  The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies 

Some of the deals made by players in this field echo the emerging trend toward globalization  In Apr 2014  Aetna bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe  Prior to that in Feb 2014  Cigna announced its debut in India s underpenetrated health insurance sector  in a joint venture with an Indian conglomerate TTK Group  In 2013  UnitedHealth bought a stake in AmilParticipacoes of Brazil for a nearly  5 billion  It already had a presence in Australia  the Middle East and the U K 

ACOs Gaining Prominence

Health insurers are trying to clinch accountable care payment contracts following the healthcare reform law s inclusion of Accountable Care Organization  ACO  tests under Medicare  The law s emphasis on providing accurate and efficient health care service rather than volume of service has led to the emergence of ACOs  These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the likes  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population 

The ACOs are appealing to insurers as these reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACO because these track and collect patient data  enabling an evaluation of patient care  Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers 

Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as exclusion of pre existing conditions  The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on current cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses  Private commercial payers such as Cigna  Anthem and Aetna are thus supporting ACO formation  CIGNA has one of the most established track records in the group for ACOs

Link 

Health insurers called upon themselves the close scrutiny of regulators  with Anthem Inc  s    proposal to acquire Cigna Corp     and Aetna Inc  s    buyout deal with Humana Inc      

Recently  the viability of the proposed merger between Anthem and Cigna was challenged by Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones  who contends that the mega deal worth  48 billion would curb competition and hurt consumers in the state of California 

Moreover  the presidential candidates are looking at ways to fine tune the provisions of healthcare legislation  which  if implemented  will see insurers reworking their business strategies 

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s priority includes a crackdown on insurers to limit out of pocket costs  These costs are expenses like deductibles  coinsurance and copayments for covered services among others that aren t reimbursed by insurance 
	Also on Clinton s agenda is giving more power to lawmakers to reject undue rate hikes by health insurers  Under the current healthcare reform  this authority is in the hands of certain select states only 
	Donald Trump said that he would end Obamacare and replace it with something that would require a lot less money 
	Coming back  the legislation has undoubtedly altered the regulatory landscape in ways that are not always beneficial to a private health insurer s bottom line  But calling it a permanent drag would be an overstatement 
	U S  health plans are expected to operate in a lowered margin environment  Some health plans   especially the smaller ones   may not survive  Pricing pressure  higher taxes and fees  rising medical costs  regulatory compliance costs  increased competition and general marketplace uncertainty are some of the headwinds faced by the players in the industry 
	While the aim of this write up is to put the spotlight on the headwinds facing the industry  an earlier write up in this space had the opposite focus

	Rising consumerism has now become the reality of the health insurance industry  Until the implementation of the ACA  the insurance companies had an upper hand in choosing who to provide coverage to and consumers  people receiving health care  had no active role in the decision making process  But now the trend has changed  Health insurance reform has put consumer power and choice in the hands of the Americans  and ensure that all Americans receive the health care services that they need and deserve  Consumers  increased purchasing power and access to information to take health care decisions are the major threats to insurers 
	Prior to reform  big insurers dominating large markets hardly ever bothered to provide consumers with even basic information  such as the performance of health insurance policies  procedures to claim  the size of the provider network and cancellation processes  Now  customers demand transparency  value and convenience  leaving insurers grappling for innovative ways to satisfy these unmet needs  The new mission  however  will not be easy to execute Global Economic Woes and Regulatory Challenges
	A fragile global economy presents a headwind for insurers looking to expand their international operations  One of the largest insurers  UnitedHealth Groupmade an acquisition to reap benefits from the Brazil market but is now facing slowing growth rates in that country 
	In case of India  which remains one of the most profitable opportunities for insurers  the regulatory environment still remains somewhat challenging  China    which merits the highest risk adjusted opportunity ranking  largely because of its immense scale    poses significant investment restrictions to foreign insurers entering and operating there Bottom Line
	The changed regulatory landscape has undoubtedly created hurdles that would weigh on profits and margins of industry operators going forward  But it is hardly the unmitigated disaster that some industry players make it out to be  Beyond the ACA  the investment appeal of the space also reflects its perceived defensive and counter cyclical orientation  which is crucial amid the current uncertainty

142796,364311,HUM,Aetna May Divest Parts Of Its Business To Acquire Humana,opinion,"Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   is planning to shed some of its Medicare Advantage business in some markets  as per sources  Aetna hopes the divestures will address federal regulators  concerns regarding its proposed acquisition of Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   
The assets to be sold are worth billions of dollars  But it has become necessary for Aetna to trim these operations to establish that its  37 billion acquisition of Humana will not quell competition in several markets 
The company has not yet finalized the assets to be sold but its advisers are busy identifying Medicare Advantage   MA   business in those markets where operations of both companies overlap significantly AETNA INC NEW Price   Last week  California s insurance commissioner made a desperate attempt to block Aetna s acquisition of Humana  The commissioner said that the deal would curb competition in the state and further shrink the already concentrated health insurance market 
Aetna is considering the sale of some of its MA business in order to get the green signal from regulators so that the deal can be sealed as per schedule  So far  the acquisition has received approval from 14 states of the 20 necessary states  The company is also working closely with the Justice Department  which is reviewing the deal 
Aetna has been bound to divest its MA business  in which Humana also has a strong franchise  With Humana  the combined company will have 47  of its business from Medicare  Together  the companies would lead Medicare Advantage plans by a large margin  This would also lead to greater concentration of the combined company in MA business  which is in huge demand due to the large aging baby boomer population  It is feared that the emergence of a single big MA player can be unfavorable for consumers in the form of high premiums and low quality of service 
The Aetna Humana deal is not the only one being closely scrutinized by the Department of Justice  The proposed acquisition of Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   by Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   is also being monitored by the Justice Department as this mega merger will also end up reducing the number of players in the industry

142805,364320,HUM,Aetna And Anthem Insurer Deals To Be Challenged By US DoJ,opinion,"According to   regulators are getting ready to file lawsuits in order to block two major health insurance mergers   About a year ago  Anthem   NYSE ANTM   agreed to purchase Cigna   NYSE CI   for  48 billion  and Humana   NYSE HUM   agreed to be bought out by Aetna   NYSE AET   for  37 billion 
The Justice Department is concerned over the increased consolidation in the health insurance space  and it believes that these mergers stand to negatively affect the competition in the industry   The companies who are set to merge already make up for four of the top five players in the health insurance space  and collectively  the companies generated sales north of  230 billion in 2015  
They represent a large share of the health insurance market  and the deals have been criticized since their inception a year ago   Doctors and consumer groups have been especially critical of the deals  citing the lessening of competition in the space because of fewer options for people to choose from   James King  a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law  questioned the impact that the mergers have on competition  saying that  instead of going into these areas on their own   the insurers  are attempting to acquire somebody who is already there and successful  
Regulators were previously worried when the deals were announced  but Aetna and Anthem had the opportunity to persuade the Justice Department  and they said that any antitrust issue could be resolved by distributing assets to other competitors   If the Department does end up filing a lawsuit  the insurers will probably fight the antitrust claims in court

142822,364337,HUM, Anthem s Pending Cigna Acquisition Under Fire In California,opinion,"Clouds of uncertainty were cast over the pending merger between Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   and Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   after concerns was raised by California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones regarding the viability of the deal  Jones argued that the mega deal worth  48 billion would curb competition and hurt consumers in the state The acquisition will lead to market consolidation and greater concentration in the already saturated health insurance market in California  According to Jones  office  in case the acquisition materializes  the new Anthem would control more than 50  of the market in 28 of the state s counties and over 40  of the market in 38 counties  This would mean more power in the hands of the company  which will gain in size and scale Will Anthem Flex its Muscles Post Merger It is feared that the company  which already has a history of rejecting claims and insufficiently addressing consumer grievances  will bother even less to service its customers with more power in hand   It is also being contemplated that the insurer will have lesser incentive to improve the quality of its products and services  since it will vie against fewer and smaller players  The company may also hike premium and increase out of pocket costs  which will come directly from the pockets of its customers These concerns are not baseless  A  415 000 fine was imposed on Anthem by state health officials in May as the company failed to identify  timely process and resolve enrollees  grievances  Naturally  this instills a fear that the company may repeat its high handedness in the future Moreover  the executives at Anthem did not give a clear reply when asked whether the company will pass on to its customers a portion of the  2 billion efficiencies flowing from the acquisition  in the form of lower prices The executives of the companies involved in the deal  however  have been defending their case from the very beginning by saying that the acquisition will help them to add scale to their business and eliminate unnecessary cost incurred in duplication of services provided to patients  They are also of the opinion that by gaining in size  they will be in a better position to negotiate with hospitals for claims and lower their overall administrative costs  Investment in technology from cost savings and expanded care by gaining quick access to new markets were the other advantages of the merger cited by them Past Consolidations by InsurersThe health insurance market in the United States has always been highly concentrated  Since 1996  the industry has witnessed acquisitions worth approximately  90 billion  resulting in dominance by just a few players  During 1990 2000  the industry witnessed approximately 400 big and small mergers and acquisitions  M A   Consolidation and market dominance consequently led to a decline in competition 
Big insurers that dominated large markets  hardly ever bothered to provide even basic information to consumers  such as the performance of health insurance policies  procedures to claim  the size of the provider network and cancellation procedures  Moreover  in the absence of any reason to lower policy holder costs  insurance companies went on raking in more profits year after year  Data from HealthReform gov showed that the profits of the 10 largest insurance companies increased 250  between 2000 and 2009  10 times faster than inflation  Consolidation among healthcare companies is leaving consumers with fewer choices and therefore more problems Another similar pending acquisition of Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   with Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   worth  34 billion is also being very closely scrutinized by federal regulators Other parties   The American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association    have also contested the Anthem Cigna merger  They have written to the antitrust division of the Justice Department asking to stop the merger Though the deal was approved by the shareholders of both companies back in Dec 2015  it will hit a rough patch with the antitrust regulators  with opposition flaring up now ",2016-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/anthem's-pending-cigna-acquisition-under-fire-in-california-200136639,200136639

142829,364344,HUM,UnitedHealth Maintains Profitability  Exits Public Exchange,opinion,"On Jun 21  we issued an update research report on the health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   UnitedHealth  is a leader in the health insurance industry and is incurring losses on the individual exchange business that is conducted via the public exchange  To protect its profitability  the company has exited public exchanges in more than a dozen states  This has saved the company from the loss that this business would have brought if it was continued Rather UnitedHealth is focusing on investing and growing its health services business branded as Optum  To this end  the company acquired Catamaran last year  The acquisition has been fruitful as evident from the revenue accretion from it   Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and is expected to account for about 42  of UnitedHealth Group s consolidated operating earnings this year 
 UNITEDHEALTH GP Price and Consensus   Over the past five years  UnitedHealth has also grown membership by nearly 13 5 million  or 40   well diversified across commercial  government programs and international offerings  The company s membership is further set to grow in the Medicare Advantage  Medicaid as well as commercial plans UnitedHealth also carries a strong balance sheet and generates handsome cash flows which allows it to increase dividend payments and make regular share buyback The company will nevertheless face stiff competition with the entry of new entities formed by the pending mergers of Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   with Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   and Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   with Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    The combined company formed by the Anthem Cigna merger is expected to cover 53 million lives  surpassing UnitedHealth  which covers 49 million as the nation s largest health insurer by membership at present  The Aetna Humana merger would enable the new entity to cover 33 million people and give stiff competition to UnitedHealth UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ",2016-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-maintains-profitability,-exits-public-exchange-200137379",200137379
142830,364345,HUM,U S  Health Insurers Offer Safety Amid Volatility,opinion,"In a volatile global economic environment  the U S  health insurance industry provides investors a micro defense thanks to high degree of its domestic business exposure  Players like Cigna Corp  NYSE CI    CI   UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH    UNH   Centene Corp   CNC  and Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  with business in international markets also have limited exposure  accounting for 3   4   1  and 0 5  of revenues respectively   More importantly  the sector is largely insulated from headwinds   low oil prices  interest rate hikes  strengthening dollar  China s economic slowdown   which have been plaguing other sectors of the economy The sole factor that has shaken the healthcare industry and changed it wholly is the Health Care Reform or Obamacare  enacted in Mar 2010  Though initially intensively lobbied against by the players  health care reform has turned out beneficial  Courtesy of Obamacare  insurers have witnessed meaningful gains in their membership enrollment  which has beefed up their revenues 
Total revenues of the top eight players  UnitedHealth   Aetna  Cigna  Molina Healthcare  MOH   Centene  WellCare Health Plans  Inc   WCG   Anthem Inc   ANTM  and Humana  NYSE HUM   Inc   HUM  increased to  437 billion in 2015 from  383 billion in 2014  with medical enrollment rising to 150 million in 2015 from 145 million in the prior year  Along with posting strong operating numbers  most of the players guided strong earnings for 2016  pointing to the fact that despite hurdles  the industry presents enough growth opportunities   
Now  after sharing the space with Obamacare for almost six years  insurers have embraced the law  Most of the players are now looking for newer avenues to expand their business  They are reassessing their business model from the perspective of product  pricing  risk management  distribution and claims to fraud management for a realistic pace of growth 
Let s discuss some of the opportunities provided by the changing industry landscape 
Extensive Consolidation
The Affordable Care Act  ACA  has heightened the drive toward market consolidation  The influx of the previously huge uninsured population into the space has increased overall membership  Now  the players are scrambling to maintain and grow their member enrollment further  and the best way to achieve this is by growing in size  With the health care law emphasizing value based care  it becomes imperative for health insurers to have a large number of patients to dilute risk  and of course ensure premium dollars to cover the expenses of their sick enrollees  thereby improving overall health outcomes 
Moreover  a bigger size would help in leveraging fixed cost and reducing overall administrative cost  increase cost of compliance with the new health care law   A bigger market share will also equip them better to negotiate harder with hospitals   Get big or get out  has therefore become the trend in the industry 
The merger frenzy hit a fever pitch with Anthem agreeing to acquire Cigna  Aetna seeking the Humana buyout and Centene s recent acquisition of Health Net  The market is speculating that consolidation will lead to the  big five  insurers transforming into the  big three   likely comprising Aetna  Anthem and UnitedHealth 
Higher Insured Population   Top Line Growth
Thanks to ObamaCare  the nation s uninsured rate has gone down to single digits  Before ACA  around 47 million lacked health coverage  Current data shows that the uninsured rate is around 9   According to an ongoing NHIS CDC study  the current uninsured rate of 9  for 2015 is the lowest in over 50 years 
The data shows that Obamacare has to a large extent accomplished its purpose which also points to the increased coverage provided by health insurers that would in turn add to their top line  Most health insurers have reported a secular rise in their revenues from membership gains because of the law 
Baby Boomers Present Medicare Growth
According to the U S  Census data  the population of Medicare beneficiaries will grow by 36  by the end of this decade led by a vast aging baby boomer population  In fact  in the next 25 years  the compounded annual growth rate of the Medicare population is expected to increase to 2 7  from 1 5  at present 
Revenues from the managed care plans of Medicare Advantage are expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire  Medicare Advantage is a privately run version of the government s Medicare insurance program for the aged and disabled  Until now  only two public providers    UnitedHealth and Humana    control more than 10  of the market  Carriers in the health insurance sector are in a race to win Medicare Advantage market share and the fastest way of achieving the target is by acquiring a company in the same business 
Shift to International Markets
Pressure on profit margins in the U S  market has compelled American health insurers to look to foreign markets for sustained growth and profitability  International markets seem attractive as these are less penetrated and competitive than the U S  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for the U S  health insurers 
Cigna and UnitedHealth Group lead the private health insurance industry in terms of international deal activity  They re followed by Aetna and Humana  The deals have either been mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures with local insurance companies 
Some of the deals made by players in this field echo the emerging trend toward globalization  In Apr 2014  Aetna bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe  Prior to that in Feb 2014  Cigna announced its debut in India s underpenetrated health insurance sector  in a joint venture with an Indian conglomerate TTK Group  In 2013  UnitedHealth bought a stake in AmilParticipacoes of Brazil for a nearly  5 billion  It already had a presence in Australia  the Middle East and the U K 
ACOs Gaining Prominence
Health insurers are trying to clinch accountable care payment contracts following the healthcare reform law s inclusion of Accountable Care Organization  ACO  tests under Medicare  The law s emphasis on providing accurate and efficient health care service rather than volume of service has led to the emergence of ACOs  These are formed when a group of health care providers  physicians  hospitals  non physician providers  and the likes  collectively take responsibility for the financial and quality outcome for a defined population 
The ACOs are appealing to insurers as these reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACO because these track and collect patient data  enabling an evaluation of patient care  Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just claims payers 
Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on many of their traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as exclusion of pre existing conditions  The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on current cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses   Private commercial payers such as Cigna  Anthem and Aetna are thus supporting ACO formation  CIGNA has one of the most established track records in the group for ACOs 
Developing Ancillary Businesses
Insurers are eyeing growth and expansion opportunities that accompany the critical challenges of modernizing the health care system  They are branching out to the non traditional areas  Over the last few years  several large insurers have acquired companies that fall outside the realm of traditional health insurance yet complement it  Humana acquired Antiva in 2011 to provide analytics services  Aetna invested in Health IT by acquiring Medicity and UnitedHealth has the broadest approach to and the greatest potential in cross selling synergies via its health benefits business via Optum  The Optum division is the poster child of UnitedHealth boasting successful diversification Healthy Balance SheetHealth insurers are also well poised with respect to their balance sheet  The risk based capital ratio of Anthem  Cigna  Aetna and UnitedHealth stands north of 500   substantially higher than the statutory level of 200   A low utilization rate  which has reduced claim payments  has helped to strengthen the balance sheet of these players 
Bottom Line
In a changing industry  which is witnessing the shift of power from insurance players to consumers  the need of the hour is to understand what consumers want and need  and provide quality service at the right time  Only those health players that modify their business strategy in tandem with the changing market will prevail and flourish in a consumer centric health insurance industry ",2016-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-health-insurers-offer-safety-amid-volatility-200137414,200137414

142882,364397,HUM,Preparing For The Grexit,opinion," If you owe your bank manager a thousand pounds  you are at his mercy  If you owe him a million pounds  he is at your mercy    John Maynard Keynes The day of dawning is upon us  at least  that is  for the financial future of Greece  In looking at the situation  the IMF and ECB are keeping the Greek Central Bank alive  and further down the food chain  the four largest Greek Banks  The banks assets are predominantly in Greek government bonds and deferred tax assets  so there continues to be very little tangible equity to support their customer bases  On the last two days of the week  depositers took  1 billion per day out of these financial institutions  As such  the Greek leaders may not have much alternative to cut a deal  but after six years of this mess  trying to predict their response is a waste of time  The country which has the most to consider  besides Greece  is Germany  Mrs  Merkel wants them in  and an ominous precedent would be set for the long term viability of the European Union if Greece says so long  As the world becomes more aware of by the day  Keynes prescient quote about banking remains pertinent  With a global world connected in every crevice and corner by fiberoptic cables  powerful satellites  and other forms of technology  every financial instrument is potentially linked in some way  As such  the idea a Greek default is going to be contained may have merit  but certainly  prudent people might want to start thinking about the possibilities if the Drachma becomes a reality   The most similar situation would be the financial crisis of 2008  which involved huge publicly traded companies needing billions of dollars of government capital  On a country basis  maybe the Mexican debt crisis could be a circumstance of equal comparison  From my point of view  in thinking about what happened in 2008  the first lesson learned was the eventual bottoming process took about nine months time  Lehman went bye bye in September of 2008  but markets did not bottom until March of 2009  Looking back  it turns out that by opportunistically buying during any of these months  you had a very good outcome  Still  if you purchased a little bit later  your price point was probably lower  so when the market came back  well  you get my drift  We have no idea what will unfold over the next few months  Anyone who thinks they do is far too confident  in my judgment  If you have extra cash available  it is a valuable asset which could be very productive if circumstances work in your favor  You have time to clearly consider where you want to have exposure  Next week will probably be very interesting and markets are going to react  or maybe they won t  which is part of the fun  In many cases  the eventual outcome is far different than what the general consensus believes  In sum  I personally don t believe this is anything close to what we experienced with Lehman  but you never know  so stay calm and keep your eye on your target  Financial markets have been relatively news free over the last week  The Fed decided to keep interest rates in place and considering the events transpiring in Europe  chances are  lower for longer  remains spot on  In corporate news  Federal Express and Oracle reported earnings last week and while strong  both guided expectations down for the rest of the year  In the IPO market  FitBit and Fogo De Chao jumped well over 20  each as public investors decided to mix good eating and exercise  The SEC rules on crowdfunding went into effect and it will be interesting to see how small companies are able to raise capital  Just as important  and more of a priority from where I sit  is whether the returns available prove worthy of the risk  Elsewhere in the government  the Treasury announced Alexander Hamilton will be replaced on the  10 bill  Alex deserves better   In the merger and acquisition arena  it seems the large health insurance entities  United  Cigna  NYSE CI   Aetna  NYSE AET   Humana  NYSE HUM   have all been rumored as buyers and sellers

Perhaps you have heard about the big vote in Greece over the weekend  Greeks voted to pay off all of their debt  they put the money in a big wooden horse  They left the horse on the doorstep of the European Central Bank in Brussels  Problem solved 
Actually  Greeks voted  No  in a referendum asking them to accept an international creditor proposal that would have included more austerity reforms  The final tally showed 61  voted  no   so it was a bit of a landslide  Both the Greek people and their government want to remain within the euro  and it isn t clear that there is a legal mechanism to kick Greece out of the Eurozone  at least not any time soon  Of course  a Greek exit might not be so bad  If you are an unemployed Greek worker  it really doesn t matter if you are not being paid in euros or drachmas  Actually  the idea of printing their own currency  even if it is greatly devalued  is probably easier to swallow than the boot to the throat that is austerity  The question is whether the Greeks must leave the euro to have their own currency  or if they can run a parallel currency and still remain in the Eurozone  Don t put it past the Greeks to fight a form of financial guerilla warfare 
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras spoke last night  saying that democracy cannot be blackmailed   Greeks have made a brave choice and I m convinced that the mandate is not to clash with Europe   adding that the question of Greece s place in Europe should be  off the table completely  
Depends on whose table  A couple of emergency meetings are now in the works  including an ECB gathering to discuss emergency liquidity assistance and a meeting between Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande that will review the Eurozone s response to the vote  Merkel is demanding Greece present a proposal for creditors  she says time is running out  Apparently  the proposal the Greeks sent on June 30th is not on the table anymore  Meanwhile  Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis will not be at the table  he is stepping down from his post due to heavy pressure from Greece s European partners 
The ECB is leaving little doubt about their approach  the beatings will continue until the Greeks collapse  Greek banks will not be getting any more help from the European Central Bank  In an  on Monday afternoon  the ECB said it would keep its Emergency Liquidity Assistance  or ELA  to Greece unchanged at levels announced last Monday  That level is believed to be around  89 billion euro  The problem for Greek banks  as it stands  is that it looks like they are quickly running out of cash  and unless the ECB releases more money to them  the banks will not be able to reopen this week  and the ATMs may run out of cash  Also of note is that the ECB said that it will adjust the haircuts on collateral accepted by the Bank of Greece as part of the ELA  This means  basically  that if the ECB increases the haircuts on collateral accepted by the Bank of Greece  the size of the ELA effectively decreases  If the adjustment is the other way  the ELA is effectively increased in size 
What the rest of Europe doesn t yet realize is that the entire Eurozone is only as strong as its weakest link  and efforts to punish the Greeks will only backfire on the whole of the Euro Union 
In an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit  French economist Thomas Piketty  the author of  Capitalism in the Twenty First Century   said Germany didn t repay its external debt after World War I nor did it repay debts after World War II and  has no standing to lecture other nations   Piketty said Germany s economic miracle after the end of the war is based in part on debt relief  noting that the London Debt Agreement of 1953 forgave 60  of German foreign debt and restructured its internal debts  Piketty says similar steps should be taken now with Greece 
The reaction in the US was muted  Stocks were down initially  then rallied to breakeven  then drifted lower 
The real elephant in the room might be China  Chinese stocks have dropped by 31 percent over the past month  losing more than  3 2 trillion in valuation  That is six times Greece s entire foreign debt  or 11 years of Greek economic output  Leveraged bets on Chinese stocks have increased to a record versus the size of the market  as prices fall faster than margin traders cut positions  Over the weekend  the Securities Association of China announced that 21 of the country s largest brokerages had agreed to pledge the equivalent of 15 percent of their net assets  or no less than  26 billion in total  to invest in blue chip investment stocks  The move represents a massive flow of liquidity into the market that will ultimately find its way to investors so they can undertake a buying binge  In addition to just throwing money at the problem  the Chinese government canned all new stock market floats  This follows from recent moves to cut interest rates and ease lenders  capital settings  The trouble is  despite using its well stocked toolbox  the Chinese government may not necessarily succeed in stabilizing its equity market 
Even after falls of 25 percent in the past couple of weeks  the Shanghai exchange is still boasting a one year return of more than 86 percent  The earnings of Chinese listed companies have not risen 86 percent this year   thus nor has their real value  Instead  the growth in the Chinese economy has been easing at the same time the stock market was experiencing these gains  Whether the Chinese government s move represents little more than a padded Band Aid remains to be seen 
China s Shanghai Composite finished higher by 2 4  amid a volatile session  The index opened with a gain of more than 8 5  before sliding  Elsewhere  Hong Kong s Hang Seng dropped 3 2   as trade entered a technical correction  now 11  off the April high 
Key elements of a nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers fell further into place on Sunday  U S  Secretary of State John Kerry warned there were more sticking points that may scuttle the deal  and he was prepared to walk away from negotiations if the problems were not resolved by Tuesday  Should sanctions be lifted  Iran would double its oil exports to 2 3 million barrels a day 
Oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries climbed to its highest monthly level since Aug  2012  OPEC production in June rose by 170 000 barrels per day from a month earlier  to 31 28 million barrels per day  OPEC is now pumping nearly 1 3 million barrels above its production ceiling of 30 million barrels a day  So  between Greece and China representing possible economic slowdown  plus the prospect of Iran pumping extra supplies  plus the reality of Saudi Arabia actually pumping extra supplies of oil  the price of oil was down almost 8  today  and that should result in savings of 2 cents per gallon in about 6 weeks  maybe 
We don t know if oil prices will continue to fall but there is a side bet on oil  and that is the Canadian dollar  or the loonie  Hedge funds and other fast money pushed net bets against the loonie to almost record levels ahead of crude oil s collapse last year  After the currency and crude oil s surprising resilience over the past few months beat them back  those positions are starting to grow again

142887,364402,HUM,Winners From The Anthem Cigna Mega Deal,opinion,"Almost a year in the making  healthcare insurance giants Anthem  NYSE ANTM  and Cigna  NYSE CI  have finally struck a deal 
And what a deal  too  Anthem will acquire Cigna for a whopping  48 billion  And with a combined 53 million insured people  the Anthem Cigna alliance would be the largest health insurer in the United States  second in revenue   behind UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and ahead of the proposed combination of Aetna  NYSE AET  and Humana  NYSE HUM  
In fact  if both the Cigna and Humana acquisitions are approved  the healthcare insurance industry will quickly consolidate into three giant insurers  which will insure over 40  of all Americans 
So what s driving this bout of consolidation 
Quite simply  you are  You and Obamacare 
The Real Beneficiaries of Obamacare
When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act  ACA  in 2010  critics immediately dubbed it  Obamacare   But supporters of the law have since adopted that term  And since the Supreme Court has now twice agreed with the Obama administration that the law means exactly the opposite of what Congress wrote  it s more than fair to call it Obamacare 
The primary beneficiaries of Obamacare aren t actually the American people   it s the big insurance companies  Need proof  Anthem  Cigna  UnitedHealth  Aetna  and Humana have all at least doubled over the past five years  And that s compared to an impressive 64  return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average 

The bottom line is that while the number of insured people has risen significantly   generally a good thing   many of these newly insured aren t actually using their insurance because the deductibles are so high 
You see  these people were required by law to purchase insurance   insurance that had to cover just about anything  even if the customer didn t want or need certain kinds of coverage  But to keep prices down  even after government subsidies  insurance companies were allowed to market plans with very high deductibles 
So many of these people never expect to use the coverage they were forced to buy unless they have a catastrophic illness or injury  even though the plans  cover  a variety of conditions  That s a pretty high profit proposition for the companies providing such  coverage  
On the other side of the equation  many who were previously denied coverage because of pre existing conditions finally received coverage under Obamacare  This is undeniably a good thing 
But the costs those patients incur are passed on to the rest of the insured population  making those high deductible plans an even better deal for insurance companies   and worse for customers 
Another big outcome of Obamacare is the acceleration of a trend that was already happening in healthcare  squeezing healthcare providers 
The Medicare  Advantage 
In theory  this trend should lower costs  even if it pains some doctors and hospitals  But by focusing on unit pricing instead of outcome based pricing  doctors are forced to work harder to keep the same incomes  but patient outcomes and overall costs don t improve 
Further industry consolidation will speed up this trend  After all  if just three companies are paying the bill for 40  or more of your customers  you pretty much have to do what they say 
This impacts Medicare  too   specifically  Medicare Advantage 
This is the government s plan to get seniors into  private  healthcare systems by paying the premiums  Rather than paying for services  Medicare Advantage pays the insurance company a monthly fee  just like companies and individuals do with their health insurers 
This is a high profit outcome for insurers  Indeed  the reason why UnitedHealth has larger revenue than the proposed Anthem Cigna combination is that United has more Medicare Advantage customers  Plenty of the recent merger activity among healthcare insurers has centered on acquiring these customers and being positioned to grab even more of them in the future 
Low Competition  High Control  Consistent Profits
Either way you slice Obamacare  most of the benefits end up going towards either large health insurance companies or large pharmaceutical companies 
But in the wake of increased consolidation among healthcare insurers  the market is asking whether these proposed mergers will go through  Or will they be killed due to antitrust issues  just like the Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Time Warner  NYSE TWX  deal was scrubbed 
The answer is  no   Lowering competition is a goal of the current administration  no matter what it says to the contrary  In fact  the big goal that you still hear from more honest Democrats is  single payer   And for some  the big dream is that the single payer will be the government 
However  cannier policymakers who believe in single payer systems know that it s actually easier to assert control over private companies than it is the bureaucracy laden federal government  So for them  the goal is a very small number of private companies that are highly regulated  in exchange for modest  but nearly guaranteed  profits  Utilities  basically 
So with this in mind  you can expect antitrust regulators to approve the mergers with some amount of token rhetoric that will make big headlines  but which won t overly influence the general direction of the health insurance industry toward just a few giants 
And it certainly won t hurt that one of the Obama administration s biggest champions   someone who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Service and was partially responsible for the disastrous initial rollout of healthcare gov   recently agreed to take a job as the chief executive of the health insurance s lobbying group 
So what will this mean for consumers 
Why Big Government Loves Big Healthcare Mergers
In the near term  not much  There are rumblings of big increases coming for private plans in many states  but with Obamacare having already taken away so many ways for health insurance companies to compete  any increases would be equally likely with a lot of companies as with a few 
The long run is more complicated   and more consolidation like the Anthem Cigna deal is what the government wants  Fewer companies generally mean less competition and higher prices  But again  there isn t much room for real competition in the Obamacare environment  As I mentioned  the government s goal in encouraging mergers is to increase the high control it already has over the industry 
There s a danger here  though  Those politicians rely on votes  and if the climate gets too bad  those voters will make their voices heard  This could be a case where the health insurance industry scoops big benefits early on  but in the long run  it ends up regretting that it got what it wished for ",2015-07-30,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-winners-from-the-anthem-cigna-mega-deal-260031,260031
142915,364430,HUM,Insider Trading In Washington  Here We Go Again,opinion,If transparency is the great disinfectant  then the stench emanating from Washington not only remains strong but just got a whole lot stronger  How so  Recall that the STOCK Act  that is the legislation passed a year ago to outlaw insider trading in Washington  only came into being after a 60 Minutes expose embarrassed Congress to address this racket  Prior to that the legislation sat bottled up in committee for many years  Well  if you had any real confidence that the STOCK Act would really clean out the insider trading stables in Washington  think again  With both old holes and recent new holes in this smelly piece of legislation  this act should be renamed the Molded Swiss Cheese Act  Thanks to the regular reader who brought  to my attention  Let s navigate  While almost no one was looking  a law making it easier for congressional and top executive branch staffers to engage in corrupt trading was signed into law Monday  The law is a modification of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge  STOCK  Act  The modification was passed by unanimous consent by the House and the Senate last week with no debate or even discussion  The STOCK Act  which became law just a year ago  was designed to discourage insider trading by members of Congress and top government officials  In addition to outlawing trading based on non public information gleaned by government officials during the course of their public duties  the law required extensive disclosure of financial holdings by Congressional staffers and 28 000 senior executive branch employees  The financial disclosures of these officials were to be posted in an online database open to the public  The disclosure requirements were an important part of the law  They would have allowed researchers to detect abnormally successful trading activity by unelected senior government staffers just as similar disclosure requirements for Congressmen and Senators had allowed scholars to produce evidence that suggested members of Congress were benefiting from non public information  Currently  although the reports of staff financial positions are officially part of the public record  they aren t readily available  Often they have to be requested from individual agencies using the names of the individuals about whom information is sought  The result is that the public is effectively blocked from learning the information disclosed in the reports  As if the stench attached to that  keep  em in the dark  amendment were not enough to highlight that the crowd in Washington still does not  get it   check out the smell associated with this   A key source for a private report that sent health care stocks on a tear earlier this month is a former top congressional aide who is now a health industry lobbyist  according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal  Mark Hayes is currently an outside lobbyist for health insurance giant Humana Inc  His email to Washington investment research firm Height Securities  alerting it to a government decision that will save the industry billions of dollars  was a final piece of confirmation Height received before blasting a news alert to its clients  according to emails and people familiar with the matter  In this case  on April 1 Height sent a report to clients 18 minutes before the end of trading that predicted correctly  it turned out a government agency would drop planned cuts in funding for insurers that offered Medicare Advantage plans  The report snagged the attention of big hedge fund firms that placed profitable trades  according to people familiar with the trading activity  Shares in several health care companies  including Humana  climbed sharply before the market close and again when trading opened the next day  This specific trade and activity of this sort falls under the heading of trading based on  political intelligence  emanating from Washington  The STOCK Act  heretofore known as The MOLDED SWISS CHEESE Act  does not directly address this stench  In fact  the  and concluded that  There are no laws or ethics rules that specifically govern the sale of information by a political intelligence firm  The allure of the cronyism and dirty money is just too much for those in Washington to resist  Financial reform  Yeah  right   Thank you again to the reader who brought these developments to my attention ,2013-04-19,Larry Doyle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/insider-trading-in-washington:-here-we-go-again-163578,163578

142917,364432,HUM,Is This The Right Time To Invest In Health Insurance Stocks ,opinion,"The insurance industry is on the threshold of stability and growth  despite clear signs of stress  Most players are reassessing their business model from product  pricing  risk management  distribution  claims and fraud management to a realistic pace of growth  The industry is also witnessing consolidation 
For decades  the industry has sought private sector engagement in meeting ever increasing national healthcare needs  These include the foundation of Medicare Advantage  the launch of Medicare Part D drug benefits  the formation of accountable care organizations  ACOs   steady migration of Medicaid to managed care  the expansion of benefit coverage to the uninsured under online exchanges  expanded Medicaid programs and the improvement in healthcare gov and many state based exchanges  Let s discuss some of the opportunities offered by the changing industry landscape  A bigger pool of people coming into the insurance system because of the ACA rule that every individual must have access to insurance  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has estimated that by 2020  approximately 24 million people will purchase coverage through the new federal and state health insurance exchanges established by the ACA    a substantial addition to the market  As per research by The Urban Institute s Health Reform Monitoring Survey  HRMS   7 3 million adults gained coverage in the first open enrollment period which ended on Mar 31  2014  WellPoint Inc   NYSE WLP   a publicly traded insurer which recorded the maximum enrollment in the new health care market  raised its 2014 earnings guidance after having benefited from the overhaul  Another insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc   NYSE UNH  stated that it will expand its Obamacare exchanges to two dozen in 2015 from five this year  A number of insurers have shown interest in increasing participation in exchanges and are submitting plans for approval for the second enrollment season  starting Nov 15  The expansion of the Medicaid program in 2014 presents an opportunity for large insurers participating in it  The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to nearly everyone under the age of 65 with income up to 138  of federal poverty levels  According to the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  the expansion of Medicaid will increase the insurance coverage by 8 million in 2014  UnitedHealth Group Inc  and WellPoint Inc  are among the largest Medicaid providers  Other companies that traditionally focused on employer based coverage may seek to enlarge their Medicaid plans  The rising senior population presents growth in the Medicare segment  According to the U S  Census data  the population of Medicare beneficiaries will grow by 36  by the end of this decade led by a vast  aging baby boomer population  In fact  in the next 25 years  the compounded annual growth rate of the Medicare population is expected to increase to 2 7  from 1 5  at present 
Revenues from managed care plans of Medicare Advantage are expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire  Medicare Advantage is a privately run version of the government s Medicare insurance program for the aged and disabled  Until now  only two public providers    UnitedHealth and Humana  NYSE HUM     control more than 10  of the market  However  we expect sharp consolidation in this market  Carriers in the health insurance sector are in a race to win Medicare Advantage market share and the fastest way of achieving the target is to acquire a company in the same business 
Global Opportunities
A sluggish economic growth  uncertainties in the newly enacted health care legislation and pressure on profit margins in general have led American health insurers to look to foreign markets for continued high rates of growth and profitability  Asia and Europe represent the best near term opportunities for U S  health insurers  Companies like Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  and Aetna Inc   NYSE AET   with a wide overseas presence  view their international business as a positive differentiator and key driver of higher than peer growth rates  Both companies intend to penetrate deeper into the emerging economies of Asia and the Middle East  In Apr 2014  Aetna bought U K  based InterGlobal  which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East  Asia  Africa and Europe  UnitedHealth is also following the same growth path  The company has expanded its reach from Australia  the Middle East and U K  to Brazil with its buyout of AmilParticipacoes  We expect to see more international deals going forward 
Alternative Care Delivery Models
Several new models    including ACO  patient centered medical homes  PCMH  and a wide variety of evidence based and pay for performance theories    are being tested for their ability to decrease total cost of care while maintaining or improving quality  ACO formation is rampant in the industry  ACOs are appealing to insurers as these provide a way to reduce medical cost and improve outcome  Insurers form an essential part of ACOs because these track and collect patient data  enabling the system to evaluate patient care   Since clinical information and care processes are shared and supported by all providers  it becomes easier to manage care and effectively lower the cost  With Obamacare  health insurers have to be more than just an insurer or claims payer  Under health reform  insurers have lost flexibility in ways that they can cope with rising medical expenses  They can no longer rely on traditional medical underwriting strategies  such as exclusion of pre existing conditions  The most effective approach for insurers now is to rely exclusively on cost control mechanisms to manage members  medical expenses  Under ACO  fees to physicians are paid on performance rather than on service  An ACO helps insurers to accomplish these objectives  In June 2013  the country s largest insurer  UnitedHealth Group  said it targeted spending about  50 billion under accountable care contracts by 2017  compared with the then  20 billion  In June 2014  Cigna successfully reached its 100 ACO goal announced in 2012

Insurers are eying growth and expansion opportunities accompanying the critical challenges of modernizing the health care system  They are branching out into non traditional areas  Over the last few years  several large insurers have acquired companies that fall outside the realm of traditional health insurance yet still complement it  Humana acquired Antiva in 2011 to provide analytics services while Aetna invested in Health IT by acquiring Medicity  UnitedHealth has the broadest approach and the greatest potential for cross selling synergies through its health benefits business via Optum  UnitedHealth Group s Optum division is the poster child for successful diversification  The unit includes OptumInsight  a health care analytics company  OptumHealth  which provides health management and wellness services  and OptumRx  a pharmacy benefit manager  Management at UnitedHealth is considering the expansion of its health service business to 35 40  of operating income over the long term 
Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
Many health insurance carriers are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestic and international to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets  Not discounting the copious mergers and acquisitions over several years  the Health Care Reform has set the stage right for further consolidation  With small insurers turning inefficient  following their inability to achieve the required level of profitability  big ticket acquisitions are the name of the game since 2011  WellPoint bought Amerigroup to expand its supplement lines business  UnitedHealth acquired AmilParticipacoes and XL Health for a wider base and new product lines  Other significant examples are Humana buying Metropolitan Health Networks  Inc   Cigna s buyout of Healthspring and Aetna s acquisition of Coventry Health Care Inc  Health Insurance Innovations Inc   NASDAQ HIIQ  buyout of privately held  Silicon Valley based HealthPocket  Inc  is also prominent in this regard Bottom Line The health insurance industry has been in flux recently  with many regulatory changes clouding the industry s outlook  But most of those issues are now behind us  which is helping reduce the level of uncertainty about the industry  This makes it an attractive opportunity for investors ",2014-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-the-right-time-to-invest-in-health-insurance-stocks-230747,230747

142952,364467,HUM,Humana Inc   Supreme Court Decision Looms  Industry On Hold  Vol Pops,opinion,Humana Inc   HUM  is a health care company  Humana operates in three segments  Retail  Employer Group  and Health and Well Being Services  The Company offers a range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong well being This is a vol note surrounding the increasingly contentious and interesting pending Supreme Court Ruling on President Obama s healthcare bill  Here s a news snippet that focuses on the impact to health insurers  If you haven t read up on the bill and pending ruling yet  I highly recommend checking that out as well It can be difficult to read the tea leaves after a Supreme Court debate  but the arguments over the law this week appear to point to a favorable situation for health insurers  Bernstein Research analyst Ana Gupta argues Based on commentary from the justices  it looks like the law s requirement that individuals purchase health insurance will be shot down  Gupte argues  But in that case  the court will also probably invalidate the portion of the law that makes insurers price policies the same whether you are sick or healthy  the part that allows people with pre existing conditions like cancer to get access to affordable coverage   That would be a net positive for insurers  Gupte says The court does not look  particularly  likely to strike down the entire law  a scenario that the insurance industry would be against  That might be somewhat  positive  for insurers  but could create uncertainty  Gupte argues Gupte sees the managed care sector rallying after the decision in the case is handed down in June     Source  Barron s via Yahoo  Finance    written by Avi SalzmanEither way it sounds like a vol event is embedded in these companies and a potential move may be coming  Let s turn to the Charts Tab  six months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side  we can see a nearly 50  rise from six months ago  But  it s the vol that caught my attention  The pop today is rather expected   but check out the level relative to its past The 52 wk range is  20 72   51 00    putting the current level in the 10th percentile  Odd given the potential for an abrupt reaction off of the news  Then there s the issue of earnings  which are due out on 4 30 2012  Hmmm Let s turn to the Skew Tab  below We can see a rather noticeable  normalcy  to the skew shape across all of the front expiries  In other words  the option market doesn t reflect any kind of bias  I do note that May is elevated to the other two expiries because of earnings  but that vol diff is relatively muted To understand what option skew is and why it exists you can read this post  Understanding Option Skew    What it is and Why it ExistsLet s turn to the Options Tab for some more detail I wrote about this one for TheStreet com  OptionsProfits   so no specific trade analysis here  Across the top  we can see that while Apr is priced to 23 68   May is priced to 27 24   and Aug is 26 75    That 27 24  level would be in the 24th percentile   so still depressed relative to its own history In English  the May vol which has both this industry wide event and a company specific earnings release  is priced in the bottom quartile  annual  of vol  relative to its own history   One huge note here  this is an event stock as long as the decision isn t released  which means back month vega can be very risky   all of the premium can be lost in a heart beat  That premium is at high risk in a very short period of time This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-03-30,Ophir Gottlieb,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/humana-inc.:-supreme-court-decision-looms;-industry-on-hold,-vol-pops-118696",118696
