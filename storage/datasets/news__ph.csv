14869,236384,PH,MHVYF Or PH  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Manufacturing   General Industrial sector have probably already heard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  Ltd   MHVYF  and Parker Hannifin  PH   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  Ltd  has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Parker Hannifin has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MHVYF has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
MHVYF currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 70  while PH has a forward P E of 18 26  We also note that MHVYF has a PEG ratio of 0 49  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PH currently has a PEG ratio of 2 
Another notable valuation metric for MHVYF is its P B ratio of 0 89  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PH has a P B of 4 19 
Based on these metrics and many more  MHVYF holds a Value grade of B  while PH has a Value grade of C 
MHVYF has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PH  so it seems like value investors will conclude that MHVYF is the superior option right now ",2019-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mhvyf-or-ph-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200483902,200483902
14870,236385,PH,Why Parker Hannifin  PH  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Parker Hannifin  PH   This company  which is in the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of motion and control products has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 83  
For the last reported quarter  Parker Hannifin came out with earnings of  2 76 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 per share  representing a surprise of 4 55   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 09 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 31 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 12  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Parker Hannifin lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Parker Hannifin currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 30   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-parkerhannifin-ph-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200496328,200496328

14887,236402,PH,Parker Hannifin  PH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Parker Hannifin  PH  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of motion and control products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 47 billion  down 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 37  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Parker Hannifin 
For Parker Hannifin  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Parker Hannifin will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Parker Hannifin would post earnings of  2 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 76  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

our cash flow are all time highs  relative to previous downturns  I think the best way to compare this    the best way to do it apples to apples is look at the base business without lowering side  Phonetic  and compare it to prior downturns When you look at our second quarter FY  20 adjusted operating margin without acquisitions  that came in at 16 1   This compares to our previous best recession performance  which was in FY  16  and that Q2 adjusted operating margins were 13 5   Both of these recessions had about similar organic sales declines and this represents a 260 basis point improvement comparing that to our best previous recession performance  Really  a remarkable performance and really my thanks to everybody around the world for doing such a great job In addition to the margin improvement  cash flow from operating activities was an all time year to date Q2 record  This performance demonstrates that we are building a more resilient business that is poised for accelerated earnings growth as the market turns Strong FY  20 margin performance and cash flow generation so far are really a reflection of the improvements driven by The Win Strategy and the strengthening of our portfolio by buying companies that are accretive to growth and to margins  So we are excited about where we are and we re excited about where we re going to go in the future Shifting to safety  We had a 25  reduction in recordable incidents in Q2  Really making great progress here and my thanks again to everybody for their effort on this and their dedication to safety  Our recordable incident rate and what that is  people that aren t familiar with that  that is the number of safety incidents we have per 100 members that is now top quartile versus our proxy peers  And there s a very strong linkage You ve heard me talk about is between safety and business performance  If you had applied our safety metrics and our financial metrics you ll see them moving in tandem in a positive direction  So some summary comments on Q2  Sales for our second quarter record as acquisition revenue offset soft organic sales  Organic sales declined as we expected with improvement in international organic sales versus our guide  The 737 MAX issues impacted our aerospace business as Q2 airframe and engine orders were slowed in advance of the production pause Strong adjusted EBITDA margins were significantly higher than they were during the last recession  We came in at Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin of 18 5  again really strong performance  Earnings in the quarter were excellent and adjusted EPS exceeded expectations Order rates in the quarter continued to be negative impacting organic growth  And the portfolio additions that we have made are certainly going to help our organic growth over time  We ve acquired businesses that are more resilient with higher organic growth rates than legacy Parker  We re well positioned for excellent performance in the second half of FY 2020 and beyond that I want to move now to year to date cash flow  You ve heard me talk about how this is such a strategic priority for us  We want to be great generators and deployers of cash to drive excellent returns for our shareholders  We ve achieved the best ever cash flow from operations of any first half in our history  And given the current market conditions that s really commendable  Free cash flow to sales is about 10  and we re expecting to achieve our 19th consecutive year of cash from operating activities as a percent of sales in excess of 10  for FY  20  The year to date free cash flow conversion was excellent at 130  Moving now to the outlook  we re increasing EPS guidance for FY  20 on roughly flat sales to the prior year  This reflects strong Q2 performance which is being offset by the 737 MAX and slightly weaker organic sales in the second half versus our prior guide Our guidance assumes no additional 737 MAX sales for the balance of FY  20  We are very excited about the future  We feel we re well positioned for growth with excellent margins and cash flow as the macro conditions improve  Some of the factors that are driving this feeling of confidence will be first launching of The Win Strategy 3 0 which is going to drive a further step change in the performance of the Company really building on the momentum from the previous updates that we ve made to The Win Strategy Second would be the portfolio strengthening that we ve done through the strategic acquisitions that have come on board  We re very happy with how LORD and Exotic integrations are progressing and we can comment more about that in the Q A  And we recently had the leadership teams for both businesses here at headquarters talked about the    incorporating The Win Strategy 3 0 their integration plans  It was a great session  a lot of good teamwork there And then third would be the launch of the purpose statement which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow  This statement is a real source of pride for our organization  And we recognize that it takes being a top quartile performing company to live up to the higher purpose Parker is transforming as evidenced by the higher level of performance that we re doing in a very difficult part of the business cycle with lots of opportunities to drive earnings growth beyond FY  20  Switching to the next slide  you ll see a reminder of our winning formula what we have characterized is our competitive differentiators  And I ve talked about these before  so I m not going to say highlight each one specific  I would just tell you this is    this listing in aggregate is what makes us special  This is why customers come to us and this is why shareholders should think about investing in Parker If I had to reference one in particular these competitive differentiators  I would point out Win Strategy 3 0 and what we re    the momentum and the performance enhancements that s going to create over time  And a lot more discussions will happen on that as we move forward So my thanks to all the global team members for their continued and dedicated effort in creating a top quartile company  And with that I ll hand it back to Cathy for more details on the quarter and the guidance Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Thanks  Tom  I d like you to now refer to slide number 6  This slide presents as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter  Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were  2 54  compared to  2 51 for the same quarter a year ago  Adjustments from the fiscal year  20 as reported results totaled  0 97 including before tax amounts of business realignment charges of  0 08  acquisition costs to achieve of  0 05 and acquisition transaction expenses of  1 14  These were offset by the tax effect of these adjustments of  0 30  Prior year second quarter earnings per share had been adjusted by  0 15  the details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non GAAP financial measures On slide number 7  you ll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of  2 51 to the second quarter of fiscal    for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to  2 54 for the second quarter of this year  Starting with the net decrease of  0 13 in segment operating income  For Legacy Parker  a  260 million decline in sales contributed to a  0 34 reduction in operating income  The Legacy Parker teams did a good job of controlling costs on this lower volume by sustaining a decremental margin of 23  for the quarter  The acquisitions contributed  0 21 partially offsetting this reduction Lower corporate G A contributed  0 16 due to gains this year  compared to losses last year on market adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation  Incremental interest expense on the debt borrowed for the acquisitions resulted in a  0 20 year over year decline in the current earnings per share  Lower other expense of  0 07 benefited from interest income earned on the bond proceeds prior to the closing of the LORD acquisition  We gained  0 10 from a lower tax rate  primarily due to favorable discrete tax benefits and a lower share count benefited the current quarter   0 03 Slide number 8 shows total Parker sales and segment operating margin for the second quarter  Organic sales decreased year over year by 7 1  and currency had a negative impact of 0 4   These declines were more than offset by the positive impact of 8 2  from the acquisitions Total adjusted segment operating margins were 15 8  compared to 16 6  last year  This 80 basis point decline before the incremental amortization expense from the acquisitions  With the help of The Win Strategy tools  the Legacy Parker businesses managed to achieve good decremental margins of 23  on their lower sales volume On slide 9  we re showing the impact LORD and Exotic had on the second quarter fiscal year 2020  These results reflect a partial quarter of contribution from LORD since the acquisition closed on October 28th  and a full quarter of Exotic  which closed on September 16th  Sales from the acquisitions during the quarter were  286 million and operating income on an adjusted basis was  36 million during this stub period Moving to slide number 10  I ll discuss the business segments  starting with Diversified Industrial North America  For the second quarter  North American organic sales were down 8 5   while acquisitions contributed 7 3  to the segment  Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 15 4  of sales versus 16  in the prior year  Incremental amortization of 75 basis points in the quarter more than accounted for the change in margins  North America s legacy businesses generated a good decremental margin of 24   reflecting the hard work of diligent cost containment and productivity improvements together with the impact of our Win Strategy initiatives Moving to the Diversified Industrial International segment on slide number 11  Organic sales for the second quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 9 4   Acquisitions contributed 4 5  to the segment and currency had a negative impact of 1 4   Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 14 6  of sales versus 15 7  in the prior year  Incremental amortization was 30 basis points in the quarter  The legacy businesses generated a very good decremental margin of 23  which was partially offset by contributions from the acquisitions I ll now move to slide number 12 to review the Aerospace Systems segment  Aerospace Systems sales increased  111 million or 18  from acquisitions and 1 3  from organic sales  Growth in military OEM and commercial aftermarket sales were largely offset by lower commercial OEM sales and military aftermarket sales Operating margin for the second quarter was 18 5  of sales versus 19 7  last year  Incremental amortization expense of 160 basis points more than accounted for the change in margins  Good margin performance from Exotic and hard work by the teams on productivity improvements  helped contribute to the strong performance in the quarter On slide number 13 we report cash flow from operating activities  Year to date cash flow from operating activities was  826 million or 12 1  of sales  This compares to 10 7  of sales for the same period last year after last year s number is adjusted for a  200 million discretionary pension contribution  That s a year over year increase of 11   Free cash flow for the current quarter was 10 4  of sales and the conversion rate to net income was 130  Moving to slide number 14  we show the details of order rates by segment  As a reminder these orders results exclude acquisitions  divestitures and currency  The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three month rolling average  while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12 month rolling average Continued declines in the industrial markets resulted in total orders dropping 3   This year over year decline is made up of a 7  decline from Diversified Industrial North American orders and a 6  decline from Diversified Industrial International orders offset by a positive 12  increase from Aerospace Systems orders Moving to slide number 15  The full year earnings guidance for fiscal year 2020 is outlined  This guidance has been revised to align to current macro conditions and includes the impact of the LORD and Exotic acquisitions  Guidance is being provided on both an as reported and an adjusted basis  Total sales for the year with the help from acquisitions are now expected to be flat compared to prior year  Anticipated full year organic change at the midpoint is a decline of 6 4   Currency is expected to have a negative 0 5  impact on sales  And acquisitions will add 6 9  to the current year We have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended December 31  2019 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year over year impact for the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2020  Considering the uncertainty of the regulatory clearance of the 737 MAX  we have now excluded all 737 MAX sales for the balance of the fiscal year 2020 For total Parker  as reported segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 15 1  and 15 5   while adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 16  and 16 4   We have not adjusted the incremental amortization expense of approximately  100 million  we will incur in fiscal year  20 as a result of the two acquisitions The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 22 5   The second quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by discrete items which we don t forecast for the balance of the year  We continue to anticipate a tax rate from continuing operations of 23 3  for the remainder of the year For the full year  the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now  8 78 to  9 38 or  9 08 at the midpoint  On an adjusted earnings per share basis  the guidance range is now  10 25 to  10 85 or  10 55 at the midpoint  The adjustments to the as reported forecast made in this guidance include business realignment expenses of approximately  40 million for the full year fiscal 2020 with the associated savings projected to be  15 million this year Synergy savings from CLARCOR are still estimated to achieve a run rate of  160 million by the end of fiscal year  20  which represents an incremental  35 million of year end savings  In addition  guidance on an adjusted basis excludes  27 million of integration costs to achieve for LORD and Exotic and  185 million of one time acquisition related expenses LORD and Exotic are expected to achieve synergy savings of  18 million this fiscal year  A reconciliation and further details of these adjustments can be found in the appendix to this morning s slides  Savings from all business realignment and acquisition costs to achieve are fully reflected in both the as reported and the adjusted operating margin guidance ranges  We ask that you continue to publish your estimates using adjusted guidance for purposes of representing a more consistent year over year comparison Some additional key assumptions for full year 2020 guidance at midpoint are sales are divided 48   second half  52     sorry 48   first half  52   second half  Adjusted segment operating income is split  49   first half  51   second half  Adjusted EPS second half is    first half second half is divided 50   50  Third quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be  2 36 per share at the midpoint and this excludes  18 million of projected business realignment expenses   7 million of integration costs to achieve and  19 million of one time acquisition related expenses On slide 16  you ll find a reconciliation of the major components of revised fiscal year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of  10 55 per share at the midpoint  compared to the prior guidance of  10 50 per share  During the second quarter  stronger than guided sales together with meaningfully higher segment operating margins from the industrial segment generated a net  0 17 operating income beat  Strong gains in market adjusted investments tied to deferred compensation and lower than guided interest expense contributed a benefit of  0 08 and favorable discrete tax benefits during the quarter helped to contribute  0 07  totaling to a  0 32 EPS beat in the quarter Updates to the second half guide result in a  0 04 increase in operating income offset by a  0 30 negative impact to operating income from the elimination of 737 MAX shipments in the second half  Updates to the below the line items resulted in a net  0 01 decline  This results in a net  0 05 increase to the fiscal 2020 full year guided earnings per share at the midpoint On slide 17  we show the impact the acquisitions will have on both an as reported and adjusted basis for the full year  On an adjusted basis the acquisitions lower operating margin to 16 2  for total Parker from 16 6  for Legacy Parker impacted by the  100 million or 70 basis points of full year FY  20 incremental amortization expense  For the adjusted EBITDA margins  the acquisitions provide 50 basis points of improvement  moving from 18 1  for Legacy Parker to 18 6  for total Parker If you ll now go to slide 18  I ll turn it back to Tom for summary comments Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Cathy  We re pleased with the continued progress  We are performing well for this downturn as demonstrated by our cash flow performance and our ability to raise the floor on margins  We re well on our way to delivering top quartile financial performance as a company I just want to remind people where we re trying to drive to as far as we re laser focused on our FY  23 targets and those are sales growth at 150 basis points greater than global industrial production growth  segment operating margins at 19   EBITDA margins at 20   free cash flow conversion greater than 100   And those would all culminate in driving an EPS CAGR over that period of time of 10  plus  So thanks again to the global team  everybody around the world for all your hard work And with that  I ll hand it over to Liz to start the Q A portion of the call Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird  Your line is now open Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYes  Good morning  everyone Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Mig Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystMaybe just very quickly some clarification on what s embedded at segment level for organic growth  especially in your industrial business Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMig  it s Tom  So what we assumed for    I m just going to give you for the second half with the new guide was North America at minus 7   Phonetic   international at minus 12   aerospace at minus 0 5   gets to the second half at a minus 7 5   And that compares to the prior guide with minus 6   Big difference there being a little bit of weakness in North America but the big difference was the shift in the MAX Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystUnderstood  Then if I may on international  I think you said negative 12  for the second half Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Yeah Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystIf I m comparing that with what you ve done in    in the first half  there is some deceleration there  And obviously your orders are looking a little bit different in that regard being less bad if you would  So can you help us understand kind of how you re seeing it and what s going on there Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So our thinking on    again Mig  it s Tom  Our thinking on the orders and the sales for international  first of all  you re right  So orders came in at minus 6   They did improve in Q2  but that was driven mainly by Asia  And from what we can tell  a lot of that was influenced by some pull ins in advance of Chinese New Year  So we feel these order rates may be a little bit overstated or maybe not entirely reflective of underlying market conditions And then given the uncertainties of the Coronavirus and the fact that Chinese government has extended Chinese New Year by one week  we actually had our Asia team just within the last 48 hours redo the second half forecast on what they thought  And their latest thinking which is obviously very fluid given what s going on there is now reflected in this new guide And ironically it came in about the same as what we had before  We were minus 11 5  before  we were minus 12   Phonetic   But that was our thinking is that  combination of the orders are a little bit over enhanced from the pull ins and our current intelligence based on what s going on is reflected in this guide Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystI appreciate that  Not to put too fine a point but as we re sort of thinking about the Q3  specifically in Asia  in China  how do we think about that in terms of the negative 12  for the back half of the year  Thank you Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I m not going to split it out necessarily by region but we have international for Q3 at about minus 16   So the worst of that hitting in Q3  you got the Chinese New Year  the extension of that  There s some obvious reasons why Q3 might be impacted worse Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Tom Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mig OperatorOur next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel  Your line is now open Nathan Jones    Stifel    AnalystGood morning  everyone Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Nathan Nathan Jones    Stifel    AnalystMaybe I ll just start with a question on pricing  I mean you were kind of getting to the peak of the negative comps in this part of the down cycle  Are you guys seeing any pressure coming from customers  Any kind of aggressive or irrational behavior from competitors in the market out there  I know you guys are always targeting being price cost neutral  Are you still able to maintain that at the moment  And do you think you can maintain it for the rest of the year Lee C  Banks    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Nathan  it s Lee  The answer to your question is yes  As you know  our goal always is to be price cost neutral  margin neutral  And I think why we re so resilient in doing that are the processes that we have  We follow the input costs through our purchase price index and we have our selling price index that we track at all the different locations  But in our forecast and what we re expecting is to be price cost neutral  margin neutral Nathan Jones    Stifel    AnalystOkay  You guys have also    I mean  you ve taken the margin expectation in aerospace down  which I think it s fairly straightforward  right  You ve got less volume from the MAX  so you re not going to say the leverage on that  You did take the margin expectations in both North America and international up  Can you talk about what s going on there  whether it s internal productivity  Or what else has led to an expectation of better margins for the full year than you had previously baked into guidance Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNathan  it s Tom  I think what we re experiencing  what we said  and you saw a lot of that in the first half  if I take North America as an example  we had some benefits from lower synergies pulling in from what we had originally expected  The Win Strategy and everything we re doing there  We ve seen a lot of help from Kaizen activities at all of our plants On international  we had a very strong Q2  driven somewhat with higher volume burst of our guide  But the same thing for international  Kaizen activities  The Win Strategy  we had the benefit of prior restructuring that is playing through for us there  And I think it just gave us confidence that when we looked at our second half that we could continue that in the second half  The organic growth is slightly different  slightly worse than the prior guide  But we didn t think it was enough to    we felt we had enough other positives to offset that and to improve the margins Nathan Jones    Stifel    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much for taking my questions  I ll pass it on Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Nathan OperatorOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Joe Nathan Jones    Stifel    AnalystTom  I just want to clarify the MAX comment that you made  I think you said that it impacted 2Q  And so  if it did  like  what kind of impact did it have on 2Q  And then secondly  as you think about the zero for the second half of the year  is it just fair to assume that airframers have inventory on hand and that s why the MAX is going to zero in 2H Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So let me just    Joe  this is Tom  Glad you asked  because I wanted to give a little bit of color as to why we did  what we did on the MAX  First  given Boeing s public comments about the ungrounding occurring sometime in the middle of the year  we felt that  hey  there s a lot of uncertainty there  Even Boeing doesn t fully know exactly what s going to happen with that  once suppliers will turn back on  And that we really wanted to derisk the guidance for the rest of the fiscal year by taking the MAX out I also felt that it wasn t fair to our shareholders to have it in and then be guessing on what it s going to be and what kind of ramps it could be  I thought it was a disservice to our shareholders and that it would be much better perceived stronger by taking it completely out and showing that we could demonstrate the guidance that we re going to    that we have here  even without the MAX So what we did is    so the production pause officially started January 15th  However  when you look at what hit us in Q2  there was some minor slowing of orders  both on the airframe and the engine side  It was approximately  5 million in Q2  The total amount for us for the full year  including Q2 and the second half  is  150 million impact for the MAX and  50 million of earnings  Obviously  lower volume and the lack of absorption associated with that But obviously Boeing and as well as all of our customers are really important to us  We re going to be there to support them whenever the production returns  If it happens to return sooner what we have in this guidance we ll be there for them  And in the meantime  we re reallocating our team members to other programs as much as possible to help with backlog and potentially accelerating schedules of our customers permit that  So that s really the strategy and the thinking behind the MAX Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s super helpful Tom  And then maybe if you can just  kind of  talk about the North America weakness in a little bit more detail  just parsing out like what you re seeing from a distributor perspective versus what you re seeing on the heavy industry side and how you expect that to play out in your fiscal second half Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So Joe what I ll do is  I ll go through North America  but I ll just maybe run through the whole company on markets  because it s typically a question people want  But our thinking on North America  we re guiding 100 bps lower than what the prior guide  So it was minus 6   Now it s minus 7   I m just talking about the second half because  obviously  that s what s left Orders were down from    100 basis points from Q1 to Q2  So that s probably the most direct linkage there  We had distribution weaker  We have the December ISM at 47 2  Phonetic   And all those factors plus  obviously  every time we do this we do a bottoms up  We really look at what our thinking was there I went through international  but I wanted to make a comment about distribution when I think about North America  So distribution and the whole for the whole company was down mid single digits about 400 basis points worse than Q1  And this declined pretty much sequentially through the quarter and really was broad based from an end market standpoint International distribution was worse in North America  but about all the regions went down equally approximately going Q1 to Q2  In North America in particular  we think the holiday timing hurt  There s two Wednesdays involved there for Christmas and New Year s Day  And really what we saw with end customers is that drove extended plant shutdowns  And our distributors as a result of this broad market based decline and the extended shutdowns took the opportunity to resize their inventory So if you think about down mid single digits on distribution  our best intelligence and again this is an estimate  it was about half of that was destocking  Half of it was tied in markets  Maybe if I go back to just total end markets  I m just going to list all of the positives and the negatives and I ll give maybe a little more color on the specific end markets  But on the positive side for the quarter Q2 total Parker  aerospace  mining  semiconductor  lawn and turf and marine  And then minus was distribution  which was    I was just talking about  It s not a market but an important channel to us Mills and foundries  refrigeration  machine tools  tire and rubber  power generation  telecom  life sciences  oil and gas  automotive  heavy duty truck  construction  ag  forestry and rail this is too long a list on the negative side So    but let me give you some color if I was to  kind of  lift it up to the major segments  So I talked about distribution  So now I d just characterize industrial end markets  For those maybe not familiar  all of our industrial markets are basically things without wheels things that don t move equipment that doesn t move  That was    that improved  So  industrial markets went from minus nine to minus 6 5   again total company The positive side of there was low single digit improvements in mining and semiconductor  Semiconductor is starting to come back  On the negative side  low single digits  I m just going to give you buckets  Low single digits was mills  oil and gas  Mid single digits was refrigeration  power gen and general industrial  And things greater than 10  declines were machine tools  rubber and tire  telecom and life science Then on the mobile side  again equipment with wheels saw us go from minus 6 5  in Q1 to minus 14   So that was the big shift  A lot of that was driven in North America  And the positives there was mid single digit improvements in lawn and turf And then on the negatives  kind of  two buckets here  high single digit decline in forestry  But then almost all the end markets with mobile were kind of in that 10  to 20  decline range  automotive construction  heavy truck  ag  rail and material handling  And then Cathy alluded to in her comments about aerospace  I m rounding to the nearest half  Up plus 1 5   We had commercial OE minus 3   military OE plus 2   commercial MRO plus 15  and military MRO down 5   Netted out to 1 5   So that s kind of the spend through the end markets  Joe  I hope you have a follow up to that Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystNo  I think I m all good  Thanks  Thanks  Tom Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Joe OperatorOur next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  Thanks  Good morning  guys Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Nicole Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystSo  I guess  maybe focusing on the North America orders  we already talked a little bit about what happened in international  But what s your view on whether or not order activity has bottomed and maybe thinking about how January has trended as a way to characterize that Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNicole  it s Tom  So if I was to kind of do what I did  I won t go into that same kind of detail for North America  But if you look at North America industrial  it went Q1 to Q2 basically about to say minus 5 5   minus 6   So basically the same quarter over quarter  The mobile is what declined the most  It went from minus 5  to minus 16   And all the same end markets that I just described for the total company  is what we saw there And then on distribution  that went from minus 2  to about    I mean  it was flat in North America to about minus 4  or so    in Q2  So that was 400 bps in North America alone that we went down  So that was kind of how we look at North America  I think  in general  when we think about organic growth for the year we re really    in our guidance  we re reflecting really Q3 is kind of our bottom from what we see at this point Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Got it  That s helpful  Thanks  Tom  And then just a quick one on the deals  I think you guys said that you re expecting  18 million of synergies  up a little bit from your prior guidance  Can you just say what you ve realized in synergies in the second quarter  And what s remaining for the second half Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We saw a little bit of the synergies for LORD pull into the second quarter  The timing moves ahead for us  so we got them sooner than we anticipated  And so  we re then factoring that through the rest of the year as well  So  a small amount in Q2 with  18 million for the full year effect Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  Thanks  I ll hop it on Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Nicole OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with J P  Morgan  Your line is now open Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  Good morning  everybody Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystGood morning  Tom  would you just comment on the notion on that  while you ve taken the downturn in aerospace because of the 737 MAX  Couldn t that also spill over into your industrial business more broadly  just from the supply chain and the supply base as they have to shut down production Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Ann  it s Tom  We did factor that in  Because people who don t realize that we d have a fair amount of work that goes that s aerospace related and engineered materials and filtration that goes into that  So the  150 million includes the industrial piece in that  And just in round numbers about 10  of that is industrial  and the other 90  as you might imagine  the bulk of it is in the Aerospace segment  But we did factor in the amount of onboard type of work we did  And then the    I think what data part you re referring to is the things that might be in the factories of our suppliers  That s factored into the guide we have for the rest of the business Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  That s    I appreciate that  And then just circling back on the same topic  can you give us a breakdown  the  150 million  How much of that is Legacy Parker  And how much is Exotic Metals Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Exotic is  16 million of the  50 million Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial Officer 150 million Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOf the  150 million  sorry  Yeah   60 million of the  150 million Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    Analyst 60 million of the  150 million Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  And that includes both direct shipments content on the aircraft as well as shipments to the engine Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that  I just wanted to get back color  and I think you d given us most of everything I m assuming  So  I appreciate it Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thank you Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ann OperatorOur next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  A nice quarter  I guess two questions Tom  Just in terms of as we exit 2020  potentially comps get better when we start to see organic growth reignite again  Based on what you ve done with the acquisitions and when is there    should we be thinking about incrementals any differently  And I m wondering if there s a difference on how to think about things Industrial versus Aerospace I guess And then just my second question just relates to your portfolio given some of the announcements recently  One  do you see any change in the competitive landscape  Or could that be a positive for you with Eaton selling their hydraulics business  And just your view of    is there any change in your view I guess of your portfolio in terms of potential divestitures  Thank you Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Jamie  it s Tom  So I m going to work backwards on the questions  I ll start with    I think what you re referring to is the Danfoss Eaton announcement  I would first say we weren t surprised  given I think the portfolio that Eaton has  And I think some of our inclination as to what they might do with it We have a lot of respect for both Danfoss and Eaton  And in our view  strong competitors make you a better business  So we welcome the challenge  We like our chances  We believe that the breadth of our technologies  the growth that we have with the motion and control technology and The Win Strategy is going to allow us to compete effectively with any company in our space  And we re confident going forward Obviously when you have these  kind of  transitions  having done a lot of these type of acquisitions ourselves  we recognize that there s stress in the system when that happens  And there s maybe a potential opportunity to look at share gain  And so we will  obviously  be doing everything we can to optimize that and take advantage of that and good competitive tension in the system So if I move back to maybe your other two comments from incremental MROSs  kind of  looking forward  I still think plus 30  Phonetic  in general is a good number if you re doing it over multiple years  But clearly coming out of a downturn as we have talked about in the past  you would expect to see that be north of a plus 30  because you re going to get some help as that volume comes up  And you re going to be only adding incremental variable cost and doing it very efficiently as you do that  So I think the first couple of quarters coming out  tends to be stronger than what I would say you d see over a whole cycle And then the whole goal of these acquisitions and they will but maybe I could just comment in general about them  I m extremely pleased with the progress  We ve acquired great products and technology but the best thing that we ve done is the talent that s come into the organization from these two businesses It was on full display when we had the leadership meaning we have about 80 people from both businesses and together  And if I look at LORD  LORD is ahead of what we had hoped for  low single digit growth and that compares to a minus 6 5  for total Parker  So it s doing what we wanted  It s more resilient And what we re seeing from the aerospace thermal management  The structural adhesives part of LORD is really doing quite nicely  We were very confident on the  125 million of cost synergies and we pulled in the synergies into this year Now with Exotic  the team is doing a great job  The 737 MAX is out of everybody s hands  That s something we can t control  But that team there is effectively redeployed everybody that was on the MAX and we ve redeployed them to the F 135  And we got to do some minor capex to help facilitate that  But we have them on F 135 We also have the repair depot starting up on the F 135  And then we ve got one of the big synergies which we didn t really disclose on our revenue side is the fact that we have this well established aftermarket organization customer support operation as part of legacy Parker aerospace that can help with the commercial efforts of Exotic to go capture those legacy engines and to look for spares and repairs for all the type of products that Exotic does  And we re going to do that and we re going to try to pull them in And everything I just described in that is not going to really help so much Exotic in FY 2020  but it s really positioned for FY 2021  And the MAX will come back  And so I think we have the benefit there  There s potentially a one two punch with Exotic MAX goes back  And then we ve also got additional people trained Now some of the F 135 will depend on our customer allowing us to accelerate the schedule  I think they have signaled that they would  But obviously  if some other supply becomes a constraint for them they might slow us down  But that s an opportunity to accelerate the F 135  So that s kind of a long winded answer on acquisitions But if you think about them in aggregate they re coming in they re going to grow faster than the legacy Parker  And that was the whole reason why we acquired them  You see the incremental EBITDA  what it s doing for us in one of the slides that Cathy had  So we re still very positive  The MAX is a short term blip on the path to a pretty strong future for them Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  I appreciate the color Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jamie OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research  Your line is now open Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystYeah  Thank you  Good day  everyone  Just a couple of things for me  First just back to LORD  Tom  Can you address how it s performing kind of in the automotive markets  And you had pointed to kind of the ability to outgrow through thick and thin  We ve heard a lot of the kind of negative automotive comments out of the 3Ms and DuPonts here this earnings season  Just wondering how things are really progressing for that slice of the business Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So    and without getting into specific numbers  if I just take the three major buckets  Aerospace is a pretty strong growth for us  And then the industrial piece would be slightly negative and automotive would be neutral to slightly positive  And what s really happening there is the technologies we have there that are more electrification type of technologies which would be thermal management And structural adhesives are offsetting the weaknesses that we have  And the traditional adhesives and coatings they might be more supplied into the internal combustion engine  So I m really happy with what they re doing  coming in at low single digits  And that s even factoring in some weakness in Asia tied to the Coronavirus  So those    that s  obviously a new element and that s an unknown still as    and yet to be determined  But I m really happy with what they re doing out of the gate Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAnd I was curious back to the MAX situation  You provided a little detail on the redirect to the F 135 etc  But have you actually shut down MAX related production  Or are you continuing at some low rate to keep the line warm  How do you manage that operationally to make sure you are ready to go if you get the signal Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  obviously  that s a balancing act  So we redeployed the people  So we haven t lost that skill set for the most part  There s some we could not retain unfortunately  but we ve retained most of them  So we have the skill set people wise  Obviously we ll make sure we maintain any of the equipment that needs to be maintained  So we re ready to go And with our supply chain  we re making sure that they re ready and able to supply to us when we need to  So if we need to carry a little extra inventory to be ready we ll do that  And our suppliers will be ready too  But I thought it was prudent for us and for our shareholders to not be trying to chase and guessing when the MAX is going to start back up  So we didn t build it in the guidance  But  obviously  internally we re going to make sure we built a supply chain that can respond  And  obviously  Boeing needs to give us some lead time and they recognize that they will  But we will be there to respond when Boeing gives us a signal Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystRight  Thank you Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jeff OperatorOur next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets  Your line is now open Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystHey  guys  how it s going Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Joel Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystWe ve gotten a lot of good information here  So just a couple of like whatever clarification I guess  Are you guys giving any updates on your debt to EBITDA  Like where do you expect to be by when  Or is that more for the Analyst Day Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerI can talk about that for you Joel  As we finished the quarter considering that we don t have a full 12 months of EBITDA from the acquisitions in there  we re currently at a gross debt to EBITDA as is 4 times  And our net debt is 3 6 times  We expect by the end of the year we ll have the gross debt down to 3 7 and the net debt down to 3 3  Again that s not    that only has a sub period of EBITDA for the acquisitions in there  So it s actually    next year will look    quickly look a little better once we get 12 months of EBITDA Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystAnd is there a target before you d look at acquisitions again  Do you need to be closer to 2  or is it more 2 5 Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJoel  it s Tom  I think as    2 0 is what we d like to get to  But  obviously  as we start to glide closer to that we re    obviously our interest is going to get more keen  The key thing on what we ve learned and it s not a new lesson over the years is you have to continually work that business development pipeline  We are working it now today as we speak  building those relationships  understanding the strategic fits to our company  And so we ll continue to do that  Even though we re not ready to action a thing  we ll continue to work that pipeline  But yes we need to get closer to two before we get back in the game Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And just one last quick one  You    Jamie asked about PLS and you didn t really    you missed that part of the question  I just wondered are there any  kind of  bigger chunks that you guys are seeing that could accelerate the restructuring  Or everything is pretty much as you expected and we just keep the incremental improvement Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJoel help me with PLS Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystProduct line simplification  so looking at individual product lines and having them off or finding a better owner for them Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Good  So yeah  that s going to be a big but we will talk a lot about that at IR day  But the cliff notes is that still a really big part of our strategy going forward  And we ve added to it was simple by design  So it s still looking at what I ll call organization or structural change  a number of divisions and cruise  But that has played through for the most part but we continue to look at that But the other part of that that we ll look at is just within the divisions do we have the right staffing elements  what we call competitive staffing analysis looking at debt versus best in class examples  So that s item one  Item three is I think what you were using    what we would call 80 20  And that s still early days  We have lots of opportunities and that s a big part of how we re trying to simplify things  revenue complexity and the processes and structure that services that And the third element is simple by design  which gets at that approximately 70  of the product cost is tied up in how we design things in the first place  So you can have the most fantastic lean system in Kaizen and doing all these other simplification things I just talked about  but a lot of your cost and your speed within your factories and your speed of service customers is stuck in concrete based on how you design the product So we ll go through that in a lot more detail at IR Day  And we think we re one of the first people thinking differently on how we want to do that and it ll be a combination of process and software things that we ll elaborate in more detail  And that s    obviously  that s a little bit longer term because you ve got to do that as you design new things  There are some things we can do going backwards with existing designs  But that will set us up nicely for margin expansion and really I think speed in the future Joel Tiss    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you very much Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Joel OperatorOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Your line is now open Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  I think Tom you had said that destocking was about a 2 5 point drag on sales in the fiscal second quarter  So I just wondered what your guidance implies for that destock aspect in the second half please Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat one is really hard to predict exactly how destocking goes and doesn t go  To be honest I would not have expected given what we were trending before the quarter does to have it stepped down about 200 bps  We re in round numbers we re about minus 100 destocking in Q1  It s now around minus 300 in Q2  That has to eventually find equilibrium  And I would    based on probably the Q3 being our bottom  our hope is that the destocking when to hit bottom in Q3  And then everything else from our distribution channel would be end market related as we go into Q4 Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat s helpful  Thank you  And then my second question just on the international industrial segment  You gave a lot of good color on the top line pieces moving around there  I just wanted to ask on the margins because it looks as if    in terms of the margin rate your full year guide for margins in international implies a step down sequentially in the second half in the first half or second half versus Q2  even though the revenues just in dollar terms should be going up  So I just wondered if there s something around mix or something with the Asian production impact that you were talking about earlier that dragged down the margin sequentially even with that higher revenue Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  You hit the nail on the head  So percentage wise organic goes down 11 5  to minus 12  for international  But I think in particular  what you re seeing there  is we ve got a little    our assumption is a little weaker decremental  go from a decremental in the low 20s in the first half to kind of the low 30s in the second half for Asia  really influenced by how we looked at what the risks associated and the uncertainties around  in particular  Asia  the Coronavirus and just the unknowns there  Recognizing that as you extend Chinese New Year shutdown  nothing s happening there  And then when you start back up  it s going to be much more inefficient  Our belief on the start up than in previous times coming off of the Chinese New Year  So that s really the difference  Julian Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat s great  Thank you Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Julian OperatorOur next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is now open Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks a lot  First question on Europe  It doesn t seem like that s trending any different than you expected  but are you seeing    we re seeing some improving macro stuff  Are you seeing anything on the ground that would follow that Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Andy  it s Tom  We saw some slight improvement in Europe  If I look at EMEA as a total region  industrial went from minus 13  to minus 11  in Q2  So still soft  but got a little bit better  There was no particular end market that kind of lifted up sand  That was what drove it  just was kind of really a whole breadth of it getting a little bit better  Mobile was basically the same  minus 13   slight improvement minus 12 5   I m rounding to the nearest half  So I would say  fairly consistent with some minor improvement Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Tom  And then  I think  last quarter you called out phase three  phase one    sorry  phase three  phase four being 28  and 48  respectively  It sounds like North American distribution had a little bit of a lag down  Could you kind of help us with how phase three and phase four trended in Q2 and how that may change if you exclude the North American distribution piece Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Andy  so that distribution    as distribution goes  it really influences these four phases  I think what we ve seen now and looking at these phases  things can move kind of jock you back and forth between phase 3 and phase 4  depending on what s going on  And that s what we saw in this last quarter Distribution went from phase 4 in the prior quarter to phase 3  And distribution  being like 37 points of our    excluding aerospace  it influences it quite a bit  So  if I just contrast for you phase 1 that s accelerating growth was plus 3   I m talking about the current quarter  Decelerating growth  phase two  was plus 17     or 17  of our sales Accelerating decline in phase 3 was 72  and that main reason why that moved higher  was because distribution moved into there and automotive moved in there  Automotive was in phase 4  The balance being 8  of our sales was in phase 4 decel and decline  So the big shift predominantly was distribution and automotive moving from four to three Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then  one last one and this isn t an attempt  because irrespective of what just  I ll be at the Investor Day  But should we expect any significant changes in the longer term goals that you previously outlined outside of potentially EBITDA margins  which are    look on track to maybe exceed it  Given a big slug of amortization that you re carrying now  the EBIT margin seems like it might be more of a challenge  But anyway should    your lineup looks great  It looks like you re going to be providing a lot of detail  But at the end of it  should we expect significant changes in the longer term trajectory Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThis is Tom  You re very perceptive  Obviously the amortization headwinds  Cathy gave numbers by segment  If you look at that on a steady state round numbers  it s about 100 bps of headwind that we now have with amortization before    that we didn t have before we set those goals  But I would    the short answer to your question is  no  you should not see any big changes  But  obviously  EBITDA needs to be looked at given what s happened And we will look at that  And we re looking forward to seeing everybody  because I think you re going to see an excited team with an exciting lineup with I think more information than we ve ever shared with you  And we re going to get a chance to talk about The Win Strategy 3 0 and a lot of things that I think are going to be very compelling to people want to be excited about our current shareholders and then hopefully future shareholders to want to own Parker Hannifin Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Andy  Liz  I think we have time for one more question OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies  Your line is now open Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystWell  just slid it in  Thank you Catherine A  Suever    Executive Vice President of Finance   Administration and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystCan I just ask Tom to go back to something you were talking about earlier when I think Joel was asking you about product line simplification  And you talked about 80 20  From a lot of other companies who have instituted this  a big part of the process was having off a fairly chunky size of revenues that might be underperforming or might just not have the potential to perform over time that you might have thought  You ve made lots and lots of acquisitions So I guess I was just trying to get a little more clarity there  Can you picture Parker going through a process of divesting a significant chunk of revenue to  kind of  prepare the ship for higher returns and higher growth going forward  Or is the portfolio where you want it and there might be some tweaking but nothing major Thomas L  Williams    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Steve  it s Tom  So that s a good question  And actually that s probably what Joel was getting at and I didn t completely answer him  I think the short answer is  no  you re not going to see any major chunks come off  You might see some minor tweaks  The big difference between say how we re deploying 80 20 We re deploying it the same way that people that you ve seen to it before like ITW etc  The difference is in our portfolio  Our portfolio is built with a lot of complementary interconnectivity there  And with 60  of our revenue coming from customers that buy from four or more of our technologies  our revenue in the tail is very much linked to other revenue throughout the Company So it requires a little more thoughtful approach  We can t just lop off those tails saying hey that s the end of it because the tail for one division might be an A item for a different division  So we re doing that for a very thoughtful standpoint  We will still get the same kind of speed and margin improvements  We re just    you re not going to see really any kind of revenue changes on that  We don t see it as a headwind to revenue  It will be neutral on the revenue side You might see some minor things that we do on that  but most of it is going to be just helping customers through different ways to deliver it  Different pricing things or different things we can do on alternative part  numbers to satisfy their demand  We want to still take care of our customers and create a great experience for them  We re just going to find more efficient ways to do it Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Good color  I appreciate it  Thanks Catherine A

136759,358274,PH,Investors cast wary eye on U S  industrial stock rebound ,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Many U S  industrial companies  shares that slid last year over concerns of an economic slowdown have regained their footing in recent weeks  but some investors and analysts suspect the stocks still may be standing on uncertain ground  Shares of about 10 large industrial manufacturers and distributors  such as  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   Parker Hannifin Corp  N PH  and  Eaton  Corp Plc  N ETN   have climbed between roughly 5 percent and 15 percent this year  although most have not recouped significant declines they suffered in 2015   In an extreme example  shares of mining equipment maker  Joy Global Inc   N JOY  have jumped about 25 percent in 2016  That may seem impressive  but after last year s plunge of more than 70 percent  Thursday s price of about  15 50 is only about a quarter of the stock s high in 2014  The industrials group broke ahead of the broader market in early February  The Standard   Poor s industrial sector index  SPLRCI  is off about 1 percent for 2016  but that is better than the 3 3 percent decline for the S P 500  SPX    Analysts pointed to various factors that could be supporting industrial shares  improving U S  manufacturing indicators  stabilizing markets for oil and other commodities  and the weakening of the dollar  whose strength has undermined the competitiveness of U S  manufacturers and the value of their foreign sales  But it is not clear whether some struggling industries that are customers of these manufacturers  such as energy and mining  will strengthen or support growth   This was a quick catch up  and I think you have to be really cautious as an investor not to assume that this resurgence is going to continue   said Kim Forrest  senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh   Just before earnings season got into full swing in late January  Robert W  Baird analyst Mig Dobre determined that the eight diversified manufacturers he covers were trading an average of 16 percent below their 200 day moving average  while seven machinery stocks were 27 percent below that mark  The stocks may no longer be so  oversold   Dobre said  so any new investors could be  hoping for real recovery and growth   It s too early to call for a more meaningful turn   he added  Large industrials  including aviation and transportation stocks  have as a group traded at a discount to the S P 500 since late 2014  but the gap has shrunk in recent weeks  The sector is now at 15 2 times forward earnings estimates against 16 1 times for the broader S P  Chicago based North Star Investment Management holds a disproportionate amount of industrial shares  finding them still undervalued  said Chief Investment Officer Eric Kuby   North Star has been adding to some positions recently  including  Graham Corp   N GHM   Shares of the small supplier of heat transfer equipment to the energy industry have risen some 15 percent this year after falling more than 40 percent in 2015

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Parker Hannifin 
For Parker Hannifin  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Parker Hannifin will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Parker Hannifin would post earnings of  3 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 31  delivering a surprise of  7 12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Applied Industrial Technologies has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Parker Hannifin has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that AIT likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PH has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this

136909,358424,PH,This Is Why Parker Hannifin  PH  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Parker Hannifin in Focus
Headquartered in Cleveland  Parker Hannifin  PH  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of  24 33  so far this year  The maker of motion and control products is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 76 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 01   This compares to the Manufacturing   General Industrial industry s yield of 0 56  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 04  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 04 is up 10 9  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Parker Hannifin has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 77   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Parker Hannifin s payout ratio is 28   which means it paid out 28  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PH expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  11 61 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 11 42  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PH is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2018-12-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-parkerhannifin-ph-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200368753,200368753

This maker of motion and control products has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11 90  
For the most recent quarter  Parker Hannifin was expected to post earnings of  2 51 per share  but it reported  2 84 per share instead  representing a surprise of 13 15   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 91 per share  while it actually produced  3 22 per share  a surprise of 10 65  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Parker Hannifin lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Parker Hannifin has an Earnings ESP of  5 05  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

137018,358533,PH,Caterpillar Vs  Deere  Which Is The Better Strong Buy Rated Stock ,opinion,"Industrial production remained unchanged in May after registering its biggest gain in nearly three years in the prior month  Manufacturing output  which accounts for around 75  of total industrial production  decreased 0 4  after advancing in April  This was the second monthly fall in the last three months  Despite the decline in its biggest contributor  industrial output managed to remain flat last month following an increase in mining and utilities production 
In this context  it is wise to focus on two major industrial companies  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE    While both the behemoths have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  You can see    
Other industrial stocks from the Zacks  sector which also carry a Zacks Rank  1 include Atlas Copco AB   OTC ATLKY   and Parker Hannifin Corp    NYSE PH   
Deere Beats on the Bourses
Over the last year  the industrial sector as a whole and the two stocks under consideration  have considerably outpaced S P 500 s performance of 17 2   While the Zacks Industrial Products sector has advanced 20 7  over the last year  Caterpillar has soared 40 8   However  Deere has outperformed both Caterpillarand broader industry  surging 49 4  over the same period 

Valuation
The most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two industrials stocks is EV EBITDA  This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector  It is superior to other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies  Further  EV EBITDA does not include the impact of non cash expenses 
First  we have compared the broader industrial sector with the benchmark S P 500 in terms of EV EBITDA  For the last year  the S P 500 has an EV EBITDA value of 10 89  whereas the Zacks Industrial Products sector s readings stand at 15  This clearly shows that the sector is relatively overvalued 

Coming to the individual EV EBITDA ratios  both Caterpillar and Deere are underpriced  with readings of 12 93 and 13 89  respectively  Clearly  Caterpillar stands out in terms of valuation 
Inventory Turnover Ratio 
Inventory turnover ratio evaluates the efficiency of an industrial company s manufacturing process  A high inventory turnover ratio ensures that the company is able to manage its inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage 

This is one of the most important financial ratios  which is widely used by industrial companies to measure their ability to utilize their inventories  In the last year  the inventory turnover ratio for Caterpillar and Deere has been 3 08  and 4 75   respectively  lower than the sector s level of 5 4   However  Caterpillar has registered better inventory turnover than its competitor 
Return on Assets
Return on assets  ROA  is one of the key financial ratios for industrials as they rely heavily on inventory to create revenues  Although they have a comparatively low level of net profit  an above average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing its assets 

A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question  Coming to Caterpillar and Deere  ROA for the trailing 12 months  TTM  is 3 1  and 3 05   respectively  which are below the industrial sector s level of 5 4   This round easily goes to Caterpillar 
Dividend Yield
In the last one year period  the dividend yield for Caterpillar has been higher than both the broader sector and Deere  While the broader sector offered a yield of 1 81   Caterpillar returned 2 86   In comparison  Deere has a dividend yield of 1 88  

Also  Caterpillar announced that its board of directors have approved a 1 3  increase in quarterly dividend to 78 cents per share after a hiatus of two years  The move reflects the company s balance sheet strength and improved cost structure which has once again enabled it to deliver incremental returns to its shareholders   Read more   
Earnings History  ESP and Estimate Revisions
Caterpillar started 2017 on a positive note  In the first quarter of 2017  Caterpillar delivered year over year improvement in both the top and the bottom line for the first time in 10 quarters  Adjusted earnings came in at  1 28 per share  handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents   Read More   
Deere s second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings surged around 59 6  year over year to  2 49 per share  Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 70 by a wide margin  Moreover  its revenues of  7 260 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 244 billion   Read More   
Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both Caterpillar and Deere delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters  However  Deere stands out with an average positive earnings surprise of 70 4   better than Caterpillar s average beat of 40 3  
When considering   there is little to choose since both Caterpillar and Deere have an ESP of 0  However  Caterpillar s earnings estimate for the current year has increased only by 1 4  over the last one month  significantly lower than Deere s jump of 30 4  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that Caterpillar holds an edge over Deere when considering profitability and valuation ratios  Also  Caterpillar offers a stronger dividend yield than Deere 
However  when considering price performance  inventory turnover  average positive earnings surprise and a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance  Deere is clearly a better stock  Since there is little to choose between the two  both these Zacks Rank  1 stocks would make great additions to your portfolio

The year over year improvement in the bottom line came largely on the back of the revamped Win Strategy  Also  a fall in cost of sales proved conducive to the earnings performance 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales in the fiscal first quarter fell 4 4  year over year to  2 743 1 million and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 767 million  Lackluster performance in the company s Diversified Industrial segment proved to be a major drag

Segmental Performance
At the Diversified Industrial Segment  North American sales for the fiscal first quarter decreased 9 2  to  1 167 0 million  Also  this segment recorded a 4  decline in orders on a year over year basis

Liquidity

Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy  Parker Hannifin is bullish about delivering its fundamental financial goals  The company has made impressive progress in key areas including safety performance  customer experience  and profitable growth and believes that these initiatives will unlock further growth opportunities PARKER HANNIFIN Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   To Conclude

137128,358643,PH,AECOM s  ACM  Q4 Earnings   Revenues Miss  Decline Y Y ,opinion,AECOM   NYSE ACM   failed to maintain its earnings streak  posting fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share of 65 cents  which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 12 2   Also  the bottom line plummeted 31 6  from the year ago tally of 95 cents The dismal top line performance  largely attributable to macroeconomic sluggishness  affected the company s earnings performance For fiscal 2016  the company s adjusted earnings fell 2 6  to  3 00 from the prior year tally  Lower than anticipated earnings contributions from power and industrial construction wins in the second half of the year weighed on the earnings Revenue PerformanceFor the fiscal fourth quarter  revenues declined 8 5  year over year to  4 323 1 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 680 million  The top line took a beating on account of lower client spending in the Americas Design business and low energy prices  which continue to strain oil and gas clients For fiscal 2016  the company s top line declined 3 2  to  17 410 8 million from the year ago tally of  17 989 9 million Segment wise  Design   Consulting Services revenues fell 6 6  year over year to  1 907 0 million  On a constant currency basis  organic revenues declined 3 7  due to sluggish performance in the Americas Construction Services revenues were down 13 2  to  1 559 6 million on a year over year basis  Stellar performance in the building construction business line was largely thwarted by the massive decline in oil and gas business On the other hand  Management Services revenues registered a year over year  decline of 3 2  to  856 6 million However  AECOM s adjusted operating income in the fiscal fourth quarter was  186 8 million  down from the year ago tally of  283 4 million  New order wins in the quarter totaled  6 3 billion  Notable wins during the quarter include multiple awards in the Americas Design market  the contract to build NFL Rams stadium in Los Angeles and over  700 million of O M wins with the core oil and gas clients  Also  AECOM s total book to burn ratio during the quarter stood at 1 40 At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter  AECOM s total backlog was  42 8 billion  up 4   thereby signaling bright prospects Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Sep 30  2016  AECOM s cash and cash equivalents totaled  692 1 million compared with  683 9 million as of Sep 30  2015  Total debt was  4 125 3 million compared with  4 606 9 million on Sep 30  2015 In the fiscal fourth quarter  AECOM generated

and 2017 AECOM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    2017 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  AECOM provided its fiscal 2017 guidance  The company expects earnings per share to be in the range of  2 70  3 10  This figure includes roughly 20 cents of anticipated gains related to AECOM Capital realizations  For fiscal 2017  AECOM anticipates effective tax rate of 20  on adjusted earnings In terms of spending  the company projects to incur  30 million in relation to acquisition and integration  capital expenditure of  115 million and depreciation expense of  165 million To ConcludeAfter three back to back quarters of impressive earnings beat  AECOM ended fiscal 2016 on a rather dull note  with both the top and the bottom line falling below expectations  Cautious client spending in energy markets and choppy recovery of its Design and Consulting business were major culprits  offsetting the company s growth  Despite the overall economic slowdown  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock remains bullish about its 2017 prospects  expecting modest growth The company s diversified portfolio  streamlining of non strategic businesses to focus on core areas and solid backlog levels add to its strength  The robust backlog level of  42 8 billion  which is a key indicator of future revenue growth  indicates significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters  Apart from the Design and Consulting Services segment  which has been the strongest growth drivers  the company anticipates bright prospects for its Management and Construction Services businesses as well  thus boosting its optimism  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry include Parker Hannifin Corporation   NYSE PH    Applied Industrial Technologies Inc    NYSE AIT   and AO Smith Corp

UnitedHealth shares have gained more than 29  year to date  outperforming the medical health maintenance organization industry by a wide margin  UnitedHealth issued optimistic guidance for 2017  backed by stable medical costs  higher contribution from Optum and decline in exposure from its public exchange business  The analyst stresses that the company is consistently gaining from the Medicaid and Medicare businesses  Continued growth at Optum is also leading to a diversified revenue source  The segment should see further growth from the Catamaran acquisition  Also  UnitedHealth should benefit from its capital strength  niche market position and a track record of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividend hikes and share buybacks  But industry fees and taxes  losses on public exchange business and overall uncertainty about the fate of ObamaCare are some of the headwinds   You can  
21st Century Fox shares have lagged the consumer discretionary sector and the broader market in the year to date period  but they have performed better than the movie TV production distribution industry  Twenty First Century Fox posted its second straight positive earnings surprise  when it reported first quarter fiscal 2017 results  The analyst likes its strong cable network programming  which has been its driving force  backed by rising affiliate fees  However  increase in programming costs and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate continues to act as a headwind for Twenty First Century Fox  Further  it expects costs at its cable network to go up in fiscal 2017  Increase in expenses may dent the company s margins and in turn the bottom line   You can

Process Equipment Group  Segment revenues declined 2  to  236 million due to weak end markets and lower demand for equipment  Revenues were flat year over year on a constant currency basis  Nevertheless  overall order volume was in line with the first quarter and increased 16  organically over the prior year 
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 14 8  in the quarter driven by the addition of Abel and Red Valve  improvements to the mix of parts and equipment sales  as well as ongoing process improvements 
Batesville  Segment revenues declined 8  to  151 million due to a decline in volumes in the North American burial market as a result of a lower mortality rate associated with a subdued flu season  We also note that Batesville continues to face the pressure of a secular decline in the burial market as a number of families are opting for cremation nowadays 
Batesville adjusted EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points to 28 4  owing to supply chain productivity initiatives  lower commodities prices  and ongoing efforts to aggressively manage costs 
Other Financial Update
During the second quarter  the company paid down  45 million of debt apart from the  133 million of new debt related to the Red Valve acquisition  completed in February  
The company also paid about  13 million in dividends to its shareholders and repurchased 39 000 shares for approximately  1 million 
Lower Guidance
The company continues to expect challenging end markets for the Process Equipment Group and Batesville in fiscal 2016  Though the company will continue to take proactive measures to boost its profitability  it still expects continued market headwinds 
As a result  for fiscal 2016  Hillenbrand expects to report weaker earnings and revenues  It now expects earnings to be at the lower end of the previously guided range of  2 05 to  2 15 per share  Organic constant currency revenue is also expected to be at the lower end of the previously guided range of down 2  to flat  Total constant currency revenue growth is also expected at the lower end of a 2  to 4  range

137263,358778,PH,Parker Hannifin Corp  Semi Cyclical Stock  Currently At A Discount ,opinion,With this article  we are going to look at Parker Hannifin Corp  PH   the world s leading diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems  through the lens of FAST Graphs    fundamentals analyzer software tool  Parker Hannifin is a semi cyclical company that is trading at a significant discount to its historically normal valuation  Parker Hannifin has increased their dividend for 56 years straight  and currently offers a 2 1  current yield and growing Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Earnings   Price Correlated Fundamentals at a GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Parker Hannifin Corp shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 9 2  and a current PE of 10 2  Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 5   and when you look at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears undervalued   it s outside of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth  Parker Hannifin Corp  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 1999Performance Table Parker Hannifin CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9 7  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Parker Hannifin Corp  assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  471 42 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 9 7  to 10 6  per annum versus 2 5   red circle  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical PE ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1999 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Parker Hannifin Corp is  89 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 14 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Parker Hannifin Corp s long term earnings growth at 5   orange circle   Parker Hannifin Corp has low long term debt at 24  of capital  red circle   Parker Hannifin Corp is currently trading at a P E of 10 2  which is below the value

circle on EYE Chart   which would be a 13 7  annual rate of return from the current price  yellow highlighting  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Parker Hannifin Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Parker Hannifin Corp s expected earnings would be 7  purple circle  times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary
