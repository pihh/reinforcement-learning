167531,389047,EOG,Even this oil spike can t lift the worst performing sector of the last decade,news,Shares of some oil producers and explorers rallied after crude s gain  But overall the sector still fell on the day Investors have exited oil names so unreservedly over the years that energy now holds a weight of only 4  in the S P 500  compared with more than 13  in 1990  according to Bespoke Investment Group The sector was also the worst performer of the last decade  up just 5  versus the S P 500 s 180  climb  People are going to maybe take a slightly more positive  constructive view on energy  which is good   said Alec Young of FTSE Russell ,2020-01-03,CNBC,https://invst.ly/pd7tr,2052075
167533,389049,EOG,Merrill Lynch Remains Hopeful on Big Oil   Gas Valuations  But Downgrades Chevron and Others,news,"When investors see gains of close to 23  on the Dow Jones industrials and over 28  on the S P 500  they generally assume that all or most sectors in the market performed well  It is far from a secret that it has been hard to be a steady investor in oil and gas stocks of late  and 2019 offered no reprieve from that pressure  Many investors are shunning oil and gas entirely and generally will not invest in the sector no matter how low the valuations get  Merrill Lynch had been trying to remain firm in the energy sector  but it just lowered its energy sector exposure from its model income portfolio at the start of 2020 What is interesting here is that Merrill Lynch has talked about how cheap the energy sector has become on an absolute and a relative basis  The firm noted that its strategists and investors alike believe that energy is cheap  The report also cites a lack of confidence on multiple levels that will continue to make energy be a  show me  story in 2020  One serious issue is the ongoing investor screens in the environmental  social and governance  ESG  theme that have grown and grown  The report even raises questions about whether energy can compete against the broader market Chevron Corp   NYSE  CVX  was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral and was removed from the model Income Portfolio at Merrill Lynch after Doug Leggate and his team made the calls  Chevron s price objective of  125 remained unchanged and compares to the  120 60 prior close  Refinitiv s consensus analyst target price was  136 08  Chevron s CEO recently told CNBC that he was not expecting to see sustained higher oil prices due to tensions between Iran and the United States flaring up div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  That model portfolio is required to sell its position when the firm issues an Underperform rating to keep its practices unified  Leggate s report noted that the firm has decreased its sector weighting in energy \to 9 5  from a prior 10 5   as the firm has exited its 1  position in Chevron  In the model portfolio  the firm is allocating the proceeds to cash  but it noted that it expects  to reinvest within seven business days in a manner consistent with the portfolio s income objective  Occidental Petroleum Corp   NYSE  OXY  is Merrill Lynch s top overall pick with compelling value  and the firm also pointed out that it has a sector leading yield  7 3   and that it has catalysts to close the gap just by executing on its integration plan  The firm s  80 price objective compares with a  45 00 recent share price  and the consensus price target is just  49 32 Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE  XOM  is still the top  major  pick at Merrill Lynch  and the firm still has a  100 price objective inside this big sector call  Exxon traded at  70 97 ahead of the call  and the consensus target price is barely  79 00  Exxon s dividend yield is now just under 5   at 4 97    Several other firms recently have used some loose guidance data from the company to handily lower earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2019 Merrill Lynch downgraded both Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE  MRO  and Phillips 66  NYSE  PSX  to Neutral from Buy There were still some quite positive views on valuations and on other drivers for investors to consider  As the recent sector valuation report was over 100 pages and covered 20 or more companies this week  we have focused on the ones where changes were more evident Apache Corp   NYSE  APA  was shown as Neutral in the big sector call for 2020  but Tuesday s analyst notes at Merrill Lynch showed that Apache has been raised to Buy  Its prior price objective was  28  but that was raised to  36 in the new call  Apache was trading up a whopping 20  at  30 75 after announcing a significant oil find along with Total in offshore Suriname Atmos Energy Corp   NYSE  ATO  was raised to Buy from Neutral with a  120 price objective  after having just been reinstated as Neutral on December 4  The firm s prior view was that Atmos still had a sustainable runway but its top tier growth was priced in at the level of that time   105 47   compared with  110 50 at the current time EOG Resources Inc   NYSE  EOG  was raised to Buy from Neutral  Shares closed up 4  at  88 44 and had a consensus target price of  101 51  PBF Energy Inc   NYSE  PBF  also was upgraded to Buy from Neutral The report was also more constructive for the smaller exploration and production for 2020  The firm noted that its  outspend and balance sheet profiles have improved  while the price of WTI oil appears to be more firm  Leggate s focus is on three companies with improving and sustaining free cash flow outlooks and with upcoming catalysts Diamondback Energy Inc   NASDAQ  FANG  was noted as having an oil guidance that appeared to be beatable and with upside to cash flow in 2020 WPX Energy Inc   NYSE  WPX  was viewed strongly as the deal accretion for Felix is underappreciated  and the firm is handily above consensus on its price objective Parsley Energy Inc   NYSE  PE  was viewed positively for its post Jagged Peak merger possibilities that will grow the company As far as the value versus the rising risks in energy  Merrill Lynch s report says that the value is being overlooked and that things might be too negative for the energy sector as an investment  Leggate s report said We believe the pendulum has swung too far  conflating weak sentiment with the reality of some E P business models deservedly de rated as confirmation of a secular decline  the DCF of zero is zero and is a justifiable outcome if perpetual promises of FCF never materialize  In recent days  the geopolitical backdrop has changed  and to ignore ramifications for oil risks exacerbating stock specific value already overlooked  Our stock specific approach is unchanged  but when taken together  2020 lines up to be a recovery year within the framework laid by our strategists where value outperforms momentum

167550,389066,EOG,Norway Wealth Fund Gets Nod to Sell  6 Billion in Oil Stocks,news," Bloomberg     Norway s massive wealth fund got the go ahead to sell oil and gas stocks worth  5 9 billion  ending a two year process that has reduced an initial proposal to dump all its petroleum investments to a more moderate divestment 
The  1 trillion fund shocked markets in 2017 when it asked the government for permission to sell about  40 billion in such stocks  arguing a cut in exposure would reduce the overall risk for Norway  western Europe s biggest petroleum producer  That plan was then heavily diluted in a political compromise that shielded the world s biggest oil companies 
The final plan from the Finance Ministry released late Tuesday evening in Oslo outlines a divestment that will be even smaller than the government had foreseen in March  when it estimated disposals would total about 70 billion kroner   7 6 billion  
As expected  the divestment will now include companies classified as  Oil  Crude Producers  by index provider FTSE Russell  The number of companies held by the fund in that category was 95 in mid September  making up 0 8  of the fund s benchmark for equities  The divestment will  be made gradually over time   the government said 
According to a list provided by FTSE Russell in July  the fund s biggest holdings in that category at the end of 2018 were ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG    Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   and CNOOC Ltd  The Finance Ministry didn t provide an updated list of companies in Tuesday s statement 
By using the index classification  the fund s investments will continuously be blocked from  upstream oil and gas companies  including corporate events  new listings and new information on or changes in companies  activities over time   the government said 
The plan marks a compromise for the Conservative led government  which is heavily dependent on oil income and faces an increasingly powerful environmental movement  The government decided to shield the biggest oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  arguing they will likely be big investors in renewable energy in the years ahead 
Regardless of its scope  the divestment has been widely debated in Norway and left a mark globally  While the fund and the government have insisted the move has nothing to do with the climate crisis and is purely about an oil producing nation s risk exposure  it has been widely celebrated by activists and politicians as a powerful signal that fossil fuels are losing favor among investors 
In a show of how divided even Norway s government is on how to interpret the divestment  Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen called it  the most important climate decision  the coalition has agreed on  in direct contradiction of the official line ",2019-10-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/norway-wealth-fund-gets-nod-to-sell-6-billion-in-oil-stocks-1990581,1990581

167552,389068,EOG,Occidental Petroleum stepping up oil and gas asset sales  marketing document,news,"By Arathy S Nair and Jennifer Hiller
BANGALORE HOUSTON  Reuters    Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  is stepping up its oil and gas producing property sales  adding land in Utah s Uinta Basin acquired as part of its  38 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   according to a marketing document seen by Reuters 
Occidental aims to reduce the  40 billion of debt from the Anadarko purchase and has raised about  10 billion so far through sales of properties  including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa  It has targeted  15 billion in proceeds by mid 2020 
Its latest offer covers about 190 000 net acres in Uinta Basin s Greater Natural Buttes gas field that could bring between  190 million to  240 million based on prior gas deals in the Rockies  according to a source familiar with the matter 
Occidental declined to comment on the potential sale 
The property has forecast net production of 215 million cubic feet equivalent per day and projected 12 month cash flow of  48 million  according to the document  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and  QEP Resources   NYSE QEP  operate on property nearby 
Anadarko had not completed a new well on the acreage since 2016  according to the marketing document  It reduced activity in the field to focus on more lucrative areas 
CIBC Griffis   Small is the financial and technical adviser 
Occidental last month began soliciting bids for oil and gas properties in Wyoming and Colorado that it hopes will fetch up to  700 million  It separately offered its own Midland  Texas  campus for sale and will move employees there to Anadarko s offices  Reuters reported on Monday 
Plans to sell Occidental s stake in its Western Midstream Partners  N WES  pipeline unit recently were shelved after failing to attract an attractive offer  It also needs the cash the unit generates  analysts have said 
Shares of Occidental closed at  38 12 Wednesday and are down more than 40  since its interest in Anadarko became public ",2019-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/occidental-petroleum-stepping-up-oil-and-gas-asset-sales-marketing-document-2020267,2020267

167587,389103,EOG,Exclusive  Marathon Oil looks to exit North Sea  joining other U S  rivals,news,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON  Reuters     Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO  has launched the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas fields  a document seen by Reuters showed  the latest U S  firm to retreat from the basin to focus on onshore shale production at home 
The sale includes stakes in the BP operated Foinaven fields in the west of Shetland area as well as interests in the Brae complex northeast of Aberdeen  according to a sales document seen by Reuters 
The process  launched this week  is being run by Jefferies and bids are due by December  The assets could fetch up to  200 million  according to two banking sources 
Marathon Oil joins several companies including  Chevron   NYSE CVX   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  that have sought to pull out of the North Sea in recent years as they focus operations on rapidly expanding shale production 
Marathon Oil spokeswoman Lee Warren declined to comment directly on the sale but said  portfolio management is an ongoing and integral element of our successful business model as we continue to simplify and concentrate our portfolio to our highest return opportunities with a focus on our differentiated position in the U S  resource plays   
The company  which produced around 419 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter  will invest over 90 percent of its 2018 capital in U S  shale production  according to its website 
The North Sea  one of the oldest offshore basins that started production in the 1970s  has undergone a broad change of guard in recent years as veteran producers have been replaced by smaller  often privately owned companies  which say they can squeeze more oil and gas out of the fields 
According to the sales document  Marathon s North Sea assets have a total production of 15 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  a resource of 31 million barrels and are expected to produce  85 million of cash flow in 2019 
Marathon holds a 40 percent stake in the Brae Area complex  one of the oldest in the basin  as well as stakes in pipelines  One of the complex s platforms  Brae Bravo  is being dismantled after production ceased in recent years in what is known as decommissioning 
The Foinaven area comprises of two producing fields  Foinaven and Foinaven East  in which Marathon holds 28 percent and 47 percent interests respectively  the document said

167629,389145,EOG,As Oil Rises  Shale Drillers With Few or No Hedges Stand to Gain,news," Bloomberg     As the price of oil rises  heavily hedged shale drillers may find it harder to meet investor demands for payback  boosting the value of producers that haven t locked in returns for future production 
When West Texas Intermediate breached  60 a barrel  it was good news generally for U S  shale producers  But the higher the price  the less gain will come to companies that hedged their production as crude held below  55 for 10 months of the year 
At least 60 percent of next year s crude output has been hedged  more than in previous years  according to RBC Capital Markets LLC  The result  Rising crude prices will boost the profile of companies with fewer hedges  according to a report by Cowen   Co  Among the winners  EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG    Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC     and Continental Resources Inc   the note said 
 If crude were to move higher  we would expect to see more E Ps lag as collar ceilings are reached   Cowen analysts led by Charles Robertson wrote 
U S  shale producers often choose to hedge a portion of their production due to their capital constraints and short life cycles of their wells  With WTI up 34 percent in the last six months  many have increased their hedging to protect their cash flows against a downturn  Hedged volumes more than doubled in the third quarter  according to a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance 
 It s a directional bet on the future of the market   said Peter Pulikkan  a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who co authored the report released on Dec  13   Some of them believe  based on the fundamentals  that oil is still going to go higher  
Representatives for EOG and Anadarko declined to comment  Kristin Thomas  a spokeswoman for Continental  did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment  But executives at the companies have taken a bullish tone in recent months 
 We think U S  production hasn t been growing quite as prolifically as what others have originally estimated   Lance Terveen  a senior vice president at Houston based EOG  told analysts on an earnings call last month when asked about hedging   We ve been disciplined since 2015  and we ve been waiting for this turn  So we re going to continue to watch here going into 2018  
More to Run
Continental sees  a little bit more to run here for sure   Harold Hamm  the explorer s billionaire chief executive officer  said on a Nov  8 call   We ll keep a close eye on it and the opportunity  when it comes  well  we re going to be there to take advantage of it

167729,389245,EOG,Trump taps well of protest with calls for more drilling in national parks,news,"By Annie Knox and Kim Palmer  Reuters    President elect Donald Trump aims to open up federal lands to more energy development  tapping into a long running and contentious debate over how best to manage America s remaining wilderness  The U S  government holds title to about 500 million acres of land across the country  including national parks and forests  wildlife refuges and tribal territories stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico  They overlay billions of barrels of oil and vast quantities of natural gas  coal  and uranium  With Trump poised to take office on Jan  20  energy companies and their lobbyists are eyeing a new gusher of federal drilling and mining leases after a period of stagnation under the administration of Barack Obama   Oil output on federal land made up about a fifth of the national total in 2015   down from more than a third in 2010   while the number of onshore drilling leases fell about 15 percent  according to federal data   This opportunity is unique  maybe once in a lifetime   said Jack Gerard  president of the Washington D C  based American Petroleum Institute lobby group  referring to prospects for increased access to federal leases  The hoped for land run by energy companies  however  could get bogged down by lawsuits and lobbying from environmental groups and some local residents   It would only take one serious mistake   one well to go bad   for our town s water supply to be damaged   said Josh Ewing  the leader of a southern Utah conservation group  Energy firms have their allies in the rural areas  too  who would welcome an economic jolt   We can t maintain our families here because there are no jobs   said Bob Turri  a former officer with the U S  Bureau of Land Management in southern Utah  surrounded by millions of acres of pristine federally managed forest   That s the only hope we have left  is what Trump may be able to do for us   Trump had campaigned on a promise to open up federal lands to increased development  He accused Obama of  denying millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet  by restricting leasing and banning new coal extraction  In December  Trump nominated U S  Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana  who backs coal mining on federal lands  to lead the Interior Department  Officials for Zinke and Trump declined to comment  Trump has vowed to lift the coal moratorium   imposed in 2016 as part of Obama s broader plan to combat climate change   within 100 days of taking office  Separately  a coalition appointed by Trump s team to guide his Native American policy is researching proposals to ease energy development on tribal lands   including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership   nL5N1DZ0OY  While efforts to boost industry access to public lands would likely trigger lawsuits and protests  it could win broad support in a Congress now firmly in Republican control after November s election  Luke Popovich  a spokesman for the National Mining Association  said he expected some of Trump s planned moves to be easy  including reversing Obama s coal ban    Happily  just as it was created with the stroke of a pen  it can be as easily rescinded   he said   That is our hope and expectation   Other efforts to undo Obama s legacy could be harder   AT YOUR PERIL  In his final weeks in office  Obama designated about 1 6 million acres in Utah and Nevada as national monuments  using the 1906 Antiquities Act that lawyers say could be complicated to reverse  The move was a parting gift to Native American groups and conservationists  nL1N1EN182  Obama also banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s era law that environmental groups say would also require a drawn out court challenge to reverse  nL1N1EF1K7  Republican lawmakers have promised to fight the moves  For some  the potential for expanded drilling signals economic revival  Others see more value in the land itself than the resources beneath it  One of the areas that Obama granted monument status last month is Bears Ears  a pair of iconic flat top hills soaring out of ponderosa pine forests in Utah  Jonah Yellowman  a Navajo spiritual advisor for Utah Din  Bik yah  a group representing five tribes  surveyed the landscape recently as he piloted his SUV down a dirt road    What would happen if we lose this   he asked   Where are we going to go   The area  he said  is central to the Navajo creation story and a symbol of his ancestors  ability to listen to and heed spiritual guidance  It is also rich in minerals and petroleum  and Yellowman said tribes are bracing for Trump to try to reopen the land to development   If that happens  we re here to stand against it   he said  EOG Resources  N EOG    a Texas based company recently approved to drill near Bears Ears   declined to comment  Native American protesters and their supporters recently won a major battle against encroaching energy interests in North Dakota  blocking a federal permit for a pipeline after months of protests   nL1N1EA1WI  Other tribes  however  have pursued energy development as a critical source of income   Nearly 2 000 miles east of Bears Ears  in Ohio s Cuyahoga Valley National Park  a similar debate is playing out  The 330 000 acre federal park is one of a handful that already allows drilling because it contains areas with privately owned mineral rights  or  split estates   Many of the park s visitors are unaware of the industry s presence  Gregory Violand  a 65 year old actor who performs at a playhouse on park grounds   two miles from a gas well surrounded by chain link fencing   said he supports drilling on federal lands  if done responsibly   The property owners are benefiting   he said  Deb Yandala disagreed  As CEO of the CVNP Conservancy advocacy group  she said many people would oppose efforts to expand drilling and mining rights   Water quality is a huge issue for Cuyahoga Valley   she said

victims of his decision to keep oil pumps flowing despite a global glut  U S  shale oil producers struggling to survive the worst price crash in years  While soaring U S  shale output brought on by the hydraulic fracturing revolution contributed to oversupply  many blame the 70 percent price collapse in the past 20 months primarily on Naimi  seen as the oil market s most influential policymaker  During his keynote on Tuesday at the annual IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston  Naimi will be addressing U S  wildcatters and executives who are stuck in a zero sum game    OPEC  instead of cutting production  they increased production  and that s the predicament we re in right now   Bill Thomas  chief executive of EOG Resources Inc  N EOG   one of the largest U S  shale oil producers  told an industry conference last week  referring to 2015   It will be Naimi s first public appearance in the United States since Saudi Arabia led the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  shock decision in November 2014 to keep heavily pumping oil even though mounting oversupply was already sending prices into free fall   Naimi has said this was not an attempt to target any specific countries or companies  merely an effort to protect the kingdom s market share against fast growing  higher cost producers   It just so happens that U S  shale was the biggest new oil frontier in the world  with much higher costs than cheap Saudi crude that can be produced for a few dollars a barrel   I d just like to hear it from him   said Alex Mills  president of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers   I think it should be something of concern to our leaders in Texas and in Washington   if in fact his aim is to push aside U S  shale producers  Mills said   Last week s surprise agreement by Saudi Arabia  Qatar  Russia and Venezuela to freeze oil output at January levels   near record highs   did not offer much solace and the global benchmark Brent crude  LCOc1  ended the week lower at  33 a barrel and U S  crude futures  CLc1  ended unchanged at just below  30    Prices fell sharply on Tuesday after Iran  the main hurdle to any production control in its zeal to recapture market share lost to sanctions  welcomed the plan without commitment  Iraq was also non committal  Many U S  industry executives understand that all is fair in love  war and the oil market  but  the Saudis have probably overplayed their hand   said Bruce Vincent  former president of Houston based shale oil producer Swift Energy   which filed for bankruptcy late last year  A PAINFUL TIME The fact that OPEC members are talking to each other offers a ray of hope  according to some industry figures  an indication that the kingdom s own fiscal pain could prompt it to change tact and lead efforts to reach a deal  On Tuesday  Standard   Poor s downgraded Saudi Arabia s credit rating   The pain is at a threshold right now  People are now willing to sit down and talk about possible remedies to that pain   Mills said  Texas  where oil production has more than doubled over the past five years thanks to the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin fields  is feeling acute pain   The state lost nearly 60 000 oil and gas jobs between November 2014 and November 2015  according to the Texas Alliance s most recent data  Only 236 rigs are still actively drilling wells in the state  down from more than 900 in late 2014  Baker Hughes data showed  Financial distress among U S  producers has deepened  More than 40 U S  energy companies have declared bankruptcy since the start of 2015  with more looming as lenders are set to cut the value of companies  reserves  often used as collateral for credit   Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC  and rival ConocoPhillips  N COP  both cut their dividends this month  unusual moves that showed financial stress  THE TIGER HAS TEETH The last time Naimi spoke at CERAWeek  seven years ago  OPEC was slashing output to lift prices that sank to  40 a barrel amid the global financial crisis  and he railed against speculators who he blamed for the price plunge  Few oil executives anticipated Naimi s willingness to let prices collapse this time around  Some of them  such as Harold Hamm  the chief executive of Oklahoma based Continental Resources  N CLR   even called his bluff  Shortly before the November 2014 OPEC meeting  Hamm cashed in Continental s hedges  calling OPEC a  toothless tiger   In an investor call in August  Hamm said he expected OPEC to begin cuts in September  adding   we think that may be the first of many   Those have yet to come  A Continental spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Hamm would attend Naimi s speech   Continental shares have tumbled more than 60 percent during the downturn  cutting Hamm s personal fortune by more than  10 billion since 2014  While producers may be more cautious now than before  some are still betting that OPEC will bail them out  EOG s Thomas reckons prices will shoot up as high as  80 a barrel in the second of the year   in part  he says  because OPEC will eventually be forced to yield in the face of fiscal strains

year ago major shale firms were saying they needed oil above  60 a barrel to produce more  now some say they will settle for far less in deciding whether to crank up output after the worst oil price crash in a generation  Their latest comments highlight the industry s remarkable resilience  but also serve as a warning to rivals and traders  a retreat in U S  oil production that would help ease global oversupply and let prices recover may prove shorter than some may have expected   Continental Resources Inc   N CLR   led by billionaire wildcatter Harold Hamm  is prepared to increase capital spending if U S  crude  CLc1  reaches the low  to mid  40s range  allowing it to boost 2017 production by more than 10 percent  chief financial official John Hart said last week  Rival  Whiting Petroleum Corp   N WLL   the biggest producer in North Dakota s Bakken formation  will stop fracking new wells by the end of March  but would  consider completing some of these wells  if oil reached  40 to  45 a barrel  Chairman and CEO Jim Volker told analysts  Less than a year ago  when the company was still in spending mode  Volker said it might deploy more rigs if U S  crude hit  70  While the comments were couched with caution  they serve as a reminder of how a dramatic decline in costs and rapid efficiency gains have turned U S  shale  initially seen by rivals as a marginal  high cost sector  into a major player   and a thorn in the side of big OPEC producers  Nimble shale drillers are now helping mitigate the nearly 70 percent slide crude price rout by cutting back output  but may also limit any rally by quickly turning up the spigots once prices start recovering from current levels just above  30   The threat of a shale rebound is  putting a cap on oil prices   said John Kilduff  partner at Again Capital LLC   If there s some bullish outlook for demand or the economy  they will try to get ahead of the curve and increase production even sooner   Some producers have already began hedging future production  with prices for 2017 oil trading at near  45 a barrel  which could put a floor under any future production cuts  GLOBAL AMBITIONS While the worst oil downturn since the 1980s sounds the death knell for scores of debt laden shale producers  it has also hastened the decline in costs of hydraulic fracturing and improvements of the still developing technology  For example   Hess Corp    N HES   which pumps one of every 15 barrels of North Dakota crude  cut the cost of a new Bakken oil well by 28 percent last year   What once helped fatten margins is now key to survival in what Saudi Oil Minister Ali al Naimi described last week as the  harsh  reality of a global market in which the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is no longer willing to curb its supplies to bolster prices  While Deloitte auditing and consulting warns that a third of U S  oil producers may face bankruptcy  leading shale producers say their ambitions go beyond just outrunning domestic rivals   It s no longer enough to be the low cost producer in U S  horizontal shale   Bill Thomas  chairman of EOG Resources Inc  N EOG   said on Friday   EOG s goal is to be competitive  low cost oil producer in the global market       Thomas did not say what price would spur EOG to boost output this year  but said it had a  premium inventory  of 3 200 well locations that can yield returns of 30 percent or more with oil at  40    Apache Corp   N APA    forecasts its output will drop by as much as 11 percent this year  but said it would probably manage to match 2015 North American production if oil averaged  45 this year  One reason shale producers can be so fleet footed is the record backlog of wells that have already been drilled but wait to get fractured to keep oil trapped in shale rocks flowing  There were 945 such wells in North Dakota  birthplace of the U S  shale boom in December  compared to 585 in mid 2014  when prices peaked  according to the latest available data from the Department of Mineral Resources  Their numbers are growing as firms like Whiting keep drilling  but hold off with fracking  Some warn that fracking the uncompleted wells can offer only a short term supply boost and a sustained increase would require costly drilling of new wells and therefore higher prices   It s going to take a move up to  55 before we see anyone plan new production   says Carl Larry  director of business development for oil and gas at Frost   Sullivan  To be sure  it is far from certain whether oil prices will even reach  40 any time soon   Morgan Stanley   N MS  and ANZ expect average prices in the low  30s for the full year  Some analysts also warn resuming drilling quickly may prove hard after firms laid off thousands of workers and idled more than three quarters of their rigs since late 2014  In fact  John Hess  chief executive of Hess Corp last week took issue with labeling U S  shale oil as a  swing producer   Hess told Reuters in an interview that U S  shale firms should be rather considered as  short cycle  producers  which might need up to a year to stop or restart production   L2N1620W4  And even scarred veterans of past boom bust oil cycles are not sure what will happen once prices start to recover   during the last big upswing a decade ago  shale oil did not even exist   We are a little concerned that this time there is one dynamic we ve never had previously   said Darrell Hollek  vice president of U S  onshore at Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC

167773,389289,EOG,U S  oil well shut ins start as crude rout batters small producers,news,"By Terry Wade and Anna Driver HOUSTON  Reuters    Collapsing crude prices are confronting scores of smaller U S  oil producers with the grim choice of either shutting older high cost wells or burning through cash in the hope of riding out the downturn  As oil prices fell by more than half over the last six months from more than  100 per barrel  the U S  oil industry responded by slowing its blistering growth and dialing back expansion plans  Now  with U S  crude around  46 a barrel  operators are already closing some small old wells  known as strippers  and tens of thousands of similar wells are on the verge of losing money  A further slide could  by some estimates  idle an equivalent of up to 2 percent of U S  supply  slowing overall output growth more than expected or even leaving it flat  Ray Lasseigne  an oilfield veteran and president of TMR Exploration Inc in Louisiana  is deciding which wells to close  TMR looks to close old wells  which produce so much saltwater that disposal costs exceed what the oil can fetch today  Other running costs include repairs and electricity to run the pump jacks  also known as nodding donkeys because they bob up and down while pulling oil out of the ground   We ve identified about 20 of our wells that are not economic at these prices   said Lasseigne  That figure represents about 10 percent of the Bossier City  Louisiana company s wells  he said  His most expensive stripper wells need oil around  70 to be profitable   NERVES AND FEAR Leslie Tipping  a longtime member of the oil industry profession known as  landmen  who broker mineral rights  said some marginal wells have already been closed   There have been some wells that have been shut in already   she said   Tipping  who manages oil and gas interests for patrons of the bank Northern Trust in Texas  said she was fielding more calls from clients who are nervously watching sliding crude prices   Most of our clients have inherited these assets  so they ve been through this before   said Tipping   But there s concern  There s some fear    She expects well closures at higher cost fields across much of North America  including older parts of North Dakota s Bakken  and areas where the geology is difficult  such as the Anadarko Basin in Kansas and Oklahoma  There are about 400 000 stripper wells in the United States  most with operating costs of between  20 and  50 per barrel  according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie  a leading energy and commodities consultancy  The cheapest ones are in locations where there is little underground saltwater  Strippers often produce just a few barrels a day  but together they account for up to 1 million barrels per day  a ninth of U S  output  Not all stripper wells are losing money now and those that do may not be shut in  This is in part because producers can lose their leases forever if they shut wells for more than a few months  so owners are often willing to pump at a loss and store oil until prices rise   At  40  we think you have got about 100 000 to 200 000 barrels per day at risk  from U S  stripper wells  said RT Dukes of Wood Mackenzie  That could represent a dent of up to 2 percent dent in output compared with U S  Energy Information Agency forecasts that this year s U S  production will average 9 3 million bpd  After production hit 9 1 million bpd in late 2014  the agency now expects production to climb to 9 42 million bpd around the middle of this year  then ebb to 9 26 million bpd at year s end  Its latest Jan  13 outlook forecasts the 2015 average price of the Brent crude global benchmark at  58 a barrel and the U S  benchmark at  3 4 below that  Some warn the slowdown could be more pronounced given the sharp drop in the number of rigs drilling new wells  The prevailing industry view  however  is that new  more productive  shale oil wells in Texas  North Dakota and Colorado will keep output rising  CHEAPER SHALE  Those wells  which typically do not need constant pumping to make oil flow  have helped U S  crude output to nearly double since 2007   They have also prompted OPEC and Saudi Arabia to let prices fall in what is widely seen as an attempt to force U S  rivals to cut output  But publicly traded shale oil companies talk of cash operating costs between  10 and  30 a barrel  suggesting oil prices would have to fall by another third to force them consider well closures  The upshot  It might take a prolonged slowdown in drilling of new wells to significantly curb U S  supply  Break even levels for drilling new wells in most U S  shale oil fields range between  50 and  80 per barrel   well above operating costs for existing shale wells  In response to the price slump  most oil companies have already cut drilling budgets by 25 percent or more  but they are still sinking new wells  Furthermore  unlike small stripper well operators  several producers have hedged much of their 2015 output at prices close to  90 a barrel  keeping lots of their new output profitable  Vast efficiency gains also mean that more oil can be squeezed from fewer new wells  For example  EOG Resources Inc said in November that output of new fracked wells in the Eagle Ford shale of Texas was up 39 percent compared with wells sunk at the start of 2014  
 To me  it s going to be extremely difficult for any U S  production to be cut significantly   TMR s Lasseigne said about the possible impact of well closures ",2015-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-oil-well-shut-ins-start-as-crude-rout-batters-small-producers-325198,325198

167860,389376,EOG,EOG Resources  EOG  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for EOG Resources basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For EOG Resources  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for EOG Resources
This oil and gas company is expected to earn  4 78 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  13 7  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for EOG Resources  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 11 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

167899,389415,EOG,Analysts Estimate EOG Resources  EOG  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  34 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 40 billion  down 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EOG Resources 
For EOG Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 26  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that EOG Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that EOG Resources would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 31  delivering a surprise of  1 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

167955,389471,EOG,EOG Resources  EOG  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 44 billion  up 4 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 07  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EOG Resources 
For EOG Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that EOG Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that EOG Resources would post earnings of  1 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  15 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
EOG Resources doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eog-resources-eog-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200445185,200445185

Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  4 1 billion for the to be reported quarter  indicating an increase of 11 3  from the year ago reported figure The consensus estimate for earnings of  1 03 per share for the first quarter has seen six upward and six downward revisions in the past 30 days  This estimated figure suggests a year over year decline of about 13 5  Factors Likely to Influence Upcoming Quarterly ResultsEOG Resources  which is a leading upstream energy player with an attractive growth profile  has significant acreage in Eagle Ford  Permian  Bakken and Powder River Basin  enabling the company to maintain an oil heavy portfolio  Its presence in these areas also boosts output from domestic resources and the to be reported quarter s results are

figure of 363 3 MBD  This can play a significantly positive role in first quarter earnings  However  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude price in first quarter 2019 was lower than the year ago period  In January  February and March  WTI averaged  51 38   54 95 and  58 15 per barrel  respectively  per the   In comparison  WTI averaged  63 70   62 23 and  62 73 per barrel  respectively  in

1 950 million  Lease and Well cost in the quarter is anticipated in the range of  4 90  5 30 per barrel To conclude  higher production volumes are expected to boost EOG Resources  first quarter 2019

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Noble Midstream Partners has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while EOG Resources has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NBLX likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than EOG has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
NBLX currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 81  while EOG has a forward P E of 18 02  We also note that NBLX has a PEG ratio of 0 80  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  EOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 29 
Another notable valuation metric for NBLX is its P B ratio of 1 07  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EOG has a P B of 2 90 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NBLX s Value grade of A and EOG s Value grade of C

What s Next for EOG Resources

167988,389504,EOG,3 Reasons Why EOG Resources  EOG  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this oil and gas company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for EOG Resources is 4 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  0 7  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  EOG Resources has an S TA ratio of 0 52  which means that the company gets  0 52 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 3  it can be said that the company is more efficient

168016,389532,EOG,AR Or EOG  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States stocks are likely familiar with Antero Resources  AR  and EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Antero Resources is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while EOG Resources has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that AR s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
AR currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 57  while EOG has a forward P E of 20 39  We also note that AR has a PEG ratio of 0 53  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  EOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 39 
Another notable valuation metric for AR is its P B ratio of 0 31  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EOG has a P B of 2 96 
These metrics  and several others  help AR earn a Value grade of A  while EOG has been given a Value grade of C 
AR stands above EOG thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that AR is the superior value option right now ",2019-04-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ar-or-eog-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200406277,200406277
168018,389534,EOG,EOG Resources  EOG  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"The market expects EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 3  
Revenues are expected to be  4 10 billion  up 11 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 22 84  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EOG Resources 
For EOG Resources  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that EOG Resources will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that EOG Resources would post earnings of  1 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  7 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

168054,389570,EOG,Is An Output Cut Imminent In The Upcoming OPEC Meeting  ,opinion,The supply glut in oil market caused investors enough pain last month  WTI crude  the American benchmark  which popped above  76 a barrel and touched multi year high in early October  plunged to  50 29 on Nov 28  Many blame sluggish demand along with the  for the fall in price levels  The dampening growth in demand stemmed from the trade war between the United States and China  two of the world s biggest economies  However  the three month truce in the trade war  declared in the Argentina G20 meeting  has come as a major relief  Investors however still have to wait and see the impact of the positive news on the market sentiment  Also  they expect the OPEC non OPEC meeting  which will take place in Vienna on Dec 6  to provide some good news  The cartel  on the other hand  is facing some huge challenges as discussed below OPEC s DilemmaSaudi Arabia Needs Money   Per International Monetary Fund  Saudi Arabia  a dominant producer of OPEC  needs  70 per barrel in 2018 to breakeven  Moreover  the economic and energy reforms yet to be implemented in Saudi Arabia require billions of dollars  In short  the kingdom needs more money  Moreover  weakening oil prices can hurt the country s balance of payments  John Kemp of Reuters stated that the country s foreign exchange reserves fell from  750 billion in 2014 to  500 billion presently  Additionally  the national energy company  Saudi Aramco also plans to invest  500 billion over the next 10 years to expand its international footprint  In conclusion  Saudi Arabia would not like the present oil output to continue  which weakens the crude prices Support from Russia  A significant non OPEC country  Russia  was initially averse to supply cut   However  reports suggest that Moscow has understood the dire need of slashing output  The second largest oil producer can support OPEC in the upcoming meeting to reduce overall crude production  It is to be noted that Russia  per its Energy Ministry s budget  requires  40 per barrel to reach balance in 2018  So  a production cut  which will most likely lead to higher prices  can boost Moscow s budget surplus Other OPEC Members  Countries like Algeria  Nigeria and Libya are heavily dependent on oil exports  A huge portion of export income comes from crude supply for these countries  Hence  an output cut will have a significant negative impact on their balance of payments  Individually  these countries contribute a small portion to OPEC s total output  However  the low prices are not doing any good to them either  Per International Monetary Fund  Algeria needs oil prices at  105 70 a barrel while Libya requires  132 80 to balance their budget in 2018  So  small countries in the cartel cannot take lower prices while a production cut can harm their budget balance Trump Tweets for Lower Prices  President Donald Trump has made it clear through his tweets that he wants fuel prices low  which primarily requires crude prices to be low  Moreover  his relation with Saudi Arabia can have an effect on the OPEC s decision this week  Considering all the speculations related to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi  allegedly involving Saudi Arabia  political pressure can play a settling role in their decision  as curbing production can anger President Trump  their political ally Advisory Committee Pushes for Cut  The advisory committee of OPEC reportedly suggested 1 3 million barrels per day output curb last week from the production levels of October  Notably  the cartel produced 32 9 million barrels of oil per day in October  It is to be seen whether the suggestion is followed by the members Given all these factors  a supply cut is the most likely outcome  However  the magnitude of the cut may not reflect the amount suggested  Saudi Arabia needs to implement the production curb to improve its economy  Therefore  the degree to which the country succumbs to President Trump s pressure needs to be seen  Other OPEC countries  interests will also play a significant role in the decision making process  Even if the supply curb does not reach the 1 3 million barrels per day mark  it might be close to it and will likely allow prices to rise again  Although prices may not reach October levels  a substantial rise is currently required in the market  Therefore  an output cut  which is the most possible outcome of the meeting is expected to bring positive news for the producers E P Companies in FocusThe volatile oil exploration and production companies will be the most affected by the OPEC meeting s outcome  as their fortunes are tied to commodity price fluctuation  Energy investors will be closely tracking S P components including the

168092,389608,EOG,Can Canadian Natural  CNQ  Pull A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Independent oil and gas explorer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd    TO CNQ   is set to release its first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Thursday  May 3  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 57 cents on revenues of  4 160 million 
In the preceding three month period  the Calgary  Alberta based upstream player reported profit of 37 cents 
As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the company is on a bit of a slippery slope  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise

   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Canadian Natural surpasses earnings estimate this time around  Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
We believe that the improving oil price environment amid a favorable shift in Canadian Natural s product mix toward the commodity bode well 
Canadian Natural is engaged in the acquisition  development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties  The company has a strong and diverse production base with long life and low decline rate assets  In the last quarter  the company witnessed a 19  year over year increase in production  With Canadian Natural s solid assets and strong project execution  we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well 
Moreover  the upstream player is poised to benefit from higher crude price realizations  Benchmark crude oil prices have risen sharply over the past nine months amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative  With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average sales price for crude oil in first quarter 2018 is  61 per barrel  up from  45 a year earlier 
However   has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada  The likes of Canadian natural had to slow down their activity levels due to difficulty in crude transportation  This might lead to lower than expected quarterly production 
Moreover  Canadian Natural pursues long term oil projects  which call for large capital outlays and several years of development before any cash flow is realized  Therefore  cost and time overrun in the ongoing projects may have a negative impact on the stock s company s upcoming quarterly performance 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Natural will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  for Canadian Natural stands at 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 57 cents 
Zacks Rank  Canadian Natural has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Canadian Natural  here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   has an Earnings ESP of  3 33  and a Zacks Rank  1  The firm is anticipated to release earnings on May 3  You can see

The negatives were partially offset by revenues of  21 million from the acquired Atwood rigs  Floater contract drilling expenses flared up nearly 26 7  to  185 million from  146 million witnessed in first quarter 2017 
Operating loss in the segment was  1 4 million against the prior year quarter s operating income of  65 6 million  The downfall was primarily caused by 26  year over year increase in contract drilling expenses Jackups  Revenues at this segment declined 16 9  to  143 million from  172 million in the year ago quarter  A fall in reported utilization  from 64  in the year ago quarter to 61  in the January March period  and a decline in the average day rate to  74 000 from  86 000  resulted in the decline  This was  however  partially offset by  5 million in revenues from the acquired Atwood rigs  Contract drilling expenses went up 6 7  year over year to  127 million in the first quarter  primarily due to the insertion of five legacy Atwood jackups 
Operating loss in the segment was  20 million against the prior year quarter s operating income of  21 1 million  due to 7  year over year rise in jackup rig s contract drilling expenses Other  In the first quarter of 2018  revenues of  15 million were reported by the company  in line with the year ago quarter  Contract drilling expenses of  13 million in the segment remained flat year over year  These traits led to operating income of  1 4 million  similar to the year ago period Costs and ExpensesDepreciation expenses came in at  115 2 million compared with  109 2 million in first quarter 2017  The uptick primarily resulted from the addition of Atwood rigs to the company s fleet  General and administrative expenses increased to  27 9 million from  26 million in the year ago quarter  Total operating expenses rose 13 3  year over year to  468 3 million  Balance Sheet At the end of the first quarter  Ensco had  465 4 million in cash and cash equivalents  Long term debt was  4 987 3 million  with debt to capitalization ratio of 36 7  compared with 35 2  in the year ago quarter

168218,389734,EOG,3 Reasons Why The U S  Shale Industry Can t Be A Swing Oil Producer,opinion,"A new  from the International Energy Administration  IEA  forecasts that oil production in the United States is on pace to overtake Russian and Saudi Arabian oil production as soon as 2019  As U S  production surpasses that of other major countries  we will see more and more talk reminiscent of the claims in  and  that the American shale oil industry has become the new  swing producer  of the oil market  I had this  recently  These claims are and will be wrong  American shale cannot constitute a swing producer 
The idea behind a swing producer is that one particular supplier  or a group of suppliers working together  can have enough control over changes in supply that it can increase or decrease the price of oil on its own  A swing producer can set the price of oil by either 

Decreasing its own production to raise prices at a time when other producers have no spare capacity to make up for the global supply loss  or
Increasing its own production to lower prices at a time when other producers cannot afford or will not choose to decrease theirs to balance the supply market 

In theory  a swing producer can respond to price fluctuations by increasing or decreasing production to keep prices relatively stable 
In the 1970s  OPEC was often a swing producer in the oil market  cutting production and embargoing global supply to raise oil prices at a time when other producers had no spare capacity  This strategy resulted in great profits and newfound market controls for OPEC countries 
In the 1980s  Saudi Arabia attempted to act as a swing producer alone within OPEC  Saudi Arabia agreed to cut its oil production on behalf of OPEC to keep prices from falling  However  at that time Saudi Arabia was not the only producer with spare capacity  New oil production from Alaska s North Slope and Britain s North Sea meant that as Saudi Arabia decreased its own production to keep prices from dropping  oil from elsewhere poured into the market  made up for missing Saudi supply  and pushed prices down  Saudi Arabia failed to be a swing producer in the 1980s 
The U S  shale industry of today is not  and can never be  a legitimate swing producer in the oil market  Here s why 
1  The combined power of the shale industry is probably not great enough  In 2014  at the height of the shale revolution and when the shale oil industry was first called a swing producer  the five largest shale   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   Apache Corporation  NYSE APA   Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  and Continental Resources  NYSE CLR   were only responsible for 10  of all US crude oil production  Only the most optimist projections of shale growth would indicate a potential for such power within the shale industry in the future 
2  Shale cannot unilaterally raise the price of oil  because other producers have plenty of spare capacity  Nor can shale unilaterally lower the price of oil  because it lacks enough spare capacity and other producers have the financial means to decrease their own production  if desired  If shale producers were to act together and decrease production to raise the global price of oil  the void could be filled quickly by OPEC  Russia  Kazakhstan  or Brazil all of which have the spare capacity to increase production and likely would if the prices rose and there was room for more oil on the market  If shale wished to swing the price of oil down by producing more  it would face problems because it likely lacks much spare capacity now most ideas of spare shale capacity are projections for the future and because countries like Saudi Arabia might choose to decrease their own production and wait out the shale overproduction  In fact  some might argue that shale is overproducing today  and OPEC along with its partners such as Russia is cutting its own production to keep prices stable 
3  Shale oil producers in the United States are actually legally prohibited from colluding to set production quotas or impact prices  This is the ultimate reason that shale cannot become a swing producer  However  some argue that shale can act as a swing producer when many independent shale companies take the same actions in response to market conditions  For instance  the price of oil has risen over the last two years and now shale companies are producing more oil again  That is true  but it is not sufficient to make shale a swing producer  There is no strategy behind this  and the self preservation of each company will keep them from making the difficult decisions to become a swing producer  As another example  without colluding shale producers will never jointly decide to cut production in unison to prop up prices  Each shale producer is out for himself  not for the shale industry or the U S  energy industry  Without collusion of the type seen in the OPEC cartel  no group of producers can become a reliable swing producer ",2018-02-28,"Ellen R.

168219,389735,EOG,Here s Why Oil Is Doing So Well,opinion,"They Just Don t Get It 
Shale predictions and price predictions  sometimes they just do not get it  According to an article in todays Financial Times  OPEC is shocked by how many hedge funds really have no clue about how the oil market works  OPEC s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo  who met with hedge fund managers  seemed shocked that many of them had no  basic understanding  of oil and were less savvy than was widely assumed 
While it is not necessary for hedge funds to understand the market fundamentals it does shed light on one of the concerns that I have been raising  I feel that a basic misunderstanding about shale oil and its limitations could be setting the stage for a future supply squeeze down the road 
I am not alone  The Wall Street Journal reported that a  Shale trailblazer turns skeptic on soaring U S  oil production  The Journal says that a former EOG CEO questions growth forecasts  says U S  oil isn t a  big bad wolf  disrupting energy markets 
The Wall Street Journal writes that  One of the pioneers of the U S  shale boom plans to deliver a surprising message at a major energy conference here this week  U S  oil production won t keep growing as fast as the market seems to think  
Mark Papa  the former chief executive of industry bellwether EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG    EOG said in an interview he is eager to tell the assemblage of oil chieftains that a widely held view that shale oil producers can quickly ramp up production  and sustain those levels if needed  is wrong 
 The oil market is in a state of misdirection now   said Mr  Papa  now head of smaller shale company Centennial Resource Development Inc   CDEV suggesting future supplies might be more constrained than experts believe   Someone needs to speak out  
Well we have been speaking out  The Energy Report has long warned that the market was overestimating shale s ability to replace more traditional jects  Years ago  we warned that the market was underestimating shales potential impact and in recent years we warned that the market was overestimating shales ability to replace traditional energy portion  We warned that shales large decline rate and its logistics and the independent nature of the producers would make it impossible for shale oil process to replace Saudi Arabia and OPEC s role as swing producer  We also warned about the financial fragility of some of the producers  We also warned that we can t trust in shale alone 
That is one reason why oil is soaring despite predictions by the International Energy Agency that the U S  will see a shale production surge  The reality is that while production will rise  current production is not meeting demand  The market rallied hard on a report by Genscape that oil supply in Cushing Oklahoma continues to drain  by an additional 660 000 barrels in the last few days  That does not fit the bearish narrative  Global supplies are also draining at a time when you expect them to be rebuilding 
You see when oil did that double dip in 2015  many thought is was because of shale and the glut  It was because many hedge funds did not understand the fundametals  They believed the lower for longer mantra or that somehow shale oil would learn to love oil in the twenties and prosper  Instead we were sowing the seeds of the most significant bottom in oil in a generation  Now  many are starting to see what we saw back then and that is why oil is doing as well as it is now ",2018-03-06,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-030618-200296055,200296055

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Phillip Morris  PM   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Becton  Dickinson  BDX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Phillip Morris s shares have underperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the last three months   8 1  vs   3    But the Zacks analyst likes Philip Morris  consistent efforts to improve the performance of its low risk products  In this category  the company s IQOS smokeless cigarette have been steadily expanding owing to consumer demand   
Higher cigarette pricing has also been favoring the company  Though the company has been benefiting from enhanced volumes and revenues in the reduced risk products category  it has been suffering majorly due to consistent declines in cigarette volumes stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products  
Owing to such headwinds  Phillip Morris continued with its drab performance in third quarter 2017  wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  These factors also compelled management to lower its 2017 view 
 You can   
Shares of EOG Resources have gained around  12 7  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas E P Industry  which has gained  4  over the same period  EOG Resources holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States  
The Zacks analyst likes the firm s plan to complete 505 wells in the area  significantly higher than 443 recorded in 2016  The firm expects 80  and 90  of the wells to meet the standards of premium wells in 2017 and 2018  respectively  In the promising U S  shale plays  EOG Resources has identified 7 200 premium wells that can give access to almost 6 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves over a period of 10 years  
However  the company s lack of exposure to international resources is a drag  On top of that  increasing debt load is a cause of concern  Moreover  cash balances have been declining substantially over the first nine months  reflecting balance sheet weakness

Becton  Dickinson s shares have outperformed the Zacks Dental Supplies industry over the last one year  gaining  30 5  vs   19 1   Becton  Dickinson and Company  popularly known as BD  is steadily progressing with its planned acquisition of medical technology player  C  R  Bard  Post completion  BD expects growth in adjusted earnings starting fiscal 2019  The Zacks analyst thinks the acquisition is a strategic one which will generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion  
Further  BD announced that it will divest its soft tissue core needle biopsy products for  100 million to Merit Medical  On the flipside  lackluster performance by the Medical segment is a concern  
Performance in the segment was affected by sluggishness in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units in the United States  BD temporarily paused shipments of its insulin infusion sets  The voluntary recall of Barricor blood collection tubes in the recent past also adds to BD s woes

168367,389883,EOG,5 Oil Stocks To Buy As Saudi Tensions Boost Prices Over  57,opinion,On Monday  political turmoil in Saudi Arabia boosted oil prices to their highest level in two and a half years  The country s 32 year old crown price  Mohammed Bin Salman  ordered the arrest of much of the country s top leadership  Such a move was apparently necessary to tackle corruption even as the young prince attempts to modernize the Saudi economy As a result  oil prices gained  with Brent crude increasing 3 4  to  64 27 a barrel and WTI crude rising 3  to  57 35 per barrel  Further  the oil rally led the Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   to advance 2 3   becoming the biggest gainer among the key S P 500 sectors Though skeptics are already depicting the spike as a temporary one  several factors may combine to boost oil prices for a longer period  Adding stocks from the oil sector to your portfolios looks like a smart move at this point Purge to Tackle Corruption or Advance Consolidation Since his elevation  the crown prince has been touting his Vision 2030 plan as the best way to channelize the Saudi kingdom s oil based clout into broad based economic growth  His plans include economic diversification and selling off a near 5  stake in state owned oil behemoth Aramco  These moves are aimed at making the country more investor friendly by boosting levels of transparency Yet there are major hurdles to be cleared before such a listing becomes possible  Allegations abound that a large chunk of the expenses of Saudi Arabia s royalty show up on Aramco s books  Meanwhile  Saturday s purge has been ostensibly aimed at rooting out corruption at the very top However  top Middle East analysts believe that this could only be a move to consolidate the young prince s power  In the process  opposition to his plans could be swiftly removed  But at the same time  the Aramco stake sale may be threatened since investors would be weary of excessive political uncertainty  In this event  a private placement with investors from Russia and China seems more likely OPEC Deal  Saudi Turmoil  Rig Count Decline to Boost PricesIn recent months  oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows  currently trading above  50 a barrel  The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC s compliance with its landmark production cut deal  On Nov 30  2016  OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1 2 million barrels a day  On May 25  the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018   Read   Now  speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018  Meanwhile  Saturday s events in Saudi Arabia have injected quite a bit of political uncertainty into the oil price scenario  In fact  a section of market watchers believe that crown prince Salman would need oil prices to rise in order to get the best possible value for the Aramco stake sale Meanwhile  Baker Hughes  closely watched weekly report  the oil rig count has gone down for a ninth week in 12  This implies that U S  energy firms are cutting down on their capital investment plans  Importantly  this is an indicator that U S  shale producers are showing signs of slowing down   Read   Our ChoicesThe Saudi crown prince s move to clamp down on an important section of the country s royalty seems to be a calculated move ahead of the crucial Aramco stake sale  Prince Salman is possibly attempting to consolidate power and boost oil prices at one go during the resulting uncertainty Meanwhile  compliance to the OPEC production controls agreement remains high even as U S  rig counts continue to fall consistently  All these factors will likely to combine to boost oil prices in the days to come  which will make stocks from the sector a lucrative proposition  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score Ecopetrol S A    NYSE EC   is a Colombia based

168368,389884,EOG,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Ecopetrol  Hess Midstream Partners  China Petroleum   Chemical  Noble Midstream Partners And EOG Resources,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 8  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Ecopetrol S A    NYSE EC    Hess Midstream Partners LP   NYSE HESM    China Petroleum   Chemical Corporation   NYSE SNP    Noble Midstream Partners LP   NYSE NBLX   and EOG Resources Incorporated   NYSE EOG   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Oil Stocks to Buy as Saudi Tensions Boost Price Over  57 bblOn Monday  political turmoil in Saudi Arabia boosted oil prices to their highest level in two and a half years  The country s 32 year old crown price  Mohammed Bin Salman  ordered the arrest of much of the country s top leadership  Such a move was apparently necessary to tackle corruption even as the young prince attempts to modernize the Saudi economy As a result  oil prices gained  with Brent crude increasing 3 4  to  64 27 a barrel and WTI crude rising 3  to  57 35 per barrel  Further  the oil rally led the Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   to advance 2 3   becoming the biggest gainer among the key S P 500 sectors Though skeptics are already depicting the spike as a temporary one  several factors may combine to boost oil prices for a longer period  Adding stocks from the oil sector to your portfolios looks like a smart move at this point Purge to Tackle Corruption or Advance Consolidation Since his elevation  the crown prince has been touting his Vision 2030 plan as the best way to channelize the Saudi kingdom s oil based clout into broad based economic growth  His plans include economic diversification and selling off a near 5  stake in state owned oil behemoth Aramco  These moves are aimed at making the country more investor friendly by boosting levels of transparency Yet there are major hurdles to be cleared before such a listing becomes possible  Allegations abound that a large chunk of the expenses of Saudi Arabia s royalty show up on Aramco s books  Meanwhile  Saturday s purge has been ostensibly aimed at rooting out corruption at the very top However  top Middle East analysts believe that this could only be a move to consolidate the young prince s power  In the process  opposition to his plans could be swiftly removed  But at the same time  the Aramco stake sale may be threatened since investors would be weary of excessive political uncertainty  In this event  a private placement with investors from Russia and China seems more likely OPEC Deal  Saudi Turmoil  Rig Count Decline to Boost PricesIn recent months  oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows  currently trading above  50 a barrel  The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC s compliance with its landmark production cut deal  On Nov 30  2016  OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1 2 million barrels a day  On May 25  the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018   Read   Now  speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018  Meanwhile  Saturday s events in Saudi Arabia have injected quite a bit of political uncertainty into the oil price scenario  In fact  a section of market watchers believe that crown prince Salman would need oil prices to rise in order to get the best possible value for the Aramco stake sale Meanwhile  Baker Hughes  closely watched weekly report  the oil rig count has gone down for a ninth week in 12  This implies that U S  energy firms are cutting down on their capital investment plans  Importantly  this is an indicator that U S  shale producers are showing signs of slowing down   Read   Our ChoicesThe Saudi crown prince s move to clamp down on an important section of the country s royalty seems to be a calculated move ahead of the crucial Aramco stake sale  Prince Salman is possibly attempting to consolidate power and boost oil prices at one go during the resulting uncertainty Meanwhile  compliance to the OPEC production controls agreement remains high even as U S  rig counts continue to fall consistently  All these factors will likely to combine to boost oil prices in the days to come  which will make stocks from the sector a lucrative proposition  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank

168369,389885,EOG,North Dakota Oil Output Remain High  Zooms Past 1 1M Barrels,opinion,As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output rose 2 1  in September after climbing 3 5  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in September averaged 1 107 104 barrels a day  up 22 414 barrels a day from August Record Number of Producing WellsReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations  the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  As daily output consolidated above 1 million barrels for the eighth month in a row  the state s total number of producing wells numbered 14 190 at the end of September  a new all time high Despite the Increase  Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1 227 483 barrels day in December 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  55 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in February 2016  The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins Rig Count Clawing Back SteadilySome 56 drilling rigs were active in the state in September  flat from the August count  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  North Dakota had just 34 rigs operating  A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry s strength  the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production  Notwithstanding recent gains  the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling Shale Industry Adjusting to  50 OilMore rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota  but also points to the rising flood of U S  shale driven production Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers  in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas  worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more What Lies Ahead The U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  benchmark hit a more than two year high of  57 recently  Also  we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being  While we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U S  dollar  we remain extremely confident of a bull run in the near future In this context  the improvement in North Dakota s September production bode well for the region  With oil prices likely to head higher  the monthly output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being Dakota Access Pipeline  Can It Increase Production Further Apart from the strength in crude prices  there is another factor that might speed up Bakken output growth   the 1 100 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L P  s   NYSE ETP    3 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration  As a result  disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  the sponsor brought the controversial conduit  in early June With the project s arrival  operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market  In fact  around 78  of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines  with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24  earlier in 2017 to less than 10  Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  Set to carry about 500 000 barrels of oil daily  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output  the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Permian Basin This  industry observers hope  will support the increase in Bakken output and help producers like Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR    Whiting Petroleum Corp    NYSE WLL    EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG    Hess Corp    NYSE HES    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   Want to Own a North Dakota Play Now If you are looking for a near term North Dakota play  Northern Oil and Gas  Inc    NYSE NOG

Zacks Rank  EOG Resources carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which  when combined with  12 18  ESP  makes us confident about a positive earnings surprise 
Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  
What Is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings

Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total production is 56 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBoe   higher than last quarter s 55 MMBoe and year ago quarter s 51 1 MMBoe

168432,389948,EOG,North Dakota Production Up In April  Will The Gain Last ,opinion,As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output rose 2 4  in Apr after dropping 0 8  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in Apr averaged 1 050 630 barrels a day  up 24 940 barrels a day from March Along with Oil  Gas Production Rises TooReflecting a healthy increase and trumping expectations  the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  It must be noted that at the end of Apr  the state s total number of producing wells numbered 13 717  a new all time high Interestingly  natural gas output jumped 6  in April to around 1 8 billion cubic feet per day   another record   as operators scrambled to the core areas of the Bakken where wells extract more gas along with crude Despite the Increase  Production is a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1 227 483 barrels day in Dec 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  45 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb 2016  The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise FurtherSome 50 drilling rigs were active in the state in April  up from 46 in Mar and 39 in February  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  North Dakota had just 29 rigs operating  The steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and production Notwithstanding recent gains  the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling  Moreover  with oil prices resuming their downward trend and officially sinking into the bear market territory with year to date losses of more than 20   the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year  It s because the current crude levels just won t support any more drilling rigs Shale Industry Caught in a  Catch 22  SituationWhile more rigs in operation and increasing production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota  the current sub  45 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable  And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U S  shale driven production Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more To conclude  the U S  shale  including the likes of North Dakota  is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again What Lies Ahead As one can conclude from the above discussion  the improvement in Apr production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018  In fact  with April production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark  there are chances that output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure before the end of 2017 if prices remain under  45 a barrel What s more  economic hardship forced producers like Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR    EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG    Hess Corp    NYSE HES    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO    QEP Resources Inc    NYSE QEP    SM Energy Co    NYSE SM   to put 1

May 3 Earnings Picture So FarTo date  we have Q1 results from 358 S P 500 members that combined account for 78 2  of the S P 500 Index s total market capitalization  According to the latest  report  total earnings for these companies are up 12 9  on 7 9  higher revenues  both on a year over year basis  So far  74 3  companies delivered positive earnings surprises and 65 9  beat revenue estimates Energy Sector Prospects Look Good The  Energy  sector has made a good start this earnings cycle  For the few sector components  63 6  to be precise  on the S P 500 Index that have reported Q1 results  total revenue surged 33 1   Most importantly  71 4  of the energy companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 61 9  of the firms beat expectations on the top line front Let s delve deeper to find out what influenced the sector s performance this time around Improvement in Commodity Prices from Historic LowsDespite the biggest oil deal in a decade and a pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  crude prices declined almost 6  in the first quarter  OPEC s historic accord to trim output and restore demand supply balance stabilized the market to a large extent  However  U S  shale players tried to make the most of the improving oil price scenario by increasing production  With the recent surge in U S  shale production putting pressure on the market  oil ended the first quarter at  50 60 per barrel  down 5 8  from the 2016 end level Natural gas fared even worse  Price of the commodity plunged 14  in the January March quarter  thanks to one of the mildest winters on record  A warmer winter translated into lesser requirement for the heating fuel  in turn  upending demand forecasts Despite the sequential fall  both oil and natural gas prices are better placed than the corresponding period of 2016  In the year ago period  crude slumped to a 12 year low  while natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years Year Over Year Gains Likely Ending the dismal trend of the past few quarters  Oil Energy sector finally turned the corner in the Q4 earnings season driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 Index The October December quarter of 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with the OPEC deal and extreme weather conditions supporting a hefty rise in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter A historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers  saw oil prices end the year at  53 72 a barrel  up 11 4  sequentially and 45  year over year  Meanwhile  natural gas too displayed improvement with futures jumping approximately 25   just in the fourth quarter  Ending the year at  3 724 per million Btu  MMBtu    up 59  from 2015   the heating fuel benefited from a cold snap that translated into a strong demand As a result  following eight back to back quarters of earnings declines  the sector turned around in 4Q16 and clocked its first positive earnings growth after two years  With estimate revisions going up following OPEC s Algeria grandstand  the Oil Energy sector s earnings were expected to improve handsomely from the 4Q15 levels True to predictions  the sector came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 Index  total Q4 earnings were up 17 1  on 2 0  higher revenues The picture looks rather encouraging for the ongoing Q1 earnings season as well  This is not surprising as both oil and gas fell to multi year lows in the year ago period  In fact  the Energy sector is set to turn around from a modest loss in the year earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter Per our analysis  the Energy sector is anticipated to earn a total of  9 billion in Q1 comparing favorably with a loss  1 6 billion in the year earlier quarter  The top line is likely to show impressive growth of 31 6  from 1Q16 levels  while margins are set to improve 5 1      Stocks to Watch for Earnings on May 8Let s see what s in store for these five energy

Chicago  IL   November 17  2016   Zacks Market Edge is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec  Every week  Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life  To listen to the podcast  click here     
	Welcome to Episode  58 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
	Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
	In this episode  Tracey is joined by Sheraz Mian  Zacks Director of Research  and a former oil analyst  to discuss where the oil market stands at the end of 2016 and what oil stocks investors should be looking at heading into 2017 
	Tracey and Sheraz first discussed the oil stocks in late 2015 when the crude sell off was just in the first innings  It wouldn t hit  25 until February 2016 
	Back in 2015  Tracey and Sheraz were both worried about which companies had the best balance sheets and how many would survive the most vicious sell off in crude in the last 50 years 
	But a year later  the story has changed  The US and International rig counts have bottomed and are slowly starting to trickle up  Crude is up off its lows and while it s not near the  60 or  70 level many thought it would be at the end of the year  it s in a zone where the oil companies can make money 
	Cost cutting is mostly complete which means fewer layoffs  The lending situation has also improved which makes it easier for energy companies to renegotiate loans with their banks 
	Where does this leave investors looking to get into oil stocks 
	WTI has fallen 14  this fall which has pushed down the exploration and production stocks from their 2016 highs  Sheraz believes this is a buying opportunity in that area  especially for long term investors  In the short term  he still expects crude and the oil stocks to be volatile The Best Oil Stocks for 2017
	1       Chevron  NYSE CVX   NYSE    is the  safe  play and Sheraz s favorite among the Big Oil stocks 
	2      Apache  NYSE APA   NYSE    just made a big discovery in the Alpine High and analysts believe this has big potential in the next few years  Tracey owns this stock in her personal portfolio 
	3      EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   NYSE    is very diversified  It has over 14 000 drilling locations in numerous areas 
	4      Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE    has one of the best balance sheets in the industry 
	5      In the small and mid cap E P sectors  look at Whiting Petroleum  NYSE    which is strong in the Bakken and Synergy  a small E P in the Wattenberg in Colorado  The insiders have been buying shares in SYRG 
	Sheraz also thinks investors can poke around in some of the big service companies  With some rigs being reactivated  the first contractors they will call are companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  
	Sheraz and Tracey still think it s too early to get into the niche oil service companies like those that transport personnel to the rigs or provide safety gear  The industry  while on the upswing  isn t yet at full throttle  Those might be plays later in 2017 
	What else should you know about the oil stocks and how to play them 
	Tune into this week s podcast to find out

168474,389990,EOG,Oil Stocks See Silver Lining As Iran Signals  55 Crude,opinion,"We have been witnessing crude price weakness since mid 2014 following an oversupplied commodity market  Over these years  big energy players suffered and touched 52 week lows  They are saddling a huge debt load and have been compelled to divest prospective oil resources 
Then  the million dollar question crept up    what measures should oil producing nations take to help crude to go back to its previous glory  The most obvious way out is to lower the output of the commodity as the market is witnessing plentiful supply  Naturally  all eyes are on a probable oil production cut agreement that The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  may seal this month 
This isn t all that oil producers are keeping their fingers crossed for  The Iranian oil minister has now raised hopes that crude could touch  55 per barrel if the accord is signed  
Oil Over  50 Again 
OPEC is expected to come up with a deal on Nov 30 for oil production cut  one of the prime measures that analysts think could restore crude amid oversupplied commodity market  The cartel  which controls more than one third of the oil in the world  is now looking to strike an accord to lower production by up to 700 000 barrels per day  
OPEC believes that the move to prop up oil prices will also depend upon the support of non OPEC members like Russia  In fact  Bijan Zanganeh   oil minister of Iran   expressed optimism that if an agreement could be reached by OPEC members on Nov 30  oil could cross  50 per barrel mark 
He further added that if non OPEC members support the production curb  crude could touch  55 per barrel level again  Indeed  Russia announced that it will support the decision of OPEC to restrict oil production 
What s in Store for Oil Companies 
The performance of energy players  especially the upstream companies  depend on oil prices  Higher the commodity price  greater the revenue generation for the companies after selling crude at higher prices 
Definitely  if both OPEC and non OPEC members agree on the production curb deal  crude price will move up  ushering on good news for oil exploration and production players like Matador Resources Company   NYSE MTDR    Apache Corp    NYSE APA    EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   and SM Energy Company   NYSE SM

168475,389991,EOG,IEA Warns Of Oil Shortage  Gainers   Losers,opinion,"Can you think of an  Oil Shortage Market  now  It is unimaginable as the commodity has long been hit by plentiful supply that has been exerting downward pressure on oil prices since mid 2014 
After a long race to secure maximum market share  oil majors are finally willing to sacrifice production for the sake of price  Now  these companies are desperately waiting for oil price to go up so that they can sell crude at high profit margins and generate handsome cash flows once again  In fact  upstream players have already reduced spending on exploration and production projects 
Then again  producing lower levels of oil could only be a short term solution and eventually lead to an oil deficit market  Like an oversupplied oil market  crude shortage also represents market imbalance  In fact  Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA    a major energy consultative body of industrialized countries   warns of oil shortage by the end of this decade    
Oil Shortage  
Oil prices have plunged much below the level it was trading during mid 2014 owing to oversupply  Following this  energy players involved in exploration and production activities have been facing difficulties as they are not being able to sell the commodity at healthy prices to refiners and other downstream players 
As a natural consequence  the world is looking for opportunities to lower output level   one of the prime measures that analysts think will restore crude 
This is exactly why all eyes are on the OPEC meeting to be held at Vienna  Austria on Nov 30  2016  wherein the cartel is expected to reach an agreement on oil production cut  In fact  Bijan Zanganeh     expressed optimism that if an agreement is reached by OPEC members on Nov 30  oil could cross the  50 per barrel mark  He further added that if non OPEC members support production curb  crude could touch the  55 per barrel level again 
Consistent efforts in curbing crude production have encouraged oil producing majors to invest at lowest levels since 1950 in new projects  Overall  these measures are definitely useful in restoring oil price in the short run  But the long term may see oil becoming exorbitant if commodity surplus turns to shortage in the coming years  This again  will not favor the market 
The IEA warns that if investments in new oil projects remain low at 2017  it will be three years in a row that less capital is being invested in upstream developments  That might create problems in feeding oil demand by early 2020  Fundamentally  a new oil field requires at least three to six years for generating oil as per IEA  Hence  if the current level of investment is not increased  there might be problems in generating new oil if there is any additional immediate demand in a crude shortage era 
Energy Players  Gainers   Losers
We know that oil price determines the fate of almost all energy players  If the crude market transforms from surplus to shortage  oil prices will flare up 
Definitely good times are coming up oil exploration and production players like Matador Resources Company   NYSE MTDR    Apache Corp    NYSE APA    EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   and SM Energy Company   NYSE SM    This is because all these debt laden upstream companies will be able to sell the commodity at much higher prices and be financially sound again  Here  Matador Resources  Apache and SM Energy carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while EOG Resources carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  
However  bad times may be in store for refiners like Western Refining  Inc    NYSE WNR    Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO   and Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC    These players will have to buy raw crude at higher prices which would raise their input cost  All the three refiners carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

168476,389992,EOG,What s Next For Big Oil After OPEC Production Cut ,opinion,"In a bold but not unexpected move  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  cartel agreed on Wednesday to reduce production starting next month  Seen as a desperate bid to put a floor on falling oil prices  the group   led by Saudi Arabia   promised to take 1 2 million barrels a day out of the market 
OPEC s First Output Cut in 8 Years
OPEC s decision to cut oil production was not totally surprising though the magnitude of reduction were deeper than many analysts had expected  The move aims to trim output to 32 5 million barrels per day    at the low end of a preliminary agreement struck in Algiers in Sep 
Crude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb on a supply glut amid slowing demand  In particular  the oil rout alarmed many of the countries whose economies depend on the commodity s exports 
A sop to populous big spending oil producers such as Venezuela and Iran  the cartel s cutbacks was a mild loss for Saudi Arabia that has been adamant about its continuing strategy to preserve market by pumping oil almost flat out rather than trying to prop up prices by modifying production limits 
Riyadh was forced to soften its stand after it became clear that the kingdom was getting clobbered by its own policies  As a result  the world s largest crude exporter gave its seal of approval on the cartel s production cut decision   the first such attempt since 2008  What s more  Saudi Arabia will bear the lion s share of the production cuts to accommodate arch rivals Iran s demands 
It will trim volumes by nearly a half a million barrels per day  while allowing arch rival Iran to boost production slightly  Another fast growing producer Iraq surprised pundits by pledging to curtail output by 0 2 million barrels per day 
Gets Russia to Comply
Russia  which is not part of OPEC  will also join output cuts for the first time in 15 years  The biggest supplier outside the bloc relented from its longstanding position of only freezing production and agreed to cut 300 000 barrels from its record high output of more than 10 million barrels a day 
Oil Prices   Stocks Climb
Oil prices jumped Wednesday to their highest point since Oct 27 as investors were impressed by a decision from the world s largest oil cartel to slash production targets  U S  crude for Jan delivery settled up  4 21  or 9 3   to  49 44 a barrel in New York 
Expectedly  the early reaction in energy stocks has been positive  The S P 500 energy sector index on Wednesday soared by as much as 4 8     its largest gain in 15 months 
Independent oil explorers and producers  whose revenues are directly associated with crude price  were among the best performing stocks  Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   was up 20 8  on the day  Newfield Exploration Co    NYSE NFX     a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company   jumped 15 7  and shale specialist EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG   soared 10 9   You can see    Oils Energy Sector Price Index

Effect on Big Oil
While most of the gains were in the small mid cap or exploration services markets  the large cap oil space fared well too  In fact  supermajors ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   were among the biggest gainers among blue chip stocks  all moving up 2  or more    a significant rise considering their status as  traditionally defensive stocks   Chevron shares even hit a new 52 week high 
The Saudi brokered oil production deal is being hailed as a positive outcome for the overall oil market especially when oilfield services cost remains low  It is expected to bring much needed stability to the market with prices set to improve steadily  Multinational oil enterprises  like ExxonMobil  Chevron etc    on the back of greater certainty  will now be able to revive spending on drilling activities  This is set to drive their upstream segment s revenues  earnings and cash flow 
Moreover  large integrated companies  or  Big Oil     unlike their small or medium sized producers   are not known to hedge a major share of their future production  So  they are more likely to benefit from OPEC driven higher spot prices   
On the flip side  a sustained crude rally will render their refining unit unprofitable  As it is  there are signs of weakness in the downstream business  suggesting that the unit   which saved the supermajors when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  The most recent quarter saw the integrated behemoths  downstream segment income erode on fuel oversupply and weak demand 
With refineries being buyers of crude  an increase in oil prices can squeeze their profitability  As a result  with the commodity s price expected to increase in the near term  we expect Big Oil s margins to be negatively impacted due to a rise in the cost of oil they buy to make gas  jet fuel and other refined products 
Finally  the stocks mentioned above   ExxonMobil  Chevron  Royal Dutch Shell and BP   are generally aligned in tandem with long term oil prices  rendering short term fluctuations in the spot market as non events 
On balance though  we see more upside potential than downside risk from current levels

168477,389993,EOG,US Shale Players To Outpace OPEC  5 Stocks To Watch,opinion,"In a bold but not unexpected move  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  agreed on Wednesday to reduce production starting next month  Seen as a desperate bid to break a fall in oil prices  the group   led by Saudi Arabia   promised to take 1 2 million barrels a day out of the market 
Now  the time has come for U S shale players to outpace OPEC in the rat race for production share  With the cartel s output sacrifice  the U S energy companies are expected to take advantage of higher oil prices in the coming days by producing more oil 
OPEC s Production Cut 
This is the first time since 2008 that OPEC has signed a deal to cut oil production  This is arguably the most crucial move in the energy sector this year to restore crude prices and oil has started shining again  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude witnessed a more than 8  improvement to settle at  49 44 per barrel yesterday 
Per the accord  OPEC will lower its production by 1 2 million barrels per day  MMB D  to 32 5 MMB D   effective Jan 1  2017   from 33 6 MMB D  Notably  the production cut   almost 1  of worldwide output   is much more than what was projected by most analysts  
Saudi Arabia has shouldered most of the output cut  It will lower production by about 486 000 barrels per day  Iraq agreed to cut 210 000 barrels per day  which marks the second highest reduction  Investors should also know that non OPEC players  including Russia  have shown willingness to cut production by 600 000 barrels per day  Of the total amount  Russia   the major oil producing player   alone will contribute 300 000 barrels to output cut 
Road Clear for U S Shale Players 
Now  if the cartel is successful in enforcing the cut  U S  shale producers will increase their market share by producing more oil at the expense of OPEC  In other words  U S  frackers will capitalize on higher oil prices in response to the cut    
However  there is a saying   Nothing Happens Overnight   Definitely oil price is shining again  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude has again crossed  50 per barrel mark and closed at  51 06 yesterday  But that improvement on the crude front could not get translated into an immediate ramp up in production for the U S shale players  It will take some time  Why 
Huge Debt Burden  The first and foremost reason is that shale players are laden with huge debt after they got hit by persistently weak oil prices  The companies so long carried on their operations simply by borrowing and also by selling many prospective assets   that could hurt future production  Hence  after selling oil at higher prices  the companies will first pay their outstanding debt  Moreover  before rushing to produce new oil  shale players will rather complete drilled wells that were left incomplete during the downtime 
Availability of Skilled Workers  Moreover  it will really be difficult to get skilled workers now as most of them have engaged themselves in some other jobs after being laid off  On top of that  many rigs were retired during the downtime  Most importantly  the higher numbers of rigs recently are being utilized to replace other declining rigs and also for holding leases 
Oil Should Reach  60  Lastly  according to some analysts  for energy majors to rush to the oil patch  oil needs to improve further  According to Jason Wangler   perInvestor s Business Daily  managing director of investment banking at Wunderlich Securities  crude needs to reach  60 per barrel for oil patch to see enough producers 
5 Shale Players to Watch
Although it is not possible for shale players to immediately return to oil plays  the road seems clear for the long run  In fact  Jason Wangler added that there might be 20  to 25  more capital spending for the shale players during 2017 from 2016 following the improvement in crude  We have employed our proprietary stock screening model to find out U S shale companies that are worth watching 
Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   based in Houston  TX  is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental U S  Cabot focuses on high impact natural gas focused drilling in the Marcellus Shale and supplements it with an Eagle Ford based liquids program in Texas 
Over the last one month  the company significantly outperformed the S P 500 Composite Market  SP5M   Cabot gained almost 14  while the SP5M increased only 5  during the aforesaid period 
Cabot carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   For 2016  the company improved its projected capital spending to  380 million from  345 million  This improved spending will likely get converted to higher output that may further lead to increased cash flows for shareholders 
Based in Fort Worth  TX  Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC   is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties primarily in the southwestern  Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the United States 
Over the last one month  the company significantly outperformed SP5M  Range Resources gained almost 15  while the SP5M increased only 5  during the aforesaid period 
For the current year  the company   which carries a Zacks Rank  3   is projected to witness year over year earnings growth of 55 4  
San Ramon  CA based Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world  based on proved reserves  The company holds roughly 600 000 net acres of land in the Marcellus Shale  Chevron gained almost 8  while the SP5M increased only 5  during the aforesaid period 
The company   with a Zacks Rank  3   has a good record of increasing dividend even during the downtime  You can see  
Oklahoma based Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  and production of onshore U S  natural gas resources  The company is one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas liquids in the U S  It has stakes in liquids rich plays like Eagle Ford Shale  and Utica Shale  The company with a Zacks Rank  3 has managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 71 1   Chesapeake gained almost 31  while the SP5M increased only 5  during the aforesaid period 
Houston  TX based EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG   is a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company  with operations in the U S   Canada  offshore Trinidad  the U K   China  Canada and select other international areas  The company has prospective resources in Eagle Ford and Barnett Shale plays among others  EOG Resources gained almost 14  while the SP5M increased only 5  during the aforesaid period

168479,389995,EOG,Crude Oil Recoups Yesterday s Losses Ahead of U S  Inventories,opinion,"Crude Oil Recoups Yesterday s Losses Ahead of U S  InventoriesFundamentals  
Crude oil levels plunged yesterday to 53 13 20 Feb fresh lows after signals that the U S  shale industry is recovering weighed on the market  ANZ Report  

One of the biggest shale producers  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  said it had boosted its drilling budget by 44 percent after the recent rally in prices 

OPEC with Saudi Arabia in focus  has set its eye on  60 P B as a target for 2017  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  Russia and other producers pledged last year to cut production by about 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  from Jan  1  The first cut in eight years is intended to boost prices and get rid of a supply glut 
OPEC could extend its oil supply reduction pact with non members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level  OPEC sources have told Reuters 
Positive Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI released early this morning give signs of increasing oil demand and therefore pushed oil prices higher 
Conclusion  U S  will increase drilling rigs to glut market with oil supply and OPEC can only reply by ascending compliance and additional reduction to the initial 1 8M bpd  Today U S  crude inventories at 3 30 PM GMT  will bring new perspectives for oil levels 
Technical  
Trend   Bullish Sideways
Resistance levels   R1 54 27  R2 54 90  R3 55 65
Support levels   S1 53 47  S2 52 85  S3 52 35
Remark   The key player today is U S  crude inventories  A penetration for R1 level and stalling above it projects further attacks towards R2 level  Closing Above R2 level is an alarm for R3 level to get ready  A correction below S1 level will create congestion with further selloffs and wash towards S2 levels  Below S3 level the market to be considered downtrend

Scenario in Q3The pricing scenario for natural gas was much better in the third quarter  both on a sequential and an annualized basis  However  oil prices were weaker than the July September quarter of 2015  Despite the persistent weakness in crude  the commodity price improved significantly from the mid February lows  The improvement in commodity prices is undoubtedly favorable for upstream energy players as these firms would now be able to carry on exploration and production activities by hiring more drillers   This is evidenced by the substantial increase in the U S  rig count in recent times  In fact  Baker Hughes Inc   BHI    the company s data issued since 1944 is as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry   declared the rig count for Sep 2016  In the U S   the total number of rigs increased from the Aug 2016 count owing to a rise in the number of land rigs  This represents the fourth

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  EOG  Apache Wrap Up Q3 Earnings

	It was a week where both oil and gas prices finished sharply lower 

	On the news front  with earnings taking center stage yet again  the major headlines came from EOG Resources Inc   NYSE     andApache Corp  s  NYSE      third quarter results  wherein they battled plunging commodity prices to report contrasting numbers 

	Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures dived 9 5  to close at  44 07 per barrel  while natural gas prices ended down 10 9  to  2 767 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices sank to their lowest in more than six weeks as investors remained anxious about the OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets  With divisions in the cartel becoming apparent  the future of the ambitious OPEC announcement looks more and more uncertain  In particular  regional heavyweights and sworn enemies   Saudi Arabia and Iran   continue to be at loggerheads with threats that neither would yield an inch to the other 

	Adding to the pessimism was the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed a record build in domestic crude stockpiles 

	Meanwhile  natural gas also turned sharply lower despite a lower than anticipated inventory build  The commodity was hampered by a warmer than normal autumn weather that translates into weak demand 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Independent energy explorer EOG Resources Inc  reported wider than expected third quarter 2016 loss  The underperformance could be attributed to attributed to lower production as well as weaker oil and gas prices 

	In the quarter  EOG Resources  total volume dipped almost 3  from the year earlier level to 51 1 million barrels of oil equivalent  Average price realization for crude oil and condensates was down almost 5  year over year to  43 63 per barrel  Natural gas was sold at  1 95 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf   down 19  year over year 

	In some positive news  EOG s per unit lease and well expenses fell 18   while transportation costs also decreased from the prior year period 

	EOG Resources  fourth quarter daily production is expected between 562 7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent  MBoe  and 591 8 MBoe  For the full year  EOG Resources projected daily output in the range of 554 9 562 2 MBoe as against the prior projection of 533 5 551 5 MBoe  The company increased its capital expenditure budget to  2 6  2 8 billion from the prior estimation of  2 4  2 6 billion   Read more     

	2  U S  energy firm Apache Corp  reported third quarter loss per share   excluding one time items   of 3 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents  The beat stems from cost savings 

	Revenues of  1 438 million were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 382 million but came 6  below the year ago level amid low commodity prices and a dip in output 

	Apache  like many other oil and gas players   has adjusted its spending plans considerably amid diving crude prices  During Jul Sep period  Apache s exploration and development investments totaled  408 million  49  lower than the  807 million incurred a year ago  Apache s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled  382 million  down 15  from the year ago quarter  Total costs and expenses fell 60  from the third quarter of 2015 to  2 343 million   Read more     

	3  Houston  TX based upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE      posted second quarter adjusted loss of 11 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 19 cents  Lower total expenses led to the outperformance  Contribution from Equatorial Guinea and Oklahoma Resource Basins  also supported the results  The positives were offset partially by lower commodity prices 

	The company s exploration expenses for the quarter of  83 million were significantly lower than  585 million in the year earlier quarter  Moreover  Marathon Oil s total quarterly cost and expenses fell 40 2  to  1 432 million   Read more     

	4  Chinese energy giant PetroChina Co  Ltd   NYSE      announced third quarter 2016 earnings of RMB 1 2 billion or RMB 0 01 per diluted share  compared with RMB 5 2 billion or RMB 0 03 per diluted share a year earlier  Earnings per ADR came in at 15 cents  failing to beat the Zacks Consensus estimate of 29 cents  Moreover  China s dominant oil and gas producer s total revenue for the three months under consideration fell 4  from the comparable 2015 period to RMB 411 4 billion 

	The negative comparisons can be primarily attributable to continued collapse in oil prices  which pummeled its biggest unit   exploration and production   to a loss 

	As of Sep 30  2016  PetroChina s cash balance was RMB 120 8 billion  while net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 190 9 billion for the first three quarters of this year  Capital expenditure for the period reached RMB 114 1 billion  down 23  from the year ago level of RMB 147 9 billion   Read more     

	5  Chevron Corp   NYSE        the second largest U S  oil producer  yielded first gas from Alder field   a gas condensate field in the Central North Sea  Chevron currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see     

	The Alder project is an initiative by Chevron North Sea Ltd  and leading integrated energy player ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Chevron s subsidiary   Chevron North Sea   is the operator of the field with a 73 7  interest in the project  The remaining 26 3  is held by ConocoPhillips 

	The field is forecast to have a capacity of 110 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 14 000 barrels per day of liquid condensate  All the production from this field   located about 100 miles off of Scotland   will be sent to the ConocoPhillips operated Britannia platform via a 17 mile pipeline

168502,390018,EOG,The Best Oil Stocks For 2017,opinion,"Welcome to Episode  58 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Tracey is joined by Sheraz Mian  Zacks Director of Research  and a former oil analyst  to discuss where the oil market stands at the end of 2016 and what oil stocks investors should be looking at heading into 2017 
Tracey and Sheraz first discussed the oil stocks in late 2015 when the crude sell off was just in the first innings  It wouldn t hit  25 until February 2016 
Back in 2015  Tracey and Sheraz were both worried about which companies had the best balance sheets and how many would survive the most vicious sell off in crude in the last 50 years 
But a year later  the story has changed  The US and International rig counts have bottomed and are slowly starting to trickle up  Crude is up off its lows and while it s not near the  60 or  70 level many thought it would be at the end of the year  it s in a zone where the oil companies can make money 
Cost cutting is mostly complete which means fewer layoffs  The lending situation has also improved which makes it easier for energy companies to renegotiate loans with their banks 
Where does this leave investors looking to get into oil stocks 
WTI has fallen 14  this fall which has pushed down the exploration and production stocks from their 2016 highs  Sheraz believes this is a buying opportunity in that area  especially for long term investors  In the short term  he still expects crude and the oil stocks to be volatile 
The Best Oil Stocks for 2017
1       Chevron  NYSE CVX  is the  safe  play and Sheraz s favorite among the Big Oil stocks 
2      Apache  NYSE APA  just made a big discovery in the Alpine High and analysts believe this has big potential in the next few years  Tracey owns this stock in her personal portfolio 
3      EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  is very diversified  It has over 14 000 drilling locations in numerous areas 
4      Pioneer Natural Resources  PXD  has one of the best balance sheets in the industry 
5      In the small and mid cap E P sectors  look at Whiting Petroleum  WLL  which is strong in the Baaken and Synergy  SYRG   a small E P in the Wattenberg in Colorado  The insiders have been buying shares in SYRG 
Sheraz also thinks investors can poke around in some of the big service companies  With some rigs being reactivated  the first contractors they will call are companies like Schlumberger  SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  
Sheraz and Tracey still think it s too early to get into the niche oil service companies like those that transport personnel to the rigs or provide safety gear  The industry  while on the upswing  isn t yet at full throttle  Those might be plays later in 2017 
What else should you know about the oil stocks and how to play them

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

It was a week where both oil and gas prices finished higher 

On the news front  pipeline giants Spectra Energy Corp     and Enbridge Inc     agreed to merge in a stock for stock deal worth  28 billion  while energy explorer Apache Corp     announced a massive discovery in West Texas  Permian Basin 

Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 3 2  to close at  45 88 per barrel  while natural gas prices edged up by a meagre 0 2  to  2 797 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

Oil prices moved north for the first time in 3 weeks after the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a huge drop  As per the federal government s EIA report  oil inventories decreased by a massive 14 51 million barrels for the week ending Sep 2  2016   largest in 17 years  The outsized drop resulted from a tumble in net imports as Tropical Storm Hermine moved into the Gulf of Mexico and prevented tankers from docking 



Natural gas also eked out a small gain following a lower than expected build and predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature over the next few days 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Leading midstream energy companies Spectra Energy Corp  and Enbridge Inc  have decided to merge in a  28 billion transaction with an aim to create the largest energy infrastructure company in North America  The deal will likely be closed by the first quarter of 2017  Post merger  Enbridge shareholders will have a 57  ownership in the combined entity and Spectra Energy will have the remaining 43  interest 

The amalgamation will form one of the largest global energy infrastructure firms with the merger of the two companies  highly complementary platforms  With a diverse base of assets that comprises crude  liquids and natural gas pipelines along with terminal and midstream operations  the merged entity will be able to reach key supply basins and markets 

The combined firm is also believed to have solid balance sheets and enough cash flow generating capacity to finance future growth projects  Moreover  the merger will combine two secured giant projects worth  20 billion and  37 billion that are under development   Read more     

2  U S  energy explorer Apache Corp  reported that it has made a significant new discovery in the Alpine High  which is located in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin in western Texas  The find is expected to contain about three billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of rich gas 

The site   which cost Apache  1 300 per acre for 352 000 gross acres  307 000 contiguous net acres  is expected to generate anywhere from  8 billion to  80 billion in revenue for the company over the life of the wells 

To accelerate drilling in the discovery  Apache has raised its full year 2016 capital budget by 11  to  2 billion  Per the company  the west Texas field has the potential to become one of the largest discoveries in a decade   Read more     

3  Oil and gas company EOG Resources Inc     has agreed to acquire privately held Yates Petroleum Corp  in a  2 5 billion stock and cash deal  Over the years  Artesia  New Mexico based Yates has gained a rich acreage position across the western U S    producing 29 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day  48  oil   EOG Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

EOG Resources  on the other hand  is the largest oil producer in the Lower 48  with average net daily production of 551 thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent  The company is reputed for technological leadership in the development of unconventional resource plays 

The combination of EOG Resources  strong technical competencies with the massive resource potential of the Yates acreage is expected to create significant value for shareholders of both companies  In particular  EOG Resources  inventory of premium drilling locations will grow by 40  as Yates immediately adds an estimated 1 740 net premium drilling locations in the Delaware Basin and Powder River Basin   Read more     

4  San Antonio  TX based refiner Tesoro Corp     announced that it has decided to purchase the Madison  WI based renewable fuels and chemical company  Virent  The deal   whose terms were not disclosed   is intended to support the latter in bringing biofuels technology to commercial scale

168523,390039,EOG,What Lies Ahead For Oil   Gas ETFs ,opinion,"Crude Oil Outlook

	So far  2016 has not been smooth sailing for the U S  oil futures  The commodity has been very volatile this year with prices recovering from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in February to  50 barrel mark in early June  slipping again to under  40 only to rally toward  50 once more 

	While factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers contributed to jump in prices earlier this year that saw the benchmark recover significantly  these issues have largely vanished from the market  As of now  overproduction of crude and a glut of refined products keep the commodity under pressure 

	At over 520 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 16  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year  As it is  improvement in oil fundamentals remain fragile with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Piling on the misery is the Baker Hughes report revealing a steady rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities 

	A number of major industry players  including Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  RDS A  and BP plc  LON BP  have reported sub standard second quarter numbers as lower energy prices take a toll   Read   

	Over the past few weeks  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures have surged to over  45 a barrel on renewed expectations of a production freeze from the 14 member OPEC bloc and Russia  However  several analysts have expressed skepticism over this mini rally  pointing to the last such attempt made in April that failed spectacularly 

	Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well  Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China s crude demand  In particular  the Asian giant s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world s No  2 energy consumer  

	What s more  in the absence of production cuts from OPEC  the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices  and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand   not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term  Moreover  a stronger dollar has made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency 

	As it is  with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year  crude is very well stocked  On top of that  the top producers of Middle East   pumping at full throttle   have indicated time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts  Therefore  the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016 

	In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  mostly trading in the  35  45 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming  we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil   Read   
Natural Gas Outlook
 It s cleaner  it s cheaper and it s domestic  

	  Legendary energy entrepreneur T  Boone Pickens  in reference to natural gas 

	Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 

	With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance 

	Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at 3 350 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is up 275 Bcf  9   from last year and is 350 Bcf  12   above the five year average  Expectedly  this has taken a toll on prices  Natural gas peaked at about  13 50 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2008 but dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years   at  1 611 per million Btu  MMBtu    in the first quarter  Apart from plentiful stocks  which hit an all time high in November  the selloff was spurred by tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Ni o phenomenon 

	In response to continued weak natural gas prices  major U S  producers like Cimarex Energy Co   NYSE XEC   Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   NYSE COG  and Range Resources Corp   NYSE RRC  have all taken significant cost cutting measures  including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets 

	With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices have been held back  Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising  In fact  EIA estimates natural gas inventories will reach 4 042 Tcf by the end of October   a record level for that time of the year 

	In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Finally  with improved drilling productivity offsetting the historic decline in rig count  we do not expect gas prices to rally anytime soon 
PLAYING THE SECTOR THROUGH ETFs

	Considering the turbulent market dynamics of the energy industry  the safer way to play the volatile yet rewarding sector is through ETFs  In particular  we would advocate tapping the energy scene by targeting the exploration and production  E P  group 

	This sub sector serves as a pretty good proxy for oil gas price fluctuations and can act as an excellent investment medium for those who wish to take a long term exposure within the energy sector  While all oil gas related stocks stand to move with fluctuating commodity prices  companies in the E P sector tend to be the most important  as their product s values are directly dependent on oil gas prices   See all Energy ETFs  
SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF    

	Launched in June 19  2006  XOP is an ETF that seeks investment results corresponding to the S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Select Industry Index  This is an equal weighted fund consisting of 58 stocks of companies that finds and produces oil and gas  with the top holdings being Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK   Rice Energy Inc   RICE  and Devon Energy Corp   NYSE DVN   The fund s expense ratio is 0 35  and pays out a dividend yield of 1 29   XOP has about  1 811 5 million in assets under management as of Aug 25  2016 
iShares Dow Jones US Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF    

	This fund began in May 1  2006 and is based on a free float adjusted market capitalization weighted index of 54 stocks focused on exploration and production  The top three holdings are ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   It charges 0 44  in expense ratio  while the yield is 1 47  as of now  IEO has managed to attract  352 5 million in assets under management till Aug 25  2016

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

Low Oil Prices  Slam Brakes  on North Dakota Production

	As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s crude output remained essentially flat in Jul after dropping to more than two year lows in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in Jul was 1 029 507 barrels a day  up slightly  by 2 376 barrels a day  from Jun 

Despite the Small Increase  Production Remains Sluggish

	Notwithstanding the miniscule increase  the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  Churning out as high as 1 227 483 barrels day in Dec 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  45 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb 

	The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 



Rig Count Still a Shadow of the Oil Boom Times

	Just 31 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jul  down considerably from the year ago number of 73 and a far cry from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 rigs drilling 

	What s more  economic hardship forced producers like EOG Resources Inc      Hess Corp      Marathon Oil Corp     and SM Energy Co      to put 1 472 wells on inactive status 

	Buying any of the aforementioned stocks at this time would present significant risks  But in case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio  one could opt for Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc      It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   

No Quick Resurgence in Sight

	As one can conclude from the above discussion  the small improvement in North Dakota s Jul production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2017  In fact  with Jul production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark  there are chances that output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure before the end of 2016 if prices remain under  50 a barrel

While record high inventories and robust production could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows  signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil  This should lead to lower future production and supply demand rebalancing

Oil Prices Surging  Buy 4 Strong Momentum Energy Stocks

	Oil price is again walking on the bullish path and rose more than 20  from the early lows in August thanks to the possible freeze in crude output after the biggest oil producers gave indications of meeting next month  The market witnessed an uptrend in oil price over the last few trading days  We believe that this is high time for momentum traders to scoop up profits by buying oil stocks since the established uptrend will likely continue in the near term 

Crude Sees Bull Run Again
	U S  oil futures have been erratic in 2016 with prices recovering from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in February to the  50 barrel mark in early June and then slipping again to under  40 
	While factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers contributed to the jump in prices earlier this year that saw the benchmark recover significantly  these issues have now vanished from the market  As of now  overproduction of crude and a glut of refined products keep the commodity under pressure 
	At over 520 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 14  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year  As it is  improvement in oil fundamentals remain fragile with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Piling on the misery is the Baker Hughes report  which revealed a steady rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointed to a resurgence in shale drilling activities 
	A number of major industry players  including Exxon Mobil Corp      have reported sub standard second quarter numbers as lower energy prices took a toll 
	But over the past few trading days  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures have surged more than 20  to touch  48 22 per barrel on Aug 18  from a low settlement price of  39 50 on Aug 2  This is also the highest level since Jul 1  This bull run came on renewed hopes of a production freeze from the 14 member OPEC bloc and Russia when they will meet next month in Algeria 4 Energy Stocks Standing Out
	For investors wanting to take advantage of the bullish oil landscape  we present four companies that deserve attention  Each of these has a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   These picks also have promising momentum metrics  Momentum Score    A   
	The Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is favorable to enter a stock to take maximum advantage of the momentum  The momentum effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank  1 and  2 stocks because as earnings estimate revisions rise  prices race ahead and future estimate revisions rise  resulting in even bigger gains Devon Energy Corporation     based in Oklahoma City  is an independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas  The company s oil and gas operations are mainly concentrated on the onshore areas of North America  including the U S  and Canada

168573,390089,EOG,Oil   Gas ETF Investing Guide,opinion,"OUTLOOK
Crude Oil
U S  oil futures ended last year 30  below the 2014 level  which itself was 46  below the 2013 level   the first time since the late 1990 s of two back to back negative growth years  Such was the ferocity of the crash that three of 2015 s five worst performing stocks in the S P 500 index were all energy companies   Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK   Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  and Kinder Morgan Inc   NYSE KMI   down approximately 77   74  and 63   respectively  And now  with the failure of a producers  meeting in Doha to agree to a production freeze plan in tackling the supply glut  prices look set to expand their 2 year rout 
In recent days  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures jumped to a 7 month high of  48 31 per barrel on a combination of supply disruptions and a turnaround in the stance of a major investment bank  Oil prices rebounded after Goldman Sachs Group Inc   NYSE GS  said that the market is facing a deficit in crude production following supply disruptions in Nigeria and Canada   Read   
But there are headwinds suggesting that the rally might be short lived  While some of the production outages might return shortly  the most important factor remains the commodity s oversupply with the glut still very much there 
Oil is facing the heat on several other fronts as well  Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China s crude demand  In particular  the Asian giant s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world s No  2 energy consumer   
What s more  in the absence of production cuts from OPEC  the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping despite crashing prices  and a weak European economy  not much upside is expected in oil prices in the near term  Moreover  a stronger dollar has made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency 
As it is  with inventories at the highest level during this time of the year  crude is very well stocked  On top of that  OPEC members  like Saudi Arabia  have made it clear time and again that they are more intent on preserving market share rather than attempting to arrest the price decline through production cuts  Therefore  the commodity is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout 2016 
In the medium to long term  while global oil demand will be driven by U S  and the Middle East   this will be more than offset by sluggish growth prospects exhibited by Chinese and the European economies 
In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  mostly trading in the low to mid  40s range  As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming  we are likely to experience pressure to the price of a barrel of oil 
Natural Gas
 It s cleaner  it s cheaper and it s domestic  
  Legendary energy entrepreneur T  Boone Pickens  in reference to natural gas 
Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 
With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance   Read   
Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at 2 681 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is up 816 Bcf  44   from last year and is 813 Bcf  44   above the five year average  Expectedly  this has taken a toll on prices 
Natural gas peaked at about  13 50 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2008 but recently dropped to its lowest level in almost 17 years   at  1 611 per million Btu  MMBtu   Apart from plentiful stocks  which hit an all time high in November  the selloff has been spurred by predictions of tepid demand for the fuel due to mild weather spurred by the El Ni o phenomenon 
In response to continued weak natural gas prices  major U S  producers like Cimarex Energy Co   NYSE XEC   Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   NYSE COG  and Range Resources Corp   NYSE RRC  have all taken significant cost cutting measures  including a reduction in their capital expenditure budgets 
With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices have been held back  Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising 
In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Also  the past winter   being unseasonably warmer than normal   hampered the heating fuel s demand and keeping inventories at high level 
PLAYING THE SECTOR THROUGH ETFs
Considering the turbulent market dynamics of the energy industry  the safer way to play the volatile yet rewarding sector is through ETFs  In particular  we would advocate tapping the energy scene by targeting the exploration and production  E P  group 
This sub sector serves as a pretty good proxy for oil gas price fluctuations and can act as an excellent investment medium for those who wish to take a long term exposure within the energy sector  While all oil gas related stocks stand to move with fluctuating commodity prices  companies in the E P sector tend to be the most important  as their product s values are directly dependent on oil gas prices   See all Energy ETFs  
SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF    
Launched in June 19  2006  XOP is an ETF that seeks investment results corresponding to the S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Select Industry Index  This is an equal weighted fund consisting of 57 stocks of companies that finds and produces oil and gas  with the top holdings being SM Energy Co   SM   Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  and Continental Resources Inc   CLR   The fund s expense ratio is 0 35  and pays out a dividend yield of 1 78

168574,390090,EOG,Ensco Plc  ESV  Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In The Cards ,opinion,Ensco plc   NYSE ESV    a leading supplier of offshore contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry  is expected to report second quarter 2016 earnings on Jul 28 In the last quarter  the company s earnings of 74 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents and also plunged 50 3  from the year ago earnings of  1 49  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe persistent weakness in crude prices and the freefall in the commodity cost to below the  30 per barrel level has resulted in the top energy companies resorting to spending cuts  particularly on the costly upstream projects  due to lower profit margins  This  in turn  means less work for drilling contractors like Ensco and hence  less earnings Moreover  Ensco is expected to have increased downtime in 2016  This will affect its utilization rates in the coming quarters and thus  lower revenues  Further  the challenges associated with contracting rigs for extensions in Brazil remain concerns ENSCO PLC Price and EPS Surprise   The increased supply of high spec rigs is likely to put pressure on utilization for standard jackups in the long run  Also  the company s execution ability with respect to the jackups under construction will play a major role in determining its growth With large  multinational energy firms looking to cut their skyrocketing capital expenses  the drilling space is witnessing intense competition  as multiple firms chase a single contract  This excess capacity  in turn  could lead to further lowering of utilization or dayrates However  Ensco has a contracted revenue backlog  excluding bonus opportunities  of  5 8 billion  which provides it with excellent cash flow visibility  With the completion of the construction phase of its eight additional rigs in 2015  as well as the recent order of two 140 series jackups  Ensco is expected poised for growth  Moreover  the company remains on track to enhance its has operational efficiency as evidenced by its decision to scrap 12 cold stacked rigs comprising eight jack ups and four floaters Ensco cut its dividend to 1 cent per share from 15 cents per share due to the prolonged weakness in the offshore market  The reduction in payout will save the company  130 million annually  It will also help in capital preservation amid the continued market uncertainty Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ensco is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below   Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 96   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 50 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents Zacks Rank  Ensco carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the same space which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Spectra Energy Corp    NYSE SE   has an Earnings ESP of  16 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is slated to release earnings on Aug 3 EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   has an Earnings ESP of  2 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to release earnings on Aug 4 Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   has an Earnings ESP of  2 38  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release earnings on Jul 27 ,2016-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ensco-plc-(esv)-q2-earnings:-disappointment-in-the-cards-200143921,200143921

In the preceding three month period  the Dallas  TX based upstream player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 36 36  despite the challenges that a steep drop in oil price tagged along  This was primarily owing to strong cost control measures 
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has an excellent record  its beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 35 43  
 EXCO RESOURCES Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with natural gas advancing more than 49  sequentially   the best quarterly percentage gain in 11 years  Natural gas futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  2 and  3 per million Btu  MMBtu   With the commodity comprising around 90  of EXCO Resources  total production  the price improvement bodes well for the company 
Moreover  to a large extent  the company s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results 
However  EXCO Resources  core operational region   the Haynesville shale   has seen a drastic fall in the number of gas rigs employed  From 25 at 2015 end  the number is expected to hit single digits pretty soon  Production is likely to suffer in this case  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that EXCO Resources will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of 7 cents 
Zacks Rank  EXCO Resources has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for EXCO Resources  here are some domestic upstream you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Legacy Reserves L P    NASDAQ LGCY   has an Earnings ESP of  31 58  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to release earnings results on August 3

168593,390109,EOG,Natural Gas Reaches New High For The Year As Summer Begins,opinion,"Summer Sizzle
The front month natural gas contract hit a new high for the year just as the summer solstice was about to begin  Record high temperatures in southern California and the American southwest are already raising fears about natural gas shortages  California is warning about emergency measures and talking about rolling blackouts and we have not even gotten through the first full day of summer 
Even in other parts of the country predictions of above normal temperatures this summer are raising concerns that natural gas demand will be met  Injections into storage will continue to be below the five year average and it is even possible with the way things are going  we might see an actually withdrawal from supply  That should not be too comforting for next winter as our so called natural gas glut starts dwindling 
This is the first summer ever that natural gas is the main fuel for electricity generation and we may have been too complacent about meeting demand because we have not had a real hot summer in some time  Year end storage may even fall below 4 trillion cubic feet which would present problems next winter 
We called natural gas a sleeper and now this market is waking up and if we continue to see the summer sizzle  this market still has a way to go  Not only can you trade futures but there are some attractive option strategies to take advantage of the summer spike  Call me to open your account 
While crude oil prices focus on Brexit there were other reasons for oil to rally  A Nigerian union known as the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria  PENGASSAN  are threatening to go on strike  which would lead to a shutdown of the oil and gas industry activity in the country 
In Norway the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association and the Norwegian Union of Industry and Energy Workers avoided a strike but the leader of Norwegian offshore worker s union SAFE is still threatening to strike 
On the supply side a report by Genscape reported a drop of 686 700 barrels of oil at the Cushing  Oklahoma delivery point  That gave oil a boost as traders are still trying to gauge how quickly U S  shale producers will come back on line  There has been a lot of talk about drilled but uncompleted wells saving U S  oil output but the reality is far from clear 
 The FT reports that   In recent weeks there have been signs that is happening  Several shale producers   including Continental Resources  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Oasis Petroleum   have started to complete some of their DUCs  drilled but uncompleted wells   Others  including Whiting Petroleum  have said they can follow suit if oil stays near  50  
The FT says that two firms  Wood Mackenzie and Rystad  have similar views on what that will mean for U S  production  Woods MacKenzie expects about 250 000 barrels per day from completed DUCs in December  while Rystad expects about 300 000 b d  To put that into context  that would represent about 4 5 per cent of total onshore crude production from the  lower 48  states of the U S  
The FT says that   While DUCs can slow the decline in U S  oil output that has been under way since April 2015  they cannot prevent it  For that to happen  the U S  oil industry will have to start drilling again and putting rigs back to work  The Baker Hughes count of rigs drilling onshore oil wells in the U S  has now risen for three weeks in succession  but is still only back to its level in April 
Gas prices surged on the futures markets with RBOB up 5   But that comes as AAA says that gas prices have fallen for nine consecutive days  reaching today s average of  2 33 per gallon  Gasoline demand remains on track to set a new all time high for the 2016 summer driving season  however  crude oil remains relatively less expensive than recent years which is contributing to direct savings at the pump 
We continue to like the long side of oil and gas ",2016-06-21,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-06-21-16-200137226,200137226
168594,390110,EOG,North Dakota Oil Output Suffers Record Monthly Drop,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s crude output fell 6 3  in April   the biggest in its history  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in April was 1 041 007 barrels a day  down 70 414 barrels a day from March 
Reasons for the Large Drop
The steep monthly fall highlights oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  50 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb  The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 
Apart from low oil prices  the state regulator also blamed inclement weather through much of April   which meant producers had to postpone new well fracking and cut back on drilling   as part of the production decline  Moreover  state imposed road restrictions were in force all month  limiting the supply of water  sand and chemicals for fracking 
Just 28 drilling rigs were active in the state in April  down considerably from the year ago number of 77 and a far cry from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 rigs drilling  And there were no drilling rigs operating in Williams County  the epicenter of the state s oil industry 
What s more  economic hardship forced producers like Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR    EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG    Hess Corp    NYSE HES    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO    QEP Resources Inc    NYSE QEP    SM Energy Co    NYSE SM    Whiting Petroleum Corp    NYSE WLL   to put 1 590 wells on inactive status in April  up 67 from the previous month Oils Energy Sector Price Index
Will Production Fall Further 
With April production levels barely above the one million barrel a day mark  there are chances that output in the second largest oil producing state could fall below that figure before the end of 2016 if prices remain under  50 a barrel  However  a significant further decline in output is ruled out though the slide may continue into the summer  In fact  North Dakota s pumped volume is expected to stabilize from here on and could even rise if oil breaches and stays above  50 ",2016-06-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/north-dakota-oil-output-suffers-record-monthly-drop-200137635,200137635

168613,390129,EOG,How To Profit From The Death of OPEC,opinion,"For more than half a century  OPEC ruled the oil market  It decided how much oil would hit the market  which in turn set the price for its members 
Not everyone agreed with this system  but it worked 
Now  the tides are changing   
The reign of mighty OPEC is coming to an end  As Resource Strategist Sean Brodrick wrote earlier this year   OPEC will fall into chaos and perhaps split into separate groups   the haves and the have nots  
Just last week  we caught a glimpse of what s to come  OPEC failed to reach a deal to stabilize oil prices  The group also failed to agree on a new production ceiling and therefore did not change its output policy 
It s no surprise 
Since 2014  OPEC has shifted away from protecting a fair market price for oil  Its new focus  Protecting its share of the oil market 
As a result  the group loosened caps on production quotas  the maximum output levels each member country was allowed to produce   And now  many OPEC countries routinely exceed their quotas 
To bolster prices  OPEC needs to regain control of production levels  It s a big problem   
But it isn t the group s biggest problem 
As you see in this week s chart  OPEC s share of the global oil market started slipping long before it relaxed its stance on production quotas  That s thanks largely to the emergence of U S  shale production 
Once OPEC s top customer  the U S  is now the world s No  1 oil producer  And the amount we import today is roughly half of what we were bringing in eight years ago 
It s only adding to the pressure OPEC is feeling 
That pressure isn t going away  either  As Sean wrote  

 U S  exports are ramping up as we start shipping oil to customers all over the world  And there are other forces at work  including interruptions in oil nations like Iraq  Venezuela and Nigeria  

In that column  Sean talked about five companies that should do well in spite of the turbulent energy market  One company set to benefit most is EOG Resources  NYSE  NYSE EOG  
It has invested heavily in ways to drill more accurately  which saves time and money  This  in turn  makes EOG s wells more productive 
In a recent note  the company told investors that it will profit on some of its production at  30 a barrel 
So  even if prices take another dive  EOG should be able to make money  It s a definite possibility   especially if OPEC can t get a handle on production ",2016-06-12,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-profit-from-the-death-of-opec-200135414,200135414

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

It was a week where both oil and gas prices finished lower 

With earnings remaining front and center  the major headlines came from Royal Dutch Shell plc    and EOG Resources Inc  s    first quarter outperformance despite the dramatic fall in commodity prices 

Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures dived 2 7  to close at  44 66 per barrel  while natural gas prices plunged 3 5  to  2 1010 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

Oil snapped a four week winning streak after the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release showed a 2 8 million barrels rise in crude supplies to an all time high of 543 4 million barrels  Things were further hampered by a soft April jobs data  underlining weak oil demand 

To some extent  these factors were offset by the huge wildfire in Canada and the subsequent production disruption  Additionally support came from the Baker Hughes report that showed another drop in oil directed rigs to a fresh six year low  indicating a break in shale drilling activities 

Natural gas also fared badly following a larger than expected storage injection 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Europe s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported better than expected first quarter earnings on higher production  Shell s upstream volumes averaged 2 828 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   11  higher than the year ago period  While crude oil production increased 16   natural gas output was up 6   Liquids contributed approximately 55  to Shell s total volumes  while natural gas accounted for the remaining portion 

However  the bottom line compared unfavorably with the year ago adjusted profit of  1 17 amid the continued plunge in commodity prices  Shell s worldwide realized liquids and natural gas prices were 36  below their respective year earlier levels 

Amid the challenging industry fundamentals and following the completion of the  54 billion BG Group  LON BG  takeover earlier this year  Shell decided to cut 2016 spending by a further 10  to  30 billion   See More     

2  Notwithstanding sharply lower commodity prices  independent energy explorer EOG Resources Inc  reported narrower than expected weak first quarter 2016 loss  The outperformance came on the back of cost reduction and improving well productivity  In the quarter  EOG s per unit lease and well expenses fell 29   while transportation costs decreased 12  from the prior year period 

Looking to stem the rot from plunging oil and gas prices  EOG has pegged its 2016 capital budget at  2 4  2 6 billion  down 47  from last year s level and 70  less than 2014  Further  the company plans to restrict its expenses to the highest return assets  the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin   See More     

3  U S  energy firm Apache Corp     reported first quarter loss per share   excluding one time items   of 40 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents  The outperformance came on the back of strong North American liquids output and cost savings  which more than offset the plunge in commodity prices 

The production of oil and natural gas  excluding divested assets and non controlling interests  averaged 478 659 oil equivalent barrels per day  BOE d   65  liquids   essentially unchanged from last year 

Apache reiterated its 2016 capital expenditure budget at the previously announced band of  1 4  1 8 billion  Using the midpoint of the range  this represents a 62  reduction from the company s 2015 total capital expenditures  Average proforma production in 2016 is expected to be approximately 438 000 458 000 BOE d  some 5 000 BOE d higher than the original guidance  This was mainly on account of strong North American onshore production   See More     

4  Houston  TX based upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp     posted first quarter adjusted loss of 43 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 47 cents  The better than expected results came thanks to solid production  at the upper end of guidance  and cost control initiatives  However  the bottom line deteriorated from the first quarter 2015 adjusted loss of 37 cents amid a freefall in oil prices 

The company s exploration expenses for the quarter came at  24 million  significantly lower than  90 million in the year earlier quarter  Moreover  Marathon Oil s total quarterly cost and expenses fell 30  to 1 328 million   See More    

5  Independent refiner Tesoro Corp     reported first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of  1 19 per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 04  The bottom line also came higher than the year ago quarter figure of 98 cents  Significant contribution from the marketing segment following considerable consumer demand supported the results  This was negated partially by the plunge in refining margin 

Manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization decreased 12 3  from the year earlier level to  5 55 per barrel  Total refined product sales averaged 952 thousand barrels per day  6  higher than the year ago quarter  Average price realized on product sales fell 26  year over year to  54 79 per barrel and average cost per barrel was down 25  to  48 93 per barrel   See More

168676,390192,EOG,Bad News For Crude Oil Prices  Persian Gulf Refineries,opinion,"The low oil prices engineered by OPEC in the last year are feeding several new Saudi refineries  The oil producing nations of the Persian Gulf have decided to produce petro products  not just crude oil  and this means serious profits for Saudi Aramco and its partners  It also indicates continued low crude oil prices  a negative sign for the U S  shale industry   like EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Halcon Resources  NYSE HK   and Oasis Petroleum  NYSE OAS    and other U S  crude producers like ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Hess  NYSE HES  and Continental Resources  NYSE CLR  
Traditionally  crude oil was not refined in the Middle East  but shipped off in tankers or transported by pipeline to refineries in North America and Western Europe  Only a fraction of local crude oil was refined at the Aramco refinery in Ras Tanura and the British Petroleum refinery at Abadan in Iran  but refinery expansion failed to keep pace with growing crude oil exports  The American and European oil companies that originally ran Persian Gulf oil operations did not invest heavily in refining in the Gulf region  Construction costs were extreme  particularly in undeveloped desert regions like Saudi Arabia  skilled workers hard to come by  and political turmoil was constant  Moreover  the United States had a slew of new refineries left over from World War II  and the Marshall Plan had funded new oil refineries throughout Western Europe so there was no need for additional refining capacity at the time 
Now the tables have been turned and Saudi Arabia  Iran  Kuwait  Bahrain  and the UAE own the oil operations started by Americans and Europeans in their respective countries  Downstream growth has been a priority for Saudi Aramco since 1988  when it first acquired shares in the Motiva Refinery in Texas  Saudi Aramco has held stakes in refineries in South Korea  China  Greece  the Philippines  and India  With ample space in Saudi Arabia and experienced personnel  opening domestic refineries was just the next step in Saudi Aramco s vision of energy diversification and expansion 
The Jubail refinery  a joint operation with Total  NYSE TOT   opened in 2013 and the Yanbu refinery  a joint operation with Sinopec  NYSE SHI  opened in 2014  Each currently processes 400 000 bpd  A third 400 000 bpd refinery in Jazan is currently under construction  Both Kuwait and the UAE are constructing refineries that will begin processing nearly 1 million barrels of oil a day by 2020  Like all major projects  these refineries have experienced setbacks and major delays   but these delays are insignificant in comparison to what is happening in the United States  where no one has built a new refinery since the 1970s 
The impressive growth in Persian Gulf refining means that whether oil prices are high or low  Saudi Aramco  Kuwait Petroleum Co   and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company will be making money  At low crude prices meaning high production rates these countries can both flood the global crude oil market and refine domestically   capturing market share on both fronts 
Moreover  the Gulf countries can sell the refined oil petroleum products at a relatively higher price than the crude  because  1  the refining industry has not caught up to the crude industry growth and similarly increased its capacity  and  2  America s own political decisions have led to a glut of crude and a related need for new refining  Our crude oil export ban  coupled with our stagnant refining capacity have contributed to the glut of crude and the concurrent short supply of refining capacity  This means it is that much more profitable for the Gulf countries to export refined petro products than to simply export crude 
Low oil prices came at exactly the right time for Saudi Arabia s impressive new refining capacity  That should be no surprise  given Saudi Arabia s influence on OPEC  and OPEC s decision to keep pumping last fall  The question investors need to consider is whether OPEC will continue the cheap crude policy in part to continue supplying that crude to refineries owned by OPEC nations ",2015-08-04,"Ellen R.

168677,390193,EOG,Crude Complex Conundrum  U S  Pipeline Issues,opinion,"Third time is a charm as China has reset its currency peg for a third day on the trot  The law of diminishing returns means markets are somewhat insulated from the fear factor of a third day of currency devaluation  while financial markets put on their rose tinted glasses and buy in  literally  to the prospect that this latest attempt from China to stimulate its economy just might work  Hence  global equity markets are looking perky  the dollar is seeing some strength  and crude prices are getting pressured lower once more 
US economic data returns to the fore  with weekly US jobless claims coming in just shy of consensus at 274 000  but no biggie   while tales of retail sales come in better than expected at  0 6   versus 0 5  consensus   Go go gadget rate hikes   
The big conundrum the crude complex is having to deal with here in the US is refinery and pipeline issues in the Midwest  An outage at the Whiting refinery  the largest in the Midwest  could keep 240 000 barrels a day offline for a prolonged period  stoking fears that Cushing stocks could get filled to the brim in the coming months  Meanwhile  the loss of demand for West Canadian Select crude  see below  sees its price plummet to the low  20s   only worsened by a pipeline leak on the Flanagan South in Missouri  although this is expected to re start today  
While we have seen the lagged impact between the falling rig count and the ripple effect to US production play out rather well over the last nine months  North Sea production highlights that investment periods work over a much longer time frame  Hence  as investment in the North Sea has picked up over the last four years to participate in an oil market predominantly spending its time in triple digits  output has risen for two consecutive years  hark  first time since 2000      only to be greeted by oil in forty dollardom  Output is likely to turn south once more in the coming years 

As Canada s crude benchmark  Western Canadian Select  WCS   drops below C 30    23  a barrel  here are some alternatives that you can buy in Alberta for the same amount of money 

The recent precipitous price drop in WCS is not only due to the global rout in oil  but has been exacerbated by a combination of rebounding production after wildfires in the spring  and the aforementioned shutdown of key refineries and pipelines in the U S  Midwest 
Meanwhile  the price of Bakken oil has dropped to  30  While break evens in the original gangster of shale plays run the gamut  apparently a half of wells can generate positive returns at this price level  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   largest shale driller  says it can make a 30  return on  50 oil in its best plays  while Whiting Petroleum Corp   NYSE WLL   largest Bakken producer  says it is ready to grow production above  40 ",2015-08-13,Matt Smith,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-market-currents---august-13,-2015-261590",261590
168678,390194,EOG,Oil Overproduction  Time For An Asset Shopping Spree,opinion,"Despite what you might hear about the  resiliency  of shale oil companies and the technological advances that have made it possible for fracking to turn a profit at lower prices  the fact is that most companies need to sell their oil at around  60 a barrel to make a reliable profit  Given the global glut of oil  it is unlikely that oil will break the  50 a barrel mark soon 
For months  the prevailing belief has been that the longer the price of oil stays low  the more pressure this puts on oil producers to curb supply  This is a fundamentally flawed argument  and neither common sense nor history supports it  In the early 1930s  there was extreme overproduction in Texas  to the point where the price of a barrel of oil dropped to just a few cents  Oil producers lost money on every barrel they sold  but they continued to produce as much as possible because every barrel sold  even at just 6 cents  was more money then they could make not producing at all  Finally  the governor of Texas declared the oil producers in a state of  insurrection  and sent in the Texas National Guard to enforce production quotas  This  of course  resulted in a robust smuggling industry  but ultimately it did raise the price of oil into the  1 a barrel range 
The lesson here is that low oil prices only incentivize struggling operations to produce MORE  not LESS  As long as they have access to credit and financing  they will not decrease production  This is what has happened with shale oil production over the last nine months  However  these sources of capital finally seem to be drying up  and the only avenues left are private equity firms who are now scouring the industry for cheap deals on oil and gas assets  They may even acquire entire companies on the cheap as those firms look to avoid bankruptcy  Reportedly  private equity firms have raised over  100 billion to spend on energy acquisitions  in addition to the  80 billion they have to purchase oil company debt 
The real value in shale oil production is in the assets and the technology  not the companies themselves  When the dust settles  the assets will end up with companies like Noble  NYSE NBL   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Continental Resources  NYSE CLR   Hess  NYSE  HES   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Saudi Aramco  Total  NYSE TOT  and Statoil  NYSE STO   These companies are better capitalized  do not face extreme pressure to produce and sell under any circumstances  and would certainly see 52 000 acres of proven oil resources in south Texas as a better bet than a billion dollar investment in off shore drilling in the arctic circle ",2015-09-08,"Ellen R.

168679,390195,EOG,Oil Patch Problems  Rigs Down 60   Production Down 3 ,opinion,"With every bounce in the price of oil  US producers used enhanced techniques to get more and more oil out of existing wells  So even as rig counts collapsed  production is barely off the highs  at a price that isn t even profitable 
Oil Flirts with  40 Again 


Prices are once again flirting with  40  Crude has not hand a monthly close below  40 since mid 2004  And  40 to  50 is not even profitable  putting producers into a bind 
Oil Patch Problems 
The Wall Street Journal explains  
U S  companies have stunned global rivals by continuing to produce oil particularly from shale deposits ever more cheaply as American crude prices plunged from over  100 a barrel in 2014  But the recent drop toward  40 a barrel and below puts even the most efficient operators in a bind 

 Forty dollar to fifty dollar oil prices don t work in this business   Ryan Lance  chief executive of ConocoPhillips  N COP   the largest independent U S  oil producer  said in an interview 
The worst case scenario most major producers have discussed in the past six weeks with investors involved a price of  50 a barrel  That is beginning to look optimistic as Saudi Arabia continues to produce near record volumes and major exporters such as Iraq have increased output  Many oil executives  including BP PLC CEO Bob Dudley  expect prices to be  lower for longer   The U S  Energy Department is forecasting the price of oil will average around  50 a barrel next year 
Breakeven Price

More than 250 000 people world wide have lost their jobs in the industry over the past year  according to Graves   Co   a Houston consulting firm  Many companies that were hoping to weather low energy prices without new rounds of layoffs and salary cuts may be forced to slash those costs yet again  said Eric Lee  an energy analyst with Citigroup  
 We re really reaching the limit of what people can do   said Allen Gilmer  chief executive of DrillingInfo  an Austin  Texas company that compiles data on tens of thousands of shale wells across North America   Right now  you are down to the best areas  the best rigs  the best people  Any cuts from now on are bone rather than fat  
Earlier this month  EOG Resources Inc  N EOG    a Houston based shale driller  said some of its most prolific wells would yield a rate of return above 40   even with U S  oil prices at  50 a barrel 
But break even prices don t always give the whole picture of how much money a shale company must spend to pump oil and move it to market  They can exclude land costs  which for some companies amount to billions of dollars  and they don t include the cost of using pipelines to transport crude  according to company financial statements and analyst reports 
In nearly all of its investor presentations this year  EOG has said it can turn a profit at prices at or below the prevailing oil price at the time of the presentation  Yet more than  6 billion in capital spending this year has produced nearly  4 billion in net losses over the past year for the company  which is an industry bellwether 
The company  which has said  40 oil is unsustainable  didn t respond to requests for comment 
EOG isn t alone  In the past 12 months  the 24 largest shale companies have reported losses totaling more than  62 billion and many show negative returns

168697,390213,EOG,FRAK In Focus On Obama s New Fracking Rules,opinion,"Oil investing is unlikely to return to its brighter days any time soon  Refusal to cut production by the OPEC and the U S  amid falling demand has dulled oil investing for over eight months  And now  president Obama s new fracking rules have rubbed salts to the wound  read     In a bid to be more environmentally friendly  the White House apparently unleashed some benchmarks for oil companies  fracking on federal lands on March 20  The new set of standards on hydraulic fracturing has been proposed for the first time in 30 years  According to the Bureau of Land Management  the new standards require oil and gas drillers operating on federal lands to reveal the chemicals used in fracking  The companies will also have to endure tougher measures in both constructing wells and disposing waste water afterward  Hydraulic fracturing  commonly known as fracking  is a process by which water  sand and chemicals are pimped into a well for extraction of oil or gas  However this process   which poses hazards to health   is highly debated by environmentalists  Energy companies already suffering from losses due to low oil prices were obviously against these rules Market Impact Investors should note that these rules hold good only for wells operating on federal and Indian land which accounts only for 11  of gas drilling and 5  of oil drilling in the U S  Probably thanks to such meager exposure  energy ETFs were still not hugely hurt following the announcement  though these were down on Monday trading  In fact  the U S  states could regulate fracking taking cues from the set standards since they administer a large portion of the country s fracking  This points to another dark cloud over the energy space due as Obama sets new rules  Notably  while energy players are agitated by this interference  environmentalists believed that the regulations are smaller in size  While many energy ETFs could be losers in the days ahead  a pure play on the unconventional energy world   MarketVectors Unconv  Oil   Gas  NYSE FRAK    is surely an energy ETF to keep an eye on for the future  see all  here  FRAK in Detail  This ETF provides exposure to the unconventional oil and gas segment  which includes coal bed methane  coal seam gas  shale oil   gas  and the sands market  This fund follows the Market Vectors Global Unconventional Oil   Gas Index  holding 68 stocks in the basket  Volume and AUM are quite low for this large cap focused fund while the expense ratio is 0 54   read     The top three components include Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   Occidental Petroleum Corporation  NYSE OXY  and EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  with a combined share of nearly 23  of total assets  Exploration   production takes the top spot in terms of sector exposure  while oil   gas integrated contribute decently as well  The ETF has lost 4  in the year to date time frame  as of March 23  2015  and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 5  Strong Sell  with a High risk outlook Other ETFs to Suffer As per   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR  and Sanchez Energy Corporation  NYSE SN  are some of the energy companies vulnerable to the new rules  So ETFs like Vanguard Energy  NYSE VDE   iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE  and Fidelity MSCI Energy Index  NYSE FENY  might come under pressure as XOM takes more than 20  exposure in each of these

168698,390214,EOG,Shell BG  Just The First In Series Of M A Deals,opinion,"Back in February  I predicted that the current crisis in oil prices would cause consolidation in the industry  with smaller companies being consumed by the energy majors 
After all  these energy giants are the only ones with deep enough pockets  valuable shares  and access to capital 
Sure enough  last week  Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  announced its plans to buy BG Energy  OTC BRGYY  
But that s just the beginning 
Shell s move is the first shot fired in what s sure to be an all out merger and acquisition  M A  war 
And while it may appear at the outset that some will overpay  companies like Shell  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  have solid 20  to 30 year plans 
That means low oil prices for one or two years may prove tough initially  But it s really just a blip in this industry that s used to the cycles of commodity prices 
The only question now is  who s next 
Making Allies
Shell offered a whopping 50  premium over BG s share price close of  13 59 on April 7 
While that premium appears rich  it s not compared to the share price from a few years ago  which traded for more than  30  and last year s prices  which were well over  20 as recently as September 2014 

Shell paid a pretty penny  but I don t think it overpaid  if you look ahead to the next 10 years  And I m sure Shell will do a good job of exploiting BG s strengths 
Shell has spent more than  56 billion in recent years bolstering its natural gas position 
It has properties all over the world  particularly in U S  shale regions  BG not only adds to that position  but it also gives Shell something else  a solid global liquid natural gas  LNG  player 
With BG  the company will increase its LNG capacity by more than 70  over the next three years  This is something Shell has been trying to accomplish for a number of years  and with good reason 
You see  LNG is becoming more and more important to integrated majors  like Shell  as steadily rising oil prices from a year ago forced countries  particularly in Asia  to look to LNG as an alternate energy source 
Last year  Shell reported that the majority of its net income   more than  11 5 billion   was derived from LNG and related operations  Of course  low crude oil prices skewed those results heavily 
Time will reveal whether or not Shell overpaid for BG  For now  the timing looks good 
Shell was able to take advantage of lower energy prices and make a lower bid than the company would have just a few months ago  Interest rates are very low  making the cost of financing very cheap 
And as for paying a premium  That is not unusual in any acquisition  unless the company being acquired is in trouble 
By going after BG so strongly  what Shell has done  though  is fired a shot across the bow of the other majors  The message being that Shell sees long term value in many of these companies at current prices 
Who Should You Stand With 
Unfortunately for Shell  the market doesn t seem to agree yet  as the price of the company is still trading just off its 52 week lows 
Still  the other majors are most likely taking the message seriously  I think we ll be seeing a lot more M A activity soon 
If you re looking to take positions  you may want to stay on the  A  side of things by investing in companies that may be acquired 
There are certainly a lot to choose from  But  as the Shell deal demonstrated  the big deals can bring in a lot of cash  so there s no need to focus on small or micro caps 
At the top of my list of big targets is EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   which is currently sporting a market cap of around  45 billion  What makes EOG so attractive is its best in class properties in the top shale regions  pristine balance sheet  and savvy management team 
Second  I like Australia s Woodside Petroleum  OTC WOPEY   a very well capitalized LNG player that serves the Asian and European markets  Woodside shares have been hit by slumping prices and a weakened Australian dollar  making it a prime victim of a takeover from a deep pocketed  U S  dollar based major 
The longer oil   and energy prices in general   remains depressed  the better the deals are going to be 
There are a lot of backroom negotiations going on right now  and cash is king

168701,390217,EOG,Is Now The Time To Buy Big Oil ,opinion,"This market is not one I m overly interested in buying in size  There are simply too many red flags for our fundamental  value driven style of investing 

Valuations are well above the level at which we like to buy  Buying high and planning to sell to a greater fool at a price that s even higher has never worked for me 
The bull is old  it could grow older gracefully  but sooner or later all things must die  gracefully or not 
We have just concluded the market s traditionally strongest season  That doesn t mean anything in some years but in more years than not  historically  the summer doldrums are real enough that Wall Street makes a big deal about not missing  The Summer Rally  
QE is gone  The Fed doesn t dare reinstate it  that would be admitting the US economy cannot stand on its own 
Global offerings may be better than the US  but are still only so so  We ve even placed trailing stops under our European and emerging market holdings 
China is on a knife edge  with investors actually believing the fabricated numbers from China  Sooner or later the truth will out 
Investor sentiment  usually wrong at major turning points  is way too optimistic 

Still  there are a few things I am willing to hold for myself and our clients even through a decline  Oil prices may take yet another dip  and take oil and gas stocks down with them  Knowing that we cannot possibly catch the exact highs or exact lows  in times of market over exuberance if there is a quality sector providing an essential product that has already been in its own private bear market hell  it is likely the best place to begin our search for value 
Three oil and gas top tier firms come immediately to mind  Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa   we prefer the RDSb shares   Total Petroleum  NYSE TOT  and BP  NYSE BP   That s not to disparage their even larger brethren  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   but those two have not fallen as much  If they should  they ll be on our buy list as well 
When I discuss big oil  I don t include any Russian or Chinese firms which are de facto state owned or oligarch owned  leaving individual investors with little say   Many investors believe some other big foreign oils are owned by their own governments  The French government  for instance  once held just over a third of Total  a figure that is now just 1   less than many mutual funds  
The benefit of sticking with these major integrated energy firms is that we have virtually zero risk of default or bankruptcy  No matter how low oil prices tumble  their diversification into both upstream  exploration and production  and downstream  refining and distribution retail sales  keeps them in good stead  When oil and gas prices are high  they make the most money  of course  But even when prices of the commodity itself are low  that just reduces the big integrated firms  cost of feedstock for their refineries and chemicals and plastics businesses 
If the market continues to leap ahead this year  it s likely these companies will be carried along with the general euphoria  and with considerably less volatility than most other stocks along the way  If the market is flat  they ll likely stay roughly where they are  though a serious elevator shaft drop in oil prices would force us to remind ourselves daily that these are long term investments   And if the market is down but oil doesn t plunge to Citicorp s projection of  20 a barrel  they will bump along  paying us more than 5 5  each to stick with them 
Let s take a look at each of these three favorites of mine  then briefly mention the next tier down 
Wall Street is all agog over the idea that BP is a wounded bird and some clever hawk like Exxon Mobil or Chevron will swoop in and make us all rich via a possible takeover  I suppose it could happen but I was in London last week and I can assure you that the current government of the UK considers BP to be a national treasure  strictly off limits to any takeover 
Mr  Cameron et al have been quite clear that they consider BP their franchise player  OK  he didn t use the term  franchise player   but you get the idea  When one company resists another s advances  they may lose  But when a sovereign government says no  they can tie you up for years and make it clear that you will be far the worse for wear  The British are a very civil people  well mannered and kind to a fault  But if you rile them  you will be reminded that these pleasant folk are descendants of decidedly truculent Picts  Celts  Scots  Angles  Saxons  Jutes  Belgics  Bretons  Vikings  Normans and Britons  Unless the Brits decide on their own to allow BP to be acquired  I don t think there is a company quite up for this fight  So  perhaps alone among analysts  I am buying BP on the fundamentals  not any takeover rumors 
All three companies have a higher weighted average cost of capital  WACC  than their return on capital  ROC  for the past quarter or two  of course  but longer term  over the past five years  BP s ROC has averaged 14   well above its mid single digit WACC   and that includes the entire time after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon fiasco  This event caused BP to divest significant assets but did not include a sizable retrenchment from the USA  Although BP is clearly a British firm  its largest employee base and biggest investments remain in the US  BP is a company with  359 billion in revenues as of 2014 
More than half the liabilities from Deepwater Horizon have been dealt with  and the remainder may yet be reduced  Anyone avoiding BP because they believe the maximum of  18 billion in remaining possible civil fines and liabilities  subject to downward revision  will drive the company into the ground are mistaken  More importantly  we are pleased to own both shares in and options on a fine company at a fine price 

Total is France s largest company by revenues  about  235 billion  depending upon where the euro is when you read this   though the chart above does not reflect this updated amount  and is France s entr e into the world of the energy super majors  Embracing French style bureaucracy wholeheartedly  TOT has  at last count  898 subsidiaries   In fairness  every time they enter into a joint venture or extend their finance arm into a new nation  they set up separate subsidiaries  
What sets Total apart is its decision to embrace LNG  The company now has LNG projects in Indonesia  Qatar  the United Arab Emirates  Oman  Nigeria  Norway  Russia  Yemen  Angola and Australia  If Europe is ever to break the stranglehold of Russian natural gas  I believe it will be because they have built the essential infrastructure for LNG  Total seems to agree with me   By the way  the first LNG re gasification plant in Europe is just now up and running in Lithuania   with LNG supplied by our old favorite and portfolio holding Statoil  NYSE STO   
Now we come to Royal Dutch Shell  under fire recently for its decision to pay up for BG Group  LONDON BG  to the tune of roughly  70 million  Many analysts believe Shell is overpaying for BG  I m not so sure  Shell has a couple dozen huge projects that will be bringing in substantial revenue in 3 5 years  its problem is immediate cash flow  That s something BG can provide from its current operations  Further  BG is a great fit for Shell in that Shell has made the geostrategic decision that the developed world and  increasingly  China  India and other emerging nations want nothing to do with coal 
Natural gas is the  well   natural  alternative  being much cleaner burning and more environmentally acceptable  So Shell is hitching it s wagon to two spirited horses  deepwater drilling  where elephant fields may yet produce massive gains  and natural gas  specifically  like TOT  LNG  This deal rockets Shell  already the 4th largest company in the world by revenues  as of 2014  way ahead of Total and  for that matter  Exxon and Chevron  in racing to build large market share in the LNG arena 
As China  India and others move toward cleaner burning fuels like natural gas instead of coal  this is a gamble that Asian markets will come to rely on U S  exports of the product  when the first shipments leave the country expected sometime later this year   Exxon estimates that global LNG will triple through 2040  to some 100 billion cubic feet a day  which would be half again the entire current U S  gas output  It s a gamble   but I believe it is a smart one 
Whether it makes rational sense or not  the rush is on to demonize the fossil fuels that light  cool and heat our homes and offices and allow us to transport cool stuff from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to our front doorstep  Oxford University students just got Oxford to consider divesting it s oil and gas companies  Stanford University has already begun the process  as has the World Council of Churches  Just yesterday the Church of England agreed to divest all coal and oil sands firms  The fire sale is on  I m happy to benefit long term from this short term thinking   
Who Is Next After BG 
Of course  there are plenty of other firms just below the top tier  weakened by low oil and gas prices  that are likely to be considered by the super majors as they decide that it is cheaper to buy proven reserves in the stock market than it is to wildcat for more reserves in unproven areas 
I have no inside information  of course  but if I were to take a wild guess as to which companies might be big enough to make a difference to the big integrated firms and still cheap enough to swallow without indigestion  I would have to include companies like Apache  NYSE APA   Anadarko  NYSE APC   Hess  NYSE HES   Marathon  NYSE MRO   Suncor  NYSE SU   Occidental  NYSE OXY   Devon  NYSE DVN   EOG  NYSE EOG   Canadian Natural Resources  NYSE CNQ   Noble Energy  NYSE NBL   EnCana  NYSE ECA   Cenovus  NYSE CVE   and Canadian Oil Sands Limited  TO COS OTC COSWF  
Conoco  NYSE COP  would be a big gulp even for an Exxon or Chevron  but it s still a distant possibility  And my favorite next level oil and gas firm  Statoil  STO  is effectively controlled by the Norwegian government and Norwegian sovereign wealth fund   if they don t want to see anyone buy it  they could easily block the attempt  If you are interested in any of these you might consider the speculation of buying calls if and as prices decline once again  That s my plan

168718,390234,EOG,Where s The Support For Oil Prices ,opinion,"For the first time since 2010  the average price of a gallon of gas in the United States has fallen below  3  according to AAA s Daily Fuel Gauge Report  An estimated  40 billion will be saved this year alone  That s money that can be put toward other expenses bigger cars  children s education  retirement and investing  But that discount comes with a price  Cheap gas might help consumers and companies in certain industries  but they re a drag on oil producers  retailers and entire nations  This affects everyone  We live in a global economy  after all  Since June  crude oil has tumbled 30 percent to prices we haven t seen in about three years  For the past 20 days and 60 days  it s down about two standard deviations  We can blame this dip on a number of things  geopolitics  the slowing of real GDP growth across the globe  a huge oil surplus here in the U S  and a strong dollar  The strength of the dollar  as you can see  has historically had an inverse relationship with the price of oil  Recent cuts to our military budget have also affected oil prices  The U S  military uses more oil than any other institution on earth  Every year it consumes over 100 million barrels to fuel ships  aircraft and other vehicles  but that number is dropping at the same time supply is rising 
Meet the Frackers
Because of the success of unconventional extraction methods such as fracking  the U S  s production level is at a 25 year high  What would the rate of depletion be if fracking were no longer profitable at  70 or  60 per barrel and production had to be halted  There s no definitive answer to that question because it s not clear how many companies would be affected and to what extent  But what should be clear is that reserves would begin to shrink and we would go back to the days of an overreliance on foreign oil 
Below are the estimated breakeven points for some of the most important shale plays in the U S  With crude currently priced at slightly under  80 per barrel  many companies  especially those that practice fracking  are starting to feel the pinch  Each play has its own unique set of challenges  one of the most significant being the region s geology  As you can imagine  the harder it is to get the crude out of the ground  the costlier it becomes  Some analysts believe that approximately a third of all U S  shale oil producers operate in the red when the price per barrel falls below  80  At  70 a barrel  these producers will need to make drastic changes such as production cuts and layoffs  According to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie  If WTI prices were below  70 for most of 2015  we predict that around 0 6 million b d  barrels per day  of U S  tight oil supply growth would be under serious threat by the end of the year a figure which would continue to increase with low prices  And if crude were to fall to  60 per barrel  An estimated 80 percent of U S  companies that extract tight oil  or shale oil  through fracking would be shut down and all new supply would diminish quickly due to the rapid decline rate  Already  oil producers must contend with the challenge of decreased production  When a well is first drilled  it might begin producing  but  throughout the year  gradually decline between 5 and 20 percent  By the end of the year  the site is producing only around 100 barrels a day  Oil producers are often able to recoup exploration and production costs in that time frame  but then it s necessary to move on to the next drill site  Unconventional extraction methods accelerate the decline rate  If frackers were forced to halt production now  our reserves would dwindle even more rapidly  It s critical that America keeps running on this treadmill  so to speak  The results of stopping now would be similar to those of a workout buff who suddenly quits going to the gym  We all know how much harder it is to get back in shape than it is to stay in shape  Layoffs would especially hurt  given that the tight oil revolution has significantly contributed to the U S  s economic recovery  Think not just of general oilfield roustabouts but also geoscientists  petroleum engineers and the thousands of other incidental professionals who face losing their jobs if prices continue to slip  Meanwhile  people continue to have babies  drive their vehicles to work and heat their homes  all of which requires oil  And there s reason to believe that we ll especially need oil for heating this winter  Already an intense storm even larger than Superstorm Sandy  Typhoon Nuri  is moving west along Alaska s Aleutian Islands and is expected to bring freezing temperatures to much of the northern part of the U S  It looks as if winter has arrived earlier than normal this year  For the time being  however  we can all enjoy lower gas prices this year  With the money saved  we can make better investment decisions  It s as if we received an unexpected tax break  Lower gas prices leads to more consumer spending  which means that luxury goods stocks such as Tiffany   Co  might benefit  Speaking of Tiffany   Co   did you know that buying the company s stock in 1987  the year it went public  would have been a better investment than buying an actual diamond  You can read about it  
Enter the Saudis  Who Will Blink First 
Many of the world s major oil producing countries are also feeling the pressure of low prices  Of those shown below  only four Oman  Kuwait  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are still able to balance their books with Brent oil flirting with  80 a barrel  Here s where geopolitics comes into play  Russia is currently the second largest oil exporter in the world and set to overtake Saudi Arabia very soon  This might help explain why the Saudis aren t in any hurry to limit their own production and support prices  They have everything to lose and nothing to gain by reducing output  They re in a better position to maintain current levels and still be profitable with  80 oil than Russia  the U S  and most of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   The kingdom has already lowered the price of the oil it exports to the U S   a sign that it s aiming to undercut the competition and hang on to its status as the world s top exporter  As oil and gas policy expert Dr  Kent Moors argues in  Saudi Arabia is fighting a losing battle against three fronts  Russia  over control of the Asian market  neighboring OPEC members such as Iraq and Iran  and the U S   a market the Saudis don t want to lose to more efficient fracking companies here in America  And  of course  the U S  and Russia are locked in their own energy skirmish  one that Casey Research s Marin Katusa calls The Colder War  the title to his latest book  OPEC officials will be meeting later this month  and hopefully an agreement can be reached  During our  Brian Hicks  portfolio manager of our Global Resources Fund  PSPFX   emphasized the point that the current price of oil just isn t sustainable  I would be surprised if we did not see another production cut if oil remains at these levels  I think that OPEC and the Saudis need to come in and support prices even more so than they already have following the cut in August 
One Word  Plastics
Just as consumers have benefited from sliding oil prices  so too have many companies  including those in the transportation sector  Below you can see that near the start of September  the oil and gas industry decoupled from the transportation sector  composed of airline  trucking  delivery services  railroad and marine transportation companies  Currently there s more than a 35 point spread between the Dow Jones Transportation Average and SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration and Production ETF  NYSE XOP   Manufacturers of plastics and synthetic rubber  of which crude is the main component  have also benefited  The U S  producer price of plastics and rubber products is up  1 20 year to date  In 30 days  Cooper Tire   Rubber  NYSE CTB  has shot up 13 percent  Berry Plastics  NYSE BERY  14 percent  Goodyear Tire   Rubber  NASDAQ GT  15 percent  Royal Dutch Shell A  NYSE RDSa   on the other hand  has given back 5 percent  This is precisely why we re attracted to low cost oil producers such as EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  and Devon Energy Corporation  NYSE DVN   Many  but not all  of them are nimbler and more adaptable in uncertain economic climates than the big names are  We strive to buy only those that have been well screened and fit our models  Late last month I noted that the  because its monetary and fiscal policies are sorely out of balance  The region relies too much on punitive taxes and entitlement spending and not enough on stimulation  Right now its GDP growth rate is a sluggish 0 1 percent  its inflation rate 0 4 percent  I suggested that the eurozone should look to China to see how it s handling its own slowdown the government has cut hundreds of lines of regulation and plans to cut more but members of the European Union  and especially the European Central Bank  ECB   might also do well to look to China s neighbor  Japan  A week ago the Bank of Japan  BOJ  surprisingly unveiled a gargantuan  724 billion a year stimulus package to combat deflation  The monetary measure will essentially turn the BOJ s governor  Haruhiko Kuroda  into the world s largest hedge fund manager  The market seemed to like the announcement  as the Nikkei 225 has risen 3 percent since then

168719,390235,EOG,Record Natural Gas Production Keeps Pressure On Prices,opinion,"The supply glut from the shale drilling bonanza meant that October was another record setting month for U S  natural gas production from the Lower 48 states 
As per the latest report from Bentek Energy   the forecasting unit of Platts   October natural gas production was up 1 2  from September to 69 9 billion cubic feet per day  Bcf d   the highest monthly average ever  In fact  the October output was 6  higher year over year  while hitting a daily record of 70 9 Bcf on the 24th of the month  Thanks to the emergence of major shale plays yielding impressive results  Bentek analysis further estimates that average domestic natural gas supply will climb to 67 9 Bcf d in 2014  To put things in perspective  U S  production was averaging just 55 1 Bcf d in 2009  only five years back The Shale Revolution Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer  With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking    a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance Growing Demand Supply Imbalance Pressurizes Price While October becomes the tenth consecutive record breaking month of 2014 in terms of natural gas output  the commodity s demand has failed to keep pace with this rapid supply surge  Industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past two years with demand rising by a meager 0 5 Bcf per day in both 2012 and 2013  The result  Prices continue to suffer Though natural gas has staged a decent rally over the last few weeks on speculation of strong heating demand in key U S  markets due to chilly early winter weather  they still remain way off earlier highs

168720,390236,EOG,U S  Set To Be The New Swing Producer,opinion,"Just a decade ago  Saudi Arabia maintained unequivocal power over oil prices 
As the largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries     it has the power to turn the spigot off and on during oil crashes and rebounds  essentially dictating the price of oil in the global market 
But it seems the Saudis are tiring of this role  And now  the United States is ready to take control 
Heavy Is the Head That Wears the Crown
As the chart below shows  Saudi Arabia is still the dominant producer of oil within OPEC  It has the ability to produce more oil to temper prices or cut production to bolster prices 

Most recently  the Saudis used this power to flood the market and spark the oil crash  along with the other members of OPEC  in an effort to eliminate competition from the United States 
This ability to efficiently turn on or off production makes them the  swing producer  
But the swing producer also tends to get the short end of the stick 
You see  if OPEC were to reduce output to keep prices high for everyone  they d lose part of their market share to other  less efficient producers who are not reducing production  but are still benefiting from the effect of higher prices 
The Saudis have been signaling for some time that they are fed up with the role 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al Naimi expressed his country s frustration with the situation in an exclusive interview with the Middle East Economic Survey earlier this year 
 Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output  while the producer of poor efficiency continues to produce  That is crooked logic  If I reduce  what happens to my market share  The price will go up  and the Russians  the Brazilians   and  U S  shale oil producers will take my share   said Al Naimi 
Saudi Arabia saw the rise of shale oil from the United States and realized that it would  once again  have to lose market share in order to stay profitable 
Thus  OPEC s refusal to cut production and keep prices high is a clear message that Saudi Arabia is done with being the swing producer 
The Saudis are hoping that prices will stay low long enough that marginal shale producers go out of business  and that those strong enough to survive will take on the role of swing producer and cut production 
And what country has been gaining ground in the oil market lately  The United States  of course 
Long Live the New King 
While the shale revolution in the United States is in full swing  it s still quite early in the game 
You see  U S  oil production growth wasn t expected to peak until the mid 2020s  And that might be pushed back a bit now  as the U S  shale producers begin to temper exploration and production until prices recover 
However  it doesn t change the fact that the United States has the ability to ramp up production  or as we are seeing today  delay or defer production  as a group  at the drop of a hat  And the number of producers is such that we can affect global supplies  and thus prices  almost as quickly as OPEC 
Yes  the United States is ready to assume the mantle of swing producers 
This realization is putting pressure on prices 
You see  many producers  like EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA   have announced lower capital spending going forward or the intention to keep production at the same level until prices recover   essentially keeping the spigot flow steady instead of turning it on full blast  But the world oil markets just aren t buying it 
The reason is that there are now two entities that can turn on the oil spigot at a moment s notice  and produce significant and measurable quantities of oil  should prices increase  Not to mention that without an increase in global demand  the price of oil isn t going to stage a miracle recovery 
The Saudis and OPEC do have the ability to cut production  which many within the cartel are clamoring for  as does the United States 
But this time  the Saudis recognize that it s in their best interest to wait this out and hope that enough shale production is cut back or that U S  producers decide to permanently moderate production growth in return for higher prices  Barring a surge in global demand  this process could be protracted  and so could the slump in prices ",2015-03-05,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-set-to-be-the-new-swing-producer-244021,244021
168721,390237,EOG,Has Moore s Law Finally Taken Hold In The Oil Industry ,opinion,"Something new is happening in oil markets  Despite the doom and gloom  you need to prepare for the coming surge One of the subtlest  most effective moves in sports is the head fake  It s a thing of beauty when done well  In the energy commodity business  it can be disastrous to anyone who falls for it  Right now  everyone is focused on low crude oil prices  and the subsequent layoffs and rig shutdowns that follow  I say it s a head fake  because too many companies are buying into the narrative and scurrying for cover  while the smart money slips past them to victory  In the past  a downward move of 50  would have spelled disaster for the oil and gas industry  This time  a convergence of new factors suggests a different view of what s happening  If you can read between the lines  you can seize your share of opportunities now  while prices are down  and march into the next cycle well ahead of your competition  
The news gets better the closer you look
Despite lower prices and dire news  particularly in the American oil markets  the fundamentals generally point to a flurry of need  If oil prices can merely get back to the  60  70 a barrel range in the next 12 month  and stay there for a reasonable period of time  U S  production is poised to respond  Certainly  many wells have shut down  Headcount has been reduced  But  the infrastructure is there to pick up the pace at a moment s notice  The recent volatility has created a much leaner breed of competitor  And from a logistics standpoint  a multitude of options have emerged   including rail  barge and tankers  to name a few   mostly over the past five years  In 2015  oil field  drilling and information technology have combined to create a perfect storm of capability and agility that will allow American oil markets to respond with a speed typically only seen in the digital realm  
Production is not dropping
The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  recently reported that oil production in the lower 48 states is stable  despite expected near term reductions in in rig count  The report says   Other key factors include the efficiency of drilling the rate of decline in production from existing wells  and changes in the amount of time between the start of drilling and the completion of the well   As little as five years ago  it could take as long as nine months to get oil out of the ground  Today  thanks to rapid advances in drilling and information technology  it now takes no longer than 30 days to see results  You can literally go on holiday at the start of the process and come back to a producing well  just like that  What s more  because production has not dropped  the need for transport to market has not dropped  Oil tankers  pipelines  rail systems and the tracking technology behind these modes have all gotten more sophisticated in the past five years  As a result  there may be no better time to be in the global oil transportation business  
Moore s Law arrives in the oil sector
As in many businesses  the 80 20 rule applies  Sixteen per cent of the wells in operation across North America account for 82  of the oil produced  And  generally speaking  production is up  It is the abundance of supply that is placing downward pressure on prices  with supply growth outside of OPEC nations growing at the fastest rate  According to the International Energy Agency  non OPEC countries produced 1 9 million more barrels per day in 2014 than they did a year ago  with the U S  leading the way at 1 1 million barrels  As producers become more efficient  the number of rigs required to yield the same amount of production naturally drops  So  while the industry freely announces sensational rig count reductions  little to no impact on actual production is seen  That s because the industry is taking this opportunity to shutdown low performing rigs  In the case of the Eagle Ford region  one of the most prolific in North America  rigs are producing at a rate 18 times more efficiently than they were in 2008  and 65 percent more efficiently than they were in 2013  Technology is whitewashing old school rules  In many ways  Moore s Law has finally arrived in the oil patch  Moore s Law  if you are not familiar  was introduced by Gordon Moore  one of the founders of Intel  who  in the 1960s observed that small improvements in technology over time led to a doubling of the density of transistors each year  The numbers exhibited in the Eagle Ford alone suggest that technology is accelerating the capabilities in oil field production by at least that pace  if not greater  As the months unfold  advancements in pad drilling and rig mobility  among other breakthroughs  will only ensure more of the same  rendering rig counts as a measure of industry health obsolete  
Wells produce more  faster
It is not unusual  considering advancements in the way wells are drilled in present day  for production rates at any given site to peak early and yield faster than in the past  The peaks are nearly three times higher than they were just five years ago  creating enhanced production rates  even during decline  due to drilling efficiencies realized by more effective horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing practices  Again  to cite the Eagle Ford as an example  the EIA reports that first year decline rates in the region fluctuated between 60  and 70  between 2009 and 2013  while second year rates steadily increased to nearly 50  for wells drilled more recently   A recent Wall Street Journal article supports the notion  stating that EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  reported 4 3 days to drill an average well in the Eagle Ford Shale   down from 14 2 days in 2012   Clearly  the ability to locate wells that promise higher oil output  combined with the speed at which wells reach peak production  is supporting a quality versus quantity approach to the oil and gas business that can be directly traced to improvements in technology  These advancements make it possible for oil companies to turn a profit  even at today s depressed market prices  as the cost of producing oil continues to fall in step  
So have oil prices hit rock bottom 
The question  in light of recent production efficiencies  is moot  Writes Leonardo Maugeri of Harvard University s Belfer Center   the truth is that U S  shale production can be turned on and off almost immediately   This  according to Pulitzer Prize winning author  Daniel Yergin  positions the U S  as the world s new  swing producer   a tag used to describe Saudi Arabia  for its ability to offset prices fluctuations with a counter in production  effectively  swinging  the market out of a boom or bust   So  if prices are moot  how are you  as a market player  reacting to the media s obsession with low oil prices and industry layoffs  Are you falling for the head fake  Or  are you sacking the opportunity while it s right in front you  I believe that there will be two camps who emerge from the current industry cycle characterized by depressed oil prices  those who curtail their innovation and shrink their business in lock step with the price of oil  as has been the practice during prior oil busts   and those who take advantage of the opportunity to trim the fat  beef up on technology and position themselves for aggressive growth when the cycle ultimately breaks  Do you have the speed and agility to get your product to market efficiently  Are you able to take a macro view of your transport options and create margin  literally in the margins  Where can you tighten your timelines  Improve operational efficiency  Reduce risk exposure and expand the upside  Now is the time to inspect and assess your technology assets  prepare for increased volume and business complexity  and sunset your old way of doing things  If you lay the right foundation now  you ll be ready to run for daylight the moment the pendulum swings  Disclosure  Mark Hill is a vice president of Allegro Development Corporation  based in Dallas ",2015-03-05,Mark Hill,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-moore's-law-arrived-in-the-oil-industry-244055,244055
168746,390262,EOG,Oil Stocks Well Positioned For Gains,opinion,"If there s one sector of the stock market still poised for more capital gains  it has to be in domestic Oil and gas producers 
This sector continues to be a top wealth creator  Most of the action is in the junior and mid tier producers  as well as the limited partnerships focused on storage and distribution 
On the other hand  large  integrated producers are running into oil equivalent production issues  Both Exxon Mobil Corporation  XOM  and Chevron Corporation  CVX  are good examples  as they are currently dealing with declining production as new projects have yet to come on stream 
EOG Resources  Inc   EOG  is a large cap oil and gas producer with an excellent track record of wealth creation for shareholders  In the past  this stock has gotten ahead of itself  but it is still very much a growth story 
The stock s been getting upgraded after reporting excellent financial and production growth in the first quarter  The position s already been a huge winner  but within the numbers  there is still very meaningful growth in domestic  U S   crude oil production 
U S  first quarter production of crude oil grew an impressive 45  to 258 1 thousand barrels of oil per day  MBbld   up from 178 3 MBbld in the first quarter of 2013 
Natural gas production also improved in the first quarter but grew at a lesser rate of 20  comparatively  including U S  and Canadian volumes  
For a large cap resource company  it s worth taking a closer look at EOG s numbers  Its balance sheet is in very good shape with tons of cash on the books  And its net cash provided by operating activities soared in the most recent quarter 
EOG s 10 year stock chart is featured below

Resource investing is fraught with so many risks  the most important being the value of the underlying commodity being produced  
Precious metals stocks are stuck with spot prices in consolidation and industry wide rising costs  But in domestic oil production  the kicker is that technology and horizontal drilling continues to be the big story  Growth by the drill bit is an investment theme with legs until the end of this decade 
And the fundamentals remain attractive  The cost of capital for domestic oil producers is cheap  and with share prices buoyant  debt and equity financing is flowing 
It s a good time to be in the oil business  and stocks like EOG are well positioned for more capital gains 
The company had a really good first quarter  with net operating revenues growing 22  to  4 08 billion  while earnings grew 34  to  661 million 
Management raised its 2014 full year crude oil production growth goal to 29  from its previous 27   The company is ramping up drilling in its four main operating sectors  the Rocky Mountains  the South Texas Eagle Ford  the North Dakota Bakken  and the Delaware Basin 
Even though this oil stock has already done extremely well  it boasts tremendous potential over the next several quarters with new drilling results awaited by the Street 
Last year  EOG s revenues and earnings really took off from what was already a good growth story  It s likely that the trend will continue

168747,390263,EOG,Is It Too Late To Enter The Hot Oil Sector ,opinion,"The spot price of oil is holding up and there are countless oil stocks pushing their highs 
If the 1990s were the decade for technology stocks  then the 2010s are the decade for independent oil producers 
While the largest integrated oil and gas companies are struggling to grow production  mid tier  independent producers are filling the gap  and there are countless growth stories in the marketplace 
EOG Resources  Inc   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG   has been a top stock market performer and is likely to continue ticking higher  The company has net proven reserves of some 2 119 million barrels of oil equivalent  of which 94  is located in the United States 
Of the company s total 2013 production  88  came from the U S  and Canada  representing a nine percent gain over 2012 
First quarter 2014 earnings were  661 million  compared to  495 million in the first quarter of 2013 
The company s total crude oil and condensate production rose 42  over the comparable quarter last year  and management has significant hedges  locking in oil prices just under  100 00 a barrel  Approximately 30  of North American natural gas production is hedged for the remainder of 2014 at a weighted average price of  4 55 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  
The Street expects EOG Resources to grow its revenues by about 17  this year and about seven percent in 2015 
Previously in these pages  we looked at Cimarex Energy Co   NYSE XEC   which has been very strong on the stock market since the beginning of February  
This oil and gas growth story is slowing  but the company is still expected to grow its full year 2014 revenues by approximately 30  and all bets are off if oil prices start moving towards  110 00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  
And this is the fundamental investment risk with all resource investing everything is tied to the spot price of the underlying commodity 
It s as if speculating in resources has twice the investment risk of your basic startup  All s well if the spread on the spot price is large enough to pay for the debt required to produce the commodity 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  has been on a tear lately  The position was  65 00 a share four months ago  now it s  80 00 
Currently sporting a 3 5  dividend yield  this global energy producer has doubled in value on the stock market over the last four years  And this does not include all the dividends paid 
ConocoPhillips has a very good track record of increasing its dividends  and considering its historical track record  it will soon be time for another 
For those who are interested  there s definitely room for some exposure to energy in a balanced equity market portfolio 
But there s no rush to do so  A good entry price should be the goal  which is more difficult now  as the juniors and mid tier oil producers are mostly fully valued 
One popular energy company that s recently been in consolidation  however  is Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation  NYSE COG   This position has been very hot the last few years  but it s still a major growth story  so it will be interesting to see where the share price goes  It s definitely a stock worth having on your radar now

168748,390264,EOG,Energy Independence  Financial Fact Or Political Fiction  ,opinion,"It has been more than a year since Citigroup Inc  published  Energy 2020  Independence Day   outlining the impacts of progress toward North American energy self sufficiency  For this special 4th of July edition of The Energy Report  we reached out to experts in the energy investing space for an update on how recent political events and production trends in the field impact our ability to produce what we use  For Porter Stansberry  Marin Katusa  Chris Martenson  Bill Powers and Cactus Schroeder  the prospects for the future and the associated investing opportunities depend on the perspective 
The Energy Report  In light of the conflict in Ukraine and Iraq  is U S  energy independence more important than ever 
Porter Stansberry  Energy self sufficiency is a political issue  not an economic one  There is no particular advantage to being energy  independent   Yes  it is important to have enough production capacity to sustain our economy in the event of a global or trade war  but that s also true for many other products  such as food  What really matters for the wealth of our country and for our standard of living is that we maximize our competitive advantage in trade with other countries  If there are other places that can produce energy more efficiently  and thus  more cheaply  than we can produce it here  then we should maximize that advantage through trade 
Going forward  I believe the U S  will be the clear leader in producing  refining and transporting natural gas around the world  We have the world s largest natural gas pipeline system and the world s largest functional reserves of natural gas  Given this comparative advantage  we should seek to maximize gas production by gaining access to world markets  That is happening with the huge  ongoing liquefied natural gas  LNG  build out  and that is why Targa Resources Corp   NYSE TRGP   a stock I pitched not too long ago  has done so incredibly well 
Given that we consume around 18 million barrels per day  18 MMbbl d  of crude oil in the U S   and our domestic production is only around 8 MMbbl d  it will be years before we will become energy independent in terms of oil  On the other hand  if you count coal exports  you could argue that we are already energy independent  In any case  even though we don t yet produce enough crude oil to meet all of our domestic consumption needs  I do think you ll soon see the U S  begin to lift restrictions on crude oil exports  And I think that s a very important move for us to make 
Why would I want to see us exporting crude if we re not making enough to satisfy our own demand for crude  Again  you have to understand how wealth is built through trade  and the idea of competitive advantage  We can t use all of the light sweet crude we re currently producing in Texas because we don t have the right kind of refineries  It would be far better for our country to sell oil to the highest global bidder than to consume it in less optimal ways  The higher profits could be reinvested in more production and new refineries here in the U S 
Crude exports would also have important benefits for our overall economy  They re the only likely way to solve our chronic current account deficits  Given that the U S  Department of the Interior is an unwelcome partner in lots of oil production in the U S   it s good for our government s deficit problem too 
Marin Katusa  The best thing the U S  can do is lift the crude export ban  That will result in lower gas prices for the average American  Refineries in the U S  have spent billions to modify those refineries to be able to treat the heavier crudes  The fracking revolution has unlocked the light oil  but that oil is trading at a discount because the pipelines are not in place to move it to play the arbitrage  Rail has picked up some of the slack  but the North American sector still needs to invest in its infrastructure  It will happen  but it will take longer than we want it to 
The U S  will not be energy independent by the media tag line of 2020  It is still a major importer of oil  But the potential is there for the U S  to become a major exporter of LNG and oil  Unfortunately  the government will not do what it needs to do during this administration to make that happen 
Chris Martenson  First  let s define what we mean by energy independence  Since various types of energy coal  gas  oil perform very different functions in our economy  there s no point in lumping them together and counting their BTUs as one big pile of energy  That obscures reality  rather than illuminating anything useful  Rather  we should explore the question of independence of each type of energy individually  oil  coal  nuclear and natural gas 
If the question is  Will the U S  ever achieve petroleum independence   the answer is currently no  Today  the U S  produces a bit more than 8 MMbbl d of crude oil  and imports an additional 7 MMbbl d  Under even the most optimistic scenarios  shale oil peaks out in 2021 while adding another 4 MMbbl d to current production  That still leaves a gap of 3 MMbbl d and at that point the gap only grows wider  forever  as the shale oil fields enter terminal decline 
Under less rosy scenarios  the shale plays peak out in 2018  while adding only 2 3 MMbbl d  leaving a much wider gap of 4 5 MMbbl d to be filled by foreign imports 
For natural gas the situation is different  Fracking has a real chance to deliver natural gas independence     for a while  The U S  will remain a net importer of natural gas for a few more years  and then be in a position to either meet 100  of its own needs for 20 30 years or export natural gas to the world in the form of LNG  and cut that window of independence down to 15 20 years 
As with the shale oil plays  the shale gas plays require extremely intensive drilling to keep production growing  The minute the last well is finished  production begins to decline  Our choice with natural gas is either to use it to deliver the energy that drives the refashioning of our domestic energy infrastructure for the day that it  too  runs out  or to export the gas to drive up the current profits of energy companies 
Our view at Peak Prosperity is that we should not export LNG for two reasons  First  it costs 25  of the embodied energy in natural gas to compress it  power that is forever lost to humanity in the service of creating a liquid out of a gas  That s just energetically stupid  Second  we desperately need that gas for domestic purposes  as we face the largest ever build out of our energy infrastructure  to move toward whatever combination of resources we decide will replace dwindling fossil fuels 
Bill Powers  The U S  is a mature oil producing region  Some of the shale fields  like the Piceance Basin in Colorado  are already in severe decline  One of the best  the Marcellus Shale  is already slowing its rate of growth  and is within two years of peaking  Technology has increased oil and gas production in recent years  but there is a limit to what technology can do  The laws of physics and geology will always win out 
TER  In a recent interview  T  Boone Pickens predicted an energy renaissance in the U S  if the government gets out of the way  What are he  and other industry experts  getting wrong about U S  production estimates 
BP  They don t understand the decline rates  These wells don t last multiple decades  The average is seven years  many less than that  Refracturing can work  but it is expensive  In the end  the price has to go up  That is an opportunity for juniors with a weighting toward gas and low valuations  That includes Pine Cliff Energy Ltd   TO PNE   which has substantial upside opportunity and low cost of operations 
Advantage Oil and Gas Ltd   NYSE AAV  is also a low cost operator with a great opportunity  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd   TO BXE  has significant gas resources waiting to be unlocked  And Arsenal Energy Inc   TO AEI  has significant acreage coming on 
Everyone in North America should be aware we are in a structural rising gas price environment that will result in tremendous opportunities from an investment position  This also means individuals may want to find a way to use less gas 
TER  Based on the amount of energy required to pull a barrel of energy out of the ground today  is fracking sustainable 
PS  It seems very clear to me  based on the economic outcomes  that fracking produces far more energy than it consumes  Most new wells produce large volumes of energy  far more than what was required to stimulate the well  Some of them  of course  don t  Others are bona fide gushers 
One extreme example is a gas well in the Niobrara Shale that WPX Energy Inc   NYSE WPX  drilled in January 2013  It s already produced 2 5 billion cubic feet of natural gas  At  3 per million cubic feet  that s  7 million worth of gas  That s a lot of energy from one well 
Another way of answering this question is to look at the financial results of the best frackers  Clearly the market leader is EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG   Over the last three years the company has spent roughly  5 billion   5B  drilling and fracking wells  It has produced over  35B in oil and gas revenue  That s 7 to 1  Seems sustainable to me     
CM  A number of costs associated with fracking are either being subsidized by current taxpayers or will be absorbed by future taxpayers  We know that the taxes collected from the fracking and production companies are insufficient to fully repair the road and bridge damage their operations cause  In Texas in 2012  the state received  3 6B in severance taxes from oil producers  but the Texas Department of Transportation estimated  4B in damage to roads  Arkansas has taken in less than half the amount of the damage to its roads by oil trucks 
In the future  it s entirely unclear who will pay to cap all the abandoned wells probably numbering in the millions when all is said and done  But if the recent experiences of Wyoming and Pennsylvania are any indication  that cost will be handed to taxpayers 
But the most obviously unsustainable part of the fracking story centers on the producers themselves  The largest and theoretically best positioned of them have all been turning in negative free cash flows  FCF   Consider Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK   which had negative FCFs of  8 5B in 2011   11 9B in 2012 and  3B in 2013  This means  at current prices  the company is spending more on capital than it is making in revenue  by a very wide margin 
The shale story is already a mature story  The best areas in the best plays have been intensively drilled for several years now  So it s worth asking  where s the positive FCF  Isn t that the point of all this  to make money 
The bottom line is that the price of oil needs to be higher   By my estimate  it needs to be  130 a barrel   130 bbl  or higher  with  10 bbl of that higher price flowing to public trusts to be cash flow and social cost neutral 
TER  Is  150 bbl oil the likely outcome of the global problems in the Middle East and Ukraine 
CM  The situation in Ukraine has less bearing on oil costs  because there s no production directly at risk  Indirectly  that would change if some form of overt hostility between Russia and the West caused Russian oil exports to falter  I consider that highly unlikely at this stage 
However  the Middle East is another matter entirely  Even a slight reduction in Middle East exports will see the prompt return of  150 bbl oil  Recalling the  150 bbl oil we saw in July 2008  the correct explanation for that event lies in the observation that in five of the six preceding quarters  global demand for oil exceeded supply  Not by a lot  but it does not take much tightness in the oil market to create higher prices 
TER  Germany is Europe s biggest consumer of gas  with 80 billion cubic meters consumed in 2012  About a third of that comes from Russia  Can fracking in Germany end that dependency 
MK  Fracking has been occurring in Europe since the 1950s  it is not a new phenomenon  even though the media tries to make it so  Germany has been increasing its natural gas and oil imports from Russia over the last two decades  Horizontal fracking will help change that  but it is not an overnight solution  The sudden success of the U S  shale sector took almost 15 years to mature  and it will take as long  if not longer  in Europe  However  it will happen  as Germany needs it to happen  Investors who expose themselves to the shale revolution in Germany will make a fortune 
The Russians have been using modern technology to enhance oil and gas production  something Europe is late to the game to do  But the United Kingdom  Germany  the Netherlands and Albania are moving in the right direction  France is going the wrong way  in every way possible  when it comes to energy policy 
To answer your question specifically  fracking  along with other technologies  will help revitalize and increase domestic production within Germany  which has one of the highest netbacks in the world  It is still very early days in the European energy renaissance  but it has started 
TER  Will the violence in Iraq make Europe s transition away from Russia more difficult 
MK  The disturbance in Iraq has increased Brent crude pricing  and will continue to do so  The situation in the Middle East will get worse before it gets better  so expect higher Brent crude pricing 
TER  What role will nuclear and alternative energy play in European energy independence 
MK  Green energy does have a role to play  but it is still not primary base load  Furthermore  without government subsidies  green energy will not be as economic as coal and natural gas  Look at Germany  for example  Electricity costs for the average person increased by 25  each year over the last two years  Expect the same this year and next  Going green has taken the green out of the economy 
The most hated energy right now is nuclear  but it is real and is here to stay  Eventually  Japan will bring back its nukes  and so will Germany  It is too expensive for them not to  Nuclear energy is very misunderstood  But if you re a contrarian and have patience  nuclear will reward those who are exposed to the sector 
TER  What can investors do to protect themselves 
CM  The biggest risk is the extreme complacency that has built up in the equity and bond markets of the industrialized nations  Complacency leads to risk being mispriced  and we are at extreme levels of complacency at the moment 
An oil price spike would be a less than perfect event and could lead to very large speculative losses  We advise people to invest with an understanding of the risks involved and to potentially forgo additional gains in favor of protecting wealth  In times like these  cash is always a good place to be  If an investor wants to remain in equities  then using options to protect positions is sensible at this time

168768,390284,EOG,Steep Yield Curve in EOG Resources Provides Opportunity For Bond Investo,opinion,Earlier we talked about finding value with a bond issued by Transocean  RIG   This type of bond is a good relative value opportunity for investors who prefer a  buy and hold  approach by way of owning the bond until maturity  This in essence locks in a yield of 3 03 percent per year when the bond reaches its maturity date in six years  Having said this  there are other opportunities in the Investment Grade energy sector that can exceed the aforementioned annualized return without increasing its maturity date and thus adding interest rate risk  This can be accomplished if an investor uses a total return approach where both income from the coupon and price appreciation from the passage of time factor in the performance  While this approach is often used by fund managers and institutional players  it is a relatively easy strategy to implement  This strategy is often referred to as Rolling Down the Yield Curve  For more information  please review    The key to this strategy is identifying the steepest part of a yield curve of a single issuer which can be either a string of Treasuries or series of bonds from the same corporate issuer  Within the energy sector  EOG Resources  EOG  which is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas companies in the U S  has multiple bond issuance and is a good starting point As you can see from the graphic above  the steepest part of the EOG yield curve which is highlighted in red is the six year part of the curve  The EOG 6 Year pays a semi annual coupon of 6 875  and matures on October 01  2018  CUSIP 26875PAC5   The bond is a senior note and is a straight bullet maturity with no embedded early call feature  So the earliest an investor will get back its principal is at the maturity date  assuming no default  These senior notes are currently being offered at a dollar price of  128 47 which translates to a yield to maturity of 1 74  Now  savvy investors will know to not be deterred by this low yield since in order to realize this return  the bond will need to be held until it matures in 6 years  Since we are taking a total return approach with a shorter time horizon  the key to establishing our expected return is to come up with a projected price target and the amount of time that we plan on owning this 6 year bond  We can both determine this by knowing where the EOG 5 Year bond is trading today So why is the 5 Year bond important when we are focusing on the 6 Year bond that offers a higher yield The answer lies in the ultimate truth that our 6 Year bond will become a 5 Year in one year  The differential between the two maturities sets our time horizon Also  we know that markets are generally efficient where mispricing and inefficiencies are taken out by the plethora of market players  Like bonds from the same issuer should be close in yields  So we have confidence that the 6 Year bond in one year from now should trade close to levels of the current 5 Year  assuming  all else equal   The yield of the longer maturity will migrate or  roll  toward the shorter one as time passes  So the yield of the 5 Year establishes the target price of the 6 Year bond that we are focusing on Going back to our example  we can see that EOG issued a bond that pays a 5 875  Coupon Maturing in September 01  2017  This 5 Year bond is currently trading at a yield of 1 17   So the yield on our 6 Year bond that is trading at 1 74  should fall toward that level in one year s time assuming stable interest rates  Given these inputs  we use Bloomberg s bond calculator to come up with the expected price and total return  As you can see we purchased the EOG bond at a yield of 1 74  percent or a dollar price of  128 47  Assuming that rates are stable during our time horizon of less than a year or ending October 23  2013  we plug in today s 5 Year yield of 1 17   This yield at this horizon date will correspond to a price of  127 30  This is the expected dollar price which we plan to monetize by selling in the open markets at our horizon date  While the expected dollar price is lower than our cost  the fact is that the high coupon earned over time provides a greater offset to a point where an investor profits  Given our reinvestment rate of 0 28  for coupon payments earned during that time period  this profit results in an annualized return of 4 29   Once those gains are captured when the bond is sold at the horizon date at that expected price  the funds generated can be redeployed  This strategy provides investors a return advantage over just a buy and hold approach  This is evident when you match up the horizon date with the maturity date of a bond from the same issuer  Currently  EOG 6 125  Coupon Maturing October 1  2013 is currently trading at a yield of only 0 33   So by using a 6 Year bond with a 1 year time horizon can produce a return greater than 396 basis points in the aforementioned scenario  Keep in mind that the main assumption to this strategy is stable interest rates  As we all know  there is no such thing as a free lunch  As with any attempt to add returns  there are risks to this enhanced strategy  If rates rise  bond prices fall and this approach as described will not work  The good thing that investors can take comfort in is utilizing market transparency by the central bank of the U S  We know that in the September announcement  the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping interest rates low     Since our horizon date of October 2013 falls well within that time frame  it is reasonable to think that our main assumption of stable interest rates is fair  But to be devil s advocate where we challenge this even further  let s assume the unlikely event that bond yields spike for whatever reason that undermines the Federal Reserve s massive balance sheet expansion  In the case of this bond  this strategy falls apart  However  not all is lost if the main objective at that point is to avoid a losing trade  The key lies in extending your time horizon  In this scenario  this can be accomplished by just holding the bond longer and to maturity as principal should be paid back at par  So the return captured in our example should be the yield to maturity of 1 74   So despite a massive shock in a rise in yields  the worst case scenario is a small but yet positive gain  To summarize  below is a simple step by step approach on what we covered in the various interest rate environments  Buy EOG 6 875  10 1 2018   1 74  YieldIf interest rates are stable  bond should roll to from a yield of 1 74  to 1 17  on October 2013  Capture 4 29  annualized return in one year by selling bonds at horizon date If interest rates fall before October 2013  sell bonds at optimal level as prices in general should appreciate If interest rates rise  hold bond to maturity which should provide a return of 1 74  on an annualized basis over the next six years In terms of the fundamentals and credit  EOG Resources is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas companies in the U S  This company which is headquartered in Houston  Texas has proved reserves around the globe ranging from United States  to the United Kingdom  and to China  EOG  together with its subsidiaries  explores  develops  produces and markets natural gas and crude oil EOG is a high quality company as evident by its credit rating that falls on the Investment Grade scale  This bond is rated A  by Standard   Poor s and A3 by Moody s  which are both three notches above the threshold between Investment Grade and High Yield In addition  EOG has been profitable and their debt exposure is relatively small  As of the 3rd quarter of 2012  EOG has produced  5 9 billion in EBITDA  which is Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization and is one measure of profitability  over the past 12 months  Compared to Net Debt  Debt Amount less their Cash Holdings  of  5 2 billion which translates to a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 0 9x  EOG has little overall leverage  In other words  it would take less than a year of profitability for EOG to pay off all of its outstanding debt In addition  EOG earns enough to cover its interest expense from the debt it owes  Over the past 12 months  EOG paid a total of  211 million in interest expense  Given the  5 9 billion in EBITDA  EOG has more than enough earnings to service its debt  close to 28x the amount  This ratio is referred to as the Interest Coverage ratio which shows how easily a company can pay interest expense given their profitability  A higher Interest Coverage Ratio implies better credit health since it is making enough money to stay current with their debt interest obligations  Conversely  a red flag is raised when this ratio approaches 1 5 or lower since its ability to pay the interest on their debt is questionable  Given its Interest Coverage of close to 28x  EOG has plenty of cushion Going back to the bonds  keep in mind that corporate bonds trade over the counter  So  prices and yields can vary depending on the broker you use  The best suggestion is to use a broker that offers the most visibility and price transparency for the corporate bond market  This can be achieved by comparing the price to buy and the sale price  aka bid ask spread   The closer the differential usually means the better the liquidity Information and market quotes on the bond investments are provided by   As always  every bond investor should

168769,390285,EOG,Top Ranked Energy ETFs And Stocks Set To Roar Higher,opinion,"The energy sector has been performing remarkably well this year  especially following the geopolitical tensions in Russia  and is clearly outpacing the broad market indices  Further  the current demand supply dynamics suggest higher oil prices  and in turn soaring prices for energy stocks and the related ETFs 
Russia Threatens Oil Supply
The situation in Russia is getting worse as the Ukrainian regime calls for military buildup against Russia on one hand  and the U S  and European Union are looking for more tough sanctions against the country on the other if the crisis escalates further  This is especially true given that at least three pro Russian militants were killed in the gun battle near the volatile eastern Ukrainian town of Slavyansk on Sunday  Since Russia is a huge supplier of both natural gas and oil  Western Europe and other markets are heavily dependent on Russian production to fuel their economies  If the crisis escalates or European Union hits Russia with more sanctions then the latter could keep European markets away from its vast oil and natural gas supplies  This will result in higher oil prices  pushing Western Europe in search of other markets to meet their energy needs 
Encouraging Demand Supply Trends
Though oil production in the U S   the largest oil consumer  reached its highest levels in 24 years thanks to new hydraulic fracturing  fracking  methods and a boom in unconventional oil production  output in other countries is showing signs of waning  The civil unrest and operational issues in Libya and Iraq  reduced supplies in Saudi Arabia  and repairs and maintenance in Kazakhstan oil fields would take a toll on total oil supply going forward in addition to Russia s reduced output  As a result  non OPEC supply is expected to fall by 0 25 million barrels per day this year to 29 8 million barrels per day  as per the International Energy Agency  IEA   The agency also expects global demand to rise a modest 1 5  to 92 7 million barrels per day this year  Most of the demand is expected to come from volatile emerging markets  Moreover  the oil and energy industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 38   suggesting a bullish outlook for the broad sector  So the overall sector is looking quite promising at present  especially given some of the weakness in many of the high flying names in other key sectors such as biotech and technology  Fortunately  there are a few top ranked picks in this corner of the market  and we have described some below  Any of these could enjoy smooth trading and lead the market higher in Q2

Bottom Line
Markets have been choppy of late as soft global economic fundamentals  stretched valuations and earnings warnings dampened investor mood  In light of this  it might be time to focus on a sector that is seeing rising earnings estimates  and is well positioned to benefit from the current geopolitical pressures  Energy companies certainly poised to benefit from this scenario and any of the aforementioned picks could be solid choices to play this trend given the uncertain market environment ",2014-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-ranked-energy-etfs-and-stocks-set-to-roar-higher-210351,210351
168770,390286,EOG,Andrew Coleman  Are You Ready For A Global Oil Surplus ,opinion,"As North America continues to produce more oil and gas than the world knows what to do with  Raymond James Analyst Andrew Coleman thinks the sector is likely to remain sluggish  But  if investing is a bit of a poker game  you need to learn to read the table if you want the best chance at a winning hand  In this interview with The Energy Report  Coleman explains the international supply demand disparity and tells us which oil and gas producers he values highest in an uncertain energy market 
The Energy Report  We are at the end of Q1 14  how is the oil and gas space faring 
Andrew Coleman  Overall  the space was helped by stronger domestic gas prices as we came out of the cold winter  The Q1 14 numbers have not been fully reported yet  but gas prices were up to  5 per thousand cubic feet   5 Mcf  at bid week  As a result of this increase  a number of gas weighted exploration and production  E P  companies outperformed the market 
TER  What changes do you see on the table for Q2 14 
AC  From the macro standpoint  we at Raymond James have been asking ourselves   How and when will gas storage begin to replenish   The answer to that question will dictate how the gas market reacts during the next three to six months  Clearly  the strength of the winter weather sales and the reduction in storage levels make us much more positive on 2014 gas prices than on 2015 gas prices  We think there will be enough coal switching to keep gas prices from getting too frothy  We also believe the E P industry s ability to bring new supply to the system will help close the storage gap  So  while we recently increased our 2014 gas price deck  we left 2015 unchanged 
TER  Are we looking at a global glut for oil and gas 
AC  That s certainly been the sentiment at Raymond James for the last 24 months  Supply coming from the North American shale plays has overshadowed demand growth  The market remained tight last year due to supply curtailments made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  in the Middle East  And in the months to come  I think we ll continue to see growth in North American production volumes and a trend toward oversupply  with the first pricing disruption coming from a widening Brent LLS spread 
TER  What role are the Saudis and Chinese playing in the current oil and gas environment 
AC  Prior to the shale oil development boom  there was one marginal producer of oil Saudi Arabia and one marginal buyer of oil China  However  the discovery of U S  shale oil deposits introduced the country as a second marginal supplier  It is our view that Saudi Arabia will cut oil production to keep the market balanced  but there s a question as to how much the Saudis will cut  The recent Saudi cut of 1 million barrels of oil per day was more than we expected in the short term  Will it cut more  A part of the answer depends upon the health of China s growth trajectory  as the country s slowed progress has given way to concern for the robustness of its oil demand 
TER  Will the North American shale fields keep producing for the long term 
AC  Raymond James recently published an article that attempts to answer that question  analyzing the Bakken Shale  We used our type curve models to forecast what it will take on a rig count basis to get Bakken production to slow its growth rate  The report shows that the rig count would have to be cut by more than 50  in order for production to show a noteworthy decline  Growth is being driven by a combination of pad drilling  e g  faster cycle times  and downspacing  e g  higher density drilling  
It used to take 60 days to bring a new well online in the Bakken  but now  the average time is half that  And even if the productivity of the rock in the basin is declining  producers don t have to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks  such as transportation issues  Roads and other infrastructure were built throughout the Bakken during the first few years of the boom and those efficiencies are helping to offset any potential risks to reservoir productivity at this point  That scenario is likely to continue through the end of this decade 
TER  In your previous Energy Report interview  you discussed a number of exciting North American E P companies  What are some of the names you re following today 
AC  EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  is the best run and most respected E P company out there  It s been my Top Pick for some time because it has a great balance sheet and the fastest growing large cap E P profile in the sector and the stock certainly reflects these strengths  It s a dominant player in the Eagle Ford play  where it has experienced huge growth  It s also one of the pioneers in the Bakken and is testing acreage in the Permian Basin  Given that Raymond James  commodity outlook for the next two years models West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil moving toward  75 barrel   75 bbl   I see EOG as a great defensive name  It offers good production growth on a debt adjusted basis 
TER  Do you think the stock is an attractive buy at the present time 
AC  Absolutely  It s hard to argue with the company s level of execution  Considering our overall risk aversion at Raymond James  EOG is a best of breed at almost any size market cap 
TER  What s the main way that Raymond James factors risk into commodities analyses 
AC  The risk is that we are pricing WTI in the mid  70 bbl range next year  The Bakken and midcontinent supply puts pressure on the Brent and WTI spread 
TER  Is that what makes Raymond James risk averse 
AC  Yes  that supply environment makes us cautious on E Ps  We aren t as cautious as we were two years ago  when we thought the WTI would drop to  65 bbl  but we re still cautious  and we are not seeing enough growth on the demand side to offset that risk 
TER  How about another E P name investors should keep an eye on 
AC  QEP Resources Inc  NYSE QEP  has a number of catalysts on the near term horizon  In Q2 14  we expect it to finish the bid process for assets that it has targeted for divestiture  Last December  the company purchased properties in the Permian Basin for  950 million   950M   Utilizing like kind exchange rules  QEP is seeking to divest its Midcontinent properties to take advantage of the tax benefits it can gain by high grading its portfolio  It also has saleable assets in the Cana and Granite Wash Basins  and we expect the proceeds from these two asset sales to potentially top the  950M that management spent in the Permian  These deals could be announced in 2 6 weeks and will help QEP deleverage and plow some money back into operations in order to generate production growth 
Interestingly  QEP is also on the cusp of finalizing its midstream business separation plan  We expect to see a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  soon  which will detail how it plans to go about that process  You may recall that JANA Partners LLC acquired shares of QEP stock late last year  QEP subsequently agreed to take on additional board members  Now  it seems everyone on the board agrees with Management s plan to spin off the midstream business and to fully separate it from the rest of QEP 
The proceeds from the midstream separation and the proceeds from its asset divestitures could drive the company to trade at a much more attractive E P multiple since it will be poised to generate more production growth  We could potentially see a  10 share increase 
TER  Are there any other companies that pique your interest 
AC  Last month  Energy XXI  Bermuda  Limited  EXXI O  announced that it will acquire EV Energy Partners LP  EVEP O   This is part of a plan to create the largest pure play Gulf of Mexico shelf producer  In my view  this will allow Energy XXI to boost its low risk inventory  effectively resetting the clock on its development plans  It is similar to what happened after the firm s acquisition of properties from Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE  in 2010  the increased inventory allowed it to have a deeper backlog and to be more selective with its development plans  This deal with Energy Partners allows Energy XXI to do the same thing  In the short term  it will find low hanging fruit to monetize  generating more production growth and cash flows over the next 12 24 months 
TER  Is the financing market robust right now for small energy firms that need operating capital 
AC  There is definitely some appetite for new issuers on the public equity side  We have seen a large number of energy only initial public offerings in the last few months  including RSP Permian Inc   RSPP NYSE   Athlon Energy Inc   ATHL NYSE   Antero Resources Corp   AR NYSE  and EP Energy Corp   EPE NYSE   I can t speak for the private equity market  but generally the circle of life in the E P space continues  I don t see any major headwinds aside from the normal concerns about what direction commodity prices will take  which is the top driver in the E P space 
TER  Will there be an increase in the pace of mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the E P sector 
AC  That is hard to say  Generally  M A picks up when operators feel they can buy properties cheaper than they can organically spend to find develop them  Lower service costs and commodity price stability would suggest that we ll see more organic options  Smaller deals remain more likely  in my view  than larger scale ones for the time being 
TER  Andrew  thank you for your time

168788,390304,EOG,EOG Resources Is Driven By Natural Gas And Oil,opinion,Here we model the evolution of EOG Resources  NYSE  EOG  share price  Imagine that you have to predict  describe  the evolution of a share price for a company from Energy sector  A natural first guess is that this share price is driven by the change in some energy related prices  Apparently  financial health of this company depends on the price and amount goods and services it sells  When these goods and services have a higher pricing power the company is likely healthy and generates some extra profit reflected in its share price   EOG engages in the exploration  development  production  and marketing of crude oil and natural gas   We extend our original model and describe the evolution of the EOG share price as a weighted sum of two individual producer price indices selected from a set of five producer price indices borrowed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the overall PPI  the PPI of electric power  EL  of natural gas  GAS  of coal  COAL  and the PPI of oil  OIL   We do not use consumer price indices in for EOG   Thus  the model seeks for the best pair of PPIs which minimizes the error since 2003  We also allow both defining PPIs lead or lag behind the modeled share price  Additionally  we introduced a linear time trend and an intercept term  Not surprisingly  the best fit model is obtained with the pair GAS and OIL EOG t   0 129GAS t 0    0 115OIL t 0    7 85 t 2000    45 12  sterr  7 77   where EOG t  is the  monthly closing  share price in U S  dollars  We allowed both time leads to vary between 0 and 12 months  In the best model  both time leads are zero  i e  the share price evolves in sync with the PPI of oil and gas  Instructively  both slopes in the model are positive and the share prices rises with that of oil and gas  The time trend coefficient is also positive and provides an annual increase of  7 85   The model standard error for the period from July 2003 to March 2012 is  7 77  It is important that the above model is valid and reliable since the middle of 2011  i e  the defining PPIs  lags  and coefficients are the same for all contemporary models since July 2011    Figure 1 shows that the model based on the producer price index of natural gas and crude petroleum  domestic production  accurately predicts the current EOG price   There were two major fluctuations in the first half of 2010 and in the fourth quarter of 2011  Both ended on the fundamental price curve  This behavior is very indicative   all deviations should return to the predicted curve  In November 2011  we would estimate the EOG price as a highly undervalued one   In that sense  the predicted price might be considered as the fundamental price level  which is fully defined by the producer prices of natural gas and oil ,2012-04-15,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eog-resources-is-driven-by-natural-gas-and-oil-120131,120131
168789,390305,EOG,Look for High Growth Oil and Gas Juniors  Josh Young Interview,opinion,Josh Young  founder of Young Capital Management  sees big opportunities in out of favor oil and gas juniors  Many relatively unknown U S  companies are trading at huge discounts  and Young s picks have underappreciated growth potential  In this exclusive interview with   he discusses several companies that are smartly growing production and cash flow  even in a range bound market    The Energy Report  It s been a tough market for energy stocks since your last interview  What is your take on the state of the market    Josh Young  It s been a tough few months for energy stocks  Over the last few years  there have been risk on and risk off cycles  Commodities and smaller energy stocks have done well when the world economy appeared to be recovering  last November through March was one of those periods  Beginning in April  the market turned down  Investors got more cautious  oil and natural gas prices came down  as did energy stocks    This is an interesting time because it is not clear what will happen next  Unless there is a big  unforeseen global event  commodities and energy will continue to trade in the wide range that we ve seen over the last few years    TER  What companies can succeed in this environment  Gale Force Petroleum Inc   GFP V  is one that you ve talked about in the past  How do you evaluate them    JY  I ve found that companies achieving the highest valuations are not just cheap based on cash flow and reserves  They are also rapidly growing  Growth can be organic or by acquisition  but there needs to be the potential to grow rapidly and economically  Any capital spending must lead to high growth  Highly valued  large companies such as Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  or Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   COG  are rewarded with a premium multiple in the market after having achieved years of economic  high production growth  I look for companies that are smaller and are in the process of economically growing production  but that aren t necessarily showing the results just yet in their financials  and where people don t yet believe there will be consistent growth  That transitional period when companies are growing and drilling with high rates of return is the sweet spot for an equity holder    Unlike most oil and gas stocks  Gale Force is up for the year  It is well financed  growing rapidly and trading at a discount to the value of its cash flow and reserves  Gale Force recently announced production guidance in excess of 800 barrels per day  bbl d  by the end of the year versus 275 bbl d at the start of the year  It is possible that the company could get to 1 thousand barrels per day  Mbbl d  by the end of the year  With a current enterprise value of around  20 million   20M   it is undervalued relative to its peers and relative to the liquidation value of its assets  Gale Force is in the process of drilling to prove undeveloped locations and recompleting three producing wells  Production could exceed 600 bbl d by the beginning of August  These projects have a very high rate of return a triple digit internal rate of return in many cases  It should create a lot of value over the next year or so through this capital program  Over time  the equity price will begin to reflect that  If Gale Force traded to a normal industry multiple of  100 000  100K  flowing barrel  with 1 000 bbl d production by the end of the year  that could make for a  100M market cap versus the current  20M market cap  There is a lot of potential upside    TER  Does this multiple apply to junior producers or is that more for mid tiers and majors    JY  That s a great question  It s not really still applicable for really small companies  but what Gale Force is doing will make it very applicable  Gale Force has been looking at royalty trusts that have been spun off by companies like SandRidge Energy  SD   Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  and the management of BreitBurn Energy Partners L P   BBEP   Once production exceeds 1 000 bbl d  Gale Force will stabilize production with continuous drilling and workover programs  Those assets are being evaluated for spinning out to a royalty trust  The valuations on royalty trusts are well in excess of  100K flowing barrel  Even now  after a few months of weakness in energy stocks  most of the royalty trusts are trading in excess of  250K flowing barrel  There s a capital expenditure requirement  but even netting the capex requirement  1 000 bbl d of stabilized production could be worth more than  200M  In general  a  100K flowing barrel metric is more appropriate for a larger company  Gale Force does have a near term monetization plan  I think the  100K is fair  As a potential royalty trust offering becomes more of a reality  the stock could price it in    TER  Have other small companies successfully spun off or converted into a royalty trust    JY  Absolutely  Recently  the management that runs BreitBurn Energy had a private company that was smaller and grew over the last few years  They spun it out as Pacific Coast Oil Trust  ROYT   The initial valuation was about  300K flowing barrel  Production was approximately 3 000 bbl d  Gale Force produces less but is higher margin  I don t think there s necessarily a size requirement beyond the 1 000 bbl d Gale Force will achieve  A spinoff needs to be a certain size for investors to want to participate and for liquidity  but I don t think it should matter too much if it s 1 000 or 50 000 bbl d as long as the yield is similar and the cash flow per unit is similar    TER  It s good to go down a path that s been traveled successfully    JY  Gale Force has always been on the XTO path  which is a little different  Many juniors will lease a bunch of land  then try to raise money on the back of it  Next  they drill wells and try to raise money on the back of those well results  Gale Force has done it the other way around  First  they buy production at a low price  Next  they rework the wells to increase production  Lastly  they borrow money  hedge production to protect the debt and repeat  Gale Force also raises equity  but it has been on the back of production  not because of large land positions  Most of Gale Force s production has a stable decline rate  That s why the royalty trust model could work well  whereas for a lot of smaller companies  it s not really an option    TER  Is Gale Force mostly active in Texas    JY  Most current production is in East Texas  Royalty trusts are best if geographically concentrated it helps to have fields in just a few areas  Gale Force has a field in South Texas  but it is close to current production  It helps to have one center of operations  The company looks at additional acquisitions and drilling  but it s all within that small area    TER  When you look at other companies  is it important to you that they have established fields in drilling friendly jurisdictions like Texas    JY  Yes  it s obviously helpful  but I care more about the field being highly economic than I do about location  I also care about political risk  In New York  you can t drill horizontally and do hydraulic fracturing  Internationally  there are all sorts of political risks that I generally avoid  although occasionally I ll participate for the right risk reward ratio    A position I recently added is AusTex Oil Ltd   AOK ASX   It is traded in Australia  which is unusual for a small energy stock with most of its assets in the Mississippian play of Oklahoma and Kansas  That could be why it trades at a discount to its asset value and to its peers  AusTex is next to Range Resources Corp   RRC  on the Nemaha Ridge  Range has drilled more than 100 vertical wells in the area  Many have had more than 100  rates of return  More recently  Range has drilled eight horizontal wells within two miles of AusTex s position  AusTex was in one of those wells from which they expect a 30 day average rate of 1 000 bbl d or more  With a well cost of less than  4M and production of 1 000 bbl d  the well could pay out in a few months  AusTex is a minority working interest partner in that particular well  with approximately 14 15  interest  AusTex has 6 000 net acres adjacent to that well  The company has drilled a few vertical wells on the land with well costs around  600K and 30 day rates in excess of 100 bbl d  Those are very high rates of return    Another AusTex neighbor is Apache Corp   APA   which just had its analyst day  Apache has hundreds of thousands of acres in the Mississippian in Kansas  where it envelops AusTex s position in Kansas  Apache is going to drill wells all around AusTex  It is possible that AusTex is in the center of a newly discovered oil field  It s exciting  but too early to give it too much credit in my valuation    TER  Your valuation on AusTex is based on production and cash flow plus a big growth component    JY  Yes  There will be a lot of growth from the 6 000 acres next to Range  AusTex will be able to drill hundreds of vertical wells or dozens of horizontal wells that will each have net present values well in excess of the cost of the well  You can more than double your money every time you drill a well  The market cap right now is just above  30M  It s a small company  but if it drills a few wells  it can ramp up production and cash flow significantly  It will be able to internally finance the drilling and get payback in approximately six months for each well    TER  AusTex stock has been pretty hot this year tripling up to a few weeks ago and then selling off  Is the word getting out or is this still somewhat under the radar    JY  I think one or two investors in Australia figured it out  In February and March  people got excited  Prior to that it  it was stable in the  0 08 0 11 range for a long time    The stock started to move after announcing excellent vertical well results  Range s results were also great  Based on both companies  results  investors were comforted that it was not a  one off  well  Recently  the stock has declined with the sector as a whole  With additional drill results  the stock could rebound and head higher  Competitors like Red Fork Energy Ltd   RFE ASX  and a few other Mississippian focused companies have higher per acre  per flowing barrel and cash flow valuations  It has a lot of room to the upside  I have bought this dip    TER  What other companies are you following    JY  Gastar Exploration Ltd   GST  has positions in Texas and West Virginia  It is executing on its plan  growing rapidly and generating high rates of return on its wells  Its financing is lined up  Last year  it doubled proven reserves and it s likely to do so again  The stock is down 50  since the beginning of the year  and it has far underperformed its peers  Exposure to natural gas and natural gas liquids didn t help  Despite that  Gastar s wells are highly economic on a new  mid continent oil play  A partner has drilled a number of highly economic wells that cost  3 4M and came on at 30 day rates of 600 800 bbl d  It also has a historic natural gas field that it hasn t been active in but still holds the land by production  EOG Resources Inc   EOG  recently drilled an Eaglebine shale well nearby with reports of stabilized production of approximately 1 000 bbl d  Encana Corp   ECA  drilled a well nearby with an initial high production that flattened out at around 200 or 250 bbl d  The company recently announced several others at similar production rates and is now drilling a longer lateral well  which it expects to produce at substantially higher rates    TER  But how do you value that    JY  Gastar s West Virginia land is probably worth more than the current enterprise value  In addition  it has 15 20K acres that are prospective for the Eagle Ford that EOG may have just delineated  Encana is also drilling around it  It also has the mid continent oil play that looks like it s going to be highly economic  Gastar is participating in the first one of its wells in a few weeks  I believe the stock is cheap  Apparently  so does the CEO  because he bought  100K of the stock a couple of weeks ago  He said he got some flack because he only bought  100K  He told me that almost all of his personal net worth is already in the stock  When you go from 90  of your net worth in the stock to 91  of your net worth in the stock  even if it s a small dollar value  it s a big deal because obviously it s further concentrating your wealth  I think he was joking  but he said he was rummaging through his couch seats for change to go and buy a little bit more  Hearing that made me go through my couch seats to pick up a little more stock myself    TER  It s really been beaten up over the past year on the price chart    JY  Yes  it s gotten beaten up  It s tough as a current holder  I ve owned the stock for a while  But it s also a great opportunity  I bought a little bit more recently  I may buy some more going forward  I see opportunity in stocks that are beaten down  executing well but are unloved for some reason  As they go back into favor  they have the opportunity to outperform    TER  Does Gastar look like an acquisition target    JY  Yes  The CEO has talked about getting inbound calls from private equity  I m not sure that the whole company is for sale  However  the Marcellus asset is probably worth more than the whole company  Half could be sold for  100 200M to pay down debt and the balance re deployed elsewhere  Such a scenario could double the stock    TER  Are there other special situations that you are watching    JY  I like companies that are cash rich  Neither Gastar  AusTex nor Gale Force have a lot of cash on hand  They have sufficient liquidity to execute their plans  but they don t have a ton of excess cash    I follow two companies that have more than 50  of their market cap in cash and no debt Sonde Resources Corp   SOQ  and Molopo Energy Ltd   MPO ASX   Both happen to be selling international assets  Molopo is selling a natural gas field in Australia that could be used for liquefied natural gas transport  Sonde is selling a North African oil field  Both companies could have negative enterprise values if their sales happen at the management guided prices  They re special situation investments  and they theoretically shouldn t be very high beta  Oddly  they have traded in line with the market over the last few months  As their asset sales proceed  the stocks should diverge from trading with the market  Both should be able to create value through stock buybacks and maybe even distress acquisitions    TER  Molopo has a large portfolio of different types of projects all over the world  Would it make sense to focus on its best prospects    JY  Yes  It has a lot of valuable assets  but the company is hard to value because not all its projects are generating cash  Molopo needs to focus  Ironically  even if it gave away some assets  it could go up in value because it would be easier to understand  Its South African holdings are an example  It has hundreds of thousands of acres there that may have shale gas or other assets  How do you value that  My estimate is that it could be worth  10 20M or more in the future  For now  Molopo is not selling the South African holdings  but the asset has value  Molopo is selling an Australian asset  but it s also hard to value  Hopefully  proceeds will be used to buy back stock because the market is having trouble valuing the company  Buybacks would help to resolve the issue    TER  Are there any other interesting companies that you would like to mention    JY  Yes  The last one is unusual for me in that its only asset is offshore West Africa and it has no production or cash flow  It has a very low valuation based on the oil that could be underneath its leases  It is in Namibia  and it is called Westbridge Energy Corp   WEB V   Southern Namibia has a known offshore field  Chariot Oil   Gas Ltd   CHARC L  recently drilled an exploratory well  That well was uneconomic  but it showed a petroleum system in the area  That well looks to be on the side of the same reservoir as Westbridge  There is a lot of activity in the area  with many wells located and permitted offshore by a number of different operators  It will only take one economic well to get numerous buyout bids for Westbridge  For now  Westbridge is starting at a low valuation and taking a more pragmatic approach  which starts with coming in early  paying little for acreage and building relationships  Westbridge has attractive back ins with Namibia  As an investor  their low cost approach mirrors my own  A large  inexpensively acquired land package with lots of exploration activity should result in value creation that someone will pay well in excess of current market valuation    TER  That is a lot different from your other picks  but it fits a different portfolio need    JY  It s a flier but it s a cheap flier  I know management well and I like how they work  If Namibia heats up  Westbridge could sell a portion of current holdings for a substantial profit to fund ongoing exploration  That would ensure that early investors are rewarded  Management recognizes that West Africa is a high risk prospect and they are acting to maximize gains for themselves and early investors    TER  How would you sum up your advice for our readers    JY  It looks likely that we re going to get some quantitative easing and bailouts in the U S  and Europe  particularly running up to the U S  election in November  If so  energy stocks could run  Investors should consider the international dynamics for oil prices  especially with regard to Russia s role  I want to be on the same side of the table as Russia in this regard  The current Russian regime has strong incentives to maintain a high oil price  Their finances need  110 Brent  There are many strong geopolitical incentives for Russia and oil exporters to maintain the high oil price  That s part of why I feel comfortable maintaining exposure to oil  despite all of the geopolitical and economic turmoil  People with the power to maintain high oil prices are doing so  I expect a reasonably high price of oil

168790,390306,EOG,It s Time To Invest In Argentina s Oil and Gas Plays  Bill Newman,opinion,Argentina s nationalist leanings grabbed major headlines earlier this year  but Mackie Research Analyst Bill Newman says the conflict is unlikely to become a repeating trend with the majors and supermajors currently trolling for oil and gas in the country s Vaca Muerta shales  In fact  Newman expects newer policies to encourage foreign investment in energy exploration  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Newman explains why investors should keep an eye on the region and watch for major catalysts   The Energy Report  Bill  Argentina s government decided to pull Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales  licenses  Are you concerned that the political climate there will drive away potential investors just when you ve started recommending projects in the country   Bill Newman  The expropriation of Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales  shares didn t drive companies away  Before the expropriation of Repsol S A  s  REPYY OTCPK  51  ownership in YPF  there was a rush of new companies coming into the Neuquen Basin who saw the huge potential of developing the Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas play  The companies that were acquiring lands were the majors and supermajors  including Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE  and Total S A   TOT NYSE   All of them are continuing to drill   What the expropriation has done is limit the amount of additional capital these companies are willing to commit to Argentina in the short term  Companies continue to talk with the government and are trying to get better certainty over commodity pricing  reduced import restrictions and capital controls  Given the huge amount of foreign capital that s going to be needed to develop these shale plays  we think there s a good chance that some changes will be announced  prompting the majors and supermajors to commit more capital again  If that does occur  then this would be a major catalyst for the junior oil and gas companies operating in Argentina  including Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE TSX V  and Madalena Ventures Inc   MVN TSX V    TER  Was the conflict with Yacimientos  licenses an isolated incident of nationalization  or is there more to come   BN  Right now  it looks like the nationalization of these assets is contained just to Repsol s shares in Yacimientos  It was a very populist move by Argentina s president  Cristina Fernandez  because most Argentineans view Yacimientos as a national oil company  But we think it s unlikely that the president will move against any other companies in the region   TER  What impact has this widely covered story had on oil and gas companies  stocks that operate in the region   BN  Both Madalena and Americas Petrogas have been hit hard by increased political uncertainty in Argentina  in addition to general market conditions  Since February  Americas Petrogas is down about 50   Madalena is down by about 75   We think this is an opportunity  Both companies are well financed  They both have active drilling programs targeting the Vaca Muerta shale  so there should be a lot of drilling catalysts  Both plan to complete multiple fracture stimulations of the Vaca Muerta in the next six months  We think the political situation has been priced into these stocks  and both companies can fund their operations with cash and cash flow for the next couple of years  We do expect the political situation in Argentina to remain volatile  but we think there s a good chance the government is going to introduce new incentives to try to attract the capital it needs to develop these shale plays  In the meantime  Americas Petrogas and Madalena will be able to continue drilling and testing the shale play   TER  So both companies can fund current operations from the cash flow they have right now   BN  That s right  Americas Petrogas is actually producing 2 500 barrels oil equivalent per day  so it s actually generating some cash flow  Madalena is generating some production but limited cash flow  It has enough capital on the books to fund its operations for the next couple of years   TER  Have test results moved these stocks   BN  The production tests of the Vaca Muerta so far have been very encouraging  The vertical Vaca Muerta oil wells are initially flowing between 200 and 800 barrels oil per day  bbl d   EOG Resources Inc   EOG NYSE  recently announced that it completed the first horizontal Vaca Muerta well  It was completed with a multistage frack and the well flowed at 1 500 bbl d  These are very good results  comparable to what you get in North America  What makes this Vaca Muerta play stand out is its thickness  For example  Americas Petrogas  Los Toldos Este well encountered a 330 meter  m  section  over 1 000 feet of Vaca Muerta shale  When you have those kinds of thicknesses  you can book a huge amount of reserves if production is proven to be economic   TER  Is Madalena on track to frack the Lower Agrio  which was slated for July   BN  Yes  Actually  it is currently working on the well  It s called the Cur X 1 well  That s a really exciting play because it s the first time that the Lower Agrio shale has been fracked in Argentina  It is targeting oil as well  So if it works out  you have a new shale play to go after in Argentina and that s really important  I m guessing there should be results at the end of August   TER  In comparison  Americas Petrogas is waiting on three pending results from current explorations  and within the next two years  it s also planning on performing about 12 unconventional shale tests  Is having a greater number of test results coming in going to give Americas Petrogas a competitive edge   BN  Definitely  So far  it has drilled and cased three shale wells  The company is drilling the fourth well right now  which is the second joint venture with ExxonMobil  That s on the Los Toldos I block  After it has done that well  it plans to immediately drill another well with Exxon  on the Los Toldos II block  So in the next two months  we re expecting Americas Petrogas and Exxon to complete a fracking stimulation of the Los Toldos wells  We think it s a good indication that it decided to go ahead and drill additional wells even before testing the first well  which was drilled in the Los Toldos II block  That shows the company is confident in what it has found so far  We are expecting a continued stream of drilling results from Americas Petrogas over the next six months  which could be a good catalyst for the stock   TER  The Vaca Muerta exploration is significant for Madalena  isn t it   BN  Yes  absolutely  Madalena has  to date  nine penetrations of Vaca Muerta on its Coiron Amargo block  Those have shown that the Vaca Muerta is present over the entire block and had good results  Later this year  it will go back and complete fracture stimulations on three more wells on that block  We think that could lead to a very large increase in its reserves by year end  Madalena and Americas Petrogas have both drilled in the deeper part of the basin  which is more gas prone  Both companies have encountered huge sections of Vaca Muerta  The shale is between 500 and 600m thick massive  massive thickness  Again  Madalena and Americas Petrogas are both carried by Apache Corp   APA NYSE  on these wells  so they don t pay for any of the costs for those wells   TER  How big a role does the Vaca Muerta play in Madalena and Americas Petrogas  stories   BN  It s actually one of the key reasons to be in the stock  Americas Petrogas has access to about 750 000 acres of land that has shale potential  So it s one of the largest holdings of shale acreage in Argentina  That s exposing the company to a massive resource  At the current market price  investors are paying very  very little for the potential of the shale play  We think Madalena is more risky  but it has actually drilled more wells targeting the Vaca Muerta than Americas Petrogas  Madalena has more leverage when it comes to stock price appreciation  We re hoping the government will make Argentina more fiscally attractive for exploration companies  If that occurs  that s another major catalyst for both stories   TER  Does Americas Petrogas  joint venture with Exxon give it an advantage  Does it derisk the project   BN  The fact that Exxon will be funding up to six wells on the Los Toldos blocks is very important  Exxon could pay up to  75 million worth of exploration on the land  which is fantastic  The fact that Exxon farmed in to Americas Petrogas and let Americas Petrogas operate the blocks  which is pretty much unheard of  shows how interested Exxon is in the Vaca Muerta play in Argentina  Again  it comes down to resource potential  Results to date are encouraging enough for them to see that this could be a multibillion barrel play   TER  What other companies in Argentina are you positive about   BN  There are a couple other junior oil and gas companies that we re keeping an eye on  but we don t have coverage on them  One of them is called Crown Point Ventures Ltd   CWV TSX V   It has a growing conventional production base  It also has Vaca Muerta shale potential in the Cerro de Los Leones block   The other one is Azabache Energy Inc   AZA TSX V   It has actually just drilled a well on its Covunco Norte plot targeting the Vaca Muerta that encountered 360m of shale   TER  Thank you so much for your time and your insight  Bill Newman is

168792,390308,EOG,Josh Young  Making A Killing in Mature Oil Basins,opinion,The oil party is not over  In this interview with The Energy Report  Hedge Fund Founder Josh Young explains how to get the most returns out of a well drilled oil field  There are plenty of excellent opportunities in mature North American basins and Young tells us why now is a good time to move in for the big kill  The Energy Report  Josh  what is a  mature  basin  You re famously bullish on them  Josh Young  Mature basins have well known reservoirs and well defined geologic characteristics  Hundreds or thousands of wells are already producing in such basins  North America has a range of them  My portfolio is almost entirely exposed to these mature basins   There is an old adage   The best place to find oil is an oil field    Some of my largest positions are in mature basins in Texas  Oklahoma and Kansas  One company is active in the Sedgwick basin with the emerging Mississippi Lime play  a horizontal redevelopment of vertical Mississippian wells  which were originally drilled over the course of decades  And another company is active in the East Texas field  which has produced for almost 100 years and is in the process of being redeveloped  TER  Why do you prefer the mature basins  JY  There is an old adage   The best place to find oil is an oil field   TER  What is the risk of being a Johnny come lately  JY  Risk is always an issue  whether it s a new field or an old field  It is important to do due diligence and evaluate the risks in any investment  TER  How does peak oil factor into your investment strategy  JY  I don t think we are running out of oil anytime soon  But we have run out of cheap oil and are having more trouble growing production and replacing existing reserves  Now we have to go into shale or redevelop existing fields  This costs more money  of course  and calls for higher oil prices  but it is not the same kind of scary situation as that associated with peak oil  TER  Is there an indefinite amount of oil for us to be able to access in tandem with technological development  JY  It is not indefinite  There is obviously a limited amount  but there is more than has been predicted in certain circles  There have been Malthusian predictions of mankind s running out of various resources for hundreds of years  We typically overcome natural resource obstacles by inventing new technologies  The biggest recent technological improvements in oil production have been horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing as well as tertiary recovery from carbon dioxide and other solvents and surfactants that increase the recovery rates from existing fields  as well as deep water drilling  These methods are very expensive and are raising the marginal cost of production  TER  Let s talk about your stock picks in the mature basins  JY  Gale Force Petroleum Inc   GFP CVE  is focused on oil fields in East Texas  Its stock hasn t performed very well the last few months  but at the same time  its production just keeps growing  Last June  it was at 150 barrels per day  bbl d   and as of its latest report  it is producing more than 460 bbl d  Management has provided guidance of more than 800 bbl d by early next year  It is growing rapidly  It trades at a low enterprise value versus production multiple and a low cash flow multiple  At some point it will get big enough to catch a bid or will trade in line with its peers  TER  Why is Gale Force s share price not in line with production  JY  It s a Canada traded company located primarily in East Texas  Even though it has successfully grown production and deployed capital more efficiently than other  better known growing oil companies like Kodiak Oil   Gas Corp   KOG NYSE MKT   Gale Force does not have a big following or a natural shareholder base  Canadian investors aren t necessarily looking to get particular exposure to U S  oil fields  They may be looking for other Canadian fields  or international fields beyond North America  The Canadian energy market  particularly the Toronto Venture Exchange  has suffered and that has led to investors and investment banks circling the wagons  There is a move toward companies paying a dividend  or companies that are very well regarded by the Canadian investment banks  Small cap companies that the banks like get a lot of coverage and have maintained their multiples  It used to be that investors would intentionally try to find companies off the radar of the big banks  especially in Canada  because investors knew that out of favor companies today are the ones that will be the big winners over the next couple of years  Now  the dominant thinking in Canada is defensive  Money ends up in overvalued companies  But for the long term oriented value investor  an operationally sound company like Gale Force is going to trade up over time  Eventually  it won t matter whether people want to own it or not  because it will get bought out in the private market or repriced in the public market in line with its production and cash flow  TER  Can you talk more specifically about Gale Force s operations  JY  Gale Force made a big bet earlier this year on a field called Texas Reef  which is a multiple stacked pay field in East Texas  According to technical experts at formerly leading companies such as XTO Energy  now Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE    the Texas Reef is very similar to the Wolfberry vertical play in the Permian  with fracking and multiple stacked pays  Gale Force is in the process of proving that out  If Texas Reef works out similar to Wolfberry for Gale Force  it would have a significant impact on the upside potential and production growth to the company  If Gale Force drills  1 million   1M  wells  and gets between 50 and 250 bbl d  primarily oil  Gale Force will be able to even more rapidly ramp up production at a relatively low cost  and has hundreds of potential locations to develop  TER  Can you explain what a multiple stacked pay is  JY  Multiple stacked pay means that there are multiple geologic zones at different depths in the ground in a certain area  which each are capable of producing oil or gas  The idea with multiple stacked pay wells is that you can choose to simultaneously produce the most productive zones  Some wells produce from one zone  and some wells produce from five zones at once  Wells in the Wolfberry play in West Texas produce somewhere between two and six zones concurrently  In the Texas Reef play there are stacked zones that are potentially productive  One of the things that is compelling about a multiple stacked pay is that it helps derisk a vertical well  With vertical wells in a single zone area  you drill down  and if you miss the zone you aimed at  the well is uneconomic and you lose the money spent on drilling  But if you are drilling in a multiple stacked pay area  let s say you miss the first zone and you miss the second zone  Then you hit the third and fourth and miss the fifth  You still have two good zones  and will probably get an economic well  If you hit all five zones  or if one of the zones happens to be particularly productive  then you end up with a highly economic well  TER  Gale Force is scheduled to convert to a U S  based royalty trust in late 2013  What are the benefits or potential drawbacks of that form of ownership  JY  The valuations on royalty trusts and MLPs are many times Gale Force s current valuation  On an exit rate  EBITDA multiple  Gale Force is currently trading for less than  50 000 barrel oil equivalent per day  boe d  for the end of 2012  versus  250 000 boe d or higher for some royalty trusts and MLPs  TER  Does that make it an attractive takeover candidate  JY  I am surprised that a Canadian trust or a U S  upstream MLP hasn t made an offer already  Gale Force s attractiveness and profile will increase as it grows further  There is potentially a five times multiple uplift  If production doubles  there is potentially a 10 times valuation uplift  despite some amount of equity dilution  TER  Does the royalty trust system lock in the existing properties and restrict further development and expansion possibilities  JY  It depends on how you structure the trust  But converting to a trust is an exit strategy for Gale Force  The final valuation of the trust at conversion is the value that the shareholder walks away with from the deal  The trust s new owners buy in for the yield  TER  It sounds like a good idea to buy in to Gale Force before it converts  JY  It seems attractive to me  I own a lot of the stock  I ve helped Gale Force craft the strategy  and if the market for royalty trusts holds up and if Gale Force hits its production targets  a trust conversion should pay off meaningfully  particularly from the current valuation  TER  What are some of the other undervalued shallow oil plays that you re watching  JY  I was recently appointed to the board of Lucas Energy Inc   LEI NYSE MKT   I acquired almost 20  of the company in an SPV along with a business partner  and we were both appointed to the board  I can t say much about it  but it does have multiple stacked pays with Austin Chalk overlying Eagle Ford shale  and it is near extremely economic Eagle Ford wells drilled by EOG Resources Inc   EOG NYSE  and Marathon Oil Corp   MRO NYSE   And it is in a joint venture with Marathon  It also has acreage in the Woodbine play in East Texas  near Halcon Resources Corp   HK NASDAQ   TER  What juniors do you like in the Mississippi Lime  JY  Petro River Oil is doing a reverse merger that should close sometime soon into a company called Gravis Oil Corp   GRAVF OTCPK   It doesn t have a lot of production  but it has just over 100K net acres in the Mississippian  The enterprise value is roughly  20M  which is really exciting because it essentially trades for  200 per Mississippian acre  which is a fraction of the valuation of other public Mississippian focused companies  There are not a lot of Mississippian wells that have been drilled recently in the area  Encana Corp   ECA TSX  ECA NYSE  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  are very active in the area and we will soon see results  Petro River uses a similar methodology used by SandRidge Energy Inc   SD NYSE  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK NYSE  when they built their initial positions in the Mississippian  The methodology is looking at old vertical wells in the area and building lease positions near where the vertical wells indicate horizontal development would be most promising  Oil companies want to drill horizontal wells near where there are really successful vertical wells  because the really successful vertical wells indicate porosity and permeability  and oil   in the reservoir  TER  These are mostly U S  based companies  Do energy independence and finding safe jurisdictions play a role in your investment philosophy  JY  Absolutely  There are a number of different costs and issues associated with being in areas where contract law isn t firmly in place and where there are lots of risks  like Venezuela  I like to deal in areas with predictable risks  Obviously  there are always some unpredictable elements in an equity investment  But  expecting that Mozambique  for example  is going to respect your contract is a big assumption  Obviously  it is not a mistake for Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC NYSE  to drill for huge gas fields in East Africa  It will probably end up being worth it for it  but as a passive investor  given the types of value I m seeing in onshore U S  and onshore Canada  I am not sufficiently compensated to take that kind of risk  TER  Do you have a hedging strategy  JY  I hedge two ways by shorting overvalued or potentially fraudulent enterprises  or by hedging oil prices  Gale Force is very well hedged  and Petro River is not as well hedged  For an equity investment in Petro River  I d hedge more oil  either via puts or shorting an exchange traded fund or with futures  TER  Do you have any predictions for the oil and gas sector in 2013 in terms of adjusting a portfolio to take advantage of any changes that you foresee  JY  When the turn happens in the equity markets  stocks like Gale Force will rise  There has been a focus since the crash in 2008 2009 on larger  more liquid companies  Smaller companies have suffered  and the stocks of a lot of companies that have newly created value are not reflecting that value  Over the long run  small cap stocks outperform  Also  I think that natural gas has seen its bottom  Earlier this year  it was below  2 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf   The full cycle replacement cost for natural gas is over  4 Mcf gas  For instance  I like larger cap natural gas companies that have started to price in  4 or  4 50 gas  while smaller natural gas producers are still pricing in  3 50 gas or less  For instance  I like GeoMet Inc   GMET NASDAQ   which is priced at  3 50 or less  GeoMet is particularly interesting because it may be one of the most leveraged ways to get exposure to natural gas prices  It has less than  10M in market cap  versus producing tens of millions of cubic feet of natural gas per day and versus  120M in senior debt and over  40M of preferred stock  If GeoMet s properties are worth  200M on a PV 10 basis at the current natural gas strip price  that implies an equity value of four times the current market cap  And if natural gas goes slightly above the strip and trades to  4 50 in the next year  GeoMet s equity could be worth 10 times or more what it is currently trading for  Obviously leverage works both ways  but with sufficient hedges in place for the next couple of years  GeoMet will likely survive further volatility in natural gas prices and may be one of the most leveraged ways to get exposure to rising natural gas prices  TER  Thanks for your time  Josh  JY  You are welcome   is the founder and
