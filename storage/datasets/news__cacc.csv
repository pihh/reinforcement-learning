21435,242950,CACC,Higher Loans  Card Fees To Aid Cadence s  CADE  Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Cadence   NYSE CADE   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Apr 29  Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year 
Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check how the company performed in the past quarters 
Cadence has an impressive surprise history  It outpaced earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 5 7  
In the last reported quarter  the bank s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results were impacted by decline in fee income along with rise in expenses and provisions  However  growth in loan and deposits lent some support 
Cadence Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   However  activities of the company during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 49 cents remained unchanged over the last seven days  Nevertheless  it indicates an improvement of 6 5  from the prior year quarter s reported figure 
Also  the consensus estimate for sales of  182 8 million implies 57 5  growth 
Here is what our quantitative model predicts 
Cadence doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  5 80  
Zacks Rank  It carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we need to have positive Earnings ESP to be sure of an earnings beat 
Factors to Influence Q1 Results
Steady Net Interest Income Growth  A modest increase in lending   mainly in the areas of commercial and consumer   is expected to have led to improvement in net interest income  Also  the Fed rate hike in December 2018 should provide some support  partially offset by flattening and sometimes inversion of the yield curve in the to be reported quarter 
Fee Income Might Rise  With the improving economy  deposits are likely to have increased  leading to higher revenues from service charge on deposits  Also  per the  s data  demand for credit card loans likely picked pace in the last two months of the first quarter and might result in card related fees  In addition  trust income is likely to reflect improvement on strong equity markets 
Expenses Might Trend Higher  Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonal rise in employee compensation and benefits might have escalated costs moderately

In the last reported quarter  T  Rowe Price surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  on the back of higher revenues and assets under management  AUM   However  escalating expenses was a negative factor 
Further  the company has a decent earnings surprise history  It delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5 3  
T  Rowe Price Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    
Notably  activities of the company in the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 68 has remained stable over the past seven days  Also  the figure indicates year over year rise of 10 5  
Factors at Play
Revenue Growth Might be Muted  T  Rowe Price s efforts to improve its operating efficiency have resulted in top line growth over the past few years  We believe the company is well poised to sustain this uptrend in the near term 
However  AUM is likely to have declined this quarter as indicated by the company s monthly reports will offset the top line growth  Per the consensus estimate  total AUM is expected to decline 1 8  sequentially to  1 03 billion  Thus  given the decline in total AUM  performance fees and investment management fees are expected to have decreased 
Overall Outflows Expected  Significant volatility and corrections in equity markets resulted in substantial outflows during the fourth quarter  Thus  T  Rowe Price is expected to report outflows for the to be reported quarter 
Expenses to Escalate  The company incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients  Further  T  Rowe Price expects operating expenses to flare up in the range of 8 11  in 2018  Notably  the company anticipates capital expenditures for the current year to be approximately  170 million  including 70  for technology development 
Earnings Whispers
According to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for T  Rowe in the upcoming results  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better for this to happen  which is not the case here as elaborated below

In the last reported quarter  the Chicago  IL based online financial services provider displayed organic growth  Continued rise in revenues and loan growth were the key highlights  However  the results were partially offset by higher expenses

Moreover  the consensus estimate for revenues of  303 6 million reflects a rise of 24 6  from the prior year quarter 
Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check the factors that are expected to impact fourth quarter results 
Factors at Play
Growth in Loans  The company s efforts to grow loan portfolio by increasing awareness of its products are likely to have attracted new customers and thus result in higher loans originations in this quarter 
Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Might Impact Revenues  The company remains exposed to foreign exchange risks as it has businesses in the United Kingdom and Brazil  Thus  weakness in the British pound sterling during the fourth quarter on account of Brexit might result in lower international revenues of which 85 2  is generated from the United Kingdom 
Overall Revenues to Rise  Given the rise in loan and rising interest rates  overall revenues are likely to have increased during the quarter  Notably  management expects total revenues in the range of  290  310 million for the fourth quarter compared with  243 million earned in year ago quarter 
Expenses to Remain High  Enova s expenses are likely to have escalated during the quarter due to its efforts to attract new customers and marketing of new and existing products

Increase in revenues along with lower provisions supported the results  Also  the balance sheet remained strong during the fourth quarter  However  an increase in expenses posed a headwind 
After considering certain adjustments  net income was  151 9 million or  7 79 per share  down from  177 1 million or  9 10 per share in the prior year quarter 
For full year 2018  the company reported net income of  574 million or  29 39 per share  up from  470 2 million or  24 04 per share 
Revenues Improve  Expenses Rise
Total revenues in the reported quarter were  342 8 million  up 19 3  year over year  The increase was attributable to rise in all three components of revenues  Also  the reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  324 3 million

Operating expenses of  75 3 million rose 13 6  from the year ago quarter  The rise was due to an increase in salaries and wages  general expenses and sales and marketing expenses

Our Take
Credit Acceptance is well poised for growth in revenues given the continued rise in consumer loans  Furthermore  backed by a solid capital position  the company is expected to enhance shareholder value through continued share repurchases  However  increasing expenses might hurt bottom line growth to some extent  Moreover  use of high debt remains a matter of concern

21533,243048,CACC,Ally Financial s Ratings Upgraded By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Ally Financial s   NYSE ALLY   ratings have been upgraded by Moody s Investors Service  The outlook for the company remains stable 
Ally Financial s issuer rating witnessed a progress from Ba3 to Ba2  Further  its senior unsecured medium term note program and senior unsecured regular bond debenture rating have been raised from Ba3 to Ba2 
Reasons Behind Rating Upgrade
Ally Financial witnessed continued improvement in its funding profile backed by the stabilized performance in the auto portfolio and sustained growth in deposits  Over the last three years  the company recorded 20  annual growth in deposits 
Per Moody s  Ally Financial has been able to raise deposits and hold a considerable portion of existing depositors through the recent interest rate hikes 
The company s ratio of market funds as a percentage of tangible banking assets fell significantly during the same period  Ally Financial s funding profile now comprises 11  secured debt and 8  unsecured debt 
Moreover  Ally Financial has been able to grow its used auto loan portfolio to more than 50  of retail auto originations for 2018 
What Can Further Boost Ally s Ratings 
A further upgrade in ratings is possible if Ally Financial continues to grow its deposit base and reasonably underwrites growing auto channels  A prudent diversification of the overall portfolio may also result in a ratings upgrade 
What Can Bring Down Ratings 
A rating downgrade could occur if there is a significant decline in the deposit base  A decline in franchised dealer relationship may also lead to a rating downgrade  Further  if growth in riskier credit quality assets hurts asset performance and weakens financial metrics  there might be a rating downgrade 
In the past three months  Ally Financial s shares have gained 4   as against the  s decline of 6 6

21600,243115,CACC,5 Finance Stocks That Crushed Buffett s Berkshire In 2018 ,opinion,"The year  which began on a positive note for the finance sector in the form of rate hikes  eased regulations and lower corporate tax  failed to boost share price of the companies toward the tail end of the year  This was due to investors  worries over inversion of the yield curve and other persistent global tensions  majorly uncertainty over Brexit and U S  China trade war   which overshadowed positive factors 
The stressed conditions led to a year to date decline of 1  in share price of Berkshire Hathaway   a company run by the Wall Street s most renowned investment guru   Warren Buffet 
Buffet displayed his knack for investment by transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a mere textile company into a conglomerate with more than 90 subsidiaries engaged in businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance  The company in itself can serve as a benchmark as it is well diversified 

Factors That Affected Berkshire in 2018
Banks and insurers typically gain from steepening of yield curve  which benefits investment income   which is also an important component of Berkshire Hathaway s insurance business top line 
However  the yield curve recently inverted  indicating that short term rates are higher than the long term rates  This also suggests that the Federal Reserve might alter its aggressive stance to raising short term rates  further impacting interest income 
Notably  the tech giant   Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    is a considerably large part of Berkshire s equity holding  which has fallen nearly 2  so far this year  majorly over trade war concerns  This might be another reason that shook investors  confidence in the mega stock 
Factors That Affected the Overall Finance Sector
At the global level  fears of slowdown in the global economy  raised by a series of weak economic reports released in the United States  China and several countries of the European Union  contributed to the stocks losing steam 
Also  lingering trade related conflicts with the United States  and the U K  s scheduled exit from EU in March 2019  with or without a deal  might have an adverse impact on the global economic growth 
These concerns have led to a decline in major indices as well  The S P 500 Financials  Sector  Index has decreased 14 9  so far this year  Also  the Zacks  Sector has witnessed a decline of 14  in the same time period 
5 Stocks That Outperformed Berkshire in 2018
While the above factors affect all the financial stocks  there are still some companies that have been able to brave these challenges and sustained an upswing in prices  Strong fundamentals and strategic moves might have helped these companies enhance investor confidence 
In order to save investors from the time taking process of identifying the key winners that crushed Buffett s Berkshire and are likely to gain further  we have created a three faceted screen using the  
At first  we looked for stocks that have gained more than 10  so far this year and have projected annualized earnings per share growth rate  for the next three to five years  of at least 5

The Trump administration has been quite aggressively attributing the discouraging performance of the U S  stock market to the latest increase in federal funds rates  The hike in rates  no doubt  increases the cost of lending money from financial institutions for small and medium business houses  This in turn could exert more pressure on the U S  economy that is on the cusp of a slowdown next year Fed may argue that the economy is in good shape but it has failed to consider key factors that may mar prospects in the near term like trade tensions between the United States and China over high tariffs  Such a trade war could easily lead to a domestic recession at a time when the global economy is already demonstrating signs of a slowdown Trump criticized Fed chairman Jerome H  Powell for the market slide after the central bank hiked rates last week and gave ample indication of further hikes next year  Also  stoking nervousness was a tweet from Steven Mnuchin to evaluate the heath of the banking system  This raised a lot of doubt about liquidity among financial institutions that had earlier not been raised   Mnuchin contacted chief executives of six major banks to make sure they were operating smoothly and had  ample liquidity available for lending  In the United States  investors are keenly watching the partial shutdown of the federal government in the midst of a deadlock between the White House and lawmakers over the President s intention of securing financing for a wall on the border with Mexico The Winning StrategyAs the broader market extends its losses  smart investors should look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 Even though low beta stocks pose less risk  they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually on a 2 month basis  Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future  After all  earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metric that measures the fundamental strength of the company  To top it  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  5 Solid BetsCasey s General Stores  Inc    NASDAQ CASY   operates convenience stores under the Casey s and Casey s General Store names  The company s stores offer a selection of food  including freshly prepared foods  The company has a beta of 0 51  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 5 2  in the last 60 days  The company is expected to return 21 6  next quarter in contrast to the  industry s expected decline of 5 6  Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   is a molecular diagnostic company  The company has a beta of 0 36  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 5 4  in the last 60 days  The company is expected to return 38 7  next quarter  higher than the  industry s projected return of 35 1  Spirit Airlines  Inc    NYSE SAVE   provides low fare airline services  The company has a beta of 0 24  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 18 8  in the last 60 days  The company is expected to return 56 8  next quarter in contrast to the  industry s expected decline of 46 9  Northrim BanCorp  Inc    NASDAQ NRIM   provides commercial banking products and services to businesses and professionals in Alaska  The company has a beta of 0 74  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 3 5  in the last 60 days  The company is expected to return almost 19  next quarter  higher than the  industry s projected return of 3 8  Credit Acceptance Corporation   NASDAQ CACC   provides financing programs and related products and services to independent and franchised automobile dealers in the United States  The company has a beta of 0 52  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 3 4  in the last 60 days  The company is expected to return 17  next quarter  higher than the  industry s estimated return of 1 8  In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 top tickers to buy and hold for the entirety of 2019 These 10 are painstakingly handpicked from over 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  They are our primary picks poised to outperform in the year ahead ",2018-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-political-tumult-shrouds-markets-5-safe-picks-200370927,200370927

Shares of Navient have lost 15 1  year to date compared with 5 5  decline of the  it belongs to 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has been revised 1 1  downward over the past 90 days  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  

Navient s top line remains under pressure due to the declining FFELP  Federal Family Education Loan Program  loan portfolio  Interest earned on FFELP loans is primarily indexed to one month LIBOR rates  whereas the cost of funds is mainly indexed to three month LIBOR rates  In the rising interest rate environment  this difference in timing may create pressure on net interest margin for FFELP loans  On the other hand  rise in interest rates might also lower Navient s floor income 
Escalating expenses is another key concern for Navient  After separation from Sallie Mae   NASDAQ SLM    Navient stands liable for payment of all regulatory orders  except the penalty charges that are directly imposed on Sallie Mae  Also  ongoing litigation issues remain an added concern as they might result in high legal costs 
Lately  Navient has been focused on opportunities that would help boost its business  In April 2017  its acquisition of educational loan portfolio from JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   consisting of federally guaranteed student loans and whole private education loans was encouraging  Also  this deal is expected to contribute 9 cents to earnings per share in 2017

ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Financials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 20 to 506   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Financials sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any Financials ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and

Figure 3 shows that 91 out of the 582 stocks  only 1  of the total net assets  held by Financials ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  Due to the low allocation of total net

sold The takeaway is  too many Financial sector mutual fund managers and ETFs are picking the wrong stocks  Their fees are undeserved  no matter how low  Figure 3  Financials Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management    Investors need to avoid all Financials ETFs and mutual funds  only 5 ETFs and 1 mutual fund earns my Neutral rating and should be held  All of ETFs and mutual funds should be sold  Investors seeking exposure to the Financials sector should focus on the 85 stocks in the Financials sector that earn an Attractive or better rating    Credit Acceptance Corp  CACC  is one of my favorite stocks held by Financials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  CACC has a proven track record of effective capital stewardship with a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 28  in 2011  which places the company in the 94th percentile of all Russell 3000 companies  CACC is not only a good company  it is also an attractive stock due to the market s pessimistic view of future cash flows  The company s current stock price    92 16  implies that after tax profits  NOPAT  will permanently decrease by 10   This seems unlikely given that the company has increased its profits by an average of 35  over the past six years  Low expectations and strong historical performance make CACC an excellent long candidate    Health Care REIT  Inc   HCN  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Financials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  In the worst sector  HCN is one of the worst stocks  HCN has misleading earnings   its economic earnings are negative and declining while its reports accounting earnings are positive and increasing  Only twice during the 14 years in my model has the company generated positive economic earnings  with 2008 being the most recent period  Not only is HCN not profitable  it is also overvalued  To justify its current stock price    59 56   the company must increase profits by 14 1  compounded annually for 34 years  That is a lot of future value creation for a company that has mostly destroyed value  Investors should avoid this stock    Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Financials ETFs and

22010,243525,CACC,Will Capital One Beat Estimates ,opinion,"We anticipate Capital One Financial Corporation  NYSE COF  to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2014 results tomorrow  Jul 17 after the market closes Why a Likely Positive Surprise  Our proven model shows that Capital One is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components Positive Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 12   This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company Zacks  2 Rank  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement    The combination of Capital One s Zacks Rank  2 and ESP of  1 12  makes us confident of an earnings beat on Jul 17 Factors to Drive Q2 Results We believe that following the integration of two major acquisitions  Capital One will likely report a decline in the quarter s operating expenses  However  this could somewhat be offset by an increase in compliance costs and compensation expenses  Capital One s credit quality is expected to remain strong  With the overall economic recovery  albeit slow   provision for credit losses would likely decrease  Moreover  Capital One delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of four trailing quarters  with an average earnings beat of 8 9  
Also  Capital One s activities during the quarter were satisfactory enough to win analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased nearly 1  to  1 79 per share over the last 7 days  However  the overall tough industry background  which continued through the second quarter as well  will likely pressurize revenue growth  Further  given the low rate environment  we foresee persistent pressure on Capital One s interest income Other Stocks to Consider Capital One is not the only firm looking up this earnings season  We also anticipate earnings beat from three other companies in this industry 
Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  has an earnings ESP of  0 76  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report results on Jul 22 
The earnings ESP of Credit Acceptance Corporation  NASDAQ CACC  is  2 39  and it has a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to release results on Jul 29 
Ally Financial  NYSE ALLY  has an earnings ESP of  3 13  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is slated to report results on Jul 29 ",2014-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-capital-one-beat-estimates-219657,219657
22011,243526,CACC,Subprime Auto Loans  Protect Yourself From the Looming Bubble,opinion,"Auto loans have been on a tear lately  soaring from  800 billion in 2008 to more than  1 trillion today  The chart above illustrates their parabolic growth  And thanks to super low interest rates  auto loans should continue to climb through the rest of 2016 
Now  you might be inclined to view today s chart as a bullish sign for automakers  But  as I ll show you  it s more likely a sign of trouble ahead 
For one thing  interest rates can t get much lower  And unlike sovereign yields  car loans won t drop into negative territory   After all  no logical lender would directly pay you to take its loan   So  if rates can t drop  there s only one way for them to move    up 
When it happens  it will put downward pressure on car loans  especially for a hugely profitable subset of the market     subprime auto loans 
According to Experian Automotive  subprime loans for Q1 2016 are up almost 11  year over year  Roughly one in five car loans goes to subprime borrowers 
So  risky lending is on the rise  Which is a setup for disaster  and defaults  
In fact  more auto loans are already starting to default  In early 2016  the number of auto loan payments at least 30 days past due climbed to over 2  of total auto loans 
It isn t a good sign 
To avoid the inevitable fallout  avoid investing in securities that include subprime auto loans   or just auto loans in general 
For example  Credit Acceptance Corporation  NASDAQ CACC  helps originate and service auto loans  Its revenue is up over the past year  but the company s share price has dropped  Even founder Donald Foss has been  
With only  9 million in cash and more than  2 billion in debt  Credit Acceptance Corp  isn t well positioned  Over the next several months  shares are likely to slip further 
Our chart may look bullish to some  But in reality  it s showing quite a bubble  You ll want to make sure you re not around when it pops ",2016-07-17,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/subprime-auto-loans:-protect-yourself-from-the-looming-bubble-200142248,200142248
22021,243536,CACC,Can The Uptrend Continue For Credit Acceptance  CACC  ,opinion,Investors certainly have to be happy with Credit Acceptance Corp    NASDAQ CACC   and its short term performance  After all  the stock has jumped by 16 5  in the past 4 weeks  and it is also above its 20 Day Simple Moving Average as well  This is certainly a good trend  but investors are probably asking themselves  can this positive trend continue for CACC While we can never know for sure  it is pretty encouraging that estimates for CACC have moved higher in the past few weeks  meaning that analyst sentiment is moving in the right way  Plus  the stock actually has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   so the recent move higher for this spotlighted company may definitely continue over the next few weeks ,2016-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-the-uptrend-continue-for-credit-acceptance-(cacc)-200142488,200142488

available on Credit Acceptance s website At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Credit Acceptance s Senior Vice President and Treasurer  Doug Busk Douglas W  Busk    Senior Vice President and TreasurerThank you  Good afternoon  and welcome to the Credit Acceptance Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call As you read our news release posted on the Investor Relations section of our

showing how non GAAP measures reconcile to GAAP measures At this time  Brett Roberts  our Chief Executive Officer  Ken Booth  our Chief Financial Officer and I will take your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Thanks  I was hoping you    Doug  you could talk a little bit about the market in the fourth quarter  because it just feels like you had a pretty significant  again  deceleration  And I know you called out the October numbers last quarter  but that seems to have continued  The volume has kind of come down 25  to 30  over the last 18 months And then it also just feels like the    your estimates were kind of up through the nine months of the year  but then kind of down in terms of cash flows in the fourth quarter for each of the last three years  So  can you just talk about what s going on that would drive that  And I ve got a follow up also  Thanks Douglas W  Busk    Senior Vice President and TreasurerYeah  I think with respect to the cash flow forecast  down  17 7 million for the quarter  even though it s a down quarter  it s still a pretty small number  We re up for the year given the magnitude of the cash flows that we re trying to forecast about  9 17  Phonetic  billion is a pretty small number  So it s a negative data point  but a very small one and not one I m too concerned about With respect to the volume  we re obviously trying to grow the business  So from that perspective  it didn t meet our objective during the quarter  But I think if I break down the numbers in the quarter  volumes per dealer was down year over year  but sequentially pretty close to what you might guess if you just looked at the history  probably the only number    attrition  again  close to what you might expect given the history  The only number that was maybe different than the trend line was the new dealer signups  Again  if you look at the history there  you d probably expect new dealers to be somewhere in the 900 to 1 000 range  And it was less than that Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystAny thoughts about what that might mean  I mean  three months ago you did kind of liberalized some of the standards for taking new dealers Douglas W  Busk    Senior Vice President and TreasurerYeah  I don t know if we liberalized the standards  I mean  we changed the enrollment fee  I think what we saw during the quarter is  our field sales force gave us feedback that they have standards that they have to meet for a new dealer enrollments  They thought those standards were too harsh  They thought it was causing them to spend more time enrolling dealers  when they would like more discretion to spend their time with the existing dealers  So we relaxed those standards  we immediately saw a reduction in new dealer enrollments  And whether that change will payoff long term  We don t know at this stage Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  My follow up question really is  this is the fourth quarter of the year  we don t get the 10 Q along with earnings  I mean  are there disclosures that we would have gotten  either as to CECL updates  And what you might be doing come first quarter in terms of the way you re going to report under CECL or any other relevant disclosures that we would have had from that filing Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorWell  again  we ll provide estimated financial impacts on our 10 K  which will be filed in fairly short order  As of now  we don t expect to make any material changes to the estimates that we provided in Q3 Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thanks OperatorThank you  our next question comes from the line of John Hecht from Jefferies  Your line is now open John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  guys  Just going a little bit more into the dealership activity  You cited that there s the net    the net loss  which was a little bit off trendline this quarter  Looking back  we ve seen certain second quarters and fourth quarters where there has been a net reduction  I m wondering is there anything seasonal with respect to kind of the selling process  And that we should be thinking about  And kind of just your color on the dealership channel  if you would kind of hit your potential target market share  Is there still a lot of opportunity for you to grow and what are kind of trends in that environment Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorWhen you refer to net loss  what are you talking about John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystYour net dealers Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorOr just the number of dealers in the quarter versus the sequential quarter John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystCorrect Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  I think the two big components there are attrition and new dealer signups  I think attrition was in line with    if you look at the history of fourth quarters  the attrition we reported was pretty much in the range of what you ve seen historically  maybe a little better than what you might expect  The number that was off was the new dealer enrollments  which I just talked about John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystAnd do you    is there any thoughts on what the    how big the market is and how much you ve penetrated in that regard Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI mean  there s a awful lot of dealers out there  60 000  80 000 dealers depending on what database you use  Just like there is turnover in our dealer base  there s turnover in that dealer base generally as dealers are bought  sold  handed down to kids  new GM  etc  So it s really tough to say what the total addressable market is  So it s    I mean  we think there s a lot of room  But  obviously  the recent trend line isn t very encouraging John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then  last question is  just looking at the spread trends  obviously  over the course of the last eight or nine years  certainly it s been a changing competitive market deeper in the economic cycle  But I m wondering  is part of the spread contraction tied to duration or anything  And maybe can you give us any color on what would change  What would change in the market to why you do see an increasing spread Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorIt s a very competitive market  no question about that  We ve said that in prior quarters  That continued to be the case in this quarter  We ve also referred in prior quarters that we don t price by spread  I think if you look at the 10 K or even the last 10 Q  there s some pretty good information in there on the economics of the loans that we re originating  So I would probably just refer you to that  And the spread table  some we ve had in there for many years  Our lenders like to see it  so we ve continued to include it  but I think really the more relevant information is in the Q and the K  From that perspective I think we re pretty happy with the economics of the business we re writing  We just like to write a little bit more of it John Hecht    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic from Stephens  Your line is now open Vincent Caintic    Stephens Inc     AnalystHey  thank you  Good afternoon  Just kind of a follow up for the same    similar topic  But    so looking at the unit volume and the dollar volume of that trajectory downward  just when you re thinking about 2020  do you expect more of the same  Are there  changes or maybe this month  you ve seen an inflection to the upside  And maybe is this trend a    so is it just competition  It s a cyclical thing  Or is it    is it a secular thing that s cyclical event or it maybe in the late stage or is there something else to it  Thank you Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI mean  we ve been in a very  very competitive period for a long time  really  since late 2011  2012  It appears that the competitive environment has gotten more intense recently  In terms of 2020  we don t have the ability to forecast what the competitive environment is going to be any better than anyone else  So I really can t provide you with an answer to your question on what we see Vincent Caintic    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  Got it  I guess  maybe compared to what you ve seen in the past in an intense competitive cycles  but maybe in an environment where  I don t know  if car sales are slowing  if used car prices are declining  What have you    any historical takeaways that you could point to Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorTypically  the market turns when there s some interruption in the supply of capital  But we haven t been through    we ve been through a few cycles  but the cycles take a long time to play out  So we don t have a tremendous number of data points to look at  but historically that s been the case where the capital supply gets interrupted and that s what changes the market dynamics  So  we ll see if that s the same thing this time Vincent Caintic    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  Got you  So if that s the case  I guess  is the applications    I guess the application sort of funnel is coming in  but you re kind of not seeing the economics of this applications compared to whoever else is winning the deal  It s just the economics are being eroded  Or is it that  that the applications are declining or a mix of both Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI think we re    as we said a minute ago  we re pretty happy with the economics of the profit per unit part of the equation  We just like to figure out how to grow the business little bit better than we have been Vincent Caintic    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  got it  Thanks so much for the help OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Tuteja from Jarislowsky  Fraser  Your line is now open Arjun Tuteja    Jarislowsky  Fraser Ltd     AnalystHey  Brett  I have a high level question on work culture  So Credit Acceptance is featured as top hundred companies to work for pretty regularly  So going back in history  can you talk a little bit about the steps you had to take to get there  I m curious  because a lot of your employees are likely dealing with consumers and financial stress  So I m curious  how do you create a positive work environment in such circumstances Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThat s a good question  It took us a long time  We started to focus on it many  many years ago  I think  we spent a lot of time communicating  do town hall meetings every quarter where I meet with every team member  Every quarter that can ask me a question online  I ll answer it in writing and post it for everyone to see  We do    I do lots of round tables where I sit with team members and we discuss the business  Other leaders do that as well  We do quarterly surveys  So we put a lot of emphasis on the communication process I think hiring is a big part of it  You got to bring the right people into your organization  consistent with our core values that we ve articulated  And those are some of the big things  You got to have the right people  It s not one thing  but it s been a journey over a long period of time  I d    I think the framework that the Great Place to Work Organization uses is a pretty good one that talks about trust  pride  camaraderie  And so I would encourage you  if you re looking to move in that direction to just embrace that framework and do all the things that they tell you to do Arjun Tuteja    Jarislowsky  Fraser Ltd     AnalystAnd when you talk about communication  are you saying that employees feel more valued when they are listened to  Is that s what you re trying to say there Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  No question Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think in addition to listening  maybe this is obvious  but we get a tremendous amount of feedback from team members from a variety of channels  I think the important thing is  we respond to that feedback  So  we ask them  we tell them we need more information  we state what our position is  or we take action  And then we report out what we ve done  So I think that makes employees feel like they re listened to and makes employees feel like they re empowered Arjun Tuteja    Jarislowsky  Fraser Ltd     AnalystOkay  Okay  And I have one more on your sales team  So  you hired quite a lot of sales people over the last three years  So have they all ramped up to what you would call a steady state productivity  Or do you still see some improvement in per person productivity there Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorIt s a work in process  I think  at this point  We ramped it up pretty quickly  I think the market in my opinion has gotten more difficult  which makes it a little bit tougher to see whether you re on track  But  Indecipherable  we still have some work to do to get to productivity where we d like it to be Arjun Tuteja    Jarislowsky  Fraser Ltd     AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Weinger from 3 Sigma Value  Your line is now open Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystHi  thanks  Just you said on the last call that there s going to be    there s no change to the economics of the business because of CECL  but you re grossing up the value of your loans  so there ll be more assets  So you ll have a bigger balance sheet generating the same level of cash flows  So  your return on assets will decline  Is that not correct Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerNo  Your net asset will be unchanged  And for the existing book  your net asset will be unchanged until that portfolio runs off  For the new loans  your assets will actually be lower  The larger point is you don t change the economics of the business by accounting for it differently Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystWhat I m saying is that your balance sheet is larger now Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerYour re wrong about that Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystThere s more assets on your balance sheet Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerYour are wrong about that  A second thing you re wrong about  which is  that accounting doesn t drive economics  so you re wrong on both points Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystSo you re not going to have a larger balance sheet because of CECL Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystOkay  And also just confirm that there ll be no decrease in your book value upon CECL adoption Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Benjamin Weinger    3 Sigma Value    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna from BTIG  Your line is now open Giuliano Bologna    BTIG    AnalystThank you  and good afternoon  I guess jumping into kind of a little more of a high level question  but since you ve taken out the enrollment fee from the business  have you seen any real change in dealer signups or the pace of dealer signups since then Brett A  Roberts    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI think the numbers for the quarter sort of answer that question  New dealer signups were  as I mentioned  were lower than the trend line  We had 753 new active dealers this quarter  951 a quarter before  over a 1 000 in the second quarter  So if you look at that trend line  there was a fall off in Q4 and I went through what I thought the reasons for that were Giuliano Bologna    BTIG    AnalystThen on a slightly different question  It looks like there was a couple of revisions to the forecast of cash flows  It looks like the  18 vintage came down about 30 bips and then the  19 vintage came down 20 bips  And it seems like it s the first time since  call it  the first quarter of  18 the dealer loan portfolio has had a negative revision or the purchase loan  I should say  Is there anything specific driving that  Is it collections  Is it recoveries on repossessions or anything specific driving those numbers Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerThe revisions  again  as Brett mentioned earlier  are very small in the context of the  9 billion in net cash flows we re trying to forecast  And there wasn t any one factor that accounted for the majority of the change Giuliano Bologna    BTIG    AnalystThat sounds good  And the only other thing to have a look at is  when we look at your expenses  obviously  you had a ramp up on the sales force side in terms of increasing your expense base  Is there anything that would continue to drive the expense base higher at the same rate  Or should we expect the expense base to taper off as originations come down Kenneth S  Booth    Chief Financial OfficerI mean  I think it    part of it is just dependent on the level of growth from the business and part of it s just dependent on the investments that we think we need to make in the business that aren t directly correlated with immediate growth  So tough to    like I said earlier  tough to predict the growth rate  And the investments in the business have historically been lumpy and I would expect that they d continue to be in the future Giuliano Bologna    BTIG    AnalystGot it  Thank you  and thanks for taking my questions OperatorThank you  With no further questions in the queue  I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr  Busk for any additional or closing remarks Douglas W  Busk    Senior Vice President and TreasurerWe d like to thank everyone for their support and
