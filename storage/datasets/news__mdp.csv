103803,325318,MDP,Should Value Investors Consider Meredith  MDP  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Meredith Corporation   NYSE MDP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Meredith has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Meredith s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Meredith has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Meredith stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Meredith has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MDP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Meredith currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Meredith a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 5  which is far better than the industry average of 39 1  Clearly  MDP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Meredith might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives MDP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 39 8  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 20 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Meredith Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMeredith is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well

103842,325357,MDP,Is Meredith  MDP  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Meredith Corporation   NYSE MDP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Meredith has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Meredith s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Publishing   Periodicals industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Meredith has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Meredith stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Meredith has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Meredith currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Meredith a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 9  which is far better than the industry average of 40 6  Clearly  MDP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Meredith might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives MDP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen seven no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 39  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 34   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Meredith Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMeredith is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 1  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-02-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-meredith-mdp-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200288382,200288382
103843,325358,MDP,Brave The Market Correction With These 6 Defensive Stocks,opinion,Investors  woes continued on Thursday after U S  markets officially entered correction territory  Fears emanating from the increase in interest rates and new found volatility continued to weigh on market sentiment  These concerns  which caused Monday s losses  continued to haunt the markets on a day when both the Dow and the S P 500 went into correction mode for the first time in two years At this point  opinion is divided over whether this is only a healthy correction or the beginning of what could become a full fledged bear market  What is certain is that fear has made a comeback to the markets and a few weeks of volatile trading are more than likely  In such an environment  investors would do well to invest in defensive stocks that have the ability to protect past gains during the rocky trading sessions ahead Rising Yields Spike Markets  RallyDuring this week  the 10 year Treasury yield has moved above 2 85  twice  Both these instances have been followed by wide spread losses for stocks  On Wednesday  the 10 year U S  Treasury note increased from 2 843  to 2 851   marginally lower than the highest level witnessed in early 2014  Meanwhile  average year on year hourly earnings for January increased to 2 9   the highest since June 2009 The record increase in wages led to concerns that retail prices would increase  Such fears  taken together with soaring yields  led to speculation that the pace of rate hikes would likely quicken over the year This is the phenomenon which is believed to be responsible for stocks entering correction mode  The collapse in volatility related investments  attributable primarily to algorithmic trading  was no less responsible for the plight Massive Loss in Market ValueThe scale of recent losses can be gauged from the amount of market value erased since the S P 500 hit a record high on Jan 26  A total of  2 49 trillion in market value has been erased since then  mostly during this week s sharp declines  The situation for global markets is even grimmer  Nearly  5 2 trillion has been erased worldwide since most of these bourses were mimicking the gains of U S  markets   The question haunting investors at this point is whether the current situation has the makings of a bear market  With markets already in correction mode  we are possibly looking at another four months of losses and uncertainty  per historical data  However  if a bear market ensues  during which markets will lose another 10   then 22 months would pass until the market scales January s highs once again  Such a possibility  though unlikely at this time  does continue to exist   Our ChoicesMarkets have just entered correction mode and investors are continuing to grapple with surging bond yields and the specter of a faster than expected increase in interest rates  Meanwhile  the market s fear gauge continues to creep up  leading to losses for volatility related bets  which in turn are triggering greater uncertainty Against this backdrop  investors would do well to invest in defensive stocks  Such stocks provide steady earnings and dividends irrespective of prevailing market conditions  Typically  utilities and consumer staples  whose demand remains undiminished even during tough times  are considered to be defensive stocks  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics The Boston Beer Company Inc    NYSE SAM   is the largest craft brewer in the United States Boston Beer has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company has expected earnings growth of 15 2  for the current year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 5 9  over the last 30

ago period  while revenue will rise 4 7   In the first quarter  earnings of S P 500 companies increased 13 3   while revenues rose 7   which is the highest growth rate in nearly two years The performance of the Index is not restricted to a single sector  and of the 16 Zacks sectors  five are anticipated to witness an earnings decline in Q2  with Autos  Conglomerates and Utilities acting as a drag  As far as  sector is concerned  the total earnings of the sector are anticipated to increase 3 6   while revenues are estimated to advance 11 3   Publishing stocks form part of the consumer staples sector Let s Take a Glance at Publishing IndustryThe U S  publishing industry has been grappling with sinking advertising revenues for quite some time now  and the global economic slowdown has only worsened the situation  The downturn in the publishing industry witnessed in the last few years is largely due to a decline in print readership  More and more readers started opting for online news  consequently making the print advertising model increasingly irrelevant To counter the downtrend in the print revenues  publishing companies are adapting to the changing face of the multi platform media universe  which currently includes Internet  mobile  tablet  social media networks and outdoor video advertising in its portfolio Let s take a sneak peek at two Publishing stocks which

diversifying business  adding new revenue streams  strengthening balance sheet along with restructuring portfolio  It has offloaded assets in order to re focus on core newspapers and pay more

103922,325437,MDP,Meredith   Time Stock Soar After Merger Announcement ,opinion,"Shares of Meredith   NYSE MDP   and Time Inc    NYSE TIME   surged on Monday morning following an official announcement that Meredith agreed to purchase the publisher of Time and People 
Meredith  the media company that owns magazine publications such as Better Homes   Gardens and Family Circle  announced on Sunday that it reached a  binding agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Time Inc  
Meredith agreed to purchase shares of Time for  18 50 per share  which marks a roughly a 9 5  premium compared to Friday s closing price  The all cash deal including the assumption of Time s debt is valued at  2 8 billion  according to company   An influx of  650 million in financial backing from Koch Equity Development helped push the merger through 
Both companies  boards unanimously approved the deal that is expected to close in about  
Talks of a Meredith and Time deal first popped up in   Merger negations also fell apart earlier this year  However  two weeks ago  reports began to surface that the Koch brothers would try to help Meredith buy Time  This news helped renew many Time investors  hopes that a buyout might finally happen 
Time has struggled recently and changed some of its business practices in order to cope with the downturn  The company is set to cut down the number of print issues of the once weekly Sports Illustratedto 27 in 2018  after limiting the historic sports publication to 38 in 2017 
The publisher of Time also made an aggressive shift to video  and even recently announced its second streaming television channel   Sports Illustrated TV  
 We are creating a premier media company serving nearly 200 million American consumers across industry leading digital  television  print  video  mobile  and social platforms positioned for growth   Meredith CEO Stephen Lacy said in a statement 
 We are adding the rich content creation capabilities of some of the media industry s strongest national brands to a powerful local television business that is generating record earnings  offering advertisers and marketers unparalleled reach to American adults  We are also creating a powerful digital media business with 170 million monthly unique visitors in the U S  and over 10 billion annual video views  enhancing Meredith s leadership position in reaching Millennials

103937,325452,MDP,9 Fairly Valued Mid Cap Consumer Discretionary Dividend Growth Stocks,opinion,"Introduction
Mid cap stocks are often overlooked by investors and not widely covered on Wall Street or many financial websites and blogs  However  I consider it a mistake because there are many mid size companies that are attractive long term investment opportunities 
Moreover  in the general sense  smaller companies tend to have more room to grow than their larger more well known counterparts  Consequently  if a larger total return is part of your investment objectives  then high quality growing mid caps might be just the ticket 
Although mid caps generally have more room to grow  not all mid caps are growing enterprises  In fact  mid cap companies can be found in virtually every industry or sector  and like all companies  possess their own unique characteristics and fundamental metrics  Some mid caps are growth stocks  some are dividend growth stocks and some offer high yield and everything in between  Therefore  as it is with all stocks  selectivity is the key to success 
This article focuses specifically on dividend paying consumer discretionary mid cap stocks  Even though some of the following names are relatively small  most of them are widely recognized companies  Furthermore  regardless whether your investment objective is growth or yield  there may be something in the following group for everyone 
9 Fairly Valued Mid Cap Consumer Discretionary Dividend Growth Stocks
The following portfolio review summarizes the 9 fairly valued mid cap dividend growth stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The portfolio review lists them by ticker  name  credit rating  sector  dividend yield  market cap and long term debt to capital 

Since many readers may not be familiar with each of these mid cap selections  I offer the following overview of each of the nine research candidates  Courtesy of S P Capital IQ  I also included a short business description on each  Additionally  I have provided earnings and price correlated historical F A S T  Graphs on each with a calculated return forecast out to 2017 based on what I considered the most appropriate valuation reference line 
F A S T  Graphs  Tutorial 
In order for the reader to get the maximum benefit from the following presentation  I offer a short tutorial illustrating the various components presented in a F A S T  Graphs   To accomplish this  I will present each component of the graph separately as I rebuild an entire graph  I have chosen TTupperware Brands Corporation  NYSE TUP  as my tutorial example 
My first screenshot reflects a plotting of earnings per share  The green shaded area represents a mountain chart of the company s earnings over the timeframe drawn  The orange valuation reference line contains two important aspects 
The first aspect is a multiple of earnings  P E ratio  that is listed in the orange colored rectangle  red circle  in the FAST FACTS to the right of the graph  In this example  the orange line represents a P E ratio of 15  In other words  any time the stock price touches the orange line anywhere on the graph in this example it will be trading at a P E ratio of 15 
The second aspect of the orange line is the slope which is equal to the earnings growth rate  In this example  the orange line is increasing at the earnings growth rate  the green rectangle in FAST FACTS  of 7 3   yellow circle   Although there is some cyclicality with earnings in between  this growth rate is calculated as the annualized growth from the first year s earnings per share to the last year on the graph 

With my second screenshot I overlay monthly closing stock prices  This illustrates how stock prices move in conjunction with earnings over the long run  Moreover  periods of overvaluation  when price is above the orange line   fair valuation  when price is touching the orange line  and undervaluation  when price is below the orange line  is clearly revealed  Most importantly  since stock price tracks earnings  it is clear that the company s earnings achievement is what drives the capital appreciation component  growth portion  of total return 

This next screenshot adds a second valuation reference line  the dark blue line  which is a calculated normal P E ratio for the timeframe drawn  In this example  the normal P E ratio line represents a multiple of 13 4  red circle   With both of these valuation reference lines on the graph  a clear perspective of a range of valuation  in this example that range is a P E ratio of 13 4   15  is revealed for analysis 

This next screenshot adds a plotting of the company s dividends per share prior to being paid out of earnings  The area below the light green line  it appears white to many people  represents the portion of earnings paid out to shareholders  Therefore  the company s dividend payout ratio  POR  for any historical year is graphically presented for instant reference 

This next screenshot presents a second dividend reference  The light green shaded area above the orange line indicates the same dividends seen above after they have been paid out to shareholders  This light green shaded area  dividends paid  represents the dividend income component of total return  Therefore  a F A S T  Graphs  reveals dividends in two ways  First prior to being paid out of earnings  and then after they have been paid out of earnings 

The complete  presented below illustrates the earnings and price relationship  offers two valuation reference lines and graphically presents the company s dividend payout ratio and dividends after they are paid out to shareholders  Most importantly  a perspective of the company s current valuation relative to fundamentals is clearly illustrated 
Tupperware Brands Corp  TUP 
 Tupperware Brands Corporation operates as a direct to consumer marketer of various products across a range of brands and categories worldwide  The company engages in the manufacture and sale of design centric preparation  storage  and serving solutions for the kitchen and home  as well as a line of cookware  knives  microwave products  microfiber textiles  water filtration related items  and an array of products for on the go consumers under the Tupperware brand name 
It also manufactures and distributes skin and hair care products  cosmetics  bath and body care  toiletries  fragrances  jewelry  and nutritional products under the Avroy Shlain  NaturCare  Nutrimetics  Fuller  BeautiControl  Armand Dupree  Fuller Cosmetics  and Nuvo brands 
The company sells its products directly to distributors  directors  managers  and dealers  The company was formerly known as Tupperware Corporation and changed its name to Tupperware Brands Corporation in December 2005 
Tupperware Brands Corporation was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Orlando  Florida  
Investment Thesis
I offer Tupperware Brands Corporation as primarily a valuation and high current yield opportunity  Earnings have been weak in fiscal 2015 and that is expected to continue but at a lower rate for fiscal 2016  Nevertheless  that weakness is reflected in the price and current low valuation  However  management has been taking action to reinvigorate growth going forward  Consequently  Tupperware Brands Corporation is also offered as a potential turnaround 
Importantly  the company reports quarterly earnings on April 20  2016  Therefore  it might be prudent to wait for the earnings announcement  On the other hand  the stock has recovered nicely since the beginning of 2016  and a good quarterly report could carry it farther 

Meredith Corp  NYSE MDP 
 Meredith Corporation operates as a diversified media company that focuses primarily on the home and family marketplace in the United States  It operates in two segments  Local Media and National Media 
The Local Media segment consists of 16 owned television stations  such as 7 CBS affiliates  5 FOX affiliates  2 MyNetworkTV affiliates  1 NBC affiliate  1 ABC affiliate  and 1 independent station  as well as 1 operated television station  This segment also includes 13 Websites  13 mobile optimized Websites  and 38 applications focused on news  sports  and weather related information 
The National Media segment publishes magazines for women  This segment publishes approximately 20 subscription magazines that include Better Homes and Gardens  Parents  Family Circle  Allrecipes  EveryDay with Rachael Ray  Martha Stewart  NYSE MSO  Living  Shape  and FamilyFun  as well as approximately 130 special interest publications under approximately 80 titles 
Its portfolio also includes Parenting and Babytalk magazines  and approximately 50 Websites  30 mobile optimized Websites  and 20 applications  In addition  this segment provides digital and customer relationship marketing services  such as specialized marketing products and services to America s companies  and a consumer database  as well as is involved in brand licensing and other related operations 
The company was founded in 1902 and is headquartered in Des Moines  Iowa  
Investment Thesis
Meredith Corporation is primarily offered as a high yield  fairly valued dividend growth opportunity  The company has raised its dividend every year since 2000 and their payout ratio was increased in fiscal year 2012  and has held steady since at a range of 50  to 60   Therefore  this research candidate might be of interest to investors looking for above average current yield with dividend growth potential 

Brinker International  NYSE EAT 
 Brinker International  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  engages in the ownership  development  operation  and franchise of casual dining restaurants worldwide  As of December 23  2015  it owned  operated  or franchised 1 646 restaurants comprising 1 595 restaurants under the Chili s Grill   Bar brand name and 51 restaurants under the Maggiano s Little Italy brand 
Brinker International  Inc  was founded in 1975 and is based in Dallas  Texas  
Investment Thesis
I offer Brinker International  Inc   as an attractively valued dividend growth and total return opportunity  Additionally  I am encouraged by the fact that they initiated their first dividend in fiscal 2006  and although earnings falter during the Great Recession  the company increased their dividend each year since instituting one  My one caveat is the company s high debt to capital ratio  However  the company produces ample cash flows to service debt and to continue covering dividends  in my opinion 

Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM 
 Williams Sonoma  Inc  operates as a multi channel specialty retailer of various products for home  It operates through two segments  E commerce and Retail  The company offers cooking  dining  and entertaining products  including cookware  tools  electrics  cutlery  tabletop and bar  outdoor  furniture  and a library of cookbooks under the Williams Sonoma brand  as well as home furnishings and decorative accessories under the Williams Sonoma Home brand  and furniture  bedding  bathroom accessories  rugs  curtains  lighting  tabletop  outdoor  and decorative accessories under the Pottery Barn brand 
It also provides products designed for creating spaces where children could play  laugh  learn  and grow under the Pottery Barn Kids brand  line of furniture  bedding  lighting  decorative accents  and others for teen bedrooms  dorm rooms  study spaces  and lounges under the PBteen brand  and mixed clean lines  natural materials  and handcrafted collections under West Elm brand 
In addition  the company offers a range of assortments of lighting  hardware  furniture  and home d cor inspired by history under the Rejuvenation brand  and women s and men s accessories  small leather goods  jewelry  key item apparel  paper  entertaining and bar  home d cor  and seasonal items under the Mark and Graham brand  It markets its products through e commerce Websites  direct mail catalogs  and specialty retail stores

Williams Sonoma  Inc  was founded in 1956 and is headquartered in San Francisco  California  
Investment Thesis
I consider Williams Sonoma  Inc  fully valued but not excessively overvalued at current levels  However  the company has historically commanded a premium valuation and the stock currently has momentum coming off of lows set earlier this year  The company offers a moderate current yield  good growth potential and a debt to capital ratio of zero  Although I think this research candidate is investable currently  prudent investors might wait for a slightly better entry point

Summary and Conclusions
The Consumer Discretionary Sector is comprised of businesses that sell what are considered nonessential goods and services to the general public  However  just because a good or service is nonessential  it does not mean that it is not in high demand by consumers  Nevertheless  Consumer Discretionary businesses can be problematic during economic downturns 
On the other hand  the good ones tend to recover and often rapidly once the economy turns around  That is clearly evidenced by the nine research candidates included in this article  Therefore  I offer the above Consumer Discretionary research candidates primarily from the perspective of growth and dividend growth 
In part 2C I will turn my attention to higher yielding mid cap companies for those investors seeking higher dividend income  The primary research candidates I will present in part 2C will cover mid cap REITs with emphasis on current yield and current valuation

103939,325454,MDP,What s In The Cards For Meredith  MDP  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Meredith Corporation   NYSE MDP    one of the leading media and marketing companies with interests in publishing  broadcasting  integrated marketing and interactive media  is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 28 
In the previous quarter  the company posted positive earnings surprise of 15   Notably  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 5 8   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Meredith is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Meredith has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 04  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  but an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Factors This Quarter
Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to positively influence the company s performance  This is well reflected from its upbeat guidance  Meredith now projects fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share in the range of  1 01  1 06 and anticipates total revenue to increase in the low  to mid single digits  The company is focused on bolstering advertising revenues  primarily in the digital space  and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing  marketing services and eCommerce 
However  with advancing technology  the print media is on a decline  Shift to online is likely to put enormous pressure on Meredith s magazine portfolio  Though the company is expanding its digital presence  it will take time to complete the metamorphosis MEREDITH CORP Price and EPS Surprise
