25948,247463,AIMC,Here s Why Investors Should Steer Clear Of Altra Industrial,opinion,Altra Industrial Motion Corp    NASDAQ AIMC   seems to have lost its sheen to softness in end markets  global economic uncertainties  forex woes and other company specific headwinds  The manufacturer of mechanical power transmission components  with a market capitalization of  2 1 billion  currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  The company belongs to the Zacks  industry  currently at the bottom 21   with the rank of 201  of more than 250 Zacks industries  We believe that the industry is suffering from global uncertainties  unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  softness in the housing market and weakness in industrial production in the United States  Cost escalation  resulting from tariff woes as well as commodity inflation  and high labor costs and freight charges  are also affecting the industry Notably  Altra Industrial s third quarter 2019 results were better than expected  with earnings surpassing estimates by 2 99   However  the bottom line declined 2 8  year over year due to weak organic sales  and rise in costs and expenses  Average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was a negative 0 40  Over the past six months  the company s shares have declined 4 4  against the industry s growth of 7 8  Headwinds Impacting Altra IndustrialEnd Market Weakness  The company is wary about the adverse impacts of uncertainties in end markets on its 2019 and 2020 top line results  This along with global worries made it lower the sales projection for 2019 to  1 827  1 837 million from the previously stated  1 850  1 880 million  It predicts organic sales decline of 2 3  For 2020  the company predicts a year over year sales decline of 2 4   It expects weakness in the Class 8 truck business to hurt sales by 2 2  in 2020 It is worth mentioning here that the company serves various end markets  including construction  general industrial  mining  wind  water infrastructure and aerospace  Weakness in transportation  metals  factory automation   specialty machinery  agriculture  distribution  and turf   garden markets adversely impacted sales in the third quarter Bottom Line Softness  We believe that high costs  resulting from rise in tariffs and input costs  and expenses might impact Altra Industrial s profitability  In the third quarter of 2019  the company recorded an 82 7  increase in the cost of sales  83 9  elevation in selling  general and administrative expenses  and 152 6  growth in research and development expenses For 2019  it lowered earnings predicted to  2 77  2 83 per share from  2 81  2 97 mentioned earlier International Exposure  Geographical diversification  with a significant presence in China  Germany  Europe and other countries  has exposed Altra Industrial to geopolitical issues  macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  Notably  lower demand in Germany and China adversely impacted the company s organic sales in the third quarter of 2019  Also  forex woes had adverse impacts of 1 75  on sales in the quarter For fourth quarter 2019  Altra Industrial expects unfavorable movements in foreign currencies to continue impacting its performance  It also anticipates softness in the global industrial economy to be a drag in 2019 High Debts  We believe that a highly leveraged balance sheet can be troubling for Altra Industrial  Exiting the third quarter of 2019  the company s long term debt was  1 602 8 million  Its interest expenses in the quarter totaled  18 2 million versus  2 million recorded in the year ago quarter  We believe that rising debt  if unchecked  will increase its financial obligations and might prove detrimental to its profitability It is worth noting here that the company s long term debt increased 73 1   CAGR  in three years  2016 2018  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are Tennant Company   NYSE TNC    Dover Corporation

26338,247853,AIMC,Middleby Business Opportunities Solid  Competition A Drag,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on The Middleby Corporation   NASDAQ MIDD   on Dec 12  Strengthening commercial foodservice  food processing and residential kitchen equipment businesses as well as the company s innovation investments and synergistic benefits from acquired assets will prove beneficial  However  the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds rising from international exposure  industry competition and existing near term risks in the residential kitchen equipment business Middleby currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring MiddlebyStrengthening Business  Middleby anticipates gaining from its commercial foodservice  food processing and residential kitchen equipment businesses in the quarters ahead  It believes that both the Commercial Foodservice and Food Processing industries have market opportunities in excess of  5 billion while that of Premium Residential industry is in excess of  3 billion Also  the company s international businesses have grown manifold over time  with average sales growing roughly 20  in the past five years  Key markets include Australia  Brazil  China  India  Mexico  Russia  Dubia and the U K Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities  Acquired assets have over time helped Middleby leverage benefits from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings  In this regard  the recently acquired assets of Scanico A S   Denmark based manufacturer of industrial equipment meant for freezing and cooling for the food processing industry   is worth mentioning  The company believes that the addition of Scanico A S will broaden its product offerings and strengthen technological expertise in the Food Processing Equipment Group In addition to the Scanico buyout  Middleby acquired QualServ Solutions in August and Globe Food Equipment Company in October  Both these assets are expected to bolster revenues of the company s Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group in the near term  Also  the Burford  completed in May  and CVP Systems  completed in June  buyouts are projected to improve near term revenues of the company s Food Processing Equipment segment  Notably  in the third quarter  Middleby generated  28 6 million sales from its acquired assets Investments  Middleby intends to boost its near term competency in the global foodservice equipment industry on the back its innovation investments  For instance  products rolled out under the Viking brand are expected to secure sturdy response from the end markets  Moreover  opening of the two new residential Viking brand centers in Chicago and New York would be beneficial  as the company will display its recently launched products in the same  Notably  the company has introduced more than 100 award winning new Viking products in the last three years Also  the company is making investments to expand its operations in emerging markets and expand facilities Factors Working Against MiddlebyPoor Share Price Performance   Falling Earnings Estimates  In the last three months  Middleby s shares have yielded 5 7  return  underperforming 7 5  growth of the  Also  earnings estimates for the stock for both 2017 and 2018 have been revised down by four brokerage firms  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  5 41 for 2017 and  6 08 for 2018  representing 2 3  and 1  decline from their respective tallies 60 days ago Adversities Rising From Residential Kitchen Equipment Segment  Middleby s integration initiatives conducted within the AGA Group business resulted in 5 7  decline in revenues from the Residential Kitchen Equipment segment in third quarter 2017  In order to reduce cost and simplify operational process  the company is currently eliminating certain less profitable products and lowering price concessions for non core business within this segment  We believe these actions might continue to mar the segment s performance in the near term Threat From Industry Competition and International Expansion  Middleby faces active competition in each business segment  Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of end users and thus  exposes the company to risks of market share loss  In order to retain competitive power  the company is forced to incur heavy innovation investments  which adds to its aggregate debt level In addition  business expansion in foreign nations has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo political issues Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the industry are Kadant Inc    NYSE KAI    Sun Hydraulics Corporation   NASDAQ SNHY   and Altra Industrial Motion Corporation   NASDAQ AIMC    While Kadant and Sun Hydraulics sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Altra Industrial Motion carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Kadant pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 20 32  in the last four quarters  Also  earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 were revised upward in the last 60 days Sun Hydraulics delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9 58  in the trailing four quarters  Also  bottom line expectations for 2017 and 2018 improved over the past 60 days Altra Industrial Motion s financial performance was impressive  with an average positive earnings surprise of 17 30  in the last four quarters  Also  earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 were revised upward over the last 60 days Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-12-12,Zacks Investment

26346,247861,AIMC,Nordson Vs  Altra Industrial  Which Stock Is A Better Buy ,opinion,So far in 2017  the U S  market has exhibited signs of improvement  with major stock indexes yielding solid returns  Year to date  the S P 500  is up 15 3   while the Nasdaq Composite and NYSE Composite are up 26 1  and 11 4   respectively We believe that Trump government s promised growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  has been one of the primary forces behind the rally  Other tailwinds include a strengthening housing and commercial construction markets as well as steady growth in new job additions  Also  the country s Gross Domestic Product  GDP  grew at an annualized rate of 3  in the third quarter of 2017   one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has gained 17 4  year to date  Industrial stocks are well poised to gain traction from the proposed growth plans of the government  Also  year over year growth of roughly 2 9  in industrial production  a measure of the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  in October is a positive for industrial stocks Given the favorable trends  we would like to bring forth two names   Altra Industrial Motion Corporation   NASDAQ AIMC   and Nordson Corporation   NASDAQ NDSN     that hold healthy growth prospects and can be of interest to investors seeking exposure to the industrial sector  Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  What if we are to choose the best bet among these two stocks Let s briefly discuss the factors that can be used as deciding parameters for finding the best pick between these two industrial stocks  Before we begin  a quick recap of the business profile of these companies will be of help Altra Industrial manufactures and distributes a diversified range of mechanical power transmission  MPT  components like clutches   brakes  couplings  and gearing   power transmission components  On the other hand  Nordson manufactures and distributes products and systems designed to dispense  apply and control adhesives  coatings  polymers  sealants  biomaterials  and other fluids Company Size  Recommendations and Price Performance  Altra Industrial has market capitalization of approximately  1 4 billion  The stock has been rated positively by two brokerage firms while three firms have issued neutral recommendations  Its average brokerage recommendation  ABR  currently is 2 20 In comparison  Nordson s market capitalization is  7 4 billion  It holds a better ABR of 1 67  average of six positive ratings and three neutral recommendations  Nordson shares have rallied 14 5  in the last three months  outperforming 5 9  increase in Altra Industrial Motion s share price   Target Price and Valuation  Altra Industrial s target price is  53 while that for Nordson is  142 Based on projected price to earnings ratio  P E   Nordson is favorably valued compared to Altra Industrial with respective tallies of 21 9 and 23 2 Profitability Ratios  Nordson s margin profile seems much better than Altra Industrial  with pre tax and net margins of 20 6  and 14 6   respectively  These are higher than pre tax margin of 6 7  and net margin of 4 9  recorded by Altra Industrial Additionally  Nordson s return on assets and equity are 10 7  and 33   respectively  These returns are higher than 6 3  return on assets and 16 3  return on equity provided by Altra Industrial Dividends  Both the companies believe in rewarding their shareholders handsomely through dividend payments  While Altra Industrial s annual dividend is 68 cents per share and payout ratio is 1 4   the same for Nordson is  1 20 per share and roughly 1  Year to date  Nordson has increased its quarterly dividend rate by 11  to 30 cents while Altra Industrial has hiked its rate by 13  to 17 cents Leverage  Nordson is highly leveraged considering its debt burden  Its debt to equity is 144 7   way higher than 77  for Altra Industrial Also  long term debt to capital is 59 1  compared with 43 5  for Altra Industrial Long Term Aspects  In the long term  Altra Industrial anticipates revenue growth to be in excess of the Gross Domestic Product  It aims to improve its operating margin by 150 basis points on strategic pricing On the other hand  Nordson anticipates revenue growth to be roughly twice the global Gross Domestic Product percentage  It aims its operating margin to be better than its revenue growth percentage Our TakeConsidering the factors discussed above  Nordson seems to be a better investment choice than Altra Industrial Zacks

26454,247969,AIMC,Colfax To Grow On Brands   Acquisitions  Competition A Drag,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation   NYSE CFX   on Nov 15  Strengthening end markets  efforts to innovate and introduce new products and synergistic benefits from acquired assets will prove beneficial  However  the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds rising from international exposure  industry competition and global uncertainties Colfax currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring ColfaxBrands Strength  Colfax has evolved as a premier industrial tool provider in the past few years  with its market capitalization increasing from less than  1 billion in 2010 to roughly  4 billion at present  The company s solid platforms   Fabrication Technology and Air   Gas Handling   that serves a diversified customer base in various end markets including general industrial  oil   gas  power  marine  mining and others have aided this significant growth ESAB is a popular brand under the Fabrication Technology business  Innovation and new product introductions are considered the keys to success  The global fabrication technology market is anticipated to grow roughly 3 4  in the long term  Technological advancements and shortage of skilled labors have boosted needs for more sophisticated equipments Howden  a popular brand under the Air   Gas Handling business  holds solid growth opportunities in emerging markets  The global air   gas handling is predicted to grow roughly 3 5  in the long run  driven by focus on energy efficiency  rise in infrastructure investments in developing nations and need for retrofits due to environmental regulations and performance upgrades Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities  Acquired assets have over time contributed to Colfax s expansion  More than 20 businesses acquired since the 2012 Charter deal added roughly  1 6 billion in revenues  Notably  in the first nine months of 2017  acquired assets contributed roughly 1 3  to year over year sales growth Year to date  Colfax has acquired TBi  a leader in robotic torch technology  and HKS  a developer of advanced process analytics and sensors  These buyouts have strengthened the company s welding process analytics and robotic welding torches operations in the Fabrication Technology segment  Also  in October  it completed the acquisition of Siemens AG s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business  This strategic acquisition will solidify Colfax s Howden trading platform In addition to acquisitions  divestment of non core assets is Colfax s another way of strengthening its core businesses  In September  it decided to sell its Fluid Handling business to CIRCOR for proceeds of approximately  860 million  It anticipates recording a material gain upon completion of the deal in the fourth quarter of 2017 Healthy  17 Guidance

quarters ahead  For 2017  the company anticipates adjusted earnings to be within  1 65  1 75 per share  up from  1 56 recorded in 2016  Also  the company has initiated certain cost reduction measures that will result in approximately  50 million in cost savings in 2017 Over the long run  three to five years   the company anticipates organic growth  CAGR  in the range of 1 2  above Gross Domestic Product  and segment margins in the mid teens level Factors Working Against ColfaxThreat From Industry Competition  Colfax faces active competition in the Air and Gas Handling business from companies offering similar products and services  or those producing different items for same uses  Also  other companies operating in the welding space provide stiff competition to its Fabrication Technology business Disadvantages of Diversification  Business expansion in foreign nations has exposed Colfax to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo political issues  In the nine months ended September 2017  the company s Air and Gas Handling s orders declined 0 2  from the year ago period due to adverse foreign currency translation  Moreover  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers both in the United States and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Adversaries Rising From Global Uncertainty  End markets served by Colfax are highly susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial conditions in countries where the company operates  will adversely hurt its sales  earnings and cash flow Share Price Performance   Key PicksIn the last three months  Colfax s shares have lost 8 7   underperforming 10 2  gain

Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents  thereby resuming its earnings beat streak of 23 straight quarters  which it broke just once as it reported in line earnings last quarter The earnings figure improved 15  from the year ago tally of 47 cents  The bottom line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 9 7  year over year to  749 9 million  It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  742 million  A thriving water heater industry in the United States  strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers  and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top line growth Talking about segments  A O  Smith s sales in the North America segment  comprising U S  and Canadian water heaters and boilers  grew 7 8  year over year to  486 million  Higher volumes of residential water heaters  strong sales of boilers  and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region  Lochinvar branded products charted 17  growth in the quarter  In addition  Hague products and Aquasana contributed  8 million to revenues  thus supplementing the segment s growth Segmental operating earnings rose 9 8  year over year to  110 3 million  The segment s profit was favorably impacted by higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers  However  the benefit was

Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment  including China  India and Europe  rose 12 4  year over year to  270 1 million  The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer

over year to  33 8 million in the quarter  The favorable impact of excellent sales in China was partially offset by escalating steel and installation costs  as well as selling and administrative costs  Operating margin contracted 40 bps to 12 5  year over year Share RepurchasesDuring the first nine months of 2017  A O  Smith repurchased around 1 9 million common shares for  103 million  At the end

year 2017  the company projects revenues to be up in the range of 11 12  now  as opposed to the earlier guided range of 10 11  Further  A O  Smith now anticipates 2017 earnings to lie in the range of  2 12  2 14 per share compared to the earlier guided range of  2 07  2 11  The upward guidance revision is primarily attributable to outstanding performance year to date  backed by solid demand and sales momentum Our TakeA O  Smith s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company s underlying strength  We believe stellar prospects in China and the U S  end markets will continue to accelerate growth  going forward  Also  dominant foothold in the North American water heater market  along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets are likely to stoke growth This apart  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s sound financial health  strategic capital expenditures to fortify its market position and overall positive trends bode well for long term growth Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the same space include Barnes Group Inc    NYSE B    IDEX Corporation   NYSE IEX   and Altra Industrial Motion Corp    NASDAQ

26709,248224,AIMC,5 Stocks Near 52 Week High To Scoop Up Right Away,opinion,Stocks near a 52 week high compel investors to take a closer look for possibilities of a further rise  The truth is there is no crystal ball or time tested strategy that can help one determine the impending trend  Though touted as one of the riskier investing techniques  a sizable number of investors are picking undervalued stocks near 52 week high with the conviction that they will scale higher  The odds are difficult  if not impossible  to gauge  At best  52 week investments can be described as a touch and go strategy which can definitely lead to handsome rewards but only in conjunction with a particular set of parameters Here at Zacks we will help you hitch a quick ride on the 52 week high bandwagon to earn some profits  Clubbing 52 week high stocks with the correct set of parameters is all you need to turn the tide in your favor Our screen will provide you with a clear investment strategy and help you minimize the risks associated with any ad hoc strategies A Peek into 52 Week High StocksStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive stocks higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period   According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time   Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales

those that are undervalued compared to their peers One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism Zacks Rank   1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental

26791,248306,AIMC,5 Stocks Near A 52 Week High To Place Your Bets On,opinion,The new administration s optimism over the longevity of the eight year Bull Market  the impressive rally of all major indices over the past six months and overall positive economic indicators reinstate our belief in the momentum investing rulebook The momentum investment strategy tends to bet on high flying stocks in a bull phase  In this screening article  we focus on the 52 week investment strategy  which loosely borrows from the basics of momentum investing Being one of the relatively new investment techniques  the 52 week investment strategy banks on Wall Street s current favorite catchphrase  buy high and sell higher   Though skeptics may raise a brow on the mettle of this approach  a certain degree of caution is needed to avoid the pitfalls Rely on our screener to stop chasing fads blindly  Let s take a look at how you could club other parameters with this strategy to turn the tide in your favor A Peek into 52 Week High StocksStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive stocks higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period  According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time Current Price 52 Week High     80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon   Change Price   4 Weeks   0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks   Change Price   12 Weeks   0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well Price Sales    XIndMedThe lower  the better P E using F 1  Estimate

27114,248629,AIMC,What s In Store For Verisk  VRSK  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Business information services firm Verisk Analytics  Inc    NASDAQ VRSK   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results after market close on May 2  In the last reported quarter  adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents  Over the trailing four quarters  Verisk beat earnings estimates twice  delivering an average positive surprise of 2 34  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key Factors in the First QuarterVerisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to customers across its core verticals of insurance  natural resources  and financial services  During the quarter  Verisk acquired a liability risk modeling and decision support company  Arium for an undisclosed amount  Per the acquisition  Arium became part of Verisk s AIR Worldwide  AIR  business   This deal augments AIR s product portfolio with additional modeling solutions and analytics for the casualty market  Arium s methodologies enable Verisk s clients to comprehensively manage risks across their portfolios in the casualty market  The company expects this acquisition to be accretive for the company in the quarter to be reported In addition  the company also inked an agreement to acquire Bangalore based data solutions company  Fintellix   The financials of the agreement remain undisclosed  Per the agreement  Fintellix will become part of Verisk s Argus business  Argus is a leading provider of information  scoring solutions  and advisory services to financial institutions worldwide  Fintellix s advanced data management platform  along with its regulatory reporting expertise  will be a valuable addition to both Argus and Verisk Analytics  The collaboration will help the company offer better services and highly advanced solutions to its customers  In addition  this deal will also enable Verisk expand its foothold across India as well   The company s acquisition spree will likely boost the top line Verisk aims to create long term value through organic and better return on invested capital  The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging on its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new  proprietary data sets and predictive analytics  by working in unison with its customers to understand their evolving needs  Verisk recorded average organic revenue growth of about 8  over the past 10 years  At the same time  the company continues to extend its footprint in new markets  with healthy long term growth potential  through targeted international expansion  This holistic growth model is expected to strengthen its leading position in the market However  a significant portion of the company s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States  With modest revenues coming from the U K   Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members  Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non tariff barriers to trade between the U K  and the European Union  lowering productivity of the company  These undermine the long term growth potential of the company to some extent Verisk s business model centers on large troves of data  Consequently  the company is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities  computer networks  and databases  resulting in a loss of its credibility and or customers  Data theft and misuse by third party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and jeopardize the fundamental existence of the company Earnings WhispersDespite the inherent strengths  our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The Most Accurate estimate for the company stands at 77 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 78 cents  So  the difference   the Earnings ESP   is  1 28    Verisk Analytics  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Verisk carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with  1 28  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank

27125,248640,AIMC,Stocks To Invest In Based On Top Down Analysis  Zacks Heat Maps ,opinion,"Utilizing the Zacks Sector and  Heat Map is a great investing  for investors  and today  I m going to recommend a few stocks based on these maps by implementing  
To quickly recap  top down analysis is a popular method of investing that begins with a macro view of the economy and then narrows down to equity investments  The Zacks Heat Map is a tool that helps make this process much easier than it sounds 
As of April 8  2017  the Zacks Heat Map shows that the top three sectors in Zacks Sector Rank are Industrial Products with 216 stocks  Basic Materials with 250 stocks  and Auto  Tires   Trucks with 79 stocks  This is my macro view of the economy  Since I now know which sectors I am bullish on  I can dig into each industry rank within those sectors 

To continue narrowing down my equity investment opportunities  I will look into Industrial Products  industries  It looks like the Manufacturing   General Industrial Industry with 37 stocks is among the best ranked industries within the Industrial Products Sector 

When looking deeper into the industry  it s seen under the  Rank of Stocks  on the industry page that the top rated stocks in the industry are Altra Industrial Motion Corp    NASDAQ AIMC   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Graco Inc    NYSE GGG   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and Nordson Corporation   NASDAQ NDSN   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

In summary  I used Zacks Sector Rank Heat Map to find my macro view of the economy  I answered the following question  What parts of the economy are ranked the highest according to Zacks Sector Rank  From there  I found that Industrial Products  Basic Materials  and Auto  Tires   Trucks were ranked among the best 
When I got my picture of the macro economy  I dug deeper to find opportunities within the industries of the sectors I am bullish on  To do this  I utilized Zacks Industry Rank Heat Map and figured that the Manufacturing   General Industry within the Industrial Products Sector was ranked among the highest 
From that second step  I finally narrowed down to a handful of equity investments from the industry page s  Rank of Stocks  section 
Top down analysis is an impactful and organized way to approach Wall Street  Zacks Heat Maps and the Sector and Industry Ranks make top down analysis simple  These features are available through Zacks Premium  Begin your free trial   
Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside

compared with the performances over the last few quarters  A robust continuation of this trend would translate into positive earnings growth in aggregate for the quarter  following five back to back quarters of earnings declines for the S P 500 index However  with macroeconomic conditions still soft  earnings growth is projected to be negative for eight of the 16 Zacks sectors  On the whole  our latest data highlights that earnings for the S P 500 companies are now on track to decline 1  from the year ago period  on 1 5  higher revenues  These numbers  however  hint toward some tell tale signs of improvement in the overall earnings picture   For more details  read our latest  article As of Oct 19  we had results from 81 S P 500 members  accounting for 19 9  of the index s total market capitalization   of which about 80 2  have posted earnings beats and 63  trumped top line estimates  This indicates that both earnings and revenues have improved notably relative to the recent quarters   According to the Zacks Industry classification  the machinery industry is broadly grouped under Industrial Products  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  The industrial products sector is one of those expected to chart positive earnings growth this quarter  According to our latest numbers  its earnings are on track to grow 3 4  in the quarter  on 0 3  lower sales compared with the last year

27278,248793,AIMC,Deere  DE  Beats On Q2 Earnings   Sales  Tweaks 2016 View,opinion,Deere   Company s   NYSE DE   second quarter fiscal 2016  ended Apr 30  2016  earnings declined around 23  year over year to  1 56 per share owing to a downturn in the global farm economy and weakness in the construction equipment sector  Earnings  however  topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 46 Operational UpdateNet sales of equipment operations  which comprise Agriculture and Turf  Construction and Forestry  came in at  7 11 billion  down roughly 4  year over year  Revenues comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 64 billion  Region wise  equipment net sales were down 6  in the U S  and Canada  and 1  in the rest of the world Cost of sales in the quarter decreased 2 9  year over year to  5 53 billion  Gross profit in the quarter came in at  1 58 million  down 7 5  year over year  Selling  administrative and general expenses dropped 3 4  to  592 9 million  Operating profit declined around 10 7  year over year to  860 8 million Operating income from equipment operations tumbled 17  year over year to  688 million due to the impact of lower shipment volumes  less favorable product mix and unfavorable currency effects  partially offset by lower production costs  reduced selling  administrative and general expenses  and price realization Segment PerformanceThe Agriculture   Turf segment s sales remained flat year over year at  5 7 billion  Revenues were impacted by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation  partially offset by price realization  Operating profit at the segment declined 4  year over year to  614 million as lower shipment volumes  less favorable product mix and unfavorable currency effects were partly offset by price realization  lower selling  administrative and general expenses  and reduced production costs Construction   Forestry sales went down 16  year over year to  1 37 billion  impacted by lower shipment volumes and higher sales incentive costs  Operating profit at the segment declined significantly year over year to  74 million Net revenues at Deere s Financial Services division totaled  651 million in the reported quarter  flat year over year  The segment s operating profit was  160 million  compared with  265 million in the prior year quarter  Net income at the segment was  102 6 million compared with  169 8 million in the year ago quarter  This decline can be attributed to higher losses on residual values  less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses Financial UpdateDeere reported cash and cash equivalents of  4 13 billion at the end of second quarter fiscal 2016 compared with  4 36 billion at the end of the prior year quarter  The company reported cash used in operations of  312 4 million for the period of six months ended Apr 30  2016 compared with cash usage of  154 7 million in the comparable year ago period  As of second quarter end  long term borrowings totaled  24 6 billion  compared with  23 6 billion in the prior year quarter Looking AheadDeere revised its outlook for fiscal 2016  The company reduced its fiscal year forecast for net income to  1 2 billion from  1 3 billion due to ongoing market pressures  It projects total equipment sales to decline 9  year over year in fiscal 2016  Sales are also likely to deteriorate about 12  from the year ago quarter in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  The projection includes a negative currency translation effect of about 2  for the full year and 1  for the third quarter Segment wise  Deere expects Agriculture and Turf equipment sales decline of 8  in fiscal 2016  including an unfavorable currency translation impact of about 2   Industry sales for agricultural equipment in the U S  and Canada are expected to be down 15  20  in fiscal 2016 owing to low commodity prices and stagnant farm income In the EU28  sales are projected to be flat to down 5  due to low commodity prices and farm income  including potential pressure on the dairy sector  In South America  industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to decline 15  20  year over year due to economic uncertainty in Brazil Sales in Asia are projected to be flat to down modestly  largely because of the weakness in China  Deere expects sales growth of turf and utility equipment in the U S  and Canada to range from flat to up 5   gaining from new products and general economic growth The company foresees global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to be down about 13  in fiscal 2016  including an unfavorable currency translation effect of about 1   The decline reflects the impact of soft conditions in the North American energy sector  In forestry  global sales are expected to be down 5  10  from year ago levels  The outlook for net income from Financial Services has been slashed to  480 million from  525 million for fiscal 2016  The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads  higher losses on lease residual values and an increased provision for credit losses Our ViewOwing to the increased global demand for food  shelter and infrastructure  we believe that the long term outlook for Deere remains strong  Global trends based on population growth and rising living standards remain intact  and are largely unaffected by periodic swings in farming economy However  declining crop prices  such as those of corn and soybean  will affect farm income  This will restrain farmers from purchasing new agricultural equipment  thereby impacting Deere  Moreover  the sluggish energy sector is a matter of concern Zacks
