35679,257194,SLB,Stocks   S P Caps Week With Record Highs as Tech Keeps Shining,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing com   The S P rounded off the week with another record close Friday as a surge in U S  housing activity strengthened investor hopes the current economic expansion can continue   
The S P 500 added 0 39   while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0 34  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0 17   
A surge in housing starts in December to a 13 year high  coupled with stronger than expected retail sales earlier this week and underpinned investor confidence in the economy boosting sentiment 
The trend of mostly bullish earnings  meanwhile  continued Friday as Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines 
About 71  of the 44 companies in the S P 500 that have reported earnings have topped analysts  estimates  while 23  have fallen short  Refinitiv said  citing I B E S data 
In a typical quarter  about 65  of companies beat estimates and 20  miss estimates  Refinitiv said 
Tech  which has played a leading role in the rally this week  continued its climb  led by Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and chip stocks like Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM    
Fresh from hitting a  1 trillion valuation  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  tacked on further gains  rising 2  for the day 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   meanwhile  rose 1  as Nomura and Morgan Stanley become the latest on Wall Street to upgrade their price targets on the iPhone maker 
Energy failed to join in the rally  as global oil demand concerns continued to keep a lid on oil prices 
The bullish end to the week comes as the U S  and China signed off on their phase one trade deal on Wednesday  ending their two year trade war 
But while the trade d tente  is certainly good news   is did not sort out all the complexities of issues between these two large economies and for sure is not resolving the fundamental questions that need addressing in the trade system so it can succeed in the future   IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said ",2020-01-17,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--sp-caps-week-with-record-highs-as-tech-keeps-shining-2062395,2062395

The company says it recorded a  2 2B charge to earnings  due to the decline in North American shale activity  centered on hydraulic fracturing and legacy drilling equipment units  and employee severance costs 
Halliburton s international business remains a bright spot  up 10  Y Y in Q4 following 6  growth in the prior quarter  bolstered by an increase in unconventional well activity in several Middle Eastern countries and in Argentina  in addition to strong evaluation software sales 
Q4 revenue in Halliburton s North American segment plunged 30  due to reduced drilling activity and unfavorable pricing across service lines 
CEO Jeff Miller says he expects customer spending in North America to decline again this year  echoing last week s comments from Schlumberger  SLB  2 2   CEO Olivier Le Peuch  which will cause Halliburton to cut this year s planned capital spending by 20  to  1 2B 
But Halliburton has reorganized and reduced North America fixed costs and deployed technology that improves efficiency  minimizes non productive time and reduces personnel on job sites  which helped lift Q4 adjusted operating margin to 10 5  from 10 2  in the year ago quarter

35689,257204,SLB,Keep On Rolling  Stocks Rack Up Record Highs As Earnings  Housing Data Look Solid,opinion," Friday Market Open  If you re bullish  this must feel like the week that keeps on giving 
Sure  there was a slight hiccup a couple days ago  but since then things have gone pretty much straight up  Stocks seem ready to continue that today  with gains in pre market trading  Momentum means a lot right now  and indices are rolling up new record highs almost every day  
Earnings season is off to an impressive start  and geopolitics are relatively quiet for now  The S P 500 Index  SPX  reached 3300 for the first time yesterday  and Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOGL  market cap hit  1 trillion 
Housing starts last month hit an eye popping 13 year high  the government said Friday  They rose nearly 17  to an annualized pace of 1 61 million  way above analyst predictions  Low mortgage rates and the healthy job market probably play a part  while sectors ranging from Financials to Materials could possibly get a lift if housing keeps up this pace  
About 7  of S P 500 companies have reported Q4 results so far  with 74  posting better than expected earnings per share  FactSet said  Oil services company Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  was the latest to beat analysts  expectations with its top  and bottom line results this morning  and shares rose nearly 3   a rare sign of strength in the struggling Energy sector  
China is in the mix this morning  but not for the right reasons  after the government reported 6 1  growth in 2019  That s the worst in nearly 30 years  and some economists think it could fall below 6  this year  The trade war probably didn t help  but a falling birth rate and high debt levels also factor in  There s no way to sugar coat this  because a weaker Chinese economy could boomerang around the world  However  China s growth has been slowing for a while  and maybe the phase one deal could give its economy support 
Before You GoIt s the last session before a three day weekend  so volume might be thinner than usual and a bit of volatility has a chance to show up  see more below   That means traders might want to take extra care moving in and out of positions  The Daily Market Update won t be published Monday  but returns Tuesday There s still data headed our way this morning as the University of Michigan reports its latest  consumer sentiment numbers  Consensus on Wall Street is for a headline figure of 98 9   just below the 99 3  reading last time out  Briefing com said  Generally  this indicator has been on the climb since last summer  supporting claims that consumers are in good shape  One thing to consider watching beyond the headline is inflation expectations  which fell to an annual level of 2 2  last time out  the lowest since the late 1970s Next week the earnings schedule picks up again after Monday s holiday  but economic data wise it might feel like an extended holiday break  The only major number is existing home sales Wednesday Earnings to consider monitoring next week include  IBM   NYSE IBM   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Union Pacific  NYSE UNP    Southwest  NYSE LUV   and United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL   This week it s been all about the banks  but as earnings season rolls on  the other industries start to show up  Semiconductor shares might be in sharp focus considering INTC and TXN are on the schedule In its last forecast  FactSet predicted a 2  drop in Q4 earnings per share for S P 500 companies  It could be interesting to see if that number starts to move higher  but more earnings need to hit the books before we ll know if it s an under estimate Back To Record Heights
That little mid week pause  It ended Thursday  
It was pretty incredible to see every sector of the SPX move higher yesterday  led by what else Technology  The defensive trading that showed up Tuesday and Wednesday faded after  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  impressed with its Q4 results and retail sales and jobless claims both provided more sense of a solid economy 
It turned out it was too early to write the obituary for semiconductors  as the PHLX Semiconductor index shot up nearly 2  amid new strength in usual suspects like Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA   Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   and Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Some of those high fliers had started to show signs of fatigue back on Wednesday  but they revived quickly  Maybe that s a sign that buying interest could appear on declines as some investors still see the sector leading things higher 
The FAANGs came to town  too  with four of the five stocks in that bunch climbing  The leader was Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   which has been humming along for months  Still  the FAANGs in general have had a pretty strong start this year  with some analysts wondering if maybe the worst of the regulatory storm might be over  
While cyclicals shined Thursday  that didn t mean defensive sectors got left behind  Utilities and Real Estate were among the leaders  Some analysts say these could continue to find bids if Treasury yields stay depressed at well below 2  for the 10 year  People looking for yield aren t getting it from Treasuries 
It s hard to ever say one stock set the tone  but MS might have done that Thursday  It s not often when you see one of the big institutional banks go up nearly 7  and just hang out there all day  but that s the way things went  The company enjoyed a surge in Q4 fixed income trading  and analysts just hadn t predicted this kind of performance  Generally  bank earnings looked very impressive with the exception of  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  and a bottom line miss from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   When you look at those two  however  the issues were isolated to specific things going on at the companies  and didn t reflect industry trends  
If you want to throw darts at this rally  you could focus on some analysts saying that gains are getting more focused in just a handful of shares  That s definitely concerning  because the best scenario is for a rising tide that lifts most boats  A counter argument might be that every S P 500 sector has risen over the last month and over the last three months  so it s not like one sector is basking in applause while the rest shy away backstage 
That said  the five most valuable U S  tech companies now account for over 17  of the S P 500  up from 11  in 2015  Even in the face of heightened regulatory pressure  the dominant companies continue to grow and attract investor dollars 
One sign of broader market strength is that both the Russell 2000  RUT  small cap index and the Dow Jones Transportation Average  DJT  outpaced the broader SPX yesterday  These two indices had been laggards  but any improvement in their fortunes might bode well for the market because small caps and transports are often seen as canaries in the coal mine  
The other thing people might pick on is valuations  which are running historically high at above 19 for the SPX  One argument is that the Fed is helping prolong this rally and stretching valuations through its current buying program  Now that earnings season is here  investors get a chance to see if companies can stand on their own and prove they re strong without necessarily getting stock market help from cheap money

CHART OF THE DAY  FAANG DEATH RUMORS EXAGGERATED  Anyone who thinks the FAANG stocks   NYFANG candlestick  have seen their best days might want to check out their performance vs  the S P 500 Index  SPX purple line  over the last three months  This chart shows how much the FAANGs have outperformed the broader index  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
When the Big Banks Talk   It s still just the start of earnings season and way too early to take much away  considering more than 90  of S P 500 companies haven t reported yet  However  a steady march out of the gate by the banks could be meaningful  in part because the banks  by the very nature of their business  reflect so much economic and market sentiment  So when a bank executive like JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon says in the company s Q4 earnings release that  the US consumer continues to be in a strong position  and  the robust holiday season  led to a 10  jump in credit card transactions for JPM during the quarter  he s talking from a position of authority  Not that CEOs in other sectors aren t  but they re more focused on their individual industries  Bank executives run businesses that tend to give them a big picture perspective 
Day Off  Monday s a holiday with the markets closed in the U S  That means it might be a good idea to be a bit more cautious in your trades today and perhaps consider smaller ones than normal  Volatility might hop a little as investors prepare for a three day weekend  Though the geopolitical situation has been a bit quieter lately and a phase one China deal is signed  there s always a chance of events happening over a long weekend that people won t be able to immediately trade on  This tends to make investors nervous going in  meaning there might be some profit taking and short covering in the meantime  So enjoy the long weekend away from the market  but understand that today might be unpredictable 
Volatility Matters  While it might pick up ahead of the weekend  volatility  as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   just hasn t been a factor lately  The VIX traded down near 12 3 on Thursday and hasn t shown much inclination to re test highs near 16 that it hit earlier this month when Iran tensions flashed  However  in the spirit of that old market saying about low prices being the cure for low prices  some analysts see a lower VIX as one indication of possible volatility ahead  One school of thought suggests investors have gotten too complacent  partly because some of the major issues like Brexit and China trade have receded  It s probably never a good idea to get that way  Like a talented baseball pitcher  the market has a way of punishing people who take their eyes off the ball  Also  as one analyst pointed out on CNBC yesterday  we re never more than one tweet away from possible volatility

35693,257208,SLB,Halliburton  HAL  Q4 Earnings Top On International Activity,opinion,"Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   delivered better than expected fourth quarter earnings as robust international activity offset headwinds in North America 
The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   reported earnings of 32 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents  However  the bottom line was 22  lower than the year ago figure of 41 cents 
Operating loss incurred by Halliburton was  1 7 billion against  608 million operating income for the same period last year 
Meanwhile  revenues of  5 2 billion were 12 55  lower than the year ago quarter but topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 08 billion  North American revenues plunged 30 3  year over year to  2 3 billion  However  revenues from Halliburton s international operations rose 11 54  from the year ago period to  2 9 billion  an area that continues to exhibit growth momentum 
Management s Outlook
The world s biggest provider of hydraulic fracking noted that although North American activity levels in the fourth quarter ramped down  the company continues to successfully ride on the changing market dynamics through excellent execution and management of the controllable factors 
Notably  Halliburton is witnessing a broad based  steady recovery in its international business  This is clearly reflected by the 10  increase in the region s year over year sales  The company still anticipates its international revenues to grow in 2020 owing to expanded activity  judicious capital spending  pricing gains to complement Halliburton s emphasis on high margin businesses 
Even as the company persistently battles a challenging business landscape in North America  it is looking to boost free cash flow generation and improve returns Halliburton Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   
 
Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment came in at  387 million  falling 22  below the year ago level of  496 million but beating the consensus estimate of  366 million 
The division s performance was affected by weakness in activity and pricing across multiple product service lines in the North American land sector  tepid stimulation activity in Latin America and lowered well intervention services in the Middle East Asia  These negative impacts were partly offset by excellent outcomes from the Eastern Hemisphere cementing business and improved pressure pumping activity  increased completion tool sales globally 
Drilling and Evaluation unit profit rose from  185 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to  224 million in the corresponding period of 2019  However  the segmental income fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  258 million 
The segmental results were primarily driven by higher drilling activity in Europe Africa CIS coupled with year end software revenues worldwide and product service lines activity in the Middle East Asia  The positives were partly offset by lower activity across a number of product service lines in North America as well as a decreased testing activity in Latin America 
Balance Sheet
Halliburton s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was  340 million  As of Dec 31  2019  the company had  2 3 billion in cash cash equivalents and  10 3 billion in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 56 24

35695,257210,SLB,Things You Should Know From Halliburton s  HAL  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Heading into the fourth quarter  expectations for Halliburton s   NYSE HAL   earnings were rather   The company  which is active in all unconventional basins in the U S   operates in two segments  Completion and Production  and Drilling and Evaluation 
The last three month period of 2019 was going to be tough for the company with North American oil rig count dropping by 33 from the third quarter  as reported by Baker Hughes   NYSE BKR   in its highly followed weekly publication  Halliburton  with sizable presence in the region  was always going to suffer 
However  the company did manage to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as robust international activity more than offset headwinds in North America  The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   reported an adjusted profit of  285 million or 32 cents per share from October to December  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents 
While the numbers don t fully explainthe stock s lackluster performance  edging down 0 8  to  23 77 by the close of trading on Tuesday  following its earnings release  we take a closer look at the results to gain further insight  Here are certain key things you need to know from Halliburton s earnings update 
Inside the Numbers
Massive One Time Charge  Including one time items  Halliburton actually lost  1 88 per share  The company  with a market capitalization of  21 billion  took a  2 2 billion hit from non cash impairment charges associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment 
North American Woes  Revenues fell  745 million  or 12 6   to  5 2 billion from  5 9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018  In particular  revenues from North America dropped by 30 2  year over year  which highlights depressed activity in this influential region  This meant that bottom line was 22  lower than the year ago figure of 41 cents   
International Operations to the Rescue  On the other hand  sales from international operations climbed 10 1  from the year ago period to  2 9 billion  an area that continues to exhibit growth momentum  especially in Middle East Asia 
Operating Margin Improves  Halliburton s adjusted operating income was down 10 2  to  546 million  indicating softness in activity and pricing  However  operational efficiency and cost management allowed the company to better its profit margins by 300 basis points 
Solid Balance Sheet  The company had about  2 3 billion in cash on the books and was able to restrict its long term debt load at the year ago level of  10 3 billion 
Lower Free Cash Flows  Free cash flow was down  falling to  915 million in 2019 from  1 1 billion in 2018  Despite the free cash flow decline  management bought back about  100 million of its shares  and its quarterly dividend remained unchanged 
Above Average Dividend Yield  Halliburton today pays shareholders 18 cents per share quarterly dividend  72 cents per share annually  for a total dividend yield of 3   which is higher than the industry s 1 9  
What Lies Ahead 
Oil Price Prediction for 2020  Oil posted 34 5  rise last year    the biggest annual increase since 2016  In particular  WTI  the U S  benchmark  jumped nearly 11  in December  aided by the agreement on a phase one trade deal between U S  and China and the OPEC  group s output cut announcement  However  the improving oil market notwithstanding  WTI crude averaged  56 74 in 2019  around  8 a barrel lower than the 2018 average of  65 06 
As usual  there are too many variables to make an educated guess as to the price of oil going forward  A clutch of industry observers sees depressed prices this year  including the EIA that expects an average price of  59 50 a barrel for 2020    
Company Outlook  Well aware of the tough operating environment  Halliburton aims to protect its cash flows  The company has pledged to spend  1 2 billion in 2020 as capital expenditure  down from  1 5 billion in 2019 
Halliburton generated approximately  2 4 billion in operating cash flow last year  compared to  3 2 billion in 2018  Therefore  even a 50  drop in operating cash flows in 2020 would come to  1 2 billion  enough to cover capital spending  
Moving onto the next quarter  Halliburton expects narrowing sequential profitability for both its segments  For the Completion and Production unit   which makes up around 59  of the oilfield service provider s total revenues and 63  of its operating income   the company projects margin decline of 1 25 1 5   The Drilling and Evaluation margins could drop by 2 2 5   Clearly  Halliburton sees enough headwinds over the next few months 
Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was  141 million  and the company expects the same amount for the first quarter of 2020 
Zacks Rank   Stock Picks
Halliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Meanwhile  investors interested in the  space could look at a better option like Oceaneering International  Inc    NYSE OII   that carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston  TX based company represents 70 5  earnings per share growth over 2019

35718,257233,SLB,Oil Prices Push Higher as Chinese Data Brighten Demand Outlook,news,"By Peter Nurse
Investing com   Oil prices pushed higher Friday  helped by signs the growth slowdown in China  the world s largest importer  may be coming to an end 
At 09 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   U S  crude futures traded 0 4  higher at  58 78 a barrel  while the international benchmark Brent climbed 0 5  to  64 92   As such  both blends are on track to end the week only a fraction below where they started it 
Earlier Friday  China reported that its gross domestic product grew 6  in the fourth quarter  meaning economic growth slowed to 6 1  in 2019  This may have been the country s weakest growth in nearly three decades  but traders zeroed in on the monthly data for industrial production  which grew at the fastest rate since April in December  while retail sales growth stayed at 8  and fixed asset investment ticked up from a multi year low  All those indicators point to a bottoming out of the world s second largest economy 
This follows on from the signing of the trade deal between China and the U S  earlier this week  which capped   at least for now   hostilities between the globe s two economic powerhouses which have lasted for around 18 months and damaged global growth 
 The signing of the U S  China trade deal has given optimism for a revival in global manufacturing  and thus stronger oil demand growth   said Bjarne Schieldrop  Oslo based chief commodities analyst at SEB AB  cited in a Bloomberg report   This is what gives the oil price some vigor  
At the same time Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the world s largest oilfield service company  also said it sees improved demand in for its services 2020  after a second half in which its U S  operations were hit by a sharp slowdown in U S  drilling 
 We ended the year with 2020 oil demand growth sentiment turning positive as uncertainty reduced following the progress made toward a U S  China trade deal   the company said in its earnings release

35719,257234,SLB,Big three oilfield services firms start year with asset sale plans   Reuters,news,"Schlumberger  SLB  1 7    Halliburton  HAL  1 3   and Baker Hughes  BKR  0 6   have started the new year by putting   800M worth of assets up for sale  as the three leading oilfield services names seek to adjust to reduced spending by oil and gas producers 
The trio  which hold roughly a quarter of the global oilfield services market  recently disclosed plans to review operations in light of declining demand for their services 
HAL tells Reuters it is marketing its pipeline and process services business  and hopes to close a sale by mid year 
SLB and BKR separately have hired advisors to sell units that improve production from wells using rod lift gear and that latter has hired an investment bank to sell its wellhead services operations  according to the report

35726,257241,SLB,Schlumberger  SLB  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  8 19 billion  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger 
For Schlumberger  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of  0 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 43  delivering a surprise of  7 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schlumberger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-slb-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200498018,200498018
35727,257242,SLB,Oil Market Week Ahead  Earnings Season Starts With Schlumberger,opinion,"The U S  earnings season starts next week with  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Citigroup   NYSE C  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  breaking the ice on Tuesday  Most of the oil majors won t report until the end of January or early February  but the first insight into how the industry has done in the last quarter will come from oil services firm Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  on Friday  Given that Schlumberger provides services to all the main oil producers and to a number of sovereign governments  Schlumberger s regional update will give a sense of how the oil project pipeline is progressing 
Global Growth Concerns
The World Bank has slightly revised downwards its global growth forecasts for this year to 2 5   a touch above the 2 4  growth in 2019  This may become problematic for OPEC as the cartel operates based on higher growth assumptions for this year and may end up being forced to adjust them downward by the time of its next meeting in March  Demand from developed economies doesn t show any signs of a turnaround and with U S  oil production continuing to expand  the risks seem to be stacking toward a scenario of oversupply  The majority of global growth is still concentrated in the BRIC countries and China is still leading the growth here  Chinese Q4 GDP and industrial production data next week will show if there is cause for concern for oil investors The signing of the U S  China trade deal  which is expected either on Jan  15 or shortly after  will probably come with much fanfare  but it still remains to be seen which of the punitive tariffs will actually be removed  
Country Update  Guyana  
According to the World Bank  Guyana s GDP growth is about to jump from 4  in 2019 to 86 7      this year  Most of this growth is expected to come from the country s oil industry which is expanding at a fast enough pace to catch up with Brazil by 2025  Until now Guyana  which has only a population of 800 000  has mainly produced and exported rice  sugar  aluminum  shrimp and bauxite  but vast new offshore oil production coming on line is about to change that 
 Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  started pumping the first oil from Guyana just before Christmas and is expected to raise  output to 120 000 bbl day over the next few months  and eventually to 750 000bbl day in the next five years  Other international players already active in the country include  Tullow Oil   LON TLW    Total  SA  PA TOTF   Hess  NYSE HES  and Qatar Petroleum   
Iran Tensions Remain An Issue
For the moment  the U S  and Iran seem to have stepped away from the brink of a conflict  but it would be far too early to dismiss this as a major factor in the market  If the conflict started affecting the Strait of Hormuz  the world s largest transit route for oil  East Asian countries would be the most impacted  Nearly 80  of the oil leaving the Gulf is destined for China  India  Japan  South Korea and Singapore  The daily flow through the Strait of Hormuz is around 21m bbl day  or just over 20  of the global supply  There is no fully functional alternative although Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates technically own pipelines that could ship almost a third of that volume via alternative routes

35728,257243,SLB,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  JPMorgan  Delta Air Lines  Schlumberger,opinion,"After surging to record highs last week  the stock market will be put to the test as U S  companies start reporting earnings for the fourth quarter this week 
Earnings growth will need to justify the sky high premium the market has reached given the explosive rally over the past year  Analysts are widely expecting to see the majority of companies meet earnings expectations 
 
Another key event that could influence the direction of markets  the U S  and China signing Phase One of the trade deal  Investors are eagerly awaiting the details of the deal which could clarify its implications on some sectors 
 In a week packed with earnings reports  there are three mega stocks in particular whose readings could impress  
1  JPMorgan Chase   Co
Wall Street s powerhouse commercial and investment bank  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  will release its Q4 earnings on Tuesday  Analysts on average expect  2 35 a share profit on sales of  27 87 billion 
Driven by strong loan growth and robust business in the lender s flagship investment banking division  2019 is proving to be a healthy year for JPMorgan   In Q3  the bank posted its biggest increase in revenue from fixed income trading in almost three years and also surprised with a jump in fees from investment banking 







The earnings momentum has kept JPM shares well supported this year  Early in the month  JPM shares hit a record high of  141 10  They are up more than 35  in the past year  closing Friday at  136 07 after falling 1  
Although a low interest rate environment going forward may not help the lender  it could fuel increased loan expansion  assisting JPM in increasing its lending activity  That s what JPM s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon pointed out last year when he told analysts that the near term outlook for credit is relatively rosy 
2  Delta Air Lines
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  will report Q4 earnings on Tuesday before the market open  On average  analysts are expecting  1 34 a share profit on sales of  11 34 billion 
Delta led all U S  carriers in generating higher net income  giving its CEO  Ed Bastian  tremendous ammunition with which to expand  In September  Delta agreed to pay  1 9 billion for a 20  stake in LATAM Airlines Group  NYSE LTM   Latin America s largest airline 
At an investor event in December  Delta announced it expects 2020 adjusted earnings of  6 75 to  7 75 a share  which compares with an average estimate of  7 06 from analysts  on continued high travel demand  Top line revenue will grow 4 6   generating  4 billion of free cash flow 







The carrier also maintained its outlook for 2 3  growth in non fuel costs for each seat flown a mile  a measure of efficiency  But these positive tailwinds have so far failed to excite investors  Delta s stock has hardly budged in the past six months  the result of global anxiety over economic growth and trade uncertainty   Shares closed at  59 24 on Friday  rising 0 5  on the day 
3  Schlumberger 
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  the world s largest oil services provider will report its Q4 earnings on Friday before the market opens  Analysts on average expect  0 37 a share profit on sales of  8 17 billion 
The shares of Schlumberger  which operates in more than 120 countries  supplying the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services  are experiencing a dramatic recovery that began in early October as the company has seen a rebound in international business  The stock closed on Friday at  39 83  up about 30  during the past three months 







Schlumberger generates most of its income from business outside the U S  and Canada  The oilfield services giant is forecasting single digit growth for 2019  with explorers slated to boost spending as much as 8   The earnings potential for Schlumberger internationally is about four times that of its competitors when considering its larger market share and operating margin ",2020-01-12,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-jpmorgan-delta-air-lines-schlumberger-200498132,200498132

35732,257247,SLB,The Phil Flynn Energy Report  01 15 2020,opinion,"Looking For Support
The oil market is trying to find support along with the lower Bollinger  bands and is not getting help from supply data from the American Petroleum Institute API   But it may find support from the fact that the market may have to reprice in at least a bit of geopolitical risk premium  OPEC  today increased its 2020 world oil demand growth forecast by 140 000 barrels to 1 22 million barrels a day   but also raised global economic growth forecast to 3 1   
Oil s rally yesterday was thwarted by a rehashing of the fact that the Trump Administration will not lift tariffs on China until after the election  Of course  anyone who has been watching the Fox Business Network already knows that  and the reporting of old news seemed to be a catalyst for a late dip in oil and stocks  There were also rumors that the OPEC meeting in March might be canceled ensuring that OPEC plus production cuts would stay in place until at least June 
Yet Russian energy minister Alexander Novak and sources from the UAE said that the March meeting is still on  Mr  Novak said that Russia is ready to comply with the OPEC   agreement to reduce oil production in January  So cuts are in place and will remain in place until at least March 
The API reported that crude supply increased by 1 103 million barrels yet a massive 3 198 million barrel in gasoline and an even larger  6 779 million barrel build in distillate put a bearish tilt on the market  Yet based on the muted post report action  it gives us more confidence that we should be near the end of the correction in the petroleum bull market 
Shale producer pain may lead to merger mania  Reuters reports that U S  oil output growth is expected to slow over the next five years  likely prompting oil majors to  gobble up  smaller shale oil producers  Mark Papa  shale pioneer and non executive chairman of Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   told Reuters   Papa  boss of the world s largest oilfield services company  expects U S  output to grow by just 400 000 bpd in 2020 and by 100 000 500 000 bpd per year through 2025  depending on future oil prices   What we are seeing is that there has been a kind of inflection in the growth path for U S  oil production  mainly due to inflection in shale oil growth   Papa said in an interview in Saudi Arabia  He cited the shorter life and high decline rates of shale reservoirs such as the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas   I m not saying that the U S  shale oil will go away but I m saying it will become a less powerful force as we go through the 2020s than it was in the previous decade  
Everybody has a dream  President Nicol s Maduro said Venezuela s crude output would more than double to 2 0 million barrels a day in 2020   We re at nearly 1mn b d now and the goal in 2020 is to reach 2mn b d   he declared in the speech before the National Constituent Assembly  
Natural gas is coming under more pressure as old man winter took the last train to the coast  How warm is it  Well  Bret Walts at Bam WX says that   We ve seen major changes especially on the European model for medium range weather model known as the Ensemble Prediction System  EPS  EPS  has lost more than 30 heating degree days  HDDs  since yesterday  The Global Ensemble Forecast System  GEFS  is a weather forecast model made up of 21 separate forecasts  has also seen warmer trends but not to the extreme of the major EPS trends  Model chaos has been high as of late  The last several weeks  the GEFS has averaged more than 30 HDDs too cold for week 2 
Walts says that   into late January and February we are losing our major source of cold air as the Polar Vortex returns to the other side of the planet   they can have it  Strong global winds favor warmer risks in the Eastern US  so we are inclined to go with lower than normal heating demand in week 2 of February  As of now  we do not see a  sustained  cold pattern in the Eastern US  Any cold remains look to remain rather transient following this brief cooler period in days 5  So get out you ice skates this week before the ice melts  P S    your natural gas calls are also melting  
The FT reports that natural gas production in the U S  is poised to decline for the first time in half a decade  the government said on Tuesday  as persistently low prices lead to a slowdown in drilling  The U S  is the world s largest gas supplier and is flexing its muscle in international markets through exports of liquefied gas  But investors concerned about meager returns have begun to hold back on funding for oil and gas exploration and production companies  The companies have responded by cutting back on capital spending and  in turn  tempering their forecasts for future production  
While U S   dry gas  production  which excludes hydrocarbon liquids  will rise by 3 percent to a new record of 94 7bn cubic feet per day this year  the Energy Information Administration said in its short term energy outlook on Tuesday  and it will fall back in 2021  The agency expects production will be 94 1bn cu ft d next year  representing the first annual decline since 2016   as relatively low natural gas prices contribute to a reduction in natural gas directed drilling   A must read

35733,257248,SLB,Can Solid Overseas Market Aid Halliburton  HAL  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2019 results on Jan 21  before the opening bell  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s earnings is 29 cents per share on revenues of  5 1 billion Highlights of Q3 EarningsHalliburton reported in line third quarter earnings as robust international activity offset headwinds in North America  The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   saw its net income registered at 34 cents per share  matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate However  the bottom line fell 32  below the year earlier earnings  Moreover  operating income of  536 million lagged the prior year s  716 million Meanwhile  revenues of  5 6 billion were 10 1  lower than the year ago quarter and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 8 billion  Revenues from North America too fell 21 1  year over year to  2 9 billion  However  the same from Halliburton s international operations rose 6 9  from the year ago period to  2 6 billion  an area that continues to exhibit growth momentum As far as earnings surprises are concerned  this Houston  TX based company boasts an excellent record  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four reports meeting the same on two other occasions  the average beat being 6 87   This is depicted in the graph below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Impact Q4 Results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been revised 14 7  downward in the past 90 days  Given this backdrop  let s delve into the factors that might have impacted the company s performance in the December quarter E P Capital Discipline  Clients have been adopting a more conservative approach to their investment decisions  Consequently  upstream oil majors are now committed to reap more investor returns rather than scaling up production by overspending cash flows  This created an extremely challenging operating environment for service providers with no adequate incentives to trigger investments in mature field development for exploring unconventional resources or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity is likely to have hurt demand for Halliburton s services and equipment in the fourth quarter Lower Rig Count in North America  During the fourth quarter of 2019  oil rig count in North America saw a decrease of 870 year over year  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and the resultant reflection in rig counts  statistics suggest weakening of activity in the North American region during the October December timeframe  Halliburton with its sizable presence in the area is expected to reflect this downside in the to be reported results Recovery in International Operations  One bright spot in the otherwise gloomy earnings outlook is the recovery in overseas markets  Halliburton s international revenues increased 10  throughout the first three quarters of 2019  a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter as well  driven by increased customer spending on drilling and completion projects across all regions outside North America including land  offshore and unconventional  This positive trend was also confirmed by the Baker Hughes rig count statistics  which put the international tally in the fourth quarter at 3 330  reflecting an increase of 9 8  over the year ago period The company s international revenues are likely to have grown in high single digits during 2019  Importantly  Halliburton saw the resurgence in customers  spending across multiple geographies outside North America What Does Our Model Say The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict a beat for Halliburton this earnings season  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or

35734,257249,SLB,Schlumberger Earnings Preview  Despite Stock Gains Business Still Challenging,opinion,"Reports 4Q 2019 results on Friday  Jan  17  before the open
Revenue Expectation   8 17 billion
EPS Expectation   0 37

When Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  reports its fourth quarter earnings tomorrow  investors will be looking for some strong justification for the stock s 30  rally since October that halted a multiyear plunge 
The shares were down more than 3  on Wednesday  closing at  38 33  giving up some of the gains from the past quarter as oil prices continued their downward slide 
Despite the move higher this past quarter  the company has been stuck in a downturn since the middle of 2014  In the current environment where energy prices remain depressed  the world s largest oil and gas producers have been reluctant to increase spending  thus thwarting the company s efforts to truly recover 
Schlumberger operates in more than 120 countries  supplying the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services  from exploration through production  Indeed  this behemoth s quarterly results serve as a bellwether for the energy business given its reach across regions and insight into drillers  plans  Yet the world s largest oil services provider has seen its stock plunge more than 50  in the past five years 
The latest evidence of this tough operating environment came in October when Schlumberger reported its largest net quarterly loss in at least a decade after the company took  12 7 billion in pretax charges  This was its first since Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch took the reins in August and represented the new CEO s strategy to clean the balance sheet from the goodwill items that he could not justify 
Most of the charges    8 8 billion   comprised writedowns on goodwill  the intangible assets on a corporate balance sheet that typically arises after the acquisition of another company  Schlumberger cited its 2010 purchase of Smith International Inc  and its takeover of Cameron International Corp  in 2016  as well as the subsequent deterioration in market conditions 
5  Dividend Yield
After the drastic correction in price  the shares looked cheap and some investors thought the bottom had been reached  especially with the company s 5  dividend yield in this low rate environment  Despite the optimism that has supported Schlumberger s stock through the past quarter  we don t yet see a growth catalyst on the horizon  Oil prices are sliding again and U S  producers aren t willing to spend 
Under pressure from shareholders  exploration and production companies are keeping spending in check  returning most of their free cash flow to shareholders in the shape of dividends and share buybacks 
Schlumberger itself isn t shying away from admitting that reality  Last year  the company told analysts that it expects oil production from North American shale basins to slow as explorers cut spending after the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions and the move away from growth  In Q3  Schlumberger s North American revenue declined 11  from the same period a year earlier  while climbing 8  in international markets 
Schlumberger s business outside the U S  and Canada is where the company generates most of its income  The oilfield services provider is forecasting single digit growth for 2019  with explorers slated to boost spending as much as 8  
The earnings potential for Schlumberger internationally is about four times that of its competitors when considering its larger market share and operating margin  But betting on its global growth is also risky  Many large oil producing nations are in pain and keeping their supplies under check because of fears of a global supply glut  We don t expect that situation to change anytime soon  and hence see no near term upside for Schlumberger stock 
Bottom Line
The shares of oil services companies have become cheaper after a precipitous decline in the past five years  But despite their more attractive valuations  we don t think the time has come to snap up their shares  In this uncertain global economic and geopolitical environment  oil prices may not remain higher sustainably  It would be better for investors to avoid entering this trade now ",2020-01-16,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-earnings-preview-despite-stock-gains-business-still-challenging-200499147,200499147
35735,257250,SLB,Schlumberger  SLB  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 37 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 36 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 41   A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest oilfield services company would post earnings of  0 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 43  delivering a surprise of 7 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Schlumberger  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  8 23 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 49   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 18 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Schlumberger shares have lost about 3 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 7  
What s Next for Schlumberger 
While Schlumberger has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Schlumberger was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 33 on  8 07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 64 on  33 42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Field Services is currently in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-slb-q4-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-200499579,200499579

shares have outperformed the broader S P 500 index year to date  68 3  vs  23 3    The Zacks analyst believes that Apple is benefiting from continued momentum in the Services segment and improved iPhone sales  owing to the trade in programs Non iPhone devices continue to perform well  driven by strong demand for iPad  Apple Watch and AirPods  The company s expanded portfolio that now includes new MacBook Pro  Apple Watch Series 5 and streaming service Apple TV  is a key catalyst  Moreover  iPhone sales are expected to improve in China with the new iPhone models Nevertheless  uncertainties over the timeframe of the resolution of the U S  China trade war do not bode well for the company  Further  antitrust investigations  App Store related lawsuits and Spotify s complaint increase legal woes Shares of PepsiCo have lost 0 1  in the past three months against the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry s fall of 0 3   The Zacks analyst believes that adverse currency rates are likely to hurt the company s results in 2019 Unfavorable impacts of ongoing investments to strengthen business  higher tax rate  and the absence of asset sale and refranchising gains that occurred in 2018 are likely to hurt PepsiCo s earnings in 2019  However  the company reported earnings and sales beat in third quarter 2019  driven by strength in all segments and robust pricing  This marked its ninth sales beat in the last 11 quarters  with positive earnings surprise in 14 of the last 15 quarters The company s productivity savings goal of at least  1 billion annually through 2023 bodes well  Moreover  PepsiCo now expects organic revenues for 2019 to meet or exceed 4  growth stated previously BHP s shares have lost 5 4  over the past six months against the Zacks Mining   Miscellaneous industry s fall of 1 6   The Zacks analyst believes that BHP Group is poised to gain from its investment plans in petroleum  copper  iron ore and potash BHP Group anticipates unit costs to be higher in fiscal 2020 thanks to natural field decline at conventional petroleum  falling copper grades  lower by product credits and higher deferred stripping costs at Escondida  Trade volatility and slowdown in global growth have made investors apprehensive and affected commodity markets  which in turn will weigh on BHP Group s results Iron ore prices have declined lately amid signs of recovery in Brazilian supply  However  metal prices will recover eventually driven by demand supply imbalance  Further  the company s efforts to make operations efficient by adopting smarter technology across its value chain will also drive results  Strong cash flow and lower debt also bode well Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Canadian National Railway and Schlumberger Just Released

	We saw another morning selloff to begin Tuesday  but unfortunately  we didn t get another rebound as the major indices finished the session in the red 
	The Dow had the worst performance of the day  ending right at its lows with a decline of 0 42   or nearly 120 points  to 28 583 68 
	Just yesterday  the index recovered from a more than 200 point plunge to gain nearly 70 points 
	The NASDAQ spent most of the session in the green as tech continues to outperform  But a late plunge put the index just under breakeven with a slide of 0 03   or less than 3 points  to 9068 58 
	The S P chopped in tandem with the Dow on Tuesday and ended lower by 0 28  to 3237 18 
	Well  we re still not at war with Iran  thankfully  In fact  there was no major news overnight  but we know they ll be some type of retaliation for the recent airstrike  At the very least  tensions will remain heightened between the two countries for the foreseeable future 
	Investors considered this strife enough of a reason to take some profits off the table on Tuesday 
	But don t be surprised to see stocks back at all time highs relatively soon  especially if there are no big developments in the Iran situation  The market remains encouraged by the trade progress with China and the possibility of Phase 1 getting signed this month 
	Despite the negative results  Tuesday s session did have some good news  The ISM non manufacturing index rose to 55 in December  which topped expectations and improved upon the previous month s 53 9   Anything above 50 means expansion  
	That reading is all the more welcome because last week s ISM Manufacturing index marked the fifth straight month of contraction  sub 50

35822,257337,SLB,Top Research Reports For Apple  PepsiCo   BHP,opinion,"Friday  December 6  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Apple  AAPL   PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   PEP  and BHP Group  BHP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Apple s shares have outperformed the broader S P 500 index year to date  68 3  vs  23 3    The Zacks analyst believes that Apple is benefiting from continued momentum in the Services segment and improved iPhone sales  owing to the trade in programs 
Non iPhone devices continue to perform well  driven by strong demand for iPad  Apple Watch and AirPods  The company s expanded portfolio that now includes new MacBook Pro  Apple Watch Series 5 and streaming service Apple TV  is a key catalyst  Moreover  iPhone sales are expected to improve in China with the new iPhone models 
Nevertheless  uncertainties over the timeframe of the resolution of the U S  China trade war do not bode well for the company  Further  antitrust investigations  App Store related lawsuits and Spotify s complaint increase legal woes 
 You can  
Shares of PepsiCo have lost 0 1  in the past three months against the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry s fall of 0 3   The Zacks analyst believes that adverse currency rates are likely to hurt the company s results in 2019 
Unfavorable impacts of ongoing investments to strengthen business  higher tax rate  and the absence of asset sale and refranchising gains that occurred in 2018 are likely to hurt PepsiCo s earnings in 2019  However  the company reported earnings and sales beat in third quarter 2019  driven by strength in all segments and robust pricing  This marked its ninth sales beat in the last 11 quarters  with positive earnings surprise in 14 of the last 15 quarters 
The company s productivity savings goal of at least  1 billion annually through 2023 bodes well  Moreover  PepsiCo now expects organic revenues for 2019 to meet or exceed 4  growth stated previously 
 You can  
BHP s shares have lost 5 4  over the past six months against the Zacks Mining   Miscellaneous industry s fall of 1 6   The Zacks analyst believes that BHP Group is poised to gain from its investment plans in petroleum  copper  iron ore and potash 
BHP Group anticipates unit costs to be higher in fiscal 2020 thanks to natural field decline at conventional petroleum  falling copper grades  lower by product credits and higher deferred stripping costs at Escondida  Trade volatility and slowdown in global growth have made investors apprehensive and affected commodity markets  which in turn will weigh on BHP Group s results 
Iron ore prices have declined lately amid signs of recovery in Brazilian supply  However  metal prices will recover eventually driven by demand supply imbalance  Further  the company s efforts to make operations efficient by adopting smarter technology across its value chain will also drive results  Strong cash flow and lower debt also bode well

35848,257363,SLB,Energy Stock Carnage Sets Up  Rinse and Repeat  Start to 2020,news," Bloomberg     Energy equity carnage was alive and well throughout 2019  and the start of 2020 could bring more of the same for the beaten up sector  though some analysts are turning positive 
 We are in an environment where the playbook to kick off the year reads like a rinse and repeat from past years   CIBC Capital Markets  energy team said in a note to clients  The team added that  it s also one that doesn t require anyone to be a hero or to take on more heartburn than is necessary  
The energy sector is the worst performing group this year  up a mere 3  versus the S P 500 Index s rise of over 25   Canada s energy gauge has advanced about 12  against Toronto s stock market gain of about 18   Crude oil has outpaced both indices during the same period 
A slightly positive tilt is creeping into analyst forecasts  with JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  recently turning  more sanguine  on the exploration   production sector  while  Citigroup   NYSE C  sees a trade in oil service stocks having  legs  after persistent weakness  Still  analysts are favoring larger cap firms before diving all in  One of Wall Street s top strategists highlighted the potential for energy equities to rebound  as cyclical segments of the market could present an opportunity 
Capital discipline  the central mantra in which drillers are living by  remains a key focus point for investors  Shale pioneers see output growth slowing next year  which could be a positive for macro commodity prices  Merger and acquisition potential in the E P sector exists  but higher oil prices will be needed to revive deals given a  clouded fundamental backdrop   according to Bloomberg Intelligence 
Here are some analysts picks on various sub sectors 
Citi s top oilfield service picks for 2020 are Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co   Nextier Oilfield Solutions  Chart Industries  Baker Hughes  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Select Energy Services and Liberty Oilfield Services  The bank thinks the oilfield service space has started to  turn the corner  Morgan Stanley s top E P and integrated oil picks include ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP    Noble Energy   NYSE NBL  and  Chevron   NYSE CVX    The 2020 backdrop continues to favor large cap and globally diversified companies   the bank said in a note CIBC Capital Markets likes oil sands firms including Suncor Energy  and pipeline stocks such as TC Energy   Our top ideas for the coming year might seem somewhat mundane  but we view them as logical and the right place in which to allocate capital   the bank wrote to clients in a note BMO Capital Markets favors Canadian energy firms relative to their neighbors down south as the northern group  appears to have largely addressed the lower for longer price environment  by restoring profitability even at these depressed prices   Brian Belski said in a note See also

35861,257376,SLB,The Energy Report  Crude Whisperers,opinion,"The oil market had one of those meltdowns on Monday s only set the stage for a turnaround Tuesday  Despite all of the doom and gloom talk and the expectations of a big oil supply build  the whisper number on the street may actually give the market a surprise  when the American Petroleum Reports  API  releases its report tonight after the close at 3 30p Central Time 
Despite low refinery runs and an expected build in the Cushing  Oklahoma delivery hub  sources are suggesting that we may get a big surge in U S  oil exports and a drop in U S  oil imports and could set the stage for a surprise crude oil draw  The U S  is going to start to feel the fall out from the massive drop in Saudi oil production from the attack last September  Because of that and the demand for U S  light oil  our exports should break a record if the whisper numbers are right 
The whispers were right last week when they predicted that massive crude oil build  The API version put the build at 10 451 million barrels  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  put it at 9 3 million barrels 
Of course  that build came with significant product ramifications  The API reported that distillate supply fell by 2 862 million barrels and the EIA by 3 8 million barrels putting supply about 11  below the five year average  Gasoline   according to API  fell by 934 000 barrels and EIA put the drop at a hefty 3 8 million barrels  Refiners will have to step up or products will most likely fall well below average and could cause price spikes on the retail level 
The bigger picture shows there is more concern about the ability of shale oil to continue to grow at these lofty levels  Low oil prices have made it hard for many shale companies to make money and bankruptcies and falling rig counts could suggest that lofty predictions of growing U S  output might be overstated  Even the Russian oil minister is weighing in  Alexander Novak is saying that the slowdown in U S  oil production is a trend  He is calling for U S  oil production to peak in just a few years  He says that U S  oil production is unlikely to grow at the same pace at current oil prices  
Investors are reflecting that sentiment  The Wall Street Journal wrote   Existing shale investors have all but cut off new influxes of cash after producers burned through more than  100 billion beyond what they earned since the beginning of 2014  Shale equity and bond issuances are at their lowest level in years  and the vast majority of companies expect banks to lower their revolving lines of credit in the coming months  according to a survey by law firm Haynes and Boone LLP  
Reuters is reporting   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co on Monday promised more cost cuts after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue as the oilfield services look to counter weak demand from North American shale producers  sending its shares up about 7   The biggest hydraulic fracking services provider  which earlier this month cut 650 jobs in North America  said it would take steps over the next few quarters that will lead to  300 million in annualized cost savings  Oilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment  Larger rival Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  said on Friday it had recorded a  1 58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America   HAL is taking costs out more aggressively than the Street forecast  which it expects to lead to strong Q4 operating margin improvement in the Drilling   Evaluation segments despite falling revenue   said Anish Kapadia  founder of London based oil and gas consultancy firm AKap Energy  Halliburton warned of further activity declines in North America  with fourth quarter revenue for its hydraulic fracturing business declining by low double digits and margins by 125 basis points to 175 basis points 
Reuters reports that   the U S  Treasury Department on Monday renewed a license allowing  Chevron   NYSE CVX   the last U S  operating energy company in Venezuela  to continue drilling in the country for another three months through Jan  22  That s probably a good thing and probably is more proof that President Trump may not be a Russian agent  You see  Russia would have the most to gain if Chevron pulled out  Already the Maduro Government deep in debt to the Putin government and is giving away its oil fields to Russia and the Venezuelan people s future to pay off its Russian debt  No word on whether Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was for the Chevron extension but I am sure that Hillary Clinton would tell you  by her silence  she is admitting that she is a Russian agent 
Maybe it won t be that cold  Natural gas fell as the winter blast for October might not be as wintery  Yes  the natural gas changing weather forecasts for the season have just begun ",2019-10-22,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-crude-whisperers-200476069,200476069

35863,257378,SLB,The Phil Flynn Energy Report 10 28 2019,opinion,"Shale Rocked
The U S  shale industry is expected to be rocked by subpar earnings and reports that bankers are running away from oil shale investments  This comes as Baker Hughes reported that the number of active U S  rigs drilling for oil fell by 17 to 696 this week  The total active U S  rig count fell by 21 to 830  the lowest level since 2017  The drop in rigs is more evidence that U S  oil production estimates by the EIA will have to be adjusted downward because not only is production per well disappointing  the money is also drying up 
Reuters News reports   Investors are bracing for weaker results from U S  shale players in the coming days as lower oil and natural gas prices and cost cutting measures have weighed on third quarter operations  Reuters says that   Major shale producers ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Concho Resources  NYSE CXO  this week kick off quarterly earnings reports for a group whipsawed this year by volatile pricing and investor demands for improved returns  Oil and gas producers have cut drilling and slashed jobs amid worries over pricing outlooks  U S  oil prices are down 17  and natural gas is down about 31  from a year ago  undercutting production increases  Costs of job cuts and retiring debt also will pressure profit at some companies  analysts said ahead of reports   I think we are moving from a growth to a value phase   said Brad Holly  chief executive at Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL  at a Denver oil conference earlier this month  
Whiting   Devon Energy   NYSE DVN  and  PDC Energy   NASDAQ PDCE  each pared staff in recent months as prices swooned  Cutbacks have spread across the sector  with Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Patterson UTI Energy  NASDAQ PTEN  idling equipment  Investors will be watching for shale productivity updates  Last quarter  Concho Resources   NYSE CXO  stock plunged 22  in a day after cutting its production outlook  blaming well designs that hurt output  According to Reuters 
It takes money to make money and the shale industry is finding out it is more difficult to find  Reuters says   The largest banking lenders to the oil and gas sector are becoming more cautious  marking down their expectations for oil and gas prices that underpin loans in a move expected to put further financial stress on struggling producers  industry and banking sources said  Major banks including JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  and Royal Bank of Canada  NYSE RY  have  as part of regular biannual reviews  cut their estimated values for oil and gas companies  reserves  which serve as the basis for those companies to receive reserve based loans  RBLs   according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the activity  
Weak data in China overnight is cooling oil prices yet future draws of crude supply will be substantial  This week we should see crude supply fall by about 4 5 million barrels  Once again U S  oil exports will surge and imports will drop  Heavy oil is in tight supply and despite worries about showing growth  the oil market keeps getting tighter and tighter  Our take is to buy breaks  Supplies of distillates are so tight and the IMO regulations are going to cause a squeeze  Gasoline supply is also tight as demand is very strong  Get hedged 
Natural gas is popping as winter is coming early  Yet the drive to get a piece of the global LNG market continues  According to  THE MARITIME EXECUTIVE  a Dubai based floating LNG company Lloyds  LON LLOY  Energy has announced plans to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska s North Slope using an offshore liquefaction terminal and icebreaking LNG carriers  The proposal would eliminate the need for a  40 billion pipeline to carry gas 800 miles overland to a liquefaction plant at Cook Inlet   a persistent cost and permitting obstacle for North Slope gas development  They say the  5 billion project is still in the planning phase but its outline is quickly taking shape 
LNG has secured a conceptual agreement with  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  for the supply of natural gas from the eight trillion cubic foot Point Thompson field for a period of 20 years  The gas is currently a stranded asset  ExxonMobil brought Point Thomson online in 2016 with production facilities designed to produce and then reinject 200 million cubic feet per day of gas  as there are no existing options for transporting it to market  The condensate is extracted and exported via the Trans Alaska Pipeline  but the gas goes back into the reservoir  The existing facility represents a  4 billion investment ",2019-10-28,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-10282019-200479201,200479201
35864,257379,SLB,Oil   Gas Stocks  Q3 Earnings Due On Oct 30  BKR  CLR   More,opinion,The third quarter earnings season has been lackluster so far for oil and gas stocks  primarily due to softness in commodity prices  Intensifying trade tensions between the United States and China  which resulted in slowdown of the global economy  significantly hurt energy demand  With several energy companies expected to report quarterly results in mid week  let s delve into the factors that played major roles in driving their earnings and impacted the firms Factors That Affected Third Quarter Results So FarWTI crude price in third quarter 2019 was lower than the year ago period  In July  August and September  WTI averaged  57 35   54 81 and  56 95 per barrel  respectively  per the   In comparison  WTI had averaged  70 98   68 06 and  70 23 per barrel  respectively  in the comparable three months of 2018  Markedly  natural gas prices also followed a similar pathway  with lower year over year figures Low domestic GDP growth rate and global economic slowdown resulted in weak demand for energy products in third quarter 2019  Moreover  takeaway capacity constraints in domestic shale plays  primarily in the prolific Permian Basin  put pressure on third quarter production Impact on CompaniesThe year over year decline in oil and gas prices is primarily discouraging for exploration and production companies  as it reduced their profit levels  Energy infrastructure providers   which usually have long term contracts with upstream companies   are expected to have been unaffected by short term fluctuations in commodity prices in the third quarter  However  given surging hydrocarbon output potential  powered by North American shale boom  and the lack of transportation facilities  pipeline companies have been missing out on a bunch of stable fee based revenue providing contract signing opportunities Refineries and downstream companies have been reaping short term benefits from lower commodity prices  as it led to low cost of production  However  fall in demand for energy products might have affected their sales and profit levels in the third quarter Expectations   Present Earnings ScenarioOur latest  shows that the Oil Energy sector s profit is expected to fall 34 8  year over year in third quarter 2019  following a 36 2  and 22 4  decline in the second and first quarters  respectively  The Energy sector is thus poised to see three consecutive quarters of earnings deterioration  after recording strong earnings growth in each of the four quarters of 2018  Third quarter revenues of the sector are expected to fall 4 8  from the year ago level Earnings of the majority of the energy companies that have already reported third quarter results show a year over year decline  However  several energy majors like Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB    BP plc   NYSE BP   and others have exceeded expectations Oilfield service behemoth Schlumberger reported third quarter 2019 earnings of 43 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents  aided by higher wireline activities in Russia and Australia  along with contributions from drilling operations in the international market Integrated energy behemoth  BP reported third quarter adjusted earnings of 66 cents per American Depositary Share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents  Its results were aided by higher oil equivalent production volumes Energy Stocks Reporting on Oct 30Given the bleak year over year backdrop  let us take a look at how the following five energy players are placed ahead of their third quarter earnings  slated to release tomorrow Baker Hughes Company   NYSE BKR    It is set to report quarterly results before the opening bell  Since oilfield service firms assist explorers and drillers in setting up oil and gas wells  the ramp up in international drilling operations is likely to have contributed to the firm s third quarter earnings  However  conservative capital spending by North American drillers is expected to have dented demand for oilfield service contracts in the continent   Read more   The oilfield service firm delivered an average

production company is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell  Rising stock inventories  intensifying trade tensions and slowdown of global economy are expected to have weighed on oil

The world s second largest economy expanded at its weakest pace in almost 30 years in the third quarter amid a bitter trade war with the United States  which has roiled financial markets and fueled fears of a global recession 
NDX closes above the Diamond Trendline 





NDX made a marginal new high above the September peak  then tested the Diamond trendline at 7830 00  closing above it  This action does not nullify the Diamond formation Its target agrees with  Point 6  of the massive Orthodox Broadening Top formation  We seldom have multiple confirmations of the general market direction  but in this case it should put us on high alert for a decline beneath the lower Diamond trendline at 7730 00 for a confirmed sell signal

 CIO  Looking for impending trouble in the economy  There s a new worry  Junk bonds  which suffer the most in a recession  are looking at a surge in credit rating downgrades vs  upgrades 

According to Moody s Analytics  the ratio of high yield downgrades to upgrades has doubled to 2 38 1 for January September 2019  from 1 09 1 for calendar 2018  A revenue fall is to blame 

 A pronounced slowing by business sales  both with and excluding energy products  helps to the explain the marked excess of high yield downgrades over upgrades after omitting primarily event driven rating changes   wrote John Lonski  the organization s chief economist 
Treasuries on a sell signal 





The 10 year Treasury Note declined to a potential Master Cycle low on Tuesday  There is room for a short term rally in the Cycles Model in the next week  but investors may wish to sell the bounce  It appears that the UST Cycle is lining up with the equities Cycle and this rally may be a trap for unwary investors The Cycles Model suggests the decline may resume through the end of the year 

 ZeroHedge  In the past month  a feud has erupted in the financial media and across capital markets between defenders of the Fed  who praise the return of its unprecedented easing in the form of  60BN in monthly T Bill purchases  by refusing to call it by its real name  and instead the Fed s fan club calls it  not QE   just so it doesn t appear that ten years after the Fed first launched QE  we are back to square one   and those who happen to be intellectually honest  and call the largest permanent expansion in the Fed s balance sheet  meant to ease financial conditions and boost liquidity across the financial sector  for what it is  QE 

It is this same  not QE  that has boosted the Fed s balance sheet by  200BN in one month  the fastest rate of increase since the financial crisis 
The Euro challenges Intermediate term resistance 





The Euro continued its rally  challenging Intermediate term resistance at 111 20 The sell signal may be suspended  pending the coming week activities  Returning beneath Intermediate term resistance reinstates the sell signal The Cycles Model suggests a period of weakness stretching through the end of October 

 Bloomberg  The euro s rally may have further to run with the shared currency likely to find support from a range of factors after uncertainty over Brexit clears 

The common currency touched its strongest level in seven weeks on Thursday after the U K  and the European Union reached a deal on Brexit  While British lawmakers could reject the pact on Saturday  the possibility of increased government spending in Europe and further U S  interest rate cuts may help keep wind in the euro s sails 
EuroStoxx reaches a new retracement high 





Note  StockCharts com is not displaying the Euro Stoxx 50 Index at this time 

The EuroStoxx50 SPDR rallied to a new retracement high on Thursday But don t be mistaken  This is not bullish  The Cycles Model suggests a probable decline through the end of October 

 CNBC  European stocks closed lower Friday afternoon as traders await signals as to whether a Brexit deal agreed between the U K  and EU will pass muster with British lawmakers in parliament 
The pan European Stoxx 600 ended provisionally lower by 1 15   with autos trading down 1 45   on the back of a profit warning from   while basic resources added 0 33  

U K  Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed a new Brexit deal which was unanimously backed by European Union leaders on Thursday  but must now fight to secure approval from British MPs  Members of Parliament  in a vote on Saturday if he is to succeed in taking Britain out of the bloc on October 31 
The Yen bounces from a Master Cycle low 





The Yen bounced from Long term support on Tuesday  It has been a longer than usual shakeout  but may now support a resumption of the rally through late November 
 writes   There is a  1 5tn reason for the yen not moving higher 
Nikkei slammed beneath mid Cycle support 





The Nikkei Index broke above a 9 month sideways consolidation  but may have hit a Master Cycle high in the process A reversal from here may produce a sell signal beneath mid Cycle support at 21779 03  The subsequent decline may last through early December according to the Cycles Model 

 InvestingCube  Asian indices ended mixed today as investors closely follow the developments around the Brexit agreement  Confusing headlines over trade deal between China and the USA weigh on investors sentiment  The Hang Seng index finished 0 55  lower at 26 706  the Shanghai Composite ended 1 32  lower at 2 938  while the Singapore Straits Times is 0 37  lower at 3 11  Aussie stocks also finished lower  the ASX 200 ended 0 52  lower at 6 649 

Nikkei 225 finished 0 18  higher at 22 492 as the index consolidates around yearly highs after encouraging earnings from USA  Data from China disappointed investors as Gross Domestic Product  YoY  below came in at 6  below expectations of 6 1  in 3Q  for the quarter China Gross Domestic Product came in at 1 5  in line with forecasts 
U S  Dollar falls short of a new high 





USD declined to close beneath Long term support at 97 05  We may see the USD continue its decline through the end of October  Something is amiss  but no one is telling 

 ZeroHedge  Just hours after the Fed announce that it accepted  56 65BN in collateral in its latest overnight repo operation   47 95BN in TSYs   8 2BN in MBS   which was a modest decline from Thursday s operation  which as we noted at the time was on the verge of being oversubscribed   
    the Fed announced the results of its second  NOT A QE  Treasury Bill POMO  which showed that Dealers submitted  36BN in bids for the maximum  7 5BN in purchases 

As such  the operation was 4 8x oversubscribed  a notable increase from the first POMO conducted on Wednesday when Dealers indicated they wanted to purchase  32 6BN in Treasuries  or  only  4 3x oversubscribed 
Gold bounces at Cycle Top support again 





Gold appears to be creeping up Cycle Top support at 1481 33  which is construed by many to be bullish  Gold is currently on a sell signal beneath Short term resistance at 1511 02  However  a rally above Short term resistance may propel gold toward 1600 00 over the next 2 3 weeks 

 FXEmpire  Gold has been consolidating for about 6 week after peaking in September  The COT report remains near term bearish with commercial shorts just off record levels   it will take time to work down those positions  The next buying opportunity in gold may not arrive until November  I have a minimum target of  1410    1420 and see the potential for a back test of the June  1380 breakout area

Crude consolidates above the trendline 





West Texas Crude continued its consolidation above the Broadening Wedge trendline  It may have a very short period of strength to complete the consolidation  The Cycles Model suggests that the decline may resume through the end of November 

 OilPrice  The world s largest oilfield services provider  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   reported on Friday a net loss of US 11 38 billion for the third quarter  compared to a US 644 million profit for Q3 2018  after a hefty pretax charge of US 12 7 billion weighed on the most recently reported results 

The pretax charge  driven by market conditions  is almost entirely non cash and primarily relates to goodwill  intangible assets  and fixed assets  said Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   which also flagged continued slowdown in North America s drilling growth 
The slowdown resulted in an 11 percent yearly decline in North American revenue for Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   North American revenue dropped to US 2 85 billion in the third quarter of 2019 from US 3 189 billion in the same period of 2018 
Agriculture Prices break out of the consolidation 





Note  The Bloomberg Agricultural Sub index has gone dark  We will be using DBA as a proxy for agricultural prices  DBA consolidated this week after nearly a 9  rally since early September  The Cycles Model suggests a continued rally through late November  possibly longer  The rally is still early in its formation 

 ZeroHedge  An unprecedented October blizzard that hit just before harvest time has absolutely devastated farms all across the U S  heartland  

As you will see below  one state lawmaker in North Dakota is saying that the crop losses will be  as devastating as we ve ever seen   This is the exact scenario that I have been warning about for months  and now it has materialized   Due to endless rain and horrific flooding early in the year  many farmers in the middle of the country faced very serious delays in getting their crops planted   So we really needed good weather at the end of the season so that the crops could mature and be harvested in time  and that did not happen   Instead  the historic blizzard that we just witnessed dumped up to 2 feet of snow from Colorado to Minnesota   In fact  one city in North Dakota actually got 30 inches of snow  In the end  this is going to go down as one of the worst crop disasters that the Midwest has ever seen  and ultimately this crisis is going to affect all of us 
Shanghai Index repulsed at mid Cycle resistance 





The Shanghai Index tested mid Cycle resistance at 3006 69 on Monday  then declined to Intermediate term support at 2936 62  closing above it for the week There is a potential sell signal beneath that level  The Cycles Model suggests potential 7 weeks of decline

 ZeroHedge  China ramped up Soybean purchases from Brazil last week  despite President Trump showboating a potential  50 billion agriculture deal with Beijing 

Multiple traders told Reuters that Brazilian soybeans are more appealing to commercial importers  especially ones from China  who are looking for deep discounts  

As of last week  Beijing hasn t lifted 25  tariffs on US soybeans nor granted new waivers to state owned businesses  indicating that China isn t ready to buy US agriculture products  as of late October  

China typically sources most of its soybeans from the US between October and January  then from South American countries in early 1Q  But this year  according to traders  as the trade war continues to escalate to the point of return  China is abandoning US markets despite positive sentiment from President Trump s tweets 
The Banking Index rises to the upper Diamond trendline 





BKX is testing the upper Diamond formation trendline again  The Cycles Model suggests the peak was on Wednesday If so  the decline from here may be profound 

 Bloomberg  China s base rate for new corporate loans stayed unchanged in October  defying expectations of a reduction as the economy sees its slowest pace of growth since the early 1990s 

The one year loan prime rate was kept at 4 2   according to a statement from the central bank on Monday  That compares to the 4 15  median estimate compiled by Bloomberg  The five year tenor was also kept unchanged at 4 85  

 ZeroHedge   With the IMF s annual meeting now concluded  few topics discussed during the past week which saw the IMF downgrade its outlook for the global economy to the lowest GDP since the global financial crisis   

    evinced as powerful a response as negative interest rates  and for good reason  long seen as the last  red line  of central banks before they are forced to admit defeat  some  15 trillion in debt now trades with a negative yield  making a farce of conventional finance which operates on the simple premise of  time value of money   which has been flipped on its head  as negative rates mean that the value of money is now negative 

Meanwhile  with the ECB recently cutting rates further into negative territory  and the BOJ likewise set for even more negative rates  a rare public debate among establishment economists has erupted as a growing number of policymakers question the value of its deep foray into unconventional monetary policy  Just one month ago  Dutch Central Bank chief  a frequent critic of the bank s ultra easy monetary policy  unloaded on ECB outgoing president Mario Draghi   This broad package of measures  in particular restarting the asset purchase program  is disproportionate to the present economic conditions  and there are sound reasons to doubt its effectiveness  There are increasing signs of scarcity of low risk assets  distorted pricing in financial markets and excessive risk seeking behaviour in the housing markets  ",2019-10-31,Anthony M.

35866,257381,SLB,Top Analyst Reports For Verizon  McDonald s   TOTAL,opinion,"Tuesday  November 5  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ   McDonald s  MCD  and TOTAL  TOT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry year to date  19 1  vs  6 5    The Zacks analyst believes that Verizon has embarked on a new operating structure with Verizon 2 0 that aims to align the business model with evolving customer needs 
Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising will likely drive future growth  Verizon aims to cut costs through employee reduction and divestments as it ramps up investment in its next generation 5G network  which is expected to be the next growth driver  The company has also upped the ante against rivals by launching 5G Ultra Wideband network in select locations of the country 
However  it continues to struggle in a competitive U S  wireless market  The company s wireline division is struggling with losses in access lines due to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers  which contracts margins 
 You can  
Shares of McDonald s have lost 5 1  in the past six months against the Zacks Restaurants industry s decline of 2 1   The Zacks analyst believes that the company s increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of EOTF restaurants in the United States is an added positive  These apart  efforts to drive growth in international markets are encouraging 
In second quarter 2019  the company posted mixed results  wherein earnings missed the estimate but revenues beat the same  Notably  its various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comps bode well  Furthermore  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 16 quarters 
However  high labor costs and currency headwinds woes linger  Additionally  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  
 You can  
TOTAL s shares have gained 10 4  over the past three months against the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry s rise of 3 1   The Zacks analyst believes that Ongoing fluctuation in the commodity prices is hurting the company despite growth in production volumes 
TOTAL s operations in some politically troubled regions and increasing competition might impact the company s profitability  Due to its global presence  it is exposed to risks associated with pursuing business abroad  However  TOTAL continues to benefit from strong contribution from new startups and expanding upstream portfolio that has above industry average exposure to the faster growing hydrocarbon producing regions of the world 
Cost reduction initiatives will boost the margins of the company  Strategic acquisitions and divestment of assets that are not in sync with its long term objectives are going to boost performance of the company

35867,257382,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  EOG   Occidental Report Q3 Earnings,opinion,It was a week where oil prices hit their highest since Sep 24 and natural gas futures tallied a small gain On the news front  upstream energy biggies EOG Resources   NYSE EOG   and Occidental Petroleum   NYSE OXY   reported third quarter earnings  While the commodity pricing scenario continues to be challenging  both companies benefited from higher year over year production     Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures rose 1 9  to close at  57 24 per barrel  while natural gas prices moved up 2 8  for the week to finish at 2 789 per million Btu  MMBtu  The U S  crude benchmark finished at a six week high on Friday  primarily driven by data showing drillers in the United States removing oil rigs  thus pointing to signs of declining domestic supplies  Positive murmurings about the U S  China trade negotiations brought further upside Meanwhile  natural gas prices finished higher after the weekly inventory release showed a smaller than expected increase in supplies  Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1   Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  1 13  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 14 owing to lower average price realization for crude oil and natural gas  This was partly offset by production gains  The bottom line also compared unfavorably with the year ago quarter profit of  1 75 per share In the quarter  EOG Resources  total volume rose 11  year over year to 76 7 million barrels of oil equivalent MMBoe  73  liquids   Average realized crude oil and condensate price fell 19  year over year to  56 66 per barrel  Quarterly NGL prices declined 58  to  12 67 per barrel from  30 09 in the year ago quarter  Moreover  natural gas was sold at  2 13 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf   representing a year over year decline of 22  For 2019  the company expects crude oil equivalent volume of 810 1 819 2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOE D   For the fourth quarter of 2019  it anticipates crude oil equivalent volume of 818 9 854 9 MBOE D  Notably  the

reported third quarter 2019 earnings of 11 cents per share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents by 73 2   The company s underperformance resulted from lower average realized prices  partially offset by production gains on account of the Anadarko acquisition Occidental Petroleum s average daily net oil  liquids and gas production volume average daily net oil  liquids and gas production volume expanded to 1 155 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   which included the acquired Anadarko assets  The metric was 681 000 BOE d in the prior year quarterThis improvement in production volume was backed by higher drilling activity and solid output from the Permian Resources region  Permian Resources production improved 33  year over year As of Sep 30  2019  the company had a long term debt  net of current portion  of  39 946 million compared with  10 201 million on Dec 31  2018  The increase in the debt level was due to the loan taken by the company to fund the acquisition of Anadarko  Occidental expects fourth quarter 2019 production in the range of 1 312 000 1 336 000 BOE d  Production from Permian Resources is expected in the range of 449 000 459 000 BOE d   Read more  3   Diamondback Energy  Inc    NASDAQ FANG   reported disappointing third quarter 2019 results  Weaker than expected natural gas price realizations caused this underperformance  Precisely  natural gas prices came in at 62 cents per thousand cubic feet  Mcf   missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 and the year ago figure of  1 86 as well  Moreover  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s adjusted net income per share of  1 47 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 71 and also decreased 12  from the year ago figure of  1 67 You can see  The 2018 buyouts of Energen Corporation and Ajax Resources helped Diamondback transform into one of the leading Permian Basin oil producers  Production of oil and natural gas averaged 287 1 MBOE d comprising 65  oil  The figure skyrocketed 133  from the year ago quarter The company now expects 2019 output in the range of 281 282 MBOE d compared with the prior guidance of 277 284 MBOE d  Further  full year capex is revised to  2 72  2 95 billion from the prior expectation of  2 85  2 90 billion  Diamondback projects 2020 average daily production of 310 0 325 0 MBOE d  Its average daily oil production is estimated between 205 0 and 215 0 MBO d with expected capital spend of  2 8  3 0 billion   Read more  4   Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO   reported stellar third quarter 2019 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Better than expected net sales volumes led to this outperformance  Precisely  the same totaled 427 MBOE d  topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 394 MBOE d  Consequently  the company s adjusted income from continuing operations came in at 14 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents Total costs in the quarter were  1 108 million  below  1 244 million in the prior year period  Marathon Oil s capital expenditure summed  646 million  Additionally  the company generated organic free cash flow  FCF  of

5    Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   reported third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents by 36 8   Robust oil and gas production led to the outperformance  partly offset by lower contribution from marketing businesses and a decline in realized prices of hydrocarbons Total production  including divested U S  assets  in third quarter 2019 touched 428 000 BOE d  a tad higher than the year ago figure  Excluding production from divested assets  third quarter total output was 325 000 BOE d  Strong output from its Delaware assets boosted overall production  Third quarter oil production was 148 000 Boe d  which is above the guided range of 141 000 147 000 Boe d and 19  higher than the year ago level  Meanwhile  total realized prices   including cash settlements   were  27 73 per BOE in the reported quarter  down 6 1  year over year Devon estimates total oil production from retained assets for the fourth quarter of 2019 within 154 000 160 000 barrels per day  Total production in the quarter is expected in the range of 420 000 448 000 BOE d  It expects year over year growth in 2019 U S  oil production in the range of 20 21   indicating a 550 basis point improvement from original expectation  Devon has lowered its view for 2019 G A expenses to the range of  460  470 million and financing costs to

35887,257402,SLB,In oil rich region  Venezuelans fear catastrophe if Trump forces Chevron to leave,news,"By Luc Cohen and Mariela Nava LA CA ADA DE URDANETA  Venezuela  Reuters    With the  2 he earns in wages each week working as a cargo driver for Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA  56 year old Freddy Brito cannot even afford to buy one kilogram  2 2 lb  of cheese  To feed himself and his wife as the once prosperous OPEC nation suffers a hyperinflationary economic collapse  Brito depends on a monthly basket of rice  canned tuna  beans and other products valued at  200 given to him by California based  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   PDVSA s minority partner at the Petroboscan field in western Zulia state where he works  But Chevron s future in Venezuela now depends on U S  President Donald Trump  who must decide  by Oct  25 whether or not to renew a waiver allowing Chevron to keep operating in Venezuela despite U S  sanctions on PDVSA  part of Washington s campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro  The benefits enjoyed by Brito and some 1 200 other Petroboscan employees and contractors are not available for most of cash strapped PDVSA s 100 000 odd workers  who have seen their wages eroded due to inflation  prompting thousands to resign  and join the 4 million Venezuelans who have emigrated   If Chevron leaves  we would be left without a helping hand  because what little we have comes from them   Brito said  Chevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years  it opened its Caracas office in 1923  and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946  making it among the private companies with the longest presence in the country  But in January  the U S  Treasury Department slapped sanctions on PDVSA as part of Washington s effort to cut off cash flow to Maduro  Chevron was only able to remain in Venezuela thanks to a six month exemption granted to it and major oilfield service companies like  Halliburton Co   N HAL  and Schlumberger NV  N SLB   The companies are keen to retain a presence in Venezuela  which has the world s largest crude reserves  The campaign to oust Maduro has since stalled  despite Venezuela s deteriorating economy and accusations of human rights violations  After internal debate  within the administration  Trump in late July renewed the waiver for three months   Some in the administration  like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  argued that  were Chevron to leave  Maduro might deliver its assets to Russian or Chinese companies  depriving a potential new government of a chance to rebuild the economy in partnership with the U S  firm  But others  such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton  argued that forcing Chevron out could prompt a further decline in crude output  adding to the economic pressure on Maduro  With the new deadline looming  residents of La Ca ada de Urdaneta  where Petroboscan s operations are located  fear the company s exit would add further misery to a drastic deterioration in their quality of life during the last seven years of recession    Chevron has supported everything   said Yennifer Gonzalez  a parent of three students at the San Agustin school in La Ca ada  where the company funds meals for students and staff  and is also paying for a construction project   If Chevron leaves  here in the field things will not be the same  By law  PDVSA s joint ventures are required to invest 1  of their profits in social programs in the areas where they extract crude  In La Ca ada  Chevron s logo adorns schoolyard basketball hoops it donated and police stations it helped build   Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said in a statement the company s social investment contributions totaled nearly  100 million between 2007 2018  and that the firm was a  positive presence  in the country  Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela s oil ministry responded to requests for comment  Maduro blames an  economic war  led by the United States for the country s problems  HALTED PUMPJACKS Venezuela s crude output steadily declined from well over 2 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of last year  the result of a drop in prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement  Blackouts and U S  sanctions have accelerated that collapse this year  the country now produces just 600 000 bpd  Petroboscan and Petropiar  Chevron

35889,257404,SLB,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com    An anti climactic weekend for Brexit  more happy talk on the U S  China trade dispute and some decidedly less happy talk from regulators with regard to Boeing s 737 MAX and Facebook s Libra project  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday  21st October 
1  U S   China talk up chances of temporary trade deal
U S  and Chinese officials continued to make encouraging noises about the prospect of sealing an interim trade truce by mid November to take the edge off the two countries  wide ranging dispute 
President Trump expressed confidence that the so called  phase 1  agreement that would stop the introduction of further tariffs and commit China to buying some  50 billion a year in U S  agricultural produce would be ready for signing when he and his counterpart Xi Jinping meet at the G20 leaders  summit next month 
Separately  China s top trade negotiator Liu He  in a rare public speech  said that  substantial progress  had been made and added that  stopping the escalation of the trade war benefits China  the U S and the whole world  It s what producers and consumers alike are hoping for    
2  Johnson requests Brexit deadline extension
Those waiting for a resolution to the Brexit drama will have to wait a few more days  The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson pulled out of a meaningful vote on the deal he brought back from Brussels when the House of Commons sat on Saturday  apparently out of concern that opposition lawmakers would tie unpalatable demands to it in the form of amendments 
Johnson  who doesn t have a majority in the House of Commons  was forced to request an extension of the Oct  31 Brexit deadline from the EU  which appears more likely than not to be granted  he didn t sign the letter himself and wrote a side letter distancing himself from the official one   That effectively nixes the chance of a disorderly No Deal scenario on Nov  1  While it leaves the longer term questions about the Brexit outcome unanswered  it s enough to support the British pound and cause money to flow out of U K  government bonds this morning 
3  Stocks set to open higher
U S  stock markets are set to open slightly higher under the influence of the two factors above  albeit still within their recent ranges and with no obvious domestic catalyst due on Monday 
By 6 AM ET  1000 GMT   Dow futures were up 37 points or 0 1   bouncing only slightly after the losses on Friday that were caused largely by Boeing  NYSE BA   see below   S P 500 Futures were up 6 points or 0 2  and Nasdaq 100 futures were up a slightly more impressive 0 3  
On the earnings front  Halliburton will be in focus after the massive writedown announced on Friday by rival oilfield services giant Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Also of interest may be TD Ameritrade  which will update on its outlook in the middle of an increasingly intense price war with other brokerage firms 
4  FAA demands answers on 737 MAX messages
The Federal Aviation Agency demanded an  immediate  explanation from Boeing  NYSE BA  over an exchange of messages by test pilots back in 2016 showing concerns about the flight control software that has been blamed for two fatal crashes since 
 We understand entirely the scrutiny this matter is receiving  and are committed to working with investigative authorities and the U S  Congress as they continue their investigations   Boeing  NYSE BA  said in a statement after a board meeting on Sunday 
Boeing  NYSE BA  shares had fallen over 6 5  on Friday as the exchange  in which a senior test pilot complained of  egregious  action by the so called MCAS software  became public  The incident adds to suspicions that production pressures led Boeing to compromise its safety culture   suspicions that led Boeing to strip CEO Dennis Muilenburg of his responsibilities as chairman last week 
5  Time to recaLIBRAte  
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  appeared to retreat from its vision of launching a global digital currency after a highly sceptical report from global regulators 
David Marcus  the executive who is coordinating Facebook s Libra initiative with 20 other partners  told a forum at the weekend that the company was open to creating a string of nationally backed  stablecoins  rather than the single payments system backed by a basket of existing currencies 
Seven of the original 28 companies backing the Libra project pulled out earlier this month after pressure from regulators in the U S  and Europe  A report by the G7 published on Friday warned that the project as designed represented potential threats to the international monetary system  as well as raising important antitrust and data privacy concerns ",2019-10-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-2000131,2000131
35890,257405,SLB,Oil Prices Tumble Again on Oversupply Fears,news,"Investing com    Crude oil prices tumbled again on Monday amid ongoing fears of looming oversupply in a world economy that is slowing sharply 
By 10 12 AM ET  1412 GMT   U S  West Texas Intermediate futures were quoted down 84 cents  or 1 6   at  53 03 a barrel  while the international benchmark Brent was down 1 8  at  58 33 a barrel 
Prices have now fallen by around  1 50 a barrel since their highs on Friday  hit as global markets priced in a smooth Brexit 
However  the British government is still unable to get its EU withdrawal agreement through the U K  parliament  keeping a big question mark over demand from the U K  and Europe  while other signs from around the world suggest that the supply side of the equation is also looking bearish 
Russia  the world s second largest oil producer  said on Sunday it breached its output ceiling under the so called OPEC  agreement in September due to an increase in natural gas condensate output as the country prepared for winter 
Additionally   OPEC members Kuwait and Saudi Arabia said they were making good progress in talks to resume oil production from joint fields in the Neutral Zone between the two countries after a three year hiatus  The fields have a capacity of 500 000 barrels per day 
While that s unlikely to hit the world market directly because both countries are still committed to the OPEC  deal  it would raise the amount of spare capacity available to OPEC 
One modest hope of support for prices has come in the quarterly reports of the oilfield services companies  where both Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and rival Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  reported sharp drops in U S  drilling in the three months to September  Halliburton said North American revenues were down 11  on the year  while Schlumberger on Friday took a  1 6 billion charge against its U S  pumping business 
 These results from Halliburton bring into crystal clear focus the speed with which North America  NAM  land well construction and completion activity eroded during course of Q3   Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co analysts wrote in a note

35891,257406,SLB,Halliburton vows more cost cuts as shale demand dwindles  shares rise,news,"By Shariq Khan and Liz Hampton
 Reuters    Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co on Monday promised more cost cuts after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue as the oilfield services looks to counter weak demand from North American shale producers  sending its shares up about 7  
The biggest hydraulic fracking services provider  which earlier this month cut 650 jobs in North America  said it would take steps over the next few quarters that will lead to  300 million in annualized cost savings 
Oilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment 
Larger rival Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  said on Friday it had recorded a  1 58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America 
 HAL is taking costs out more aggressively than the Street forecast  which it expects to lead to strong Q4 operating margin improvement in the Drilling   Evaluation segments despite falling revenue   said Anish Kapadia  founder of London based oil and gas consultancy firm AKap Energy 
Halliburton warned of further activity declines in North America  with fourth quarter revenue for its hydraulic fracturing business declining by low double digits and margins by 125 basis points to 175 basis points 
 Feedback from our customers lead us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than the fourth quarter of last year   Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller told analysts during a post earnings call 
Halliburton said its revenue from North America  which accounts for more than half of the company s total  fell 21  in the third quarter  Revenue from completion and production fell 16  in the three months ended Sept  30 
The company also idled more equipment in the third quarter than the first six months of the year  Miller said 
Evercore ISI analyst James West said Halliburton was  showing leadership by walking away from unprofitable or low return work  
Net profit attributable to Halliburton fell to  295 million  or 34 cents per share  in the three months ended Sept  30  from  435 million  or 50 cents per share  a year earlier 
Analysts had on average estimated 34 cents per share  according to Refinitiv IBES data 
Revenue fell to  5 55 billion  below analysts  average estimate of  5 80 billion

35892,257407,SLB,Chevron Wins Venezuela Waiver Extension As Sanctions Bite,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration extended  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   s waiver to operate in Venezuela  allowing the second largest U S  oil explorer to keep its toehold in the crisis stricken Latin American nation as U S  sanctions severely restrict crude exports 
The 90 day reprieve lets Chevron continue its role as the last major U S  oil producer in the country until Jan  22  The Treasury Department on Monday also extended waivers for four U S  oil services providers  Baker Hughes Co   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  Ltd  and Weatherford International Ltd 
The extension is the first granted since Trump fired former National Security Advisor John Bolton  who was seen as a vocal opponent of granting exceptions for U S  companies doing business in Venezuela  Perhaps tellingly  Monday s waiver was granted four days ahead of expiration  compared with a gap of just hours last time around 
Chevron s joint ventures in the country are with Petroleos de Venezuela SA  the national oil company and the lifeblood of President Nicolas Maduro s regime  There s a desire within parts of the U S  government to maintain some level of American presence in Venezuela s oil industry in the event of a political transition  The U S  and dozens of other countries recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the nation s rightful leader 
 It looks like they ve convinced the Trump administration that this is something that needs to be done every 90 days   said Muhammed Ghulam  a Houston based analyst at Raymond James   Associates   I don t see much lobbying now on the other side of the issue  
While Venezuela only accounted for 1  of Chevron s global crude production last year  it remains strategically important as home to the world s largest oil reserves  In recent months  Chevron made the case to the Trump administration that if it were to leave  its Venezuelan assets could easily be turned over to another operator with little effect on overall production  That could mean the state  or even Russian or Chinese interests  would benefit 
Hardliners  Pragmatists
 This seems again like a compromise between hardliners who wanted maximum pressure and pragmatists who believed that not renewing the license would not lead to regime change and just open spaces for the Russians to fill   said Francisco Monaldi  a lecturer in energy economics at Rice University s Baker Institute for Public Policy   It seems pragmatism is prevailing  
Venezuela s crude exports have been crippled by U S  sanctions  falling to a 70 year low of 495 000 barrels a day in September  according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg  The policy s apparent success is another reason why removing Chevron wouldn t have much effect on the Maduro regime  according to Monaldi 
 Sanctions have been so effective in reducing sales that producing more is not necessarily going to help  Maduro  he said 
Chevron s near century of operations in Venezuela included the crucial discovery of the Boscan field in the 1940s  The California based driller has outlasted many other oil companies  including  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM    which left after a series of industry nationalizations during Hugo Chavez s time as president 
Keeping a Toehold
As it stands now  the U S  oil service companies have no desire to broaden beyond the tiny presence they re maintaining in Venezuela  J  David Anderson  an analyst at  Barclays   LON BARC   wrote in an email  But the extension of the U S  waiver allowing them to remain is ultimately helpful 
 It s important to keep a toehold in the country in the event of a change of government down the road   Anderson wrote   If the government does change  it will be a massive opportunity for major oil companies and they will need all the help they can get  for service providers 
Venezuela s oil output has fallen from a high of 3 7 million barrels a day in 1970 to less than 700 000 today  according to data compiled by Bloomberg

35893,257408,SLB,Investors brace for poor U S  shale earnings amid weak oil and gas prices,news,"By Liz Hampton
 Reuters    Investors are bracing for weaker results from U S  shale players in coming days as lower oil and natural gas prices and cost cutting measures have weighed on third quarter operations 
Major shale producers ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Concho Resources  N CXO  this week kick off quarterly earnings reports for a group whipsawed this year by volatile pricing and investor demands for improved returns  Oil and gas producers have cut drilling and slashed jobs amid worries over pricing outlooks 
U S  oil prices are down 17  and natural gas is down about 31  from a year ago  undercutting production increases  Costs of job cuts and retiring debt also will pressure profit at some companies  analysts said ahead of reports 
 I think we are moving from a growth to a value phase   said Brad Holly  chief executive at  Whiting Petroleum Corp   N WLL  at a Denver oil conference earlier this month 
Whiting   Devon Energy   N DVN   and  PDC Energy   O PDCE  each pared staff in recent months as prices swooned  Cutbacks have spread across the sector  with Halliburton  N HAL   Schlumberger  N SLB   and Patterson UTI Energy  O PTEN  idling equipment 
Investors will be watching for shale productivity updates  Last quarter  Concho Resources   N CXO  stock plunged 22  in a day after cutting its production outlook  blaming well designs that hurt output 
OUTPUT GAINS  DECELERATING 
Concho is expected to report earnings of 69 cents per share for the quarter  down from  1 42 a year ago  Top U S  independent Conoco is expected to post earnings per share of 75 cents  compared with  1 36 a year ago  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
U S  oil companies have flooded the market with crude this year  capping prices at about the mid  50 a barrel range  Oil production averaged 11 8 million barrels per day  bpd  in July  the latest monthly figure  up 915 000 bpd from the same period last year  according to U S  government figures      
 We will continue to see growth  but it will be decelerated  and meaningfully decelerated from where it has been for the last three years   said Bobby Tudor  chairman of Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co  in an interview this month on the sidelines of a conference  He based the forecast on U S  oil at about  50 a barrel 
U S  oil output is projected to rise by 900 000 bpd next year to 13 2 million bpd  down from a gain of 1 3 million bpd day this year  according to a U S  Energy Information Administration forecast 
With prices in the mid 50s  top shale service provider Halliburton last week warned U S  customer activity would continue to decline this year  and outlined plans for a new round of cost cuts 
RESTRAINT CAME  TOO LATE 
Halliburton and other hydraulic fracturing providers have taken 100 U S  fracking fleets that complete oil and gas wells off the market   with a portion of that to never return   consultancy Primary Vision wrote last week 
 We expect 2020  spending  plans to be focused around maintenance capital   or spending that supports existing output  said Bernadette Johnson  vice president of market intelligence at consultancy Enverus 
Among major shale producers  EOG Resources  N EOG  is forecast to report per share earnings of  1 13  down from  1 75 a year earlier   Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  could post earnings of  1 98 per share  down 9 cents  according to Refinitiv IBES 
Continental Resources  N CLR  is projected to earn 47 cents per share  down from 90 cents a year earlier  Its shares have fallen to about  29 16 from roughly  54 15 a year ago 
 People are ignoring shale names now and they re sort of disgusted with them almost   said Rohan Murphy  an analyst with Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Investors in London  adding that their push for capital discipline came  almost a bit too late

At the same time  crude oil prices rallied as much as 3  after a weekly report showed U S  oil inventories rising by a smaller amount than expected  The effect was to boost energy shares like   Chevron    NYSE CVX  and   Exxon Mobil    NYSE XOM  and slam airline stocks    American Airlines Group    NASDAQ AAL  was the biggest percentage loser among Nasdaq 100 stocks 
The Dow suffered its second 100 point loss in two days  the first time that s happened since early October 
Interest rates moved lower on the selling  The United States 10 Year Treasury yield fell to 1 736  from 1 41  on Tuesday  Gold   however  was little changed 
The market has set record closing and intraday highs multiple times in the last week and into Monday  largely on the hopes a Phase 1 trade deal between the U S  and China was about to happen  In the process  the major indexes and key stocks like Apple probably rose too fast and became vulnerable to selling if there was any bad news

QuarterE P Capital Discipline  Clients have been taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Consequently  major upstream oil companies are now committed to investor returns rather than adding production by outspending cash flows  This has created an extremely challenging operating environment for the service providers as there is not enough incentive to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity is likely to have hurt demand for Halliburton s services and equipment in the third quarter Lower Rig Count  Moreover  during the third quarter of 2019  U S  oil rig count decreased by 75  from 788 to 713  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest weakening North American activity in the April June timeframe  Halliburton  with sizable presence in the region  is expected to reflect this impact in the to be reported results Huge Backlog of Uncompleted Wells  The crude price spike of 2014  which saw the commodity breach the  100 a barrel level  led to massive expansion in domestic drilling  However  the subsequent commodity price crash forced a number of producers to defer the  fracking  of the wells  Investors should know that fracking   which follows drilling   is used to complete the well and get the oil flowing  This led to a huge backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells  impacting demand for oilfield services  In fact  there is a backlog of around 3 700  in the Permian Basin alone As a proof of the market challenges  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter Completion and Production adjusted operating income is pegged at  451 million  lower than  613 million reported in the year ago quarter  To put things in perspective  the Completion and Production unit makes up more than three fourths of Halliburton s total operating income Recovery in International Operations  One bright spot in the otherwise gloomy earnings outlook is the recovery in overseas markets  Halliburton s international revenues increased 12  throughout the first half  a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter because of increased customer spending on drilling and completion projects across all regions outside North America   land  offshore and unconventional Highlights of Q2 EarningsIn the last reported quarter  the major oilfield service provider  the consensus mark on robust international activity In the last reported quarter  the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   reported earnings of 35 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents  The bottom line  however  decreased 39 7  on a year over year basis  primarily owing to weakness in the North American market  Revenues of  5 9 billion were 3 5  lower than the year ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a marginal 0 6  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Houston  TX based company has an excellent record  having gone past met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    What Does Our Model Say The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Halliburton

35911,257426,SLB,What Lies Ahead For Oilfield Service In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Investors will get a brief idea of how oilfield service firms might have fared in the recently completed third quarter from Schlumberger Limited s   NYSE SLB   earnings announcement  scheduled for Oct 18 Although a weak oil pricing scenario and conservative capital spending by U S  explorers might have acted as headwinds in the quarter  rising rig count in international markets may have lent support   Oilfield Service Business OverviewOilfield service players offer technologies to oil and natural gas drillers for efficient drilling and setting up of wells  Among the services offered are manufacturing and mending of equipment that are utilized for extracting crude from wells Notably  drillers are now specializing in horizontal or angled drilling since explorers and producers are not finding it profitable to employ vertical drilling techniques to many wells  Oilfield service firms help explorers drill horizontal wells more efficiently Overall  the fate of all oil service firms is positively correlated to crude prices and also to the capital investment decisions of drillers Unfavorable Q3 Oil Price Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   average prices of West Texas intermediate  WTI  crude for the first two months of the September quarter were recorded at  57 35 per barrel and  54 81 per barrel  respectively  In comparison  average prices of the commodity were recorded significantly higher at  70 98 per barrel and  68 06 per barrel  respectively  in the first two months of third quarter 2018  The last month of the September quarter also witnessed a steep decline in WTI oil price The significant year over year fall in Q3 oil price reflects that global economic slowdown and the prolonged U S  China trade war have hurt energy demand Conservative US SpendingDomestic explorers and producers started 2019 with a conservative capital budget as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  U S  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth than oil and gas production  Hence  continued conservative spending by explorers and producers is likely to have hurt demand for oil service firms in the to be reported quarter Meanwhile  the count of oil drilling rigs in the international market has considerably increased year over year in each of the three months of third quarter 2019  per data provided by Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    This reflects robust oilfield service activies in markets outside North America Permian BottleneckWe also need to consider the pipeline bottleneck problem in the Permian to forecast results for the oilfield service players in the recently completed third quarter  This is because among all U S  shale plays  Permian has been mainly contributing to the nation s oil production boom Hence  the constraint in transportation capacities in the prolific basin has slowed down drilling operations  This has also likely affected domestic oilfield service demand in the September quarter of 2019   3 Biggest Oilfield Service Giants Unlikely to Beat

35912,257427,SLB,Schlumberger Earnings Preview  More Cuts Coming To Save Its Rich Dividend ,opinion,"  Reports 3Q 2019 results on Friday  Oct  18  before the open
  Revenue Expectation   8 52 billion
  EPS Expectation   0 41
Shares of Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the world s largest oil services provider  have been in a deep slump for a long while  Ahead of the company s 3Q earnings on Friday  we take a look at what s caused it and what may lie ahead 
In the current deteriorating macro environment  the world s largest oil and gas producers have been reluctant to increase spending  thus thwarting the company s efforts to recover from the downturn it s been stuck in since the middle of 2014 
Schlumberger  which operates in more than 120 countries  supplying the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services  from exploration through production  has seen its stock plunge more than 45  in the past year  Trading at  31 95 at Wednesday s close  it s down more than 65  in the past five years 
This drastic correction has made its stock quite cheap  Its forward price to earnings multiple of 17 37 is close to the lowest in the past five years  while its 6 1  dividend yield looks attractive in this low rate environment 
These multiples may appear appealing  but with no near term growth catalyst on the horizon  investors have no incentive to get excited about the oil servicing companies 
Slowing Oil and Gas Investment
Under pressure from shareholders  exploration and production companies are keeping spending in check  returning most of their free cash flow to shareholders in the shape of dividends and share buybacks 
Schlumberger itself isn t shying away from admitting that reality  In the last conference call in July  the company told analysts that it expects oil production from North American shale basins to slow as explorers cut spending after the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions and the move away from growth 
Spending among producers in North America is likely to decline 10  this year  according to Schlumberger   and the only other avenue though which the company can increase revenue is via its international business 
Schlumberger s business outside the U S  and Canada is where the company generates most of its income  The company is forecasting single digit growth for 2019  with explorers slated to boost spending as much as 8   The earnings potential for Schlumberger internationally is about four times that of its competitors when considering its larger market share and operating margin 
But betting on its global growth is also risky  Many large oil producing nations are in pain and keeping their supplies under check because of fears of a global supply glut  We don t expect that situation to change anytime soon  and hence see no near term upside for Schulmberger stock 
In its call with analysts tomorrow  the most important thing for investors to focus on is how many more cuts in capital spending Schulmberger is willing to make to protect its  2 a share annual dividend 
Bottom Line
The stocks of oil services companies have become cheaper after a precipitous decline in the past five years  But despite their more attractive valuations  we don t think the time has come to snap up their shares  In this uncertain global economic and geopolitical environment  oil prices may not remain higher sustainably  It would be better for investors to avoid entering this trade now ",2019-10-17,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-earnings-preview-more-cuts-coming-to-save-its-rich-dividend-200474324,200474324

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest oilfield services company would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Schlumberger  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  8 54 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 67   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 50 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Schlumberger shares have lost about 11 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 6  
What s Next for Schlumberger 
While Schlumberger has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Schlumberger was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

drilling operations in the international market led to the better than expected results  The improvement was partially offset by lower activities in Argentina and softer pricing in onshore North

 Reuters    U S  oilfield supplier National Oilwell Varco Inc  N NOV  is trimming its workforce  according to people familiar with the matter  as oil and gas customers have cut spending on services and equipment 
The company recently began offering voluntary early retirement to eligible employees  three people said  Any discussion of workforce cuts would be part of its second quarter earnings call next week  said a spokesman for the Houston based company  who declined to comment further 
Although global oil prices have rebounded from the market s 2014 16 downturn  profits at the service companies that provide drilling and well completion services have not recovered to the same extent 
An index of oilfield service firms  operating margins fell to a negative 32 8 from negative 6 6 in the bank s earlier survey

35944,257459,SLB,GE s Baker Hughes beats estimates on international demand  LNG drilling,news,"By Nishara Karuvalli Pathikkal
 Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co s oilfield services arm  Baker Hughes  beat quarterly profit estimates on Wednesday  driven by higher LNG drilling and demand for its oilfield services in international markets  sending its shares up nearly 6  
Revenue in the oilfield services segment  which constitutes a majority of the company s operations  rose 14  to  3 26 billion in the second quarter  led by growth in the Middle East  North Sea and Europe 
Last week  bigger rivals Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co also posted higher quarterly revenue from regions outside North America  benefiting from an uptick in demand from international markets that helped make up for lower sales to U S  producers reluctant to spend 
On a post earnings call with analysts  Chief Financial Officer Brian Worell said the company s outlook for 2019 was unchanged as a substantial number of equipment orders being booked in its turbomachinery and process solutions  TPS  business do not start taking revenue until the second half of 2019 
Orders in the TPS business surged 34  in the second quarter on increasing activity in the market for liquefied natural gas projects 
According to projections by the International Energy Agency  with global LNG demand expected to grow about 4  a year through 2024  developers could make final investment decisions  FID  later this year to add more export capacity 
On the call  Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli brushed off concerns that issues around global economic growth and tariffs could slow FIDs over the next year 
 As you look at demand  Chinese LNG ports continue to grow  You got South Korea continuing to grow  India continue to grow   he said

35945,257460,SLB,StockBeat  BP Positions Itself for Shale Patch Bargain Hunt,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com      BP    LON BP  is bolstering its position for a bargain hunt  and the market approves 
Under a deal announced late on Tuesday   BP   LON BP  will sell its entire Alaskan business  including production assets on the North Slope and its stake in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System  to privately held Hilcorp Alaska for  5 6 billion 
The deal is big enough to take  BP   LON BP  more than halfway to its target of raising  10 billion in asset sales by the end of next year and   assuming the deal clears the standard regulatory hurdles   will significantly strengthen the company s balance sheet at a time when the outlook for the sector is more than usually clouded by the U S  China trade war and the risk of a disruptive Brexit   The company s share price has fallen by nearly 15  since April  as those twin threats to growth have become ever more material 
All other things being equal  the receipts from the sale would bolster BP s cash pile by around a quarter  That should reduce the volatility of its share price  offering some protection against any further worsening of sentiment in the market at large 
It also leaves  BP   LON BP  in an enviable position for future M A activity  which the company has suggested is likely on more than one occasion  In Tuesday s statement  CEO Bob Dudley was at pains to stress   We remain very bullish on the U S  energy sector  In just the last three years we have invested more than  20 billion in the U S  and we will continue to look at further investment opportunities here  
He may not have to wait too long  With crude prices having fallen some 20  from last year s peaks  many operators in the shale patch are once again running into financial constraints  Baker Hughes  oil rig count hit its lowest level since the start of 2018 last week  and oil services companies such as Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  have already briefed investors about the slowdown they see coming in the U S  upstream sector

35947,257462,SLB,Low cost fracking offers boon to oil producers  headaches for suppliers,news,"By Liz Hampton SMILEY  Texas  Reuters    At a dusty drilling site east of San Antonio  shale producer EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  recently completed its latest well using a new technology developed by a small services firm that promises to slash the cost of each by  200 000   The technology  called electric fracking and powered by natural gas from EOG s own wells instead of costly diesel fuel  shows how shale producers keep finding new ways to cut costs in the face of pressures to improve their returns  E frac  as the new technology is called  is being adopted by EOG  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc   Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM  and others because of its potential to lower costs  reduce air pollution and operate much quieter than conventional diesel powered frac fleets  Investment bank Tudor  Pickering Holt   Co analyst George O Leary estimates e fracs could lop off up to  350 000 from the cost of shale wells that run  6 million to  8 million apiece  While a handful of oil producers are capturing savings from lower well costs  the picture is less rosy for oilfield service providers  These systems can cost them up to twice that of conventional fleets to build  A rapid uptake could worsen the economics for a sector cutting staff and idling equipment as oil producers pare spending  That leaves this potential breakthrough technology in the hands of small service providers without the means to fully exploit it  ONE SIDED SAVINGS Jeff Miller  chief executive of Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co  the top U S  provider of fracking services  said his firm has tested the technology but has no desire to promote it   Halliburton will be really slow around frac   Miller said  referring to the costs of updating diesel systems to electric  Converting the industry s 500 frac fleets would cost  30 billion  he estimated  too steep a price for oilfield firms  he said  He recently advised an oil producer interested in the technology that the benefits of deploying e fracs  work for you  they don t work for us   he said at  Barclays   LON BARC  energy conference this month   Halliburton  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and others have idled scores of diesel powered fleets this year as producers cut spending due to flat to lower oil and gas prices  Consultancy Primary Vision estimates the number of active fleets in the U S  fell 19  since April to around 390   Halliburton cut 8  of its North American workforce and reported second quarter profit fell 85  over the year ago period in part because of equipment writedowns and severance costs due to weak demand for its frac service   Every week that goes by I get more and more negative about e frac due to the harsh imbalance between the benefits achieved by the oil company and the costs incurred by the service company   said Richard Spears  a consultant to top oilfield services suppliers  Schlumberger paid  430 million in late 2017 to acquire a diesel powered frac fleet from rival Weatherford International  hoping to expand shale services  A spokesperson declined to comment on e frac   This month newly named CEO Olivier Le Peuch disclosed plans to write down investments that were  based on a much higher activity outlook with the ambition of achieving economies of scale     HARD TO JUSTIFY  E frac supplier Evolution Well Services  which supplied the equipment and crew for EOG s Eagle Ford shale operation  is one of a handful of smaller oilfield firms pioneering the systems   Evolution operates six e frac fleets   mobile collections of high pressure pumps powered by gas turbine generators   and plans to roll out a seventh next year  U S  Well Services  another e frac provider  has agreements with  Apache Corp   NYSE APA  and Shell  Conventional pressure pumper ProPetro Holding Corp also announced plans to bring a handful of e frac fleets to the market   We d kind of would like to  build more systems without firm customer contracts  said Ben Bodishbaugh  CEO of Evolution  the only purely e frac provider in North America   But in this market it s hard to justify   he said   The reason  e frac fleets can cost up to  60 million apiece because they rely on pricey gas turbines similar to those that run utilities to generate electricity  compared with as little as  30 million for a diesel motor powered fleet  Evolution would not say how much its fleets cost  but noted it is below  60 million    It s a bad time for service companies to be ramping up very capital intensive service offerings   said Josh Young  chief investment officer with energy investor Bison Interests   People always feel pressure to invest in the next new things  but sometimes you shouldn t be investing in any of the things   Companies like Evolution and U S  Well Services that already have e frac fleets would be winners if the technology takes off  analysts from investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt   Co predict  E frac accounts for about 3  of active fleets  and could reach between 25  and 33  in the next five years  Tudor estimated   EOG began testing Evolution s gear in late 2016  and signed a multi year agreement about six months later  The shale company  well known for its use of cutting edge technology  runs four of Evolution s fleets and plans to add a fifth next year   The agreement with Evolution  is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business   said Billy Helms  EOG s chief operating officer  EOG is among the handful of top shale producers that generate more cash than they consume in drilling and shareholder dividends  NO SOOT  LESS NOISE  At its Smiley  Texas  oil and gas well site  EOG s crew carried on casual conversations despite the whir of e frac pumps  No one wears ear protection  which is common at conventional diesel fleets  and the towering white silos holding frac sand were gleaming during a visit in August  At a conventional frac site just up the road  the towers were black from diesel exhaust   Evolution s Bodishbaugh said some oil and gas firms see less polluting e frac as improving their standing with investors who rate environmental  social and governance  ESG  attributes in their investments    I d say this year we ve probably had more inbounds calls on the emissions profile than the economic savings   he said   Paul Mecray III  a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who follows major service companies  said e frac will only catch on if overall demand for oilfield services recovers

Importantly  the count of oil rigs in Permian fell for seven consecutive weeks Investors should know that domestic drillers may continue to lower rigs in the oil patches as they have a conservative capital budget for 2019 and the crude pricing scenario is weak  Despite the bearish landscape  it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on Permian drillers which are ramping up crude production with the deployment of lesser rigs 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most

35958,257473,SLB,Energy Sector Q3 Seen Weak Despite Attack On Oil Supplies,opinion,"After sputtering all year  energy stocks finally got a boost last month  It wasn t necessarily how company executives would have envisioned  however  because it took a devastating military strike against Saudi oil facilities to help the struggling sector post some decent gains on Wall Street 
Despite the military action that temporarily disabled 5  of the world s crude production  Energy companies aren t exactly charging into earnings season  While the temporary shortage gave some drilling and refining company stocks a shot in the arm in mid September  the sector is still by far the worst performing S P 500 sector over the last year  down double digits  It s also the second worst performer year to date  only ahead of Health Care 
The Energy story doesn t seem likely to accelerate much once Q3 earnings season gets underway  with research firm FactSet predicting another quarter of negative earnings and lower revenue growth for the sector  see more below   Energy hasn t had a positive earnings quarter yet this year  and Q3 crude oil prices averaged about 20  below year ago levels  That could be a major drag on bottom lines  though it s worth noting that prices were relatively steady through much of Q3  That little flare up at the end of the quarter might have helped profitability a little for some companies 
Fundamentally Speaking
The fundamental picture doesn t seem to be improving despite the attack on Saudi Arabia  In a  good news is bad news  moment for the major refiners and drillers  Saudi Arabia moved quickly to repair facilities  Crude prices which soared 15  in one day on Sept  16 after the weekend military strike almost immediately pulled back 
U S  crude futures  retreated quickly to the mid  50s by early October after briefly topping  60 on Sept  16  Even after the attacks  a crude futures chart showed traders only building in expectations for slightly higher crude prices eight months from now than they d built in before the military strike 
Though analysts said a higher risk premium could continue to be built into crude prices as the world deals with aftershocks  Energy sector executives can t necessarily count on that to keep things profitable over the long run  They re a victim of their own success  in a way  because the explosive growth of U S  supplies over the last decade provides a decent shield against the impact of geopolitics 
Many analysts said if the same attack on Saudi Arabia had happened 10 or 12 years ago  crude would have soared quickly above  100 a barrel  That level hasn t been seen since 2014 thanks in part to U S  crude production rising to record highs and staying there much of this year and last  U S  production has jumped from under 5 million barrels a day at times back in 2005 to more than 12 million barrels a day now 
Some of the U S  energy stocks that got a boost after the attacks included  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM    Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX    Marathon Oil  Corporation  NYSE MRO  and Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE CHK   U S  oilfield services firms Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  also rallied  Notably  though  none of the rallies lasted beyond a day or two  with all these stocks going flat or even falling a few days after the attack as the Saudis promised to quickly restore production 
What the companies can t control is demand  and that s becoming a problem in places like Europe and Japan  where economies struggle  The European Central Bank  ECB  recently announced lower interest rates and a new monetary stimulus program to try and spark some sort of growth 
The long trade war between the U S  and China appears to be taking a toll on China s economy  too  judging from much of the recent economic data coming out of Beijing  U S  data remains mostly strong  especially on the consumer side  but dents might be showing in the armor when you look at recent manufacturing data  which has been a mixed bag 
Global oil demand will grow by a little more than one million barrels a day this year  according to the International Energy Agency  IEA   That s only around 1   Things won t get any easier for the Energy sector in 2020  if the IEA is right  It predicts supply growth to outweigh demand growth that year as new supplies from Norway and Brazil hit the market 
 While the relentless stock builds we have seen since early 2018 have halted  this is temporary   the IEA said in a September press release   Soon  the OPEC  producers will once again see surging non OPEC oil production with the implied market balance returning to a significant surplus and placing pressure on prices  The challenge of market management remains a daunting one well into 2020  
Perhaps seeing the challenges ahead for its members  OPEC decided in September not to cut production from already reduced levels  a bearish development for crude prices  The bombing of Saudi Arabia s oil facilities came soon after the OPEC meeting  blunting its impact  but with the facilities expected to be operating normally again soon  OPEC and its lack of action could return to focus  Its next major meeting is in December 
Of course  the supply picture could potentially change quickly if tensions in the Middle East get worse  but as an investor  it s not prudent to try to guess how geopolitical events might turn out  There s really no point assuming things will get better or worse in Saudi Arabia 
Imagine going into a business where the price of your main product stagnates for years even while additional supply continually gets dumped on the market and demand growth barely moves  and you ll get a sense of why the Energy sector has issues  Companies that in some cases lose money on every barrel they sell  drill  refine  or transport can t make up for those losses just by selling more product 

In a sign of possible retreat  U S  rig counts have generally been falling lately  according to Baker Hughes  a  General Electric   NYSE GE  company  The oil rig count dropped to 719 in late September from 885 at the end of last year  Fewer rigs represents a potential negative for oil services companies helping to take care of those operations  Briefing com said 
Consider listening closely to Energy company earnings calls for what executives say about the demand side of the equation  The question we used to hear on these calls was always   Where are you drilling   Now  the question is   Where is the demand   On top of everything else  more companies are switching from fossil fuels to alternative energy  as Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  announced recently  This is another potential pressure point on demand for crude and natural gas 
The sector is down more than 22  year over year as of early October  compared with a 2  rise for the S P 500 Index  SPX  as a whole

Q3 Earnings
As of mid September  89  of the Energy sector companies saw a decline in FactSet s earnings estimates compared with June 30  FactSet said  These include behemoths like XOM  CVX  and Occidental Petroleum Corporation  NYSE OXY   You might want to consider taking this with a grain of salt  however  because in Q2  about 72  of the Energy sector companies reported earnings that exceeded FactSet s expectations 
In Q3  Energy firms in the S P 500 are expected to report a more than 29  year over year drop in sector earnings growth and a 6 8  drop in sector revenue  FactSet said  Those estimates are both well below where FactSet saw things going at the end of Q2  implying that news from the energy patch has gotten worse over the last three months 
Earnings fell 3 9  for the Energy sector in Q2 following a 27  decline in Q1  Revenue rose 0 7  for Energy in Q2 
So in this environment  what are companies likely to emphasize  Cost cutting  That s been a theme for some of the big oil companies recently  As Briefing com noted   Cost cutting is almost obligatory to preserve bottom line if top line growth isn t there  If there are a lot of fixed costs  you need to get spending in line to protect profit margins and have some sort of flow through  
They re also emphasizing production meaning more of it  For instance  CVX noted in its last earnings press release that Q2 net oil equivalent production  was the highest in the company s history  driven by continued growth in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia  
XOM sounded similar in its Q2 release  saying   Our upstream liquids production increased by 8 percent from last year  driven by growth in the Permian Basin  and we are preparing to startup the Liza Phase 1 development in Guyana  where the estimated recoverable resource increased to more than 6 billion oil equivalent barrels  
So perhaps expect to hear more about production growth in this coming quarter s calls

35960,257475,SLB,Murray International Trust  Continuing To Favour Emerging Markets,opinion,"Murray International Trust   LON MYI  is a well established investment trust  launched in 1907  Manager Bruce Stout runs a diversified portfolio of global equities and fixed income securities  aiming to achieve long term capital growth while protecting capital during periods of market weakness  and generate an above average level of income  the current dividend yield is 4 4    The majority of the portfolio is invested in emerging markets  regions where the manager finds the most attractive opportunities  and which continue to employ orthodox economic policies  unlike many developed markets 





The market opportunity
As shown in the chart above  emerging markets and developing economies have superior historical and potential GDP growth opportunities compared with the world as a whole  Valuations in these regions are also relatively attractive compared with global equities on both an absolute and relative basis  which may be of interest to investors seeking exposure outside of the traditional developed markets

Three year performance vs index





























Market outlook  Volatility looks set to continue
UK equities have lagged the performance of overseas markets  in sterling terms  since mid 2014  Exhibit 2  LHS   this is partly due to domestic currency weakness and continued uncertainty following the 2016 referendum on EU membership  There are other macro issues to consider  which means stock market volatility could well continue  these include changes in central banks  monetary policy  and the escalation in the US China trade dispute  which is affecting the global supply chain and overall economic growth 
In addition  valuations are not looking particularly attractive   despite choppier stock markets in recent quarters  global equities  led by the dominant US market  continue to trade on a forward P E multiple that is at a premium to its 10 year average  Exhibit 2  RHS   Given the current macro and valuation backdrop  investors may be rewarded by focusing on high quality companies that are supported by stable earnings and income streams  and are trading on reasonable valuations 





Fund profile  Preference for emerging markets
MYI was launched in December 1907 and is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange  The lead manager  since June 2004  is Bruce Stout  a member of Aberdeen Standard Investments   ASI  global equity team  he has been directly involved with MYI since 1992  The manager aims to generate long term capital growth  while preserving capital during periods of stock market weakness  and an above average dividend yield from a globally diversified portfolio of equities and fixed income securities  He has a preference for emerging markets  c 60  of the fund  given their above average growth potential and relatively attractive valuations  From time to time  the trust may hold other equity related securities such as depository receipts  preference shares or unlisted companies  and derivatives are permitted for efficient portfolio management 
MYI s performance is measured against a composite benchmark of 40  FTSE World UK and 60  FTSE World ex UK indices  The high UK weighting is a result of historical considerations  in the past  other regions did not offer competitive yields  and over time  the trust s UK exposure has declined meaningfully  from c 45  in 2004 to c 10  now  The manager explains that there is no available benchmark that mirrors MYI s structure of global equities and emerging market debt  while global equity indices  unlike MYI  have a very high US weighting  a market that only offers a modest dividend yield   Stout argues that when it comes down to it  the trust s shareholders are essentially interested in its ability to grow and protect capital  while offering an attractive level of income  the annual dividend has grown at an average annual rate of c 8  over the last 10 years  
The manager is not limited to any specific geographic or sector exposures  but at the time of investment  a maximum 15  of the portfolio may be in a single holding  Total gearing of up to 30  of NAV is permitted in normal market conditions  at end August 2019  net gearing was 12 1  
The fund manager  Bruce Stout
The manager s view  Finding opportunities in Asia and EM
In a recent analyst meeting  Stout gave his perspectives on ASI s investment team following the merger between  Standard Life   LON SLA  and Aberdeen in August 2017  He says that the regional team structure focusing on quality and value remains the same  but is just larger  now numbering 148 investment professionals  The manager is a member of ASI s 19 strong global equity team  four of whom have worked closely together on MYI for more than 20 years  both in terms of idea generation and portfolio management  They are able to draw on the resources of six regional teams covering North America  UK  Europe  Asia  Japan and emerging markets  with particular input from the Asian and emerging market teams as Stout believes these two regions offer the most companies with favourable earnings and dividend growth  He explains that MYI now has the lowest UK and European exposure in the last 15 years  as the team is unable to find a sufficient number of companies fulfilling the investment criteria in these areas 
The manager only buys bonds when they are trading below par  but he notes that some of MYI s sovereign bond holdings are relatively expensive  trading above face value  However  he says that Asia and emerging markets are currently the only parts of the world with orthodox economic policies  suggesting that elsewhere  negative yields are leading to misallocation of capital  Stout believes that due to moderate inflation  there is room for further interest rate cuts in emerging markets and potential for a re rating  In the context of negative yields in developed markets  the manager considers emerging market debt extremely cheap  as such  he is in no hurry to divest MYI s exposure  However  he notes that this is not a large liquid market  so MYI s debt position sizes are relatively small versus its equity holdings 
Stout says he does not consider himself a value investor  he is interested in owning growth stocks that can grow their dividends  such as ASUR  CME and  Unilever   LON ULVR  Indonesia  which are all top 10 holdings  Exhibit 1   However  there are selected value stocks in the portfolio  such as global oil service leader Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   purchased in 2018   which along with the rest of the industry has experienced a significant business downturn  The company currently offers a c 5  dividend yield 
So far this year  MYI s dividend income has have been higher than expected  such as from top 10 holdings Taiwan Semiconductor  ASUR and  Unilever   LON ULVR  Indonesia  Stout believes that this is an important development  as these companies are based in regions where there are orthodox economic policies  they have  decent yields and balance sheets that are strong enough to support them   The manager compares this to the UK  where some companies have 5 5 6 0  dividend yields and stretched balance sheets versus gilt yields of 40bp  He suggests that  something is wrong   not just in the UK but also in other developed markets  such as in Germany and Switzerland  which both have negative bond yields  There is no recession yet  but these bond prices are indicating deflation  recession or depression  Stout does not know how events in the bond markets will ultimately pan out  but he remains cautious  keeping a zero exposure to developed market government debt 
The manager says that the global interest rate environment is even more favourable now the Federal Reserve has changed tack from raising to lowering interest rates  However  he suggests that the US China trade dispute is as prickly as ever  with President Trump on a  one man crusade  despite the lack of a resolution having a negative impact on the US economy  The Chinese economy is evolving  Stout believes that it will be in a consumption phase for the next 10 to 15 years and China will become the world s largest consumer  so he questions why the US is picking a fight  He explains that the US has enormous unfunded social programmes  so the president is trying to appease the electorate  However  he suggests that Trump s barometer of success is the S P 500  which only benefits a small percentage of the population  In addition  the manager questions the president s comments on foreign policy via social media  and believes that over time people will become numb to his tweets  Stout believes that as an investor it is prudent to look through the short term macro noise and continue to look for attractive investment opportunities that can be held for the long term 
Asset allocation
Investment process  ASI s focus on quality and value
Stout follows ASI s focus on bottom up investment in high quality companies that are trading on reasonable valuations  Quality is assessed in terms of a firm s management team  its business focus  the strength of its balance sheet and its corporate governance track record  Regularly meeting with company managements is a key part of the investment process  The manager is able to draw on the resources of ASI s six specialist fund management teams   UK  Europe  Asia Pacific ex Japan  North America  Japan and emerging markets   and may invest in any companies held throughout the wider firm  Stout invests without regard to benchmark allocations  c 60  of the fund is invested in emerging markets   he says that he essentially  buys good companies that are doing good things   seeking firms with defensive businesses that can consistently deliver earnings and dividend growth  MYI s portfolio typically has around 50 equity holdings from across the market cap spectrum  and the manager has c 50 names on a  watch list  that may be considered for investment in the future  Stout also invests in fixed income securities that are held in ASI s regional portfolios  government and corporate bonds are selected on the basis of their value and future prospects  There is a board requirement that MYI s portfolio must contain 45 150 holdings  at end August 2019  there were 51 equity and 27 debt positions  Equity holdings are initiated at around 1 0  to 1 5  of the fund  while initial fixed income positions tend to be smaller  If a holding reaches 5  of the portfolio  it is trimmed within 30 days  and the manager will sell a holding within 30 days if it is no longer on the regional teams   buy lists   MYI s portfolio turnover is very low  with the majority of the positions having multi year holding periods 
Current portfolio positioning
Over the last 12 months to end August 2019  as normal  there have been only modest changes in MYI s portfolio structure  with 0 9pp coming out of equities and into bonds cash  Exhibit 3   In terms of geography  the largest increases in exposure are Asia Pacific ex Japan and North America  both  3 5pp   while the largest decreases are Japan   3 1pp  and the UK   2 6pp   At end August  the trust s top 10 holdings made up 30 8  of the portfolio  which was a modest decrease in concentration from 32 9  a year earlier  seven names were common to both periods 
The manager highlights MYI s positions in the telecom sector  suggesting those in Asia are a  blend of growth and boring  and include on the boring side Taiwan Mobile  which lacks dividend and earnings growth but has a well covered  high dividend yield  Stout explains that telcos were historically viewed as bond proxies   fixed line  regulated state monopolies with low capex requirements  While their business models have evolved over time  the manager suggests that the companies still generate stable cash flows and offer attractive dividend yields  including MYI s holdings in Singtel  Singapore Telecommunications   Telus  Canada  and Verizon  NYSE VZ   US   Stout believes that if telcos still have bond proxy attributes  it implies that they are incredibly cheap  while bonds are very expensive  He also highlights a few of MYI s financial positions  such as Siam Commercial Bank  which has high levels of capital adequacy  The manager says that the Thai banking system  has been through the mill   but the cycle is now improving with a lower level of non performing loans  He has been adding to MYI s position in Oversea China Banking  Singapore   which he says has enormous capital reserves and is increasing its dividend at a double digit rate  The trust also has a holding in  Standard Chartered   LON STAN   which Stout suggests  has to get it right this time  given its poor returns versus its peers  The manager says the bank has the right geographic footprint and that its problems have been self inflicted  He believes that a higher return on equity could lead to a meaningful improvement in the rating of Standard Chartered s shares  in the meantime  the company has started to increase its dividend 





Focusing on portfolio changes in recent months  Stout says there are new positions in  Castrol India  a lubricant manufacturer that has de rated in recent years and offers double digit earnings growth  an attractive yield and a growing dividend   GlobalWafers  a Taiwan based semiconductor manufacturer whose shares came under pressure due to the ongoing China US trade dispute  and is growing its dividend   TC Energy  formerly TransCanada   an energy infrastructure company with solid earnings and dividend growth   and Telenor  a Norwegian telco with 70  of its business generated in Asia  this is the first time the manager has held shares in this company  
Complete disposals from the fund include  BAT  LON BATS  Malaysia  whose business is under pressure due to competition from contraband tobacco   Daito Trust  a long term holding in a Japanese construction and real estate firm  which has diminishing growth prospects  with risks to its dividend cover   MTR  an unattractively valued Hong Kong public transport network operator   and Weir  a small position in a UK engineering company that has been unable to grow its dividend   Stout also highlights the sale of a Uruguayan sovereign bond  which at the time of purchase offered a 6 5  yield  but due to capital appreciation is trading above par and now yields less than 4  
Performance  Solid 10 year total returns





In H119  ending 30 June   MYI s NAV and share price total returns of  10 6  and  4 3  respectively trailed the benchmark s  15 5  total return  Positive contributors to performance included the trust s Asian exposure  where stock selection was favourable  and financial and other interest rate sensitive businesses performed well  MYI s returns were hindered by challenging stock selection in Japan and its defensive US holdings  this market was particularly robust over the first half of 2019  Despite improving company fundamentals in Latin America  stock prices in the region suffered from the effects of the US trade dispute  although there was increased investor demand for relatively higher yielding Latin American bonds 





MYI has generated solid 10 year NAV and share price total returns approaching 10  pa  Stout continues to adhere to his disciplined investment approach  constructing MYI s portfolio without regard to benchmark weightings  As a result  there are periods when the trust s and benchmark s performances will diverge  his focus on capital preservation led to meaningful outperformance during the Q418 global market selloff 
Exhibit 6 shows MYI s relative returns  Its NAV is ahead of the benchmark over the last year  while lagging over longer and shorter periods  however  the trust s NAV continues to outpace the performance of UK shares over one  five and 10 years 











Discount  De rating in recent months
In recent months  MYI has de rated  the current 0 6  discount to cum income NAV compares with a range of a 5 5  premium to 5 5  discount over the last 12 months  Over the last one  three  five and 10 years MYI has traded at an average discount of 0 1  and average premiums of 0 8   0 8  and 3 1   respectively 
Renewed annually  MYI has authority to repurchase up to 14 99  and allot shares up to 10  of issued share capital to manage a persistent significant discount to ex income NAV or a premium to cum income NAV  The board believes it is in the best interests of shareholders to reduce the volatility in the trust s discount or premium  while repurchasing shares at a discount and allotting them at a premium is modestly accretive to NAV  During H119  0 7m shares were issued or sold from treasury  0 5  of the share base   which raised  8 3m 





Capital structure and fees
MYI is a conventional investment trust with one class of share  there are 128 8m ordinary shares in issue  The trust has  200m in debt  including a  30m five year  2 25  fixed rate loan taken out with the Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  International in mid May 2019  part of which was used to pay off a  15m maturing loan  Total gearing of up to 30  is permitted  in normal market conditions   at end August  net gearing was 12 1

Dividend policy and record
The board pursues a progressive dividend policy  in some years revenue is added to reserves  and drawn down in others to supplement income  over time  it aims to pay out the underlying portfolio revenue earnings  While MYI s level of income is affected by the relative strength and weakness of sterling  the board believes that due to the costs and complexities associated with currency hedging  this process would not be in shareholders  best interests  Dividends are paid quarterly in August  November  February and May  The 51 5p total FY18 dividend was 0 96x covered and 3 0  higher than the 50 0p total FY17 distribution  So far in FY19  two interim dividends of 12 0p have been declared   4 3  year on year   and based on its current share price  MYI offers a 4 4  dividend yield  At end H119  the trust had  71 3m in revenue reserves  which is equivalent to c 1 1x the FY18 dividend payment

35961,257476,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  ExxonMobil   Shell s Q3 Updates  ConocoPhillips  Dividend Hike,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas futures came under selling pressure 
On the news front  supermajors ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   issued updates on their upcoming third quarter earnings  Meanwhile  world s largest independent oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   announced a 38  dividend hike combined with a  3 billion share repurchase 
Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures moved down 5 5  to close at  52 81 per barrel  while natural gas prices dropped 2 2  for the week to finish at 2 352 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark registered a sharp weekly loss on concerns about demand and a larger than anticipated build in domestic stockpiles 
Natural gas prices also finished down after the weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected increase in supplies  The bearish injection  which was also higher than the five year average  sparked a sell off  
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1   ExxonMobil recently announced that weakness in crude prices will hurt its third quarter earnings  Following the announcement  the integrated energy player s share price slid 2 6  
Through the September quarter of 2019  price of West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude plunged 8 5  and 8 9   respectively  The decline in oil prices is likely to clip ExxonMobil s third quarter 2019 profit from its upstream operations  The latest SEC filing revealed that the company expects total quarterly earnings from upstream businesses  including the domestic market and abroad  to decline roughly 45  from the September quarter of 2018 
ExxonMobil also anticipates its third quarter 2019 profit from downstream businesses to slump 70  from the year ago period  As a whole  the energy giant projects total profit decline of 50  to  3 1 billion from the prior year quarter  owing to underperformance in both upstream and downstream businesses   Read more   
2    Royal Dutch Shell recently announced the updated version of its third quarter guidance  Let s delve into some key segmental revisions 
The upstream production is projected to lie between 2 600 and 2 650 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  boe d   slightly lower than the year ago figure of 2 672 thousand boe d  Compared with the prior year quarter  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company expects to incur additional  250  350 million well write offs during this year s third quarter 
You can see  
Shell projected its third quarter oil product sales in the range of 6 700 7 350 thousand barrels per day assuming that the upper end of the estimate will be met  This indicates a 10  increase from the number reported in the third quarter of 2018  Meanwhile  the company expects to see a marginal fall in its chemical sales volumes  Further  Shell envisioned its third quarter LNG liquefication volumes to increase 10 14  compared with its previous year s quarterly output  Moreover  its segmental production is anticipated to lie in the 930 960 thousand boe d band  In the year earlier period  Shell produced 924 thousand boe d   Read more   
3    ConocoPhillips recently announced a hike in its quarterly dividend and plans to repurchase of stocks worth  3 billion 
The new dividend of 42 cents per share reflects an increase of 38  from the prior payout  The dividend is likely to be paid on Dec 2  to stockholders of record as of Oct 17  On an annualized basis  the company hiked its dividend by roughly  500 million 
Moreover  ConocoPhillips has announced its intention to buy back stocks worth  3 billion in 2020  Both the dividend hike and share buyback program reflect the company s strong focus on returning cash to shareholders consistently   Read more   
4   Cenovus Energy Inc    TSX CVE   announced that it has lowered its guidance for 2019 capital budget and raised its fourth quarter 2019 dividend payout 
The company now expects its capital spending through 2019 in the band of C 1 1 C 1 2 billion  The midpoint of the guidance suggests a reduction of C 150 million from the midpoint of the prior projected band 
Cenovus also announced fourth quarter 2019 dividend of 6 25 cents  which calls for a sequential increase of 25   The new dividend is likely to be paid on Dec 31  to common shareholders of record as of Dec 13  Notably  while presenting its five year business plan  the company boasted about its strong financials and added that it will be able to raise annual dividends by 5  to 10  even if West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude trades at a low level of  45 per barrel   Read more   
5    Roan Resources  Inc    NYSE ROAN   has reached an agreement with Citizen Energy Operating  LLC  a subsidiary of private equity major Warburg Pincus LLC  By dint of this deal  the former will be acquired by the latter  The transaction value reveals an all cash deal worth  1 billion comprising  780 million net debt as of Sep 30 
This strategic move would provide Roan shareholders with  1 52 in cash for each share of Roan common stock they own  accounting for a 24  premium to the closing price prior to the acquisition announcement  This  in turn  implies a total equity consideration of  234 2 million  The buyout pact is expected to unlock a significant value for the company s shareholders wherein they are anticipated to receive a substantial premium 
Recently  Roan was witnessing weak drilling activities in its core operating SCOOP and STACK basins in Oklahoma  This downside resulted from the irregularity in the region s geology  making it an expensive area for producers and therefore inducing a higher cost structure  Read more

35962,257477,SLB,Earnings Preview  Schlumberger  SLB  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 9  
Revenues are expected to be  8 49 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger 
For Schlumberger  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schlumberger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-schlumberger-slb-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200472758,200472758

for a 3rd consecutive quarter in a S P 500 earnings decline This is akin to the 2016  earnings recession  period  But this time  it is driven by U S  tariffs and trade uncertainty Zacks Director of

earnings season leads  If the U S  catches a cold  the global week will get sicker  1  Q3 Earnings Season BeginsTrade and impeachment have grabbed the most headlines of late but the countdown has now begun for the U S  third quarter earnings kickoff No good news here  expect screens to turn red on Tuesday for JPMorgan  Citigroup  NYSE C   Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  With interest rates falling and the Treasury yield curve having inverted earlier in the year  U S  banks should report a 1 2  decline in earnings  Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio predicts  It will be the first

 NYSE HON  on Thursday  they will show the tariff impact on trade sensitive transport and industrial firms  Trade obsessed markets will also watch for September industrial production figures on Friday to see how manufacturing sidis performing Tuesday is also when President Trump s threatened tariff increase is supposed to take effect on  250 billion of Chinese goods  There is some optimism that they might be able to find enough common ground to delay the scheduled hikes  The talks went  very well   according to Trump  2  Trade War ScorecardMore on trade  With the U S  China trade summit out of the way  markets face a sobering return to  normal transmission  Two numbers this week will shed light on the bigger picture  China s trade balance and annual growth  Both could be ugly  All indications are trade hostilities are slowing the world s second largest economy  exports dropped in August and data on Monday is expected to show they fell faster in September Economic growth   the weakest in 27 years in June   is also seen going a little lower in the third quarter to test the bottom end of Beijing s 6  to 6 5  target for 2019  All that will put pressure on the central bank to loosen monetary policy  especially if the planned U S  tariff increases go through Another number of interest will be the daily fixing of the yuan s onshore trading range  A fall past the symbolic seven per dollar rate in August was considered a response to economic weakness as well as a message that the currency would be on the table if the trade war escalated  The yuan has been pegged around 7 0730 for a few weeks  and a move in either direction could telegraph clearer than words whether the trade war antagonists are moving closer together or further apart  3  U K  Pound Sterling Bulls Are UnleashedSterling bulls could be forgiven if they thought Christmas had arrived early Deadlocked for months over Brexit  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar now say they  see a pathway to a possible deal   The pound has witnessed its biggest two day jump in more than three years  as investors slash some of their extreme short sterling bets  Expectations for an interest rate cut are falling too  as a positive Brexit outcome would remove the uncertainty hanging over the economy But the road is long   EU Council President Donald Tusk has signaled there is no guarantee of a deal and time is running out  It also remains unclear what compromises have been made on the thorny Irish border issue  but hopes are now high of further progress ahead the Oct 17 18 EU summit The risk of exiting without a deal had already faded  but if a deal is agreed at the summit or before it  sterling could jump above a 2019 high of near  1 34 hit in March  Delay and recrimination  however  could see the pound reverse the gains it racked up so quickly  4  End of a U S  Turkey Friendship Meanwhile  Trump s blossoming friendship with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has hit a rocky patch Bosom buddies not long ago  when the U S  president shielded Ankara from being sanctioned over its purchase of Russian missile defense systems  the two are locking horns over Turkey s launch of a military campaign in northeastern Syria against Kurdish forces   I say hit Turkey very hard financially   with sanctions if they don t play by the rules  I am watching closely   Trump tweeted Republicans in the House of Representatives have announced plans for legislation to impose sanctions and the upcoming EU summit will debate sanctions  The quarrel carries enormous risks for Turkey s economy  which is still emerging from its worst slump in two decades  The sanction threats have pushed the lira to its weakest level in nearly four months and its dollar bonds have tumbled  Risks include higher deficits and borrowing costs and slowing tourism  The volatility is likely to prevent the central bank from easing policy later this month  crimping economic recovery   5  The IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings BeginThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank s autumn gathering promises to be a gloomy one for the finance chiefs  bankers  development officials and politicians who will descend on Washington D C  for the Oct  14 20 meeting New IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has warned of a  synchronised slowdown  and  substantially weakened  manufacturing backdrop due to trade wars  but other risks loom  too A decade after the global financial crisis  it s becoming clear that major central banks have maxed out their ability to lift economic growth  Will more government spending do the trick instead  For debt burdened countries  that may seem a tall order too  Also  what tools can policymakers use should the world tip into recession  And there is the more immediate fear of global money markets seizing up again  2008 style  with the recent repo rate surge in U S  interbank markets a potential warning signal  U S  and Eurozone weakness won t leave emerging markets unscathed either  There are already pockets of distress such as Argentina  but other countries   from Egypt to Ecuador   are starting to witness violent protests  Climate change

35984,257499,SLB,Oil service firms eye new survival tactics amid weak U S  market,news,"By Liz Hampton
 Reuters    Packers Plus Energy Services  a company built on the North American shale oil boom  is turning to the Middle East to weather a new round of spending cuts by producers amid warnings of a looming oil glut 
Oil production has outpaced demand by 900 000 barrels per day  bpd  this year  according to the International Energy Agency  which expects increases to add a net 136 million barrels to the global surplus by March  Spending cuts by producers also have sharply cut service providers  margins  a June survey of 60 providers by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank revealed 
The last time supplies overwhelmed demand  oilfield service suppliers cut 100s of thousands of jobs and top firms gushed red ink  Memories of that sharp downturn in late 2014 have executives such as Ian Bryant  chief executive officer of privately held  Calgary based Packers Plus  again cutting jobs  seeking safe harbors  mergers  or putting business units on the market 
These defensive strategies comes as oil and gas drillers are producing vastly more oil with less investment 
U S  shale output is estimated to have hit 8 5 million bpd  even as the number of rigs in operation fell by almost 100 in the last year  On average  analysts expect the top 50 U S  independent oil producers will cut spending by 20  this year  with some by as much as 60   according to review by researcher DrillingInfo 
That drop has Bryant s Packers Plus  which historically catered to North American onshore producers  looking beyond shale and toward markets in the Middle East for future business 
 There are obviously geopolitical risks  but the cycles are not as vicious as they are in North American land   said Bryant in an interview  He cut 10  of Packers  staff in North America earlier this year and is planning to open a manufacturing center at an undisclosed location in the Middle East  The bet  there will be more growth there and better margins than in North America 
 For some exploration and production companies  the downturn is over and behind them  For most service companies  it still feels like we re in the downturn   said Bryant   Service pricing is unsustainable at present levels  
 TOO MANY PLAYERS 
Weatherford International  once a top four oilfield service provider  filed for protection from creditors this month and has been cutting staff  citing  market headwinds  and lack of access to financing 
In the last 18 months  other top service firms  including the world s top oilfield services company Schlumberger  N SLB   added or acquired new hydraulic fracturing fleets in a bet that a backlog of uncompleted shale wells would grow their businesses 
But across the U S  the number of yet to be fracked wells hit 8 289 in May  up 22  in a year  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration 
Oil and gas employment in the United States has grown since the last downturn  but last month remained 20  below the same month in 2014  according to U S  government data 
Some investors and executives believe a wave of mergers and restructurings will be required to prop up declining margins 
 There s just frankly too many players   Roe Patterson  CEO of Fort Worth  Texas based  Basic Energy Services Inc   N BAS   said of the oilfield services industry in May 
 Everyone understands that trying to reduce our cost structure is not going to be how we improve and fix the OFS  oilfield service  space  We ve got to see a shrinking number of bidders and competitors out there  
 GRAPHIC   More oil with fewer workers   
CAN MERGERS FIX MARGIN PRESSURE 
Profits for service companies that added people and equipment following the 2015 2016 oil price collapse also have suffered  Oilfield equipment utilization fell nearly 13 points and profitability tumbled 26 points versus the previous quarter  according a June survey by the Dallas Federal Reserve bank  Its survey polled 60 oilfield service companies in Texas  New Mexico and Louisiana 
Investors have so soured on the sector that there were no public equity offerings by oilfield service firms last quarter  said Drillinginfo  for the first time in more than three years 
C J Energy Services Inc  N CJ  and  Keane Group Inc   N FRAC  struck an all stock deal in June to merge  a move that investors hoped would spark more 
However  that combination still leaves about 14 larger pressure pumping firms in business  estimates Brad Handler  an oilfield services analyst at investment firm Jefferies  He estimates five are candidates to sell their pressuring pumping businesses 
 If a much needed transaction doesn t happen  service companies will have to look at refinancing or entering into out of court agreements with debt holders  or filing bankruptcy   said Kelli Norfleet  a restructuring partner at law firm Haynes   Boone 
But even as companies look to consolidate  too many are in such poor shape to attract a buyer 
Patterson s Basic Energy Services ratio of debt to pre tax earnings is 5 57  according to Moody s Investors Service  By comparison  Keane s debt to EBITDA ratio was 1 05 before it merged with C J Energy Services 
 There are not very many buyers   said Sajjad Alam  an analyst for debt rating firm Moody s Investors Service   The market is still very weak and looks more uncertain today than it did earlier in the year

35985,257500,SLB,Oil Prices Rise After U S  Takes Down Iranian Drone  Iran Denies Report,news,"Investing com   Oil prices rose on Friday after U S  President Donald Trump confirmed that the Navy had shot down an Iranian drone in the Persian Gulf area 
Crude shot up 2  to intraday highs overnight but later pared gains after Iran denied the report 
New York traded West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 40 cents  or 0 7   to  55 70 a barrel by 8 32 AM ET  12 32 GMT   while Brent crude futures  the benchmark for oil prices outside the U S   gained 62 cents  or 1 0   to  62 55 
Abbas Araqchi  Iranian deputy foreign minister contradicted Trump s claim  saying that Tehran had  not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else  and said that the U S  may in fact have shot down one of its own by mistake 
Tensions remain high in the area where tankers have been attacked amid growing tension between Washington and Tehran over Iran s nuclear program  The Strait of Hormutz is a key shipping route for oil and conflict in the region runs the risk of restricting oil supply 
Both parties have now also reportedly destroyed each other s drones and  according to Investing com s senior commodity analyst Barani Krishnan  seem ready for further conflict despite also suggesting they want to hold negotiations 
 While few may want to give the U S  Iran style of gunboat diplomacy a chance  oil bulls should never be too complacent that there will be no breakthrough here   because on the off chance there is one  another crude price collapse is very likely   Krishnan said 
Friday s gains broke a four day losing streak but oil remains on track for hefty weekly declines of 7 5  in the case of U S  crude and 6 3  for Brent 
Oil has remained under pressure since weekly data from the Energy Information Administration showed the U S  market awash with refined products last week 
Oil has remained under pressure since weekly data from the Energy Information Administration showed the U S  market awash with refined products last week 
Reports of potential talks between the U S  and Iran contributed this week to an already sharp decline in oil prices after Hurricane Barry passed without causing as much damage as feared  
The U S  government said on Thursday that 335 000 barrels of oil a day of output was still shut in  while 9  of production platforms were still unstaffed 
Analysts at consultancy Rystad Energy noted that production outages had peaked at 1 4 million barrels a day and had lasted longer than is usual  
 It wasn t the strength of the storm or wind gusts that led to the outages  but timing and location   they said 
Barry s impact peaked on Day 5 at nearly 1 4 million bpd in lost production  In the end  it wasn t the strength of the storm or wind gusts that led to the outages  but timing and location that led to such high outages 
Oil has remained under pressure since weekly data from the Energy Information Administration showed the U S  market awash with refined products last week

Elsewhere Friday  oil services firm Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  said it expected price to remain  range bound around present levels   against a backdrop of slowing U S  production growth and output restraint coordinated by OPEC and Russia 
 We continue to see U S  shale oil as the only near  to medium term source of global production growth   it said in a press release detailing quarterly results   albeit at a slowing growth rate  as  exploration and production  operators continue to transition from a focus on growth to a focus on growth and returns

36000,257515,SLB,Why Rig Count Is No Longer A Reliable Gauge Of Production,opinion,"It seems that the  rig count  data have become irrelevant today  especially in terms of oil and gas production 
The figure used to generate considerable excitement among energy investors and has long been deployed to help predict future oil and gas production  However  the correlation seems to come under the spotlight recently 
As per conventional thinking  when number of rigs decline  fewer wells are drilled  This means less new oil and gas are discovered  and ultimately production slows down 
But recent data suggest otherwise     
Nationwide Oil   Gas Rig Count Slumps
In its latest report  oil services player Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   said that rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 904 for the week ended Aug 30  14  less than a year ago 
In particular  the number of oil directed rigs  at 742  is at its lowest since January 2018  The current total  far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is also lower than 862 a year ago 
Meanwhile  the current nationwide natural gas rig count  at 162  has plunged to levels last seen in mid April 2017  It is well below the previous year s rig count of 184 and 90  below the all time high of 1 606 recorded in 2008   
Moreover  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new technology to drill and extract crude from onshore shale formations    at 854   is well below the previous year s tally of 982 
Weakness in Commodity Prices to Blame 
There is growing evidence that producers are being repelled by falling crude and natural gas prices  
As far as oil is concerned  the volatility in realizations have convinced explorers like Apache   NYSE APA    Parsley Energy   NYSE PE    Equinor   NYSE EQNR   among others to take a relatively conservative approach on capital expenditure programs  The U S  crude benchmark  now below  55 a barrel  is also reeling from fears of a global economic slowdown in the backdrop of the U S  China trade war  Oil s troubles pushed the index into a bear market in August  leading to a more than 20  drop from recent highs 
Natural gas  meanwhile  recently fell to levels not seen in more than three years  reflecting a steady  albeit slow  descent  Natural gas might experience short lived surge based on positive weather forecasts but any powerful turnaround looks unlikely at the moment  With gas output in the lower 48 states recently hitting a record 92 1 Bcf per day  there is little room for prices to improve meaningfully from their current levels of around  2 35 per MMBtu 
Yet Production Hits Record
Per the EIA  the U S  oil output hit an all time high of 12 5 million barrels per day last week  Further  the government agency predicts that domestic oil production will average a record 12 3 million barrels per day in 2019 
On the natural gas front  EIA analysis suggests that average domestic supply will climb around 10  year over year to a record high of 91 billion cubic feet per day in 2019  To put things in perspective  U S  production was averaging around 55 billion cubic feet per day in 2009  only ten years back 
Why the Disparity 
Firstly  producers have become immensely better at churning out oil and gas out of deep underground layers of rock with the help of sophisticated technology 
Secondly  some of the rigs that have been taken out of work were employed in secondary regions where the probability to find oil gas was low anyway  Therefore  their exclusion did not materially affect overall volumes 
Lastly  2014 s crude price spike   that saw the commodity breach the  100 a barrel level   led to massive expansion in domestic drilling  However  the subsequent commodity price crash forced a number of producers to defer the  fracking  of the wells 
Investors should know that fracking   which follows drilling   is used to complete the well and get the oil flowing  This led to a huge backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells that are now being completed  In other words  lack of new drilling  or lower number of rigs  could still increase production if the wells are being completed 
So  Are Rig Counts Totally Irrelevant 
It s quite clear that the number of rigs is no longer the sole criteria in determining production movement  as it doesn t give the whole picture  Consequently  the decline in the number of U S  drilling rigs has not translated into slowing shale production yet 
For the real picture  one should also take into account existing and impending cut in fracking  or shale drilling  operations from the likes of oilfield services giants Halliburton   NYSE HAL   and Schlumberger   NYSE SLB     both carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold    and spending cuts by top energy companies

36004,257519,SLB,E Fracs Hold Promise But Do Not Appear Appealing To Industry,opinion,As WTI crude price stayed below the  60 per barrel mark for the last few months  exploration and production companies are looking for ways to slash production costs in order to boost profits  There s a path for these upstream companies to significantly increase savings using the E Frac technology  Moreover  this technology can be a remedy for their environmental concerns  enabling these companies to reduce emissions  Still  this huge opportunity is being swiftly avoided by drillers What is E Frac Electric fracking  popularly known as E Frac  uses natural gas that comes as a by product of crude oil in the process of generating electricity  This electricity is used to run frac fleets at drilling sites  This way of drilling is better than the conventional diesel operated fracs as it creates less noise  fixes the problem of   reduces air pollution through lower emissions than diesel fracs and saves diesel costs  Notably  E Fracs can reduce the cost of fracking in a well by  350 000 from  6  8 million standard cost per well Markedly  heavyweights like EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG    Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  are slowly adopting this technology  Wide application of the technology can help drillers save millions of dollars per annum  in turn boosting margins and profits However  E Frac technology is not that popular at drilling sites What is Holding It Back The cost of building an E Frac fleet is much higher than the conventional diesel powered fleet  As oilfield service providers are currently struggling to keep up profit levels  they are laying off staff and idling equipment to boost margins  Notably  since April  the number of active fleets in the United States has declined nearly 19  to around 390  per Reuters  Moreover  slashing of capital budgets by upstream companies  since investors are more focused on returns than hydrocarbon production  has put oilfield service providers in a tough spot  Hence  amid the current unfavourable business scenario  adopting a new technology   which can cost oil equipment suppliers almost double the amount required to build a conventional frac fleet   is anything but economical Oilfield service providers like Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   and others  which have been victims of reduced spending by upstream energy companies  have no intention to invest in E Fracs at present  The cost of conversion of their huge fleet to E Fracs can result in significantly lower profit levels However  Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   sees gains from this technology  In early 2019  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company debuted its E Frac gas turbine in the prolific Permian Basin  and estimates huge savings on diesel fuel and maintenance costs per annum as a result of the move  Several small oilfield service providers are also capitalizing on this opportunity by clinching fracking contracts for their small E Frac fleets  You can see  To ConcludeAlthough E Frac sounds like a smart and efficient investment opportunity  oilfield service providers are currently not in a position to avail the technology  The reduction in capital spending by upstream energy companies will not allow them to adopt this low cost and environment friendly fracking system  at least not in the present  extremely volatile  oil pricing scenario  However  small scale oil equipment suppliers can reap profits from the current situation via long term contracts with upstream companies 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops  Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 6  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention ,2019-09-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/efracs-hold-promise-but-do-not-appear-appealing-to-industry-200464923,200464923

36030,257545,SLB,Upstart Russian oil firm  with Goldman Sachs backing  bucks industry blues,news,By Olesya Astakhova YARAKTA OIL FIELD  Russia  Reuters    In the frozen taiga of eastern Siberia  where bears roam in spring after waking from hibernation  an independent Russian oil company is bucking the domestic industry trend by rapidly ramping up its output and expanding operations  Irkutsk Oil Company  known by the Russian acronym INK  has increased its crude production levels 30 fold over the past decade and has negotiated access to a pipeline network that allows it reach the Asian market  The company told Reuters it is planning investments worth  3  4 billion over the next three years  including developing its gas business by building four processing plants  INK stands out in the Russian oil sector  more than half of which is in state ownership  and is dominated by massive players like Rosneft and Lukoil  Production growth in the sector has been sluggish and a combination of low oil prices and Western sanctions have weighed on new investment  There is no immediate prospect of the industry landscape changing  leaving INK as a throwback to the 1990s  when the state had a smaller role and enterprising businesses blossomed  However  its experience suggests there are still opportunities in the sector for smaller  nimbler independent players  backed up by some international know how and a dose of good luck  INK is not subject to the U S  sectoral sanctions that apply to Russia s biggest energy firms and which place restrictions on the type of financing they can attract from Western creditors  INK s minority shareholders include Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  EBRD    Its crude production was 9 million tonnes last year  or 180 000 barrels per day  bpd    small beer compared to the 230 million tonnes  or 4 6 million bpd  produced by Rosneft  The company faces a series of obstacles that could put the brakes on its growth  including the increasing risk of being swallowed up by a larger rival  the need to invest huge amounts of money to build infrastructure in eastern Siberia and a lack of skilled staff in the remote region   58 CELSIUS  SNOW DRIFTS  FLOODS Producing oil in such a hostile environment is also challenging  Winter temperatures fall as low as 58 degrees Celsius below zero  and snow drifts reach 1 5 meters in height  according to INK workers  When the snow melts in spring  rivers flood  cutting the oil workers off from the outside world and meaning they have to travel in and out by helicopter   To reach reserves in the fledgling oil region  INK has to sink wells up to 5 km  3 miles  in depth  compared with 1 3 km in western Siberia which is more developed  A global deal to curb oil production agreed by OPEC and Russia  which means INK will have to keep its output at 9 million tonnes until July  has come at an opportune time for the company  according to Dmitry Zotov  its head of oil production   The OPEC deal has given us a chance to stop and draw breath   said Zotov  adding that INK was using the time  to touch up the paint here  do some repairs there   To help with exploring in such a difficult environment  INK said it had hired Don Walcott  an expert in oil production who has previously worked for Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and YUKOS  the Russian oil firm taken over by Rosneft   INK does not have publicly traded shares so there is no independent estimate of its value   The company s estimated value in 2013  when Goldman Sachs acquired its stake of slightly less than 4 percent  was  2 7 billion  according to a source familiar with the terms of that deal who declined to be identified as the information is confidential   The estimated value of the firm now is at least  4 billion  Yuri Rubin  INK s chief financial officer  told Reuters  He did not detail how that estimate was calculated   Andrei Polishchuk  an analyst with Raiffeisen  said the  4 billion estimated was plausible   The company has good production assets and their proximity to ESPO infers a premium on the company s value compared to competitors   he said  ESPO is the Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean  ESPO  pipeline  which pumps Russian crude to Asian markets   Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment on its investment  The EBRD  which owns a 1 6 percent stake in INK  said it was satisfied with its investment and had no plans to increase its holding  SIBERIAN OIL TO ASIA The company started out in the oil producing business in the late 1990s when its main shareholder  Nikolai Buinov  whose family had run a local fuel transport business  acquired three oil concessions from the local government  The previous owners had run into financial difficulties  At the time  eastern Siberia had no infrastructure and was thousands of kilometers from markets  Oil majors were preoccupied with easier prospects elsewhere  Luck played a part when the first wells found oil of an unusually high quality  Some of INK s wells have a yellow reddish color  a sign of low residue levels   In 2011  INK s fields were connected to the ESPO pipeline  where its crude mixes with other blends  INK now sells 300 000 400 000 tonnes of oil a month  or around half of its production  for export  The rest of its production goes to the local market

36033,257548,SLB,Schlumberger Sees Global Oil Industry Rebound on Rising Demand,news," Bloomberg     Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  Ltd   the world s biggest oilfield servicer  said the global oil industry is set to improve in 2019  supported by a  solid demand outlook  as production cuts from OPEC and its partners take effect 
Exploration and production investments are  starting to normalize as the industry heads toward a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base   the company said in its first quarter earnings release  Higher investments in international markets are required to keep production flat  while North America land is set for lower investments  Schlumberger said 
Key Takeaways

Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard is trying to rally investor enthusiasm after the drilling and fracking giant lost more than half its value amid the worst crude crash in a generation  Global oil prices have recovered some of their losses  but are still down more than a third from their June 2014 high  Schlumberger s shares have slid 56 percent in that period 
One of the biggest keys to Schlumberger s success is cranking up its bread and butter international business  where the company generates most of its revenue  It s prepared investors to expect single digit growth this year outside the U S  and Canada  The company said Thursday that it sees the recovery in international service and product pricing as a major business priority 
However  Schlumberger balanced it optimistic commentary on international markets with more cautious language about spending in the U S  It sees more moderate growth in U S  shale production in coming years 
After closing out 2018 as one of the worst performers in the Standard   Poor s 500 Energy index  Schlumberger has rallied this year to sit among the best in the 29 member group  Investors in January cheered the company s plans to slash its capital spending  in part to protect dividend payouts

36051,257566,SLB,Will PetroChina Pull Out Of Venezuela Amid US Sanctions ,opinion,Although Venezuela has the world s largest oil reserves  the oil industry therein is in deep trouble in the wake of tougher U S  sanctions and years of mismanagement  As a result of political and economic unrest in Venezuela  PetroChina   NYSE PTR   has suspended direct purchase of crude oil from the South American nation  Amid severe sanctions  the Chinese energy giant cancelled loading plans of 5 million barrels of Venezuelan oil this month   Venezuelan Political Crisis Subjects its Oil Industry to Doldrums As we know  during 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis  Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state run oil firm PDSVA in January  in a bid to push out Nicolas Maduro  As part of U S  sanctions  American companies have been restricted to conduct business with Venezuela s PDVSA  However  the United States granted six month waivers to Chevron   NYSE CVX    and major oilfield firms including Halliburton   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger   NYSE SLB    Weatherford and Baker Hughes  allowing the companies to conduct transactions with PDSVA   In August  Trump ramped up the sanctions  in turn freezing all Venezuelan government assets in the United States  Markedly  this placed Venezuela on par with countries like North Korea  Syria  Cuba and Iran  which are also under such severe U S  sanctions  The latest move by Trump threatens to impose sanctions on any company or individual that provides support to Maduro  This has put many foreign companies carrying out business with PDVSA at risk   The severe U S  sanctions are aimed at further isolating the Nicolas Maduro regime  Despite imposing new curbs on Venezuela to oust Maduro  the Trump administration granted a three month extension to U S  major Chevron last month to continue its operations in Venezuela till late October  Had Trump not extended the license  it would certainly have triggered huge losses for Chevron  which has spent billions in the Venezuelan business  Years of mismanagement  under investment and alleged government corruption have also resulted in deterioration of Venezuela s energy industry  With the country tethering on the verge of political and economic collapse  oil output has dwindled more than 50  since 2016  In fact  Venezuela s oil production plunged to a 30 year low  prior to enforcement of the U S  sanctions  According to OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report  Venezuelan oil production declined 32 000 barrels per day  bpd  in July  totaling 742 000 bpd  Restrictive financial sanctions imposed by the United States on the Maduro regime and periodic power blackouts throughout the country have further strangulated the Latin American nation s struggling energy sector   China s Loyalty Toward Venezuela at Risk Due to Sanctions Threat China has been a loyal supporter of the Venezuelan government  as the former considers the oil rich nation as a chief trading partner and geopolitical ally  China has loaned Venezuela  50 billion over the past decade  Notably  China became the largest export destination for Venezuelan oil  post U S  sanctions against PDVSA  Oil exports have been a major source of revenues for Venezuela  which bankrolls the Maduro regime  China imported around 339 000 barrels of oil per day this year from the crisis struck country  with bulk of the commodity coming in through PetroChina  However  the company is now looking for reducing the risk of U S  sanctions by shunning Venezuelan oil for the first time in more than a decade  In light of the political unrest engulfing the nation  we believe this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s latest decision is a well timed one  You can see  Wrapping Up PetroChina s backing out of three Venezuelan oil shipments is a major setback for the strife torn nation  which has failed to attract another buyer yet  The company has also been contemplating to dump PDVSA as a partner in a mega oil refinery project in China  Well  these moves suggest that PetroChina is distancing itself from the embattled nation  Now  whether the energy giant will completely withdraw from Venezuela is a wait and watch story   Without China s support  Venezuela may not be left with many options and the nation s crisis is likely to exacerbate   The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-petrochina-pull-out-of-venezuela-amid-us-sanctions-200456342,200456342

36087,257602,SLB,Schlumberger Unloaded Its PDVSA IOUs Just Before U S  Sanctions,news," Bloomberg     With Venezuela s economy in ruins  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  Ltd  moved at the end of last year to sell promissory notes representing  700 million in bills owed by state oil giant PDVSA  just in the nick of time to avoid sanctions that would have complicated the deal 
The world s largest provider of oilfield services transferred the notes    essentially IOUs    to an unidentified buyer in the fourth quarter of 2018 after writing down their worth to about one fifth of the face value  according to a regulatory filing  In January  the U S  tightened sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA that severely limited transactions in their debt 
Joao Felix  a spokesman at Schlumberger  declined to comment on the deal beyond what was in the annual filing  He said in an email Friday that the company s operations in Venezuela are continuing as normal 
Schlumberger s promissory notes are one of the latest examples of illiquid Venezuelan assets to switch hands as some firms seek to unwind their exposure to the South American nation  Distressed debt investors have pounced on the beaten down securities amid speculation an eventual restructuring will hand them a windfall  Court documents link Connecticut based hedge fund Contrarian Capital Management to a lawsuit against PDVSA for  182 million of unpaid loans to  General Electric   NYSE GE  Capital  and Dresser Rand Co   which makes equipment for oil and gas production  has sued PDVSA for  132 3 million  claiming it defaulted on a 2017 loan 
Schlumberger  based in Houston and Paris  is among a handful of oil firms granted licenses by the U S  Treasury Department to continue operating in Venezuela through July 27  In 2017  when PDVSA was struggling to meet payments for suppliers  Schlumberger accepted the promissory notes with a three year term bearing an annual interest rate of 6 5 percent

The oilfield service giant recorded total revenues of  8 269 million  almost the same as the year ago quarter figure  The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 115 million 
Contributions from drilling operations in the international markets aided the quarterly results  Higher wireline and testing services in Russia and Central Asia as well as the United Kingdom and Continental Europe were also the positive factors  These were partially offset by soft prices of hydraulic fracturing 
Schlumberger is the first major company in the oilfield service space to release Q2 numbers  Two other key oilfield service firms  Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   and Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE    are scheduled to report results on Jul 22 and Jul 31  respectively 
Segmental Performance
Reservoir Characterization and Drilling segments saw a year over year increase in revenues while the Production and Cameron units reported a decline 
Increased Wireline and Testing activities in Russia   Central Asia  United Kingdom   Continental Europe and Saudi Arabia   Bahrain  which were backed by rising exploration operations in offshore plays  aided the Reservoir Characterization segment 
Significant contributions from profitable international business boosted the company s Drilling unit  This was partially negated by a drop in activities in North American shale plays 
Soft prices for hydraulic fracturing hurt the Production segment  The results were partly made up for by higher activities associated to Well Services in the international market 
Revenues at the Reservoir Characterization unit totaled  1 649 million  marginally higher year over year  Pre tax operating income  however  declined 7  to  326 million from  350 million in second quarter 2018 
Revenues at the Drilling unit rose 8  year over year to  2 421 million  Pre tax operating income was  300 million  up 4  year over year 
Revenues at the Production segment declined 5  from the year earlier quarter to  3 077 million  Moreover  pre tax operating income fell 26  year over year to  235 million 
Revenues at the Cameron segment amounted to  1 237 million  down 4  year over year  Pre tax operating income dropped 6  from the prior year quarter to  156 million 
Financials
As of Jun 30  2019  the company had approximately  2 348 million in cash and short term investments plus  16 978 million in long term debt  This represents a debt to capitalization ratio of 32   Through the June quarter  2 5 million stocks were repurchased by the oilfield services player  
Outlook
With the increase in count for drilling rigs in international resources  Schlumberger reaffirmed its projection at 7 to 8  higher international spending by upstream energy firms  However  explorers are facing constant investor pressure for higher returns instead of production growth  The headwinds are likely to lower investments by explorers and producers in the land market of North America by 10  through 2019  reaffirmed the world s largest oilfield service firm

Schlumberger shares have added about 7 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Schlumberger 
While Schlumberger has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Management s Outlook
The world s biggest provider of hydraulic fracking noted that United States land activity levels in the second quarter improved sequentially  particularly in the pressure pumping business  while drilling and artificial lift activity picked up too  Halliburton did encounter lower pressure pumping activity in Canada and a fall in drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico but the company continues to successfully ride the changing market dynamics through excellent execution and management of the controllable factors 
Meanwhile  Halliburton is witnessing broad based  steady recovery in its international business  The company anticipates its international revenue to grow at a high single digit rate in 2019  with further improvement next year  Importantly  Halliburton believes it has got the scale and required technology portfolio to take advantage of this growth trend 
Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment was  470 million  29 7  below the year ago level of  669 million  The division s performance was affected by decline in Latin America stimulation services 
However  the segment operating income bettered our consensus estimate of  430 million  The outperformance was largely the result of strong domestic artificial lift activity  increased cementing job and completion tool sales outside North America  higher stimulation activity in North America and Middle East Asia  and increased pipeline services throughout Europe Africa CIS 
Meanwhile  Drilling and Evaluation unit profit fell from  191 million in the second quarter of 2018 to  145 million in the corresponding period of 2019  The segment income was also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  148 million 
The underperformance was on account of lower drilling fluids activity in Latin America and North America  together with decline in software sales  These setbacks were partly offset by stronger project management activity in Middle East Asia  improved wireline activity globally and increase in North America  Latin America and Europe Africa CIS drilling activity   
Balance Sheet
Halliburton s capital expenditure in the second quarter was  408 million  As of Jun 30  2019  the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company had approximately  1 2 billion in cash cash equivalents and  10 3 billion in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 52

36104,257619,SLB,Top Stock Reports For Microsoft  JPMorgan   Wells Fargo ,opinion,"Tuesday  July 23  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Microsoft s shares have gained  29  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 s  gain of  4 1  during the same period  Microsoft reported stellar fourth quarter results  Both top and bottom lines increased year over year  Robust execution and better than expected demand from customers for hybrid cloud offerings drove quarterly results  
Moreover  strong Commercial business positively impacted top and bottom line  The Zacks analyst thinks Microsoft is benefiting from a growing user base for several of its applications like Office 365 commercial  Dynamics  Outlook mobile and Teams  Further  acquisitions like PlayFab and GitHub expand Microsoft s TAM and penetration  
Also  Microsoft s collaboration with AT T  NYSE T  bodes well  The company is consistently integrating the cloud capabilities of Azure into its gaming segment which is yet another positive  However  stiff competition remains a concern 
 You can   
Shares of JPMorgan have gained  1 7  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s decline of  0 2   It has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  The bank s second quarter 2019 results depict decent loan growth and lower credit costs  while dismal trading and investment banking performance was on the downside  
The Zacks analyst thinks improving loan balance  strong balance sheet  branch openings in new regions  focus on strengthening credit card business and the deal to acquire InstaMed will support the bank s financials  However  weak mortgage banking performance  mainly due to lower origination volume and rise in competition  is a concern  
The company s excessive dependence on capital markets revenues is another major concern  These concerns are expected to hamper fee revenue growth to some extent 
 You can   
Wells Fargo s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the past six months   6 1  vs   3 5    Its earnings surprise history is impressive  with results surpassing expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  Second quarter results reflect fee income growth and lower costs  partially offset by higher provisions  
The Zacks analyst thinks restructuring activities and higher interest income  aided by loan growth  are a tailwind  Further  reinvestment in businesses to enhance compliance and risk management capability bodes well  However  Wells Fargo has been slapped with several sanctions  including a cap on asset growth by the Fed  
These restrictions will remain in force given the CFPB s dissatisfaction with the bank s progress on fixing risk management issues  Also  rising expenses due to pending litigation issues and hike in personnel costs curb bottom line expansion

36105,257620,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Schlumberger   Halliburton Report Q2 Earnings,opinion,It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices settled sharply lower On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   and Halliburton   NYSE HAL   reported second quarter earnings  While the North America business environment remains challenging  both companies expect further uptick in international drilling activity  confirming the region s broad based recovery Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures slumped 7 6  to close at  55 63 per barrel  while natural gas prices dropped 8 2  for the week to finish at  2 251 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark logged its lowest settlement level since Jun 19  after the U S  government reported a smaller than expected decline in oil stockpiles and swelling fuel inventories   all troubling signs of oil demand  Prices also remained under pressure from the return of some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico  as companies began to recover from Hurricane Barry Natural gas prices plunged too  pressured by healthy supply and a bearish near term weather forecast that signals weak power sector demand for the fuel Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1   Schlumberger reported second quarter 2019 earnings of 35 cents per share  excluding charges and credits   in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The bottom line  however  declined from 43 cents a year ago Contributions from drilling operations in the international markets aided the quarterly results  Higher wireline and testing services in Russia and Central Asia as well as the United Kingdom and Continental Europe were also the positive factors  These were partially offset by soft prices of hydraulic fracturing With the increase in count for drilling rigs in international resources  Schlumberger reaffirmed its projection at 7  to 8  higher international spending by upstream energy firms  However  explorers are facing constant investor pressure for higher returns instead of production growth  The headwinds are likely to lower investments by explorers and producers in the land market of North America by 10  through 2019  reaffirmed the world s largest oilfield service firm   Read more  2    Smaller rival Halliburton reported higher than expected second quarter profit on robust international activity  The company saw its adjusted net income  excluding impairments and other charges  come in at 35 cents per share  outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents  However  the bottom line was below the adjusted earnings of 58 cents in the year earlier quarter on weakness in the North American market The world s biggest provider of hydraulic fracking noted that United States land activity levels in the second quarter improved sequentially  particularly in the pressure pumping business  while drilling and artificial lift activity picked up too  Halliburton did encounter lower pressure pumping activity in Canada and a fall in drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico but the company continues to successfully ride the changing market dynamics through excellent execution and management of the controllable factors Meanwhile  Halliburton is witnessing broad based  steady recovery in its international business  The company anticipates its international revenue to grow at a high single digit rate in 2019  with further improvement next year  Importantly  Halliburton believes it has got the scale and required technology portfolio to take advantage of this growth trend   Read more  3    Kinder Morgan Inc    NYSE KMI   posted second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  the bottom line improved from the year ago quarter s 21 cents The lower than expected results were owing to reduced contribution from the KM Crude   Condensate Pipeline and lower terminal volumes  This was offset partially by higher earnings from the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  midstream energy player s natural gas pipelines You can see  The company s second quarter distributable cash flow increased to  1 128 million from  1 117 million a year ago  The company had a project backlog of  5 7 billion for the June quarter  Kinder Morgan reaffirms 2019 dividend at  1 00 per common share  Moreover  the company maintains adjusted EBITDA and DCF for 2019 at  7 8 billion and  5 billion  respectively  However  Kinder Morgan added that its adjusted EBITDA for 2019 could be marginally below budget   Read more  4    Range Resources   NYSE RRC   recently announced its decision to divest 2  overriding royalty interests in Appalachia assets  The company will likely receive a gross amount of  600 million for the resources  spread across 350 000 net acres in the southwest of the basin Range Resources expects the deal  which involves two separate transactions  to close by the end of July  The last time the company had announced a royalty sale in the Appalachian was in October 2018  when the upstream energy firm sold a 1  overriding royalty interest in the basin for  300 million of gross proceeds The latest properties that the company has agreed to sell have produced a total of 1 9 billion cubic feet equivalent per day through the March quarter of 2019  Moreover  the company announced that it will get a total of  34 million from the closure of the divesture of several non producing properties in Pennsylvania   Read more  5    SM Energy Company   NYSE SM    recently announced second quarter 2019 total production of 136 5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBoe d   higher than the year ago period s 115 2 MBoe d  backed by better than expected performance from the Permian Basin and South Texas region  Moreover  production increased 16  sequentially  Of the total production in the June quarter  44  is expected to be oil The better than expected performance so far has enabled the company to boost its full year 2019 production guidance to the range of 129 131 MBoe d  the midpoint of which is higher than the previous guidance of 124 4 132 6 MBoe d  The revised guidance is much higher than the 2018 figure of 120 3 MBoe d In the second quarter  the company incurred a cost of  269 million related to oil and gas activities  Total capital expenditure for the quarter is estimated at  261 million  below the earlier guided level and first quarter s realized amount of  316 million  For full year 2019  it

36107,257622,SLB,AOTH Metals And Company Roundup,opinion,"Major investments in the hundreds of millions and billions by some of the world s largest EV automakers and battery cos give us a good look at what could be a future electric vehicle ecosystem  where batteries are made in the United States possibly even from metals mined in America   like lithium  nickel  cobalt and graphite   then sold to EV makers in the US   likely the southeastern US anchored by SK Innovation s huge battery plant being built in Georgia 
The announcement a few weeks ago by Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the world s largest oilfield services firm  that the USD 50 5 billion market cap company has invested  2 million for Pure Energy s  C PE  lithium brine project in the Clayton Valley  appears to support this thesis

Elon Musk  Tesla s CEO  recently talked about plans to ramp up car production and to start mass producing electric pick ups and electric Class 8 semi trucks by the end of 2020  Musk added these plans are dependent on Tesla being able to manufacture a lot more lithium ion battery cells  In fact the luxury car maker may even 
Tesla skeptics may scoff  but the company apparently is zipping around its competition including the 400 odd electric vehicle manufacturers in China  A  states that Tesla s vehicles accounted for 22  of global EV capacity in May  against 18  in May  2018  The next best EV maker was China s BYD  backed by Warren Buffett  at 4  capacity  
Tesla s head of minerals procurement has said the company expects global shortages of lithium  copper and nickel in the near future

Gold
A few weeks ago we wrote that this is   At the time  our reasons for being bullish on the  barbarous relic  were mostly to do with negative economic news coming out of the United States  including a bond yield curve inversion  signaling a recession is on its way  
Now it seems every day the gold price breaks a new record   the latest being on Friday  when gold breached a six year high of  1 452 60 oz  Gold s current movement is not so much related to economic malaise  but rather  is being judged against bond yields and what the Federal Reserve is going to do next  




The metal used mostly for jewelry and investments is up a rollicking 11   year to date  
Until June the Fed s party line was to keep increasing interest rates as long as the economy was hitting the right employment and inflation targets  When prices increased slower than expected  the Fed took a pause  At its last meeting  Fed Chair Jerome Powell strongly hinted that a rate cut   the first in a decade   was coming  which lit a fire under the gold price  Gold investors love low interest rates because that could weaken the dollar  thereby pushing up commodity prices and making dollar priced investments like gold attractive  The idea of monetary easing causing inflation also appeals to gold investors  since the precious metal is known to hold its value over time versus depreciating fiat  paper  currencies 
The gold price is also being lifted by very low and in some countries  negative interest rates on sovereign debt  If investors have to effectively pay for lending money to borrowers  gold is seen as a better investment  Finally  the price is moving up in response to geopolitical tensions   among them  reports of an Iranian drone being shot down by an American warship  
As for what happens next  all eyes are on the next Fed meeting July 31

Silver
Last week  ruminating about tools we might use to predict what direction gold is going  we decided to take a look at gold ratios  including the gold silver ratio  
The gold silver ratio is the amount of silver one can buy with an ounce of gold  Simply divide the current gold price by the price of silver  to find the ratio  
 by breaking through the 90 ounce mark   meaning it took 93 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold  The higher the number  the more undervalued is silver or  to put it another way  the farther gold is pulling away from silver  valued in dollars per ounce  
Given then that silver was so undervalued  one might speculate that now would be a good time to buy under valued silver  Well low and behold  that is exactly what s happened  
The chart below shows a major outbreak for  the devil s metal   characterized for its volatility   In the last two weeks  silver has shot up from  14 92 oz on July 5  to a close of  16 12 on Friday   a gain of 8  




 
 that at  16 10  the gold silver ratio was down about five points to 88  the lowest in two months  The average ratio over the past 20 years is around 65  
While gold was retreating from Thursday s six year high  silver was taking off  On Friday the precious metal hit a 13 month high of  16 62  prompting a colorful commentary from Ross Norman of Sharps Pixley  London s largest bullion broker  
Rather like the vapours emanating from the Temple of Apollo at the oracle in ancient Delphi  silver s price action now portends well for gold 
The gold silver ratio has fallen from 95 to 87 and if you like gold you should positively love silver as there is scope for a further correction

At the beginning of January we at Ahead of the Herd made a bold prediction  that   Considering the poor 2018 that most metals had  especially industrial metals dragged down by uncertainty over China US tariffs and tariff threats   to stick our necks out for metals could have meant the guillotine  
We pinned our thesis on four main points  1  Commodities are cyclical  and the timing is right to be invested  2  The US dollar is likely to fall or be range bound during 2019  3  A looser monetary policy by the Federal Reserve would weigh on the dollar and be good for commodities  4  The need for infrastructure spending is not going to let up  Despite the Chinese economy weakening  Beijing will continue to demand iron ore and base metals for its Belt and Road Initiative and other ambitious megaprojects  India and other developing nations are also in the mix 
A key message in our article was the global shift towards the electrification of the transportation system  cars  trucks  buses  trains  involves moving from an oil based economy to one grounded on electric vehicles and sources of energy that emit fewer to no greenhouse gas emissions 
The electrification trend calls for a slew of battery metals   lithium  graphite  nickel and cobalt   along with tonnes of rare earths and copper 
The first three are crucial to this global transportation shift  because they all go into electric vehicles  Lithium is used in the different configurations of EV batteries  eg  NCA   nickel cobalt aluminum  NMC   nickel manganese cobalt  where lithium is the dominant metal in the battery 
Copper has under performed this year  but we see this as a blip in a long term trend that supports prices due to a pending supply shortage  Output at some major mines  eg  Escondida  Las Bambas  is falling  as are ore grades  
We continue to believe in gold because a  it s smart to have gold as a portion of your portfolio  most managers say 10  minimum   b  low global growth has pushed many central banks to cut interest rates and stimulate their economies with bond buying  a very bullish signal for the gold price  c  appetite for gold has soared due to negative yields and slowing economic growth  and d  now is an  or gold stocks  is at a record high as some countries   
Silver is also on our radar due mostly to the  falling  presaging an upside for the white metal  
It turns out our contrarian position on commodities was forward thinking and bang on  A half year into 2019  we see major commodities indices up significantly  
The S P GSCI Commodity Indexed Trust  NYSEArca GSG  had one of its best performing half years  gaining 13  as of June 30  Crude oil was the top performing commodity in H1  followed by palladium     
After a couple of down months  seven of 10 Monthly Metal Indices  MMI  increased for July    The only index to fall was steel  due to weak US steel prices  with aluminum and construction MMIs trading flat

Palladium




MetalMiner also notes the spread between palladium and platinum prices widened this past month  As of July 19  palladium closed at  1 505 50 an ounce versus  843 50 oz for platinum  Readers will notice that s higher than the gold price which is trading around  1 425 oz  In January palladium raced past gold for the first time since 2002  Twice this year it s broken the  1 600 an ounce mark  
Palladium is surging because of supply challenges and tougher emissions standards revving up demand for gas powered vehicles  which use palladium in their catalytic converters  and hybrid vehicles 
By comparison platinum use is falling because the precious metal is used in the autocatalysts of on the way out polluting diesel vehicles 
A  that The auto industry has all but stopped developing next generation combustion engines as limited resources are directed towards building electric and self driving cars  
Concerns over air pollution led the EU to set a target of cutting emissions by at least 40  by 2030  from 1990 levels  China  whose major cities are often blanketed with thick air pollution  has also begun to implement tougher vehicle emissions standards  The country is targeting a reduction of between 26 and 28  of emissions from 2005 levels by 2030  
According to Norilsk Nickel  which controls 40  of the world s palladium production  palladium demand is intensifying   that combined palladium use in hybrids  HEVs  and plug in hybrids  PHEVs  next year will be nearly triple that of 2016  JP Morgan   Chase is equally bullish on the precious metal    the investment bank predicts by 2025  hybrids will represent over 25 million vehicles  close to a quarter of all vehicle sales  compared to just 3  in 2016  
Not only has demand bounced up  palladium is also facing constricted supply  2018 was the seventh year in a row that palladium was in deficit because of strong vehicle sales  The way things are going  2019 will be the eighth year  
According to a report from Sprott Asset Management   Supply shortages continue to support palladium s performance  with strong multi year growth in palladium demand now straining a fixed supply    Citigroup   NYSE C  said in December that production is expected to trail consumption by 545 000 ounces this year  
Indeed  there is limited scope for producers to increase supply  in the near term 
South African palladium is a by product of platinum mining and palladium from Russia is a by product of nickel  Between them  the two countries control 75  of the palladium market 
Safehaven notes that labor tensions are heating up in South Africa  with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union  AMCU   calling for a 48  rise in the minimum wage  
Platinum mining in South Africa is frequently interrupted by labour unrest  The country s platinum miners are under constant pressure to contain costs  because their mines are some of the deepest and most labor intensive in the world  High temperatures are also a serious issue  Platinum is being mined in reefs up to two kilometers deep  where virgin rock temperatures have been measured at 70 degrees C  
In 2014 workers at the country s three major producers   Lonmin   Anglo American   LON AAL  Platinum and Impala Platinum   downed tools for five months demanding that wages be doubled  The strike was the longest and most expensive in South African history  shutting down about 40  of the world s platinum production

Zinc
In 2017 zinc enjoyed a spectacular run from  1 19 a pound to  1 61 within only six months   35    Prices got a nice uplift from mine closures and an expected long term structural supply deficit  The metal s hot hand had many juniors roaming around with boots on the ground trying to find the next zinc deposit 
The zinc market was in deficit in 2018  According to the USGS  despite new zinc mines opening in Australia and Cuba in 2017  and increased production at the Antamina mine in Peru  supply failed to keep up with consumption  Some very large zinc mines have been depleted and shut down in recent years  with not enough new mine supply to take their place 
MMG s shuttered Century mine for example used to supply 4  of the world s zinc  Between the shutdown of the Lisheen mine in Ireland  Century  and Glencore s Brunswick and Perseverance mines in Canada  over a million tonnes was ripped from global zinc production 
The closed mines represent an estimated 10 to 15  of the zinc market  On the flip side  there have been few discoveries or big zinc projects planned  This is setting the zinc market up for a supply shortage 
The International Lead and Zinc Study Group predicts the zinc market will again be in a  in 2019 
Tighter environmental restrictions in China are lessening the amount smelters can produce 
Antaike  a Chinese metals research firm  estimates national production of refined zinc in 2018 fell to just 4 53 million tonnes  the sharpest downturn since 2013  
The result has been a record amount of zinc imported into the world s largest metals consumer  715 355 tonnes of refined zinc in 2018  The high demand in China has also pulled a lot of zinc out of LME warehouses 




In February zinc inventories fell to the point where there was less than two days worth of global consumption locked in London Metal Exchange warehouses  The paucity of the metal used to prevent rusting caused prices to spike to the highest they ve been since last June 
Zinc prices were US 2 845 a tonne or  1 29 a pound  after data showed LME warehouses held just over 58 000 tonnes  Levels have since increased to 80 000 tonnes but are a long way off the 250 000t stockpiled a year ago  According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group  there was a deficit of 123 000 tonnes for the first five months of this year

Once mined almost exclusively for its use in stainless steel  the industrial metal has enjoyed something of a rebirth since battery makers started using it in electric vehicles  According to   which tracks battery metals  EV manufacturers deployed 57  more nickel in EV batteries this past May  versus May 2018   the inroads nickel have been making are due mainly to an industry shift towards  NCM 811  batteries which require over 50 kg of nickel   NCM 111 batteries have one part each nickel  cobalt and manganese   The switch to NCM 811 could outpace the amount of nickel used for EVs  compared to stainless steel  adding up to 900 000 tonnes annually  by 2030  one analyst said   
On the supply side  solid stainless steel production  a supply deficit and record low warehouse inventories are contributing to the bullish case for nickel  Nickel stocks in LME warehouses have fallen to a 6 5 month low  from 450 000 tonnes in 2016 to just 147 942 tonnes  MetalMiner reports  
Another recent supply factor concerns Indonesia  a major nickel producer  The country this week re instated a ban on ore exports  starting in 2022  to encourage the building of domestic smelters 




 




Nickel demanded for EV batteries and stainless steel  plus tight supply has resulted in a nickel price spike  Two weeks of technical and speculative buying hiked the metal to  15 115 a tonne on Thursday  the highest in over a year  and 20  better than two weeks ago  Year to date  nickel has been the star of the industrial metals complex  surging an impressive 37

Cobalt
  standard grade cobalt prices started the year at  26 a pound but have fallen in the first quarter  to  14 per pound in March  That s a fair distance from the  40 lb prices reached in April of 2018 
However  Roskill observes that  some restocking is taking place  which should push cobalt prices back up after reaching a bottom of  14 lb in March  The metals consultancy expects prices to recover in 2019 
Roskill attributed the price slide to oversupply  especially of cobalt hydroxide  clashing with sluggish demand  Many buyers have stayed on the sidelines  preferring to buy on the spot market  A lot of cobalt that was not committed to long term contracts last year added to the glut  Roskill explained  Still  DRC cobalt production expanded by 44  in 2018 to 106 439 tonnes  The African nation produces between 60 and 75  of world supply  
 that several years of rising cobalt prices  brought about a rush to mine as much cobalt as possible and sell it to the Chinese   noting that China accounts for two thirds of the world s lithium ion megafactory capacity  The publication also argues that artisanal mining in DRC was a factor in over production 
But  a very recent  reports that the market expects to see a big drop in artisanal cobalt output this year  due to prices falling  The hard scrabble miners who use rudimentary digging tools  are switching to copper instead  
Another reason for the anticipated 70  decline in artisanal output  is less miners  says Bloomberg  citing cobalt specialists at Darton Commodities and Roskill 
The workforce at Kaumbu s cooperative has halved this year to around 500 and the group is only producing 2 000 tons of ore a month  15  of which is cobalt  compared with 4 000 tons of cobalt ore and 1 000 tons of copper a year ago 
Artisanal production will retreat to levels seen in 2013 to 2016 before the boom  said Jack Bedder  a cobalt expert and director at Roskill Information Services 
The Mutoshi Cobalt artisanal project has shed about 2 800 of its 4 100 authorized diggers this year 
As lack of artisanal supply is absorbed by the market resulting in higher prices  though  driven by explosive demand for cobalt used in EV batteries  more workers should return  
 Artisanal mining will continue to be the swing producer   Bloomberg quotes George Heppel  senior analyst at CRU Group

Copper
There is no getting around the fact that the copper market is experiencing some weakness  However  we see the current price slippage as a blip in what the evidence points to as a growing and powerful bull market for copper 
As we wrote in   copper mine production is expected to increase for the next year or so  then drop off significantly  By 2035  without major new mines up and running to replace the ore that is being depleted from existing copper mines  we are looking at a 15 million tonne supply deficit by 2035  Four to six million tonnes of added capacity are needed by 2025  Lower ore grades are also part of the waning supply picture     highlighting the urgent need for grassroots exploration to arrest the trend 
One country that may be able to help fill the supply gap is Colombia  Better known for coal and gold than copper  Colombia is   The country only has one producing copper mine  in the Choco department of northwest Colombia  Choco is also the region the Andean Copper Belt runs through  The belt hugs the South American coastline all the way from Chile in the south to Central America in the north  and hosts some of the largest copper porphyry deposits in the world 
For now though  copper output is falling  Exports from Chile s Escondida  the world s second largest copper mine  are expected to   That s a dramatic fall from 1 8 million tonnes in 2018 to just 200 000 in 2019  The mine is expected to take until 2022 to re gain full production  I find it hard to believe they will produce the same tonnage from underground as open pit 
A processing problem at BHP s Olympic Dam copper  gold and uranium mine ate into the company s second half production numbers  Problems in Zambia  Africa s second largest copper producer  are putting a big question mark beside the country s output  First Quantum Minerals has reacted to a planned tax hike on operators by  Barrick is reportedly   
Another example of copper output declining is an expected delay at Mongolia s Oyu Tolgoi mine going underground  Difficult ground conditions are cited as the reason the expansion could be delayed up to 30 months  
Globally  MINING com reported a 2 4  production fall in February  with Chile and Peru hit the hardest  at a respective 7 1  and 5 1  reduction  year on year 
According to the   world copper mine production shrunk from 1 797 million tonnes in November 2018  to 1 515Mt in February 2019  an 18 6  decrease 
Meanwhile the anticipation of lower interest rates  causing the dollar to fall with them  is currently helping the copper price  The red metal hit a two month high on Friday  with LME copper finishing up 1 4  at  6 065 per tonne  the best performance since May 10  
Three of the world s largest investment banks   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   Citi and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   have all placed bullish bets on copper this year  Morgan Stanley expects the price to rocket 14  as supply tightens  Citi is predicting a demand surge from China in the second half  as construction completions requiring copper catch up with housing starts

Lithium
Arguably  lithium is the most important metal for electrification  As the main ingredient in lithium ion batteries that drive EVs  a steady supply of lithium for battery makers and auto manufacturers is going to be crucial 
Automobile manufacturers are increasingly investing in EV models  Just about all car makers are incorporating EVs into their production mix  and they are calling for public charging infrastructure to accommodate them 
Volvo has banned the internal combustion engine  stating that this year  all new models will be electrics or hybrids  Nissan  JLR  Daimler  BMW  Geely and BYD have made public commitments to EVs 
In North America a very small percentage of the auto market is electric  but elsewhere governments have made deeper commitments  Norway  the Netherlands  France  Germany  UK  China and India have all indicated they will ban cars running on fossil fuels 
Bloomberg says EV sales are expected to increase from 1 1  of the total auto market in 2017  by a factor of 10 by 2025  27X by 2030 and 50X by 2040  JP Morgan is forecasting electric cars to be 35  of the global market by 2025 and 48  by 2030 
All these EVs will need lithium ion batteries containing lithium  graphite  nickel and cobalt  plus other mined metals that go into EVs  like copper 
Will there be enough  According to  in February 2019  75  more lithium carbonate was deployed for batteries in electric and hybrid passenger vehicles compared to February  2018 
We know that the lithium market  long term  is likely to be in deficit as troubles ramping up production meet a mounting wall of demand 
For more on this read 
We also know that China produces roughly two thirds of the world s lithium ion batteries and controls most of its processing facilities  This gives China tremendous clout should it decide to deprive the United States of lithium batteries or raw materials  just as the US is planning a mine to EV battery supply chain 
But North America has a problem  There is only one producing lithium mine  Silver Peak  run by Albemarle  the world s largest lithium producer  The grades at Silver Peak are rumored to be declining  There are a number of companies exploring for the element in and around Nevada s Clayton Valley  including AOTH s lithium junior pick  Cypress Development Corp   TSX V CYP   but none has yet advanced to the mine permitting stage  The US is about 70  dependent on foreign suppliers for its lithium  Lithium products from Albemarle s Silver Peak lithium brine operation in Nevada are sent to its processing plant in North Carolina  This material is then loaded on ships and sent to Asian battery manufacturers  which sell the batteries to automakers 
There is currently no  mine to battery  supply chain in North America  but steps are being taken to address our lithium dependence  The big question is  where are all the North American auto plants  once they get re tooled for EVs  going to get their batteries from  
IHT Markit thinks electric vehicle sales in the US will smash 1 28 million units by 2026  a whopping 540  increase from the 200 000 sold in 2017  or a CAGR of 30 4  ",2019-07-29,Richard Mills,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aoth-metals-and-company-roundup-200446225,200446225

36151,257666,SLB,U S  Energy Independence Race Producing Tons Of Oil  Not So Much Profits,opinion,"Strong demand driving the rise in oil prices 
PRICE Futures Group s Phil Flynn on the outlook for oil prices 
The United States Opens a New Window   is currently producing over a million barrels a day more of oil Opens a New Window   than it was last year at this time  according to the EIA  making it look like U S  energy Opens a New Window   independence is within our grasp 
That being the case  one would think this must be the best of times for U S  oil producers and oil service companies  Instead  for many of them it is the worst of times as the industry struggles  That hit home this week when Weatherford International PLC Opens a New Window    a Swiss based oil field services company  filed for bankruptcy protection after its bondholders approved a restructuring agreement that will reduce its total debt by about 70 percent 
This bankruptcy  the biggest in the shale patch in years  should be a warning sign to an oil and world market that has been taking the incredible achievements in U S  oil production for granted  Oh sure  U S  shale producers have been prolific with oil production  but not so much with actually making profits 
The wildcatting ways and optimism that brought on the shale revolution also led to overproduction and companies taking on way too much debt  According to the New York Times  at least six energy firms have gone bankrupt this year  Over the last 4 years the number is about 175 firms in the United States and Canada  with debts totaling almost  100 billion in bankruptcy protection 
It is mainly because they are not making money  Over the last 10 years  40 of the largest independent oil and gas producers collectively spent roughly  200 billion more than they took in from operations  according to the Wall Street Journal 
This has forced a cutback in spending and has caused pain to all sectors of the industry  especially oil services  Marquee names like Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  Ltd  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co  have seen their stock prices take a hit 

And while this cost cutting is mandatory for these producers to stay in business  it also means that U S  oil production growth could stall out and already  we are seeing the rate of oil production growth decline 
In the meantime  the reality is that the market is probably underestimating demand  Many have been pointing to weakening manufacturing growth as a sign that oil demand will crash  but what we have seen in the recent past is that this coupled with lower interest rates around the globe can change things very quickly

36153,257668,SLB,Earnings Preview  Schlumberger  SLB  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 35 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 6  
Revenues are expected to be  8 12 billion  down 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 81  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger 
For Schlumberger  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 30  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schlumberger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-schlumberger-slb-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200439315,200439315
36154,257669,SLB,What To Expect From Bank Earnings ,opinion,"Bank stocks have done reasonably well lately  contrary to general perception of the group as a laggard and victim of the dovish Fed outlook  The chart below shows the year to date stock market performance of the Zacks Major Banks industry relative to the S P 500 index and the Zacks Finance sector 
 
 
 
 
 
The blue line in the chart represents the Zacks Major Banks industry  which includes Citigroup  C  that reports on Monday July 15th and JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  that report on Tuesday July 16th  The recent most catalyst for the group turned out to be the late June completion of the Fed s  stress test   officially called Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR  that allowed these players to return ever increasing amounts to shareholders through cash dividends and buybacks 
The Dodd Frank legislation in the wake of the 2008 crisis made banks better capitalized and more stringently regulated  The goal was to make this important part of the economy safer and less prone to riskier behavior  Banks have become boring as a result  almost like utilities  with many of the major industry players promising juicy dividend yields  JPMorgan currently yields 3 2   
The group s earnings performance has been good  not great  but good  On most key operating metrics  bank performance was been very strong in recent quarters and we will most likely see a repeat performance this earnings season as well 
Key parts of the market s worry list for banks include the interest rate backdrop and its related implications for the broader economy  With the current U S  economic expansion on the verge of becoming the longest in history  many in the market justifiably worry about the duration and stability of the economy s growth trajectory 
Keep in mind that banks are cyclical businesses engaged in lending and other activities like investment banking  money management  and trading that are always at the mercy of the economic cycle  Banks not only experience low demand for its services when the economic cycle turns down  but the quality of its existing assets  its loan portfolio  also goes down as its customers  credit profiles weaken 
The Fed s recent dovish tilt is aimed at forestalling worries about trade and global growth from bleeding into business and market sentiment  The momentum in stock and other asset prices suggests that it is working  even though it is prompting cuts to earnings estimates for  banks 
What Are Banks Expected to Earn 
Total Q2 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry that includes Citi  JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and other major industry players are expected to be down  5 4  from the same period last year on  0 2  higher revenues  This would follow the  2  earnings growth on  0 8  higher revenues for the group in Q1 
The table below shows Q2 expectations for the constituent industries of the Finance sector  contrasted with what was reported in Q1 and what is expected for Q3  Please note that the Major Banks industry represents the biggest slice of the Finance sector  accounting for almost 45  of the sector s total earnings 
 
 
 
 
The decline is primarily a function of tough comparisons  with the year earlier tally reflecting one time boost from the tax cut legislation 
The chart below puts the Finance sector s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been and where it is expected in the coming periods 
 
 
 
 
Major Earnings Reports This Week
The Q2 earnings season really gets going with Monday s Citigroup report  but the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already with results from 24 S P 500 members  All of these earlier results are from companies for their fiscal quarters ending in May  but those reports get counted as part of the Q2 tally 
As you can see in the chart below of weekly reporting schedule for S P 500 companies  the Q2 reporting cycle front end loaded  with the bulk of the repots coming out in the next three weeks 
 
 
 
 
In all  we have more than 140 companies reporting Q2 results this week  including 57 S P 500 members  While banks and Finance sector companies dominate this week s reporting docket  there is plenty of representation from other sectors as well  with notable bellwethers like Microsoft  MSFT   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   NFLX   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   SLB  also reporting results this week 
The table below shows the notable companies reporting results each day this week 
 
 
 
Overall Q2 Expectations 
For Q2 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be down  3 4  from the same period last year on  3 9  higher revenues  This would follow the  0 2  decline on  4 5  higher revenues in Q1 
The chart below shows Q2 earnings and revenue expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few periods 
 
 
 
The  Earnings Recession  Narrative
With earnings growth expectations for the first quarter of 2019 already in negative territory and estimates for 2019 Q2 moving in that direction as well  there is growing talk of an impending earnings recession 
This is coming at a time when many in the market are worried about the duration of the current economic cycle that is on track to become the longest in the nation s history later this summer  It is this backdrop that has made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications  No doubt  the  R  word has become potent 
So how reasonable are these  earnings recession  fears 
The definition of  recession  is two or more quarters of negative growth  typically GDP growth  The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
To be totally pedantic about it  the recession talk reflects ground reality  as you can see in the chart above  After all  earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative  even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory 
We shouldn t take this recession talk too seriously  however  The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons  In other words  the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1  when earnings received a huge boost from the tax cut legislation  The lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1  the base year for 2019 Q1  boosted profitability through margin expansion  As such  we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019 
The tax cut legislation didn t have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either  as the chart below shows  orange bars  
 
 
 
Q2 Scorecard  as of Friday  July 12th  2019 
For the 23 S P 500 members that have reported Q2 results already  total earnings are down  12 8  from the same period last year on  3 1  higher revenues  with 83 3  beating EPS estimates and 62 5  beating revenue estimates 
It is hard to look for aggregate trends from this small sample of reports  But growth is unsurprisingly on the weak side  but positive EPS surprises appear to be tracking higher at this stage

36158,257673,SLB,Will E P Capex Slowdown Mar Halliburton s  HAL  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is expected to release second quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Monday  Jul 22  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is a profit of 30 cents on revenues of  6 billion In the last reported quarter  the major oilfield service provider  the consensus mark on robust international activity  offsetting pricing pressure in the North American business This Houston  TX based company beat met the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells can continue its winning ways by surpassing earnings estimate this time around  However  our model indicates that the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   might not beat on earnings in the second quarter Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results Factors to Consider This QuarterE P Capital Discipline  Clients are taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Per the new paradigm in the energy sector  a disciplined capital expenditure strategy  resulting in free cash flow  is being prioritized over reckless spending beyond operating cash flows  Consequently  major upstream oil companies are now committed to investor returns rather than adding production by outspending cash flows  This has created an extremely challenging operating environment for the service providers as there is not enough incentive to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity hurts overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for Halliburton s upcoming earnings release Lower Rig Count  Moreover  during the second quarter of 2019  U S  oil rig count decreased by 23  from 816 to 793  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest weakening North American activity in the April June timeframe  Halliburton  with sizable presence in the region  is expected to suffer significantly on this sentiment Permian Takeaway Constraints  By now  it is well documented that logistical constraints in West Texas s Permian  super basin  is forcing operators in the region   especially those without committed pipeline capacity   to slow down their drilling and production activity  impacting demand for oilfield services  In fact  there is a backlog of more than 4 000  in the Permian Basin   indicating a slowdown in well completion activity As a proof of the market challenges  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter Completion and Production adjusted operating income is pegged at  430 million  lower than  669 million reported in the year ago quarter  To put things in perspective  the Completion and Production unit makes up more than three fourths of the oilfield service provider s total operating income What Does Our Model Say Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this

36180,257695,SLB,ABB  Siemens CEOs to visit Saudi Arabia for supplier conference,news,"By John Revill
ZURICH  Reuters    The chief executives of ABB  S ABBN  and  Siemens   DE SIEGn  are traveling to Saudi Arabia to attend a supplier conference  just weeks after they pulled out of an investment event in the country following the death of a journalist 
ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer and Joe Kaeser from Siemens will travel to Dammam for an event organized by Saudi Aramco called In Kingdom Total Value Add  IKTVA  which is due to take place on Monday and Tuesday 
The pair had been among the executives who boycotted an earlier investment conference following the killing of Jamal Khashoggi  a journalist who was critical of the Saudi government 
During his trip Spiesshofer will visit an ABB factory in Dammam  and will also meet representatives from Saudi Aramco  one of ABB s most important customers in the region 
Among other attendees at the IKTVA event are Paal Kibsgaard from Schlumberger  N SLB  and Jeff Miller  CEO of oilfield services company Halliburton  N HAL  
 Alongside being a responsible partner to our customers  we act as a responsible employer to our workforce  Therefore  our CEO will meet some 200 employees at our plant in Dammam during his trip to Saudi Arabia   ABB said in a statement on Sunday 
 In addition  the CEO will also be meeting one of our most important customers in the region in order to foster further dialogue with them  
A person familiar with the situation said Spiesshofer was only taking part in the opening ceremony  and would not be a speaker or a panelist 
Siemens confirmed the attendance of Kaeser at IKTVA  where he is among the speakers  but said the executive would not meet with officials from the Saudi government 
 This is a business trip to the Middle East where Mr  Kaeser will visit customers and business partners in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia among others   a Siemens spokesman said 
 In Saudi Arabia he will visit only our customer  Saudi Aramco  in Dammam  
More than two dozen top officials and executives from the United States and Europe boycotted an investment conference last month over the killing of Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul 
Khashoggi  a critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Washington Post  was killed on Oct  2 when he went there to pick up documents for his planned marriage to a Turkish woman 

The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi  sources have told Reuters  a claim rejected by the Saudi embassy in Washington ",2018-11-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abb-siemens-ceos-to-visit-saudi-arabia-for-supplier-conference-1699291,1699291
36181,257696,SLB,Dismantling the oil industry  rough North Sea waters test new ideas,news,"By Shadia Nasralla LONDON  Reuters    Scottish marine salvage group Ardent is adapting the tanks it used to refloat the Costa Concordia  the cruise ship wrecked off the Italian coast in 2012  to decommission North Sea oil platforms   It is one of several companies trying new ideas to win business in the market for dismantling disused oil platforms  In Britain s aging oil fields alone  the opportunities could be worth up to 17 billion pounds   21 85 billion  before 2025  according to industry body Oil and Gas UK  The ideas could then be deployed to other maturing fields such as in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia   GRAPHIC  Decommissioning spending outlook by region     Ardent says it needs at least two companies to sign up for a project to get off the ground  Well Safe  another company offering a new approach  also needs several operators to commit  So far  Ardent has found it challenging to persuade companies to be the first to sign up   GRAPHIC  Offshore decommissioning     Everyone is queuing to be second   said Ardent s Decommissioning Director Stuart Martin   Oil companies are keen to reduce costs in a part of the market dominated by major global players such as TechnipFMC  N FTI   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB    Saipem   MI SPMI  and AllSeas   Beyond the floating tanks  Ardent has also joined forces with oil services firm WorleyParsons  AX WOR  and technology and shipping group Lloyd s Register  to bring a one stop shop service   This could save money by cutting out the need for lots of different contractors  Well Safe proposes coordinating decommissioning work across companies to share equipment and staff   GRAPHIC  Cost of Ardent projects     You got to give Well Safe and the others a real tip of the hat  We all want them to win  It s in the best interest of the industry   said Jim House  CEO of Neptune Energy  which is planning decommissioning for its Juliet and Minke fields in the North Sea   Oil platforms are usually removed piece by piece and taken to the shore using complex vessels  The floating tanks that Ardent used to lift the Costa Concordia  are much cheaper to use  industry experts say   GRAPHIC  UK North Sea Decommissioning Spending     This technology could have significant potential cost efficiencies   the Oil and Gas Technology Centre  which is funded by the British government  said in a report  But Ardent says it would need contracts for at least two buoyant tanks to go below current costs per ton of steel removed and three to get below its target cost reduction of around a third  Britain s industry regulator  the Oil and Gas Authority  has set a target of 35 percent cost cuts compared with 2015 levels  Well Safe s main lever for cost reduction also depends on several operators committing to contracts  Ardent is also proposing to oversee a project from production to scrapping the metal onshore  Worley Parsons would operate the platform and maintain the equipment and Lloyd s Register would plug the wells   It s a lot about an emerging set of companies and we don t yet know which is going to be the winning model   said Boston Consulting Group s Philip Whittaker   One of the biggest sources of value is how to integrate the decom work with the final stages of the production work     GRAPHIC  UK North Sea Decommissioning Spending     MATURE BASIN  With other fields maturing and drying up across the world and some experts expecting demand for oil to peak in the 2030s the North Sea is a test bed for new decommissioning projects   If a company can plug oil wells without leaks and remove thousands of tonnes of steel platforms and pipelines  some 50years old  in the rough  deep seas between Scotland  England and Norway  they should be able to do it anywhere   Industry body Oil and Gas UK  expects oil companies to spend17 billion pounds   22 05 billion  on removing around 1 600wells  100 platforms  and 5 500 km of pipelines in the next seven years  Some 840 000 tonnes of material will be returned to shore to meet environmental regulations    We ve got a mature basin with a steady flow of work   said Joe Laesk  decommissioning manager at Oil and Gas UK    Those resources and expertise can be exportable globally    The Gulf of Mexico has had decommissioning projects in its warm  calm waters for years but Southeast Asia is a new hot spot  with more than 1 500 platforms and 7 000 subsea wells expected to be uneconomical by 2038  according to the BCG  That is followed by Latin America  West Africa and the Middle East Gulf  GRAPHIC  Future decommissioning hotspots    With so much potential  more established players are also trying different approaches to make decommissioning cheaper   Service vessel group Allseas is experimenting with new ideas  It specializes in subsea construction but is converting huge ships to lift structures as heavy as 48 000 tonnes in one haul    We lift in a matter of hours and we re gone   said Allseas President Edward Heerema   The first job for Allseas  Pioneering Spirit  the biggest construction vessel in the world  was in the Norwegian North Searemoving Repsol s  MC REP  13 500 ton Yme production unit   Shell  AS RDSa  also used it to remove its 24 000 ton Brent Delta platform in 2017   We have taken substantial costs out of our major decommissioning project  the Brent  and we will continue to do so   said Steve Phimister  head of Shell s North Sea upstream   The whole industry needs to do that by innovating

U S  China trade tensions were thrown into further turmoil after President Donald Trump s trade adviser Peter Navarro said if issues with China are not resolved during the 90 day ceasefire  the administration would raise existing tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods 
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow  however  offered a more sanguine outlook  telling CNBC that Trump would consider extending the 90 day tariff truce with China if progress is made in talks

36204,257719,SLB,Searching For Higher Yields  Avoid These 3 Risky Stocks,opinion,"The landscape for income investors seeking higher yields is becoming more challenging  As central banks prepare to cut interest rates to save the global economy from slipping into recession  expectations of a low rate environment are pushing investors to find high yield alternatives and take more risky bets 
This is one of the main triggers behind the S P 500 reaching a new record high of 2 954 18 last Thursday  Though dividend stocks  with their solid income streams  can provide shelter as the skies get darker  it s also important to understand that not all income stocks are safe 
Below are three high yielding stocks  which we believe investors should avoid despite their extremely attractive dividend yields 
1  Ford Motor Co 
One of America s largest carmakers   Ford Motor Company  NYSE F    has become attractive to yield seeking investors  Its stock  trading at  9 84 at yesterday s close  is offering a dividend yield of more than 6   This is a massive premium when you compare it with the S P 500 s average yield of just 1 9  

But before buying Ford stock  careful investors should ask whether the company s payout is safe and sustainable   its payout ratio of over 80  is almost four times the industry average of 22  
The past few years have been tough for Ford  After many years of rising sales  helped by the robust global economy and consumer demand  the car maker is now facing powerful headwinds  it s undertaking an  11 billion restructuring  after its net income fell by more than half last year as demand for its sedan cars slowed  The turnaround will involve canning thousands of salaried jobs  closing factories overseas  and building capacity to manufacture electric and driverless cars 
As Ford undertakes this massive restructuring exercise to improve profitability and get ready for this new era  investors haven t shown much faith  The stock has traded below  10 a share since the past summer amid concerns about the sustainability of its generous  0 15 a share quarterly dividend 
Analysts have built in a potential scenario where Ford s credit rating could be downgraded soon and its dividends slashed  if the company s turnaround plan fails to produce results  If the U S  economy slips into a recession or faces a sharp slowdown  the demand for gas guzzling SUVs will erode  It s therefore better to avoid Ford despite its higher yield in this uncertain economic environment 
2  AT T Inc 
The largest telecom operator in the U S   AT T  NYSE T  is another dividend stock offering a yield that s hard to ignore  Closing yesterday at  32 55  the shares offer a 6 3  annual yield  paying a quarterly dividend of  0 51 a share 

But that hefty return doesn t come without risks  AT T has been rushing to become a modern media giant at a time when consumers are cutting cords and subscribing to cheaper entertainment options  such as Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   To survive in this disruptive environment  the company last year acquired Time Warner  which included popular content assets like HBO and CNN  for  85 billion 
But that acquisition ballooned AT T s debt and created operational complications  AT T has  169 billion of net debt and says 75  of the debt it took on to buy Time Warner will be paid off by the end of this year 
AT T s dividend yield is indicating that investors see some sort of cuts in its  15 billion dividend bill going forward if the company s turnaround plan doesn t work out  Due to this lingering debt overhang  we recommend investors avoid catching this falling knife 
3  Schlumberger
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the world s largest oil service provider  has seen its shares plunge about 20  since the April high  to  38 58 at yesterday s close  on concerns that the world s largest oil and gas explorers will cut their spending plans amid slowing  growth and challenging demand supply situation in the oil markets  That bearish spell has pushed the dividend yield on its stock close to 6  

The stock  which has fallen more than 67  in the past five years  may look quite attractive to some contrarian investors though  Its annual dividend yield at 5 2  is more than double its five year average  But the current environment isn t conducive to oil and gas exploration and production companies to go on spending binges while they re under pressure from shareholders to return capital  That  in turn  is reducing demand for oilfield services  according to S P GIobal  which cut Schlumberger s credit rating last month a notch 
In this uncertain global economic and geopolitical environment  oil prices may not sustain their recent gains  It would be better for investors to avoid entering this trade now 
Bottom Line
Investing in high yielding dividend stocks isn t always profitable  Investors should carefully pick their holdings  focusing on the companies with strong balance sheets  low levels of debt  and a long history of rewarding investors  The above three stocks don t fit the bill ",2019-06-26,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/searching-for-higher-yields-avoid-these-3-risky-stocks-200434706,200434706

36231,257746,SLB,Schlumberger reports slight profit beat despite sluggish U S  growth,news,"By Liz Hampton and John Benny
 Reuters    Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV  N SLB  on Friday reported a slight profit beat but said that the pace of growth in North America had slowed due to transportation bottlenecks in the largest U S  shale basin 
Although profits rose year over year  the company has been hit by slower than anticipated growth in the Permian basin  where production has outpaced available pipeline takeaway capacity and is driving prices lower  Schlumberger said it expects those bottlenecks to be resolved within the next 12 to 18 months 
 In North America  sequential growth remained positive but slowed from rates of previous quarters as takeaway constraints in the Permian impacted hydraulic fracturing activity   Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on Friday 
Schlumberger  the largest oilfield service provider and first to report earnings  is seen as a bellwether for the industry  The company last month warned investors that slowing activity in North America was impacting its business 
The company reported a profit of  644 million  or 46 cents per share  up about 18 percent from a year ago  Analysts had anticipated earnings of 45 cents per share  excluding items  according to Refinitiv data 
Benchmark U S  crude prices  CLc1  are up about 40 percent from a year ago but service companies  which help operators drill and finish wells  have seen demand for their work cool as producers clamp down on spending and delay completions due to pipeline bottlenecks 
Shares of Schlumberger were up about 1 3 percent in pre market trading on Friday at  59 2  The company s stock has fallen by about 27 percent from a peak this year in late January 
Analysts from investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt   Co said on Friday the results were within expectations but  unlikely to bring investors rushing off sidelines  and back into the oilfield services sector 
The company s international revenue rose 1 3 percent to  5 22 billion  while revenue from its North America business rose about 23 percent to  3 20 billion 
Sequential revenue growth in the international business outpaced that of North America for the first time since the second quarter of 2014  Kibsgaard said

36235,257750,SLB,China s choreographed trade expo more  theater  than deal clincher,news,"By John Ruwitch and Michael Martina SHANGHAI  Reuters    German car maker Volkswagen AG  DE VOWG p  signed what looked like a meaty deal with one of its China joint ventures this week at a huge new trade show in Shanghai to ship almost  9 billion worth of cars and parts to China next year  But it turns out the  Memorandum of Cooperation   one of hundreds of deals inked at the China International Import Expo that wraps up on Saturday  represents business as usual for VW  Two sources close to the company and its FAW Volkswagen tie up said the joint venture would have imported the cars and parts with or without the expo to support its day to day manufacturing and sales operations  as it does every year  FAW Volkswagen did not have an immediate comment  While the giant import fair is a key part of China s response to growing complaints about its commercial policies  critics said the tightly choreographed event was more show than substance that failed to address core issues at the heart of the festering U S  China trade war   I don t think we re holding out high hopes for the expo in terms of improving China s trade relationship with the rest of the world   said Duncan Innes Ker  regional director for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit   People really want to see a generalized improvement in the fairness of the operating environment  not a specific commitment to importing more in this particular year or whatever   State media has lavished praise on the event  which was headlined by President Xi Jinping  who provided few specifics in his opening speech about how China would address complaints on issues like market access and intellectual property rights protection   The Shanghai expo will act as a demonstration before billions of global observers that China is letting the market play the decisive role in its business operations   the Global Times newspaper said  The expo s organizers were less laissez faire  and the heavy hand of the state  from stifling security to pressure on state owned enterprises to do deals  was ever present  Schools were closed across Shanghai  a city of more than 24 million people  on the first two days of the expo and cars without special passes were blocked from approaching the enormous clover shaped exhibition hall  Inside  guards and police blanketed the venue and lined walkways to and from the subway  Participants were required to undergo airport level security and a long list of items  from daggers to Frisbees  were banned   I m not sure what they are trying to protect with all of this security   one foreign industry VIP said  Hundreds of student volunteers in red blazers offered directions around the venue  which boasts an exhibition area roughly the size of 40 football pitches and a multi story maze of roads  meeting rooms  offices and restaurants  One Reuters journalist clocked more than 17 000 steps of walking at the expo in one day  or roughly 12 km  ACTORS AND OLD DEALS Many of the deals touted at the fair  like Volkswagen s  appeared to be either business agreements that would not ordinarily warrant publicity  or the announcement of previously agreed contracts  according to executives   After one signing  a foreign participant told Reuters that he had nothing to do with the company he was representing   Everything you saw at the signing ceremony was theater or farce  I m essentially an actor  hired for the duration of the expo  in order to give the impression of international cooperation   the person said  asking not to be named  Chinese companies have been known to hire foreigners to impersonate executives at events  presumably to lend an air of international legitimacy  On Wednesday at the expo  China s state run offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd signed 20 deals with foreign businesses  including Siemens    Caterpillar   N CAT  and Schlumberger  N SLB   Two people involved in the signings said the deals were non binding  memoranda of understanding   or letters of intent  with existing partners  CNOOC executives declined to provide details  Merck Group s  DE MRCG  CEO for performance materials  Kai Beckmann  said deals aren t everything   For us as a global company  any signal that promotes free trade and global collaboration is highly appreciated and welcome  and this platform was used for that purpose   he said   In the old days  these kinds of exhibitions and trade fairs were used to sign deals  But now you do the deals through e commerce and you don t need trade fairs for that   The strategy for some of the more than 180 American companies at the expo seemed to be to wait and see   We will continue to do what we are doing and hopefully that will resolve itself between both of our governments   said Henry Irizarry  a vice president at Jeanerette  Louisiana based Metal Shark Boats  referring to the China U S  trade war  At the media center  a robot on wheels named  Xiao Bao   or Little Leopard  scooted to and fro  showing reporters to the bathroom and answering basic questions  Asked where Xi Jinping was  Xiao Bao could give a rundown of news of the day involving the Chinese leader  
It was unable to respond when asked multiple times how the China U S  trade conflict could be resolved ",2018-11-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinas-choreographed-trade-expo-more-theater-than-deal-clincher-1681577,1681577

oilfield services player s rotary rig count affects demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by the likes of Schlumberger Ltd  Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc  and Transocean Ltd DetailsTotal US Rig Count Decreases  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 983 in the week ended May 24  down from the prior week tally of 987  With this  the tally declined for seven weeks in a row  The current national rig count is also lower than the prior year s 1059 The number of onshore rigs  through the week ended May 24  totaled 957  down from 961 in the previous week  However  four rigs operated in inland waters and 22 rigs worked in the offshore plays  The counts of both inland and offshore rigs were in line

ConclusionThree oil drilling rigs were removed from each of Permian and Cana Woodford basins  This led to a drop in total rig count operating in the United States  Notably  Permian   the most prolific basin in the United States which employs roughly half of the nation s total rigs   has seen a decline in oil drilling rigs in the last six consecutive weeks  Investors should also note that the waning oil rig count reflects conservative spending by some of the drillers in the nation Importantly  Permian drillers have now become more efficient as they are now deploying lesser rigs to produce more of the commodity  Despite the decline in rig count  in June  the Permian basin will produce 4 173 thousand barrels of oil per day  MBbl D   up by 56 MBbl D from May s production  according to the  Higher

36250,257765,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Shell s Appomattox Start Up  Rattler Midstream s IPO   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices hit their lowest in more than two months and natural gas futures tallied a small loss 
On the news front  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  started production at its Appomattox offshore platform in Gulf of Mexico  Meanwhile  Rattler Midstream Partners LP   the midstream subsidiary of Permian Basin operator Diamondback Energy   NASDAQ FANG     raised around  665 million in an IPO 
Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 6 8  to close at  58 63 per barrel  while natural gas prices moved down 1 3  for the week to finish at  2 598 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark hit the lowest settlement level since May 13 following the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  The report showed that crude stockpiles recorded another unexpected weekly build  ballooning to their highest since July 2017  In particular  analysts and industry watchers are worried over the tepid refinery runs at a time of year that typically see heightened demand for gasoline as the U S  summer driving season takes off  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both increased from their previous week levels 
There are also concerns that the worsening U S  China trade spat could lead to a major slowdown in global economy and translate into weak demand for the commodity 
Natural gas prices also suffered as mild weather continues to limit heating and air conditioning demand in the face of strong production

36252,257767,SLB,Schlumberger s Rapid Plunge Signals More Pain For Oil And Energy Stock Bulls,opinion,"It s never easy to time any market  but it s even tougher to predict peak and trough in energy markets  However  the risks for the oil markets have increased dramatically in recent days and the supply demand dynamics are shaping up in a way that we could be in for another deep downturn in oil markets after a slow and gradual recovery since 2014 
The escalating U S  China trade war  increasing evidence that the U S  economy has entered a slow patch  and U S  President Donald Trump s conciliatory tone towards Iran point to a tough summer for oil bulls and the stocks associated with the energy business  Indeed  the share performance of companies providing crucial services to oil producers is painting a grim picture of the outlook for the oil and gas industry 
Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB   the world s largest oil service provider  has seen its shares plunge more than 24  since the April high  The stock closed down 0 9  yesterday at  36 18  on its fifth consecutive day of losses  Its closest competitor Halliburton Co   NYSE HAL  is faring no better  After rising about 20  this year to mid April  its stock is now down 28  

Companies in the Philadelphia Oil Services Index failed to sustain the April rally or to keep up with the overall recovery in the global oil market  and the index is down about 25  since mid April 
Deteriorating Macro Environment
Schlumberger  which operates in more than 120 countries  supplying the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services  from exploration through production  was predicting a good year for the oil industry in its most recent earnings report last month 
 The return of international growth  and in particular the return of offshore activity and exploration  is what we have been waiting for   Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard told analysts and investors on April 18 on a conference call   The last year we had growth internationally was in 2014  so this is five years of waiting  so we are more than ready for this  
But the deteriorating macro environment and the reluctance of big oil and gas producers to increase investments are thwarting the company s efforts to recover from the slump it s been stuck in since the middle of 2014 
The stock  which has fallen more than 60  in the past five years  may look quite attractive to some contrarian investors though  Its annual dividend yield at 4 69  is more than double than its five year average  while its forward price to earnings multiple of 16 5 is the lowest in the past five years 
But historical data may not be too relevant for the oil service providers when the industry they work for is going through a fundamental change  Under pressure from shareholders  exploration and production companies are keeping spending in check  which is reducing demand for oilfield services  according to S P GIobal  which cut Schlumberger s credit rating last week a notch 
 Oilfield services companies will no longer be able to generate the high operating margins they did in 2014   Carin Dehne Kiley  an analyst at S P  wrote in a report last Friday  Said Dehne Kiley 

 The oilfield services industry has fundamentally changed due to permanent efficiency and productivity gains realized by E P companies as well as investor sentiment calling for E P companies to live within cash flow and limit production growth  

Bottom line
The stocks of oil services companies have become cheaper after a precipitous decline in the past five years  But despite their more attractive valuations  we don t think the time has come to snap up their shares  In this uncertain global economic and geopolitical environment  oil prices may not sustain their recent gains  It would be better for investors to avoid entering this trade now ",2019-05-30,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-stocks-fast-plunge-signals-more-pain-for-oil-bulls-200426352,200426352
36253,257768,SLB,What Went Wrong With Oil Services ETFs In May ,opinion,"May has been deadly for oil services stocks and ETFs  Oil prices treaded lower in the month with United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  LP  losing about 11  on US China trade worries and higher inventory build up  But the pain for oil services stocks was greater than the actual commodity  read    
Among several subsectors  equipment and services ETFs suffered the most  Investors should note that SPDR S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  NYSE XES  ETF  has lost 18 2  in the past month while SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  NYSE XOP  ETF   CSE XOP   is off 12 7  and VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF  has lost only 7 9  
Oil services stocks come from a bottom ranked industry  bottom 44    Let s find out what are the factors working against equipment and services ETFs 
Inside the Pain 
The S P downgraded Halliburton   NYSE HAL   and Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   in late May  The news dealt a blow to oil service stocks   Oilfield services companies will no longer be able to generate the high operating margins they did in 2014   S P analyst Carin Dehne Kiley said 
Also  Baker Hughes  data for the week ended May 24 showed that rig count has declined for   Market watchers are of the view that   in a bid to conserve capital  
Less capital expenditure among exploration   production  E P  companiesmeans   for top oilfield services providers   Trade war also hampered the global growth outlook as well as demand for energy  This along with ample supplies may have tempted E P companies to limit production growth 
As a result  Invesco S P SmallCap Energy ETF  NYSE XLE    down 18 2    VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF   CA OIH    down 16 7    iShares U S  Oil Equipment   Services ETF   down 16   and Invesco Dynamic Oil   Gas Services ETF   down 15 1   suffered badly in the month  read    
Any Hope Ahead  
Oil service companies seem optimistic despite a tumultuous start to 2019  After four years of major pricing concessions  Schlumberger plans to recover its international service and product pricing this year  It also seeks to gain efficiency by increasing activity levels  with little to no spare equipment capacity   
Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE     60  of its oilfield service revenues come from outside North America   expects strengthening international markets to drive its overall business positively  per that analyst 
Halliburton   which confirmed lower drilling and completion spending among U S  E P companies    generates about s from international markets  The percentage is expected to shoot higher throughout the year as international spend is on the rise 
Against this backdrop  we can conclude that even if medium term potential could be decent for the space  the short term looks murky  The oil services ETFs like PXJ  IEZ  XES have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  while OIH has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

36256,257771,SLB,Crude Oil Hit Hard,opinion,"The quotes are pleasantly red this morning    ES down  NQ down  YM down   but one  in particular  is getting zapped particularly hard  and that is CL  crude oil  which is down nearly 3   The CL contract shows that after a modest reversal pattern  tinted  oil has been steadily weakening 

Looking at the very long term oil  augmented with Fibonacci arcs and a Fibonacci retracement  gives us more perspective  Although you would never guess it looking at the gas pumps here in the Bay Area  where gas is still above  4 gallon   oil has been broadly weak for many years 

I suspect the next level of support for crude will be around  50  both because this is the next Fibonacci retracement level but also becomes humans are weirdly hung up on Big Round Numbers

36282,257797,SLB,Russian oil industry would weather U S   bill from hell ,news,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW  Reuters    Stiff new U S  sanctions against Russia would only have a limited impact on its oil industry because it has drastically reduced its reliance on Western funding and foreign partnerships and is lessening its dependence on imported technology  Western sanctions imposed in 2014 over Russia s annexation of Crimea have already made it extremely hard for many state oil firms such as Rosneft  MM ROSN  to borrow abroad or use Western technology to develop shale  offshore and Arctic deposits  While those measures have slowed down a number of challenging oil projects  they have done little to halt the Russian industry s growth with production near a record high of 11 2 million barrels per day in July   and set to climb further  Since 2014  the Russian oil industry has effectively halted borrowing from Western institutions  instead relying on its own cash flow and lending from state owned banks while developing technology to replace services once supplied by Western firms  Analysts say this is partly why Russian oil stocks have been relatively unscathed since U S  senators introduced legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia over its interference in U S  elections and its activities in Syria and Ukraine  The measures introduced on Aug  2  dubbed by the senators as the  bill from hell   include potential curbs on the operations of state owned Russian banks  restrictions on holding Russian sovereign debt as well as measures against Western involvement in Russian oil and gas projects  While the ruble has fallen more than 10 percent and Russian banking stocks have slumped 20 percent since the legislation was introduced  shares in Russian oil firms have climbed 2 percent  leaving them 27 percent higher so far in 2018    The main driver of the Russian oil industry s profitability is the oil price denominated in roubles and it is currently posting new records as the rouble is getting weaker  Hence the sanction noise often even has a positive impact on Russian oil stocks   said Dmitry Marinchenko at Fitch Ratings  MAJOR DEPARTURE The prospects for the latest U S  sanctions bill are not immediately clear  It would have to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and then be signed into law by President Donald Trump  To be sure  Washington could really hurt the Russian oil industry if it introduced Iran like measures forbidding oil purchases from the country  But given Russia produces more than 11 percent of global crude  such a measure would lead to a major spike in oil prices and hit the United States itself hard as it is the world s largest oil consumer  Russian gas exporting monopoly Gazprom  MM GAZP   for example  has maintained its output since 2014 and actually increased exports to Europe to an all time high in 2017  securing a 34 percent share of EU markets amid rising demand  But of all Russian oil and gas companies  it is the only one to have borrowed significant sums from the West   about  5 billion in 2017 and  3 billion in 2018 so far   using Eurobonds and syndicated loans  What s more  those amounts are only equivalent to a small proportion of Gazprom s annual capital spending of  22 billion  The rest of the Russian oil industry invests a similar amount each year as well  mostly without Western funding  That represents a major departure from the years prior to the sanctions when the lion s share of Russian oil industry s borrowing came from Western banks or export backed facilities with trading houses and major oil companies  In 2013  for example  a year before the first Western sanctions  Rosneft alone borrowed more than  35 billion from Western institutions to buy smaller rival TNK BP and to fund its capital spending  CHINESE MONEY There has been a similar shift in joint ventures between Russian and Western companies  A decade ago  dozens of projects were planned but the number has shrunk to just a few ventures  which are important but not critical to help Russia maintain its output growth  U S  oil giant  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  and Italy s Eni  MI ENI   for example  have dropped plans to help Russia develop offshore fields and U S  company ConocoPhillips  N COP  sold out from Russia s biggest private oil firm Lukoil  MM LKOH   The key remaining ventures involving Western companies are three projects between  BP   L BP  and Rosneft in East and West Siberia and a gas venture between Rosneft and Exxon Mobil on Sakhalin island  Also on the gas front  Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  and France s  Total   PA TOTF  have been considering new liquefied natural gas projects with Gazprom and Novatek  MM NVTK   as well as a new pipeline to Europe under the Baltic Sea  But to put the projects in perspective  the combined cost of all of them is about  50 billion   less than a 10th of the Russian oil industry s investment program for the next decade  And if Western institutions are wary of lending to Russia  other countries such as China have been prepared to step in  Novatek and Total  for example  launched the  27 billion Yamal LNG plant this year with Beijing s financial support  WEAKEST LINK The weakest link in the Russian oil industry in the face of sanctions has traditionally been high end Western technology such as complex drilling  hydraulic fracturing or IT  said Denis Borisov  director of EY s oil and gas center in Moscow  Russia s drilling and oil servicing market is worth about  20 billion a year and the share of the market held by Western service companies has remained fairly steady over the last few years and at about a fifth    But the process of replacing foreign equipment with local production has gathered pace   said Borisov  Rosneft  which produces 40 percent of Russian oil  has recently tested its own simulated hydraulic fracturing technology   the extraction technique that spurred the boom in U S  shale oil production  The technology first came to Russia mainly via major Western oil services firms such as Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL   Companies such as Schlumberger are still doing a lot of complex drilling work in the Caspian Sea and West Siberia for Lukoil  as well as working on the world s longest extended reach well for Exxon and Rosneft off the Sakhalin island  But Fitch s Marinchenko said the reliance of Russian oil firms on Western technology has declined since 2014 thanks to imports from China and local production of drilling equipment  Since 2014  Rosneft s own drilling subsidiary has doubled its market share to 25 percent  meaning the company has become almost self sufficient  
 It is clear that new wide scale sanctions on technology will not become the start of an end for the Russian oil industry  especially if Europe doesn t join them   said Marinchenko   But it will complicate the development of hard to extract or depleted deposits  ",2018-08-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/russian-oil-industry-would-weather-us-bill-from-hell-1577874,1577874
36283,257798,SLB,After lean years  Big Oil is under pressure to spend,news,"By Ron Bousso LONDON  Reuters    Executives at the world s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves  halt output declines and take advantage of a crude price rally after years of austerity  With oil at a four year high of  85 a barrel  exploration departments are urging company boards to drill more  wages are creeping higher  service companies say rates will have to rise and some investors say Big Oil must start growing again soon  For the heads of companies such as  BP   L BP    Chevron   N CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  AS RDSa  who have pledged to stick to lower spending after slashing budgets by as much as 50 percent since 2014  the pressure may become hard to resist  As in previous oil price cycles  there are concerns about the strength and duration of the business cycle  now in its 10th year of growth after the 2008 financial crisis   Unlike previous oil price cycles  there is the prospect  eventually  of an end to growth in oil demand as the world shifts to cleaner energy  But there are already signs some cost cuts implemented after oil slumped from  115 a barrel in 2014 to  26 in 2016 are being rolled back  Shell  for example  said last month its teams in the UK North Sea will switch to a less tiring rota of two weeks offshore then three weeks onshore  During the austerity years  teams spent three weeks offshore then four onshore  More frequent rotations mean more ships and helicopters will need to be chartered  Shell says the change will increase costs slightly but is convinced it will make its North Sea operations more cost effective and productive  More generally  salaries across the oil and gas sector have edged up about 6 percent so far in 2018 after declining in the previous three years  according to a survey published by Rigzone   At one major firm  senior managers who had been meeting by video conference for several years are now getting flights approved for face to face gatherings  according to an executive at the company  The boards of large oil firms are facing more internal requests to invest in new projects and acquisitions  and to beef up staff  according to senior executives present at such discussions   There is lots of pressure from all the units to get more money   said an executive at a large European oil company   For a graphic showing spending by major oil companies    LONG CYCLE INVESTMENTS New project approvals are picking up  Shell and its partners this week gave the green light to LNG Canada  one of the largest liquefied natural gas  LNG  projects in recent years   Shell s motivations for the project are clear  without this project  the company s upstream  LNG contract portfolio and LNG production was set to go into decline early next decade   Wood Mackenzie  analyst Dulles Wang said   Typically  after a period of lower capital spending  or capex  and low prices comes an era of rapid investment as oil recovers and supplies tighten  During the lean years  companies cut back sharply  Now  they generate as much cash as in 2014 and are vowing to remain thrifty to focus on higher dividends  buying back shares and reducing debt  But in an industry where reserves and production decline naturally as oil is pumped from fields  continued investment is considered critical    We are likely in need of more long cycle investments given the persistent and accelerating base declines observed in global conventional and offshore projects   said a source at in investment firm with large stakes in big oil companies   Although some companies such as BP  L BP  were able to stem production declines thanks to technology and lower costs  a drop in new production has taken a toll on the longer term outlook for many companies  Oilfield decline rates doubled from 3 percent in 2014 to 6 percent in 2016  For the big oil firms  rates went from 1 5 percent to just over 2 percent during the same period  according to  Morgan Stanley    I expect capex rises due to a significant drop in reservoir life  Some capex will be used to reinvigorate existing wells   said Darren Sissons  partner at Campbell Lee   Ross Investment Management   adding that increases would be cautious initially   For a graphic showing reserve life for major oil companies reserve life    RESERVE LIFE Spending by the world s top seven oil companies is expected to rise to a combined  136 billion by 2020 from  105 billion in 2017  according to analysts at Morgan Stanley  N MS  and Jefferies  N JEF   Starting from the middle of next year  boards will change their tone to prepare shareholders for higher spending from 2020  Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats said   New project awards will likely already accelerate in 2019  but for major developments  capex in the first year tends to be limited  From 2020 onwards  capex is likely to go higher   Boards are not blind to the pressure  Many companies have defined a range for spending  while committing to the lower end  Shell  for example  has a  soft floor  and a  hard ceiling  for spending of  25 billion to  30 billion per year  For some companies such as Italy s Eni  MI ENI   which is developing major gas projects in Egypt and Mozambique  boosting costs may be unavoidable     Oil companies  proved themselves in a low oil price environment  but at some point they do need to start respending on new projects to keep getting oil out of the ground   said David Smith  fund manager of the Henderson High Income Trust   Patrick Pouyanne  chief executive of French oil company  Total   PA TOTF   conceded this week that while it aimed to stick to its spending range of  15 billion to  17 billion a year beyond 2020  capex could rise to  20 billion   Our view is that the majors  capex is probably 5 to 10 percent or so too low if they are to maintain their current reserve lives   said Jonathan Waghorn  co manager of Guinness Asset Management s  global energy fund   For a graphic showing upstream investment by oil and gas companies    The pressure to increase spending also comes at a time oil services companies are slowly increasing rates  saying their sacrifices to help Big Oil weather the slump should now be rewarded as crude prices rise   Current investment levels  particularly in the international market  are clearly not sustainable to meet either medium term demand or long term reserves replacement needs   Paal Kibsgaard  Chief Executive Officer of Schlumberger  N SLB   the world s largest oil services provider  told a conference last month  He said the international production base needed double digit growth in investment for the foreseeable future just to keep production at current levels  But investors and executives say reserve life   which was at its lowest in at least two decades in 2017   is no longer the gold standard for measuring the health of oil companies  A spending splurge could also eat into profits and revive fears oil companies are returning to the wasteful practices of the first half of the decade when crude prices soared   
 Historically  excess free cash flow above dividend cost has seen capex rise in the industry but the sector is trying to shake off the capital indiscipline tag and I believe they will stick to that   said Rohan Murphy  analyst at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Investors  ",2018-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/after-lean-years-big-oil-is-under-pressure-to-spend-1632777,1632777

36285,257800,SLB,U S  oil service firms face tough quarter despite high crude prices,news,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON  Reuters    Even as crude prices hover near four year highs  U S  oilfield service firms  third quarter results due out in coming days will reflect a shaky recovery  as their customers face drilling constraints and pressure to hold down spending 
Oil producers are holding off finishing new wells  and cost pressures from tight labor markets and U S  tariffs on imported steel are driving up service firms  costs 
Meanwhile  shale producers including  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN  and  Oasis Petroleum  Inc  N OAS  are doing more work traditionally handled by service companies 
The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region s infrastructure with oil production  driving up costs  depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of production growth 
 The risk for a number of  oilfield service  firms is to the downside   said Brad Handler  a Jefferies equity analyst in New York who follows the oilfield service sector 
Wall Street is trimming earnings forecasts for oilfield market leaders  Schlumberger NV  N SLB  and  Halliburton Co   N HAL   and for pressure pumper  Keane Group Inc   N FRAC  and sand provider  U S  Silica Holdings Inc   N SLCA   Schlumberger kicks off third quarter reporting by the sector on Friday 
The cuts are coming despite third quarter oil prices  CLc1  that are up more than 40 percent from a year earlier 
Schlumberger is expected to report a profit of 47 cents a share  up from 39 cents a share  in the same quarter a year ago  according to Refinitiv I B E S  Halliburton s per share profit is expected to be 49 cents  compared with 42 cents a year ago

Weakness in completing wells is worrisome because such services have carried the day for firms still waiting for offshore drilling to pick up 
Completing a well by fracking and tying it to pipelines represents about 60 percent of onshore well expenditures  With producers holding off completions until new pipelines start up next year  there is less demand for services 
 The market for frac spreads is very soft  below even what we started in 2018   Bill Thomas  chief executive of EOG Resources Inc  N EOG   told investors at a New York conference last month 
The number of active hydraulic fracturing spreads or fleets in the Permian  the largest oilfield in the United States  has fallen to 172 from 192 earlier this year  and such fleets active across the U S  have dropped to 460 from a peak of 480  according to data provider Primary Vision 
 Lower utilization and increased completion efficiencies is creating more slack in the system  with pressure pumpers most at risk heading into year end    Barclays   LON BARC  said in a note this month 
Producers  unwillingness to raise spending despite higher oil prices also is taking a toll  Analysts at Barclays estimate that more than 80 percent of producer upstream budgets soon will be tapped out if third quarter spending was similar to the second quarter s 
Bernstein analysts estimate there could be a 15 percent further decline in fracking activity  but they expect the market to bottom early next year 

 There is still risk of further declines as we approach winter and roll into the new E P  exploration and production  budget cycle   Colin Davies  a senior analyst for Bernstein wrote in a note ",2018-10-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-oil-service-firms-face-tough-quarter-despite-high-crude-prices-1647269,1647269
36301,257816,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Chevron Tops Q1 Earnings  Exxon   TOTAL Flops,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices settled lower but natural gas futures gained 
On the news front  integrated majors ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM    Chevron   NYSE CVX   and TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   reported first quarter earnings  
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 1 2  to close at  63 30 per barrel  natural gas prices gained 3 1  for the week to finish at  2 566 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark pulled back from multi month highs after the Energy Department s latest inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly increase  The commodity s downward movement could also be attributed to the prevailing uncertainty in the market following President Donald Trump s statement that he asked OPEC to bring down prices 
Nevertheless  oil has climbed more than 40  this year  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices rebounded slightly from their three year lows despite a government report showing higher than expected increase in supplies  The gain could be attributed to weather associated tailwinds that might lead to robust heating demand  While the fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The largest publicly traded integrated energy company  ExxonMobil  reported weak first quarter 2019 results due to significant lower contributions from

was primarily due to softness in the prices of commodities compared with the previous year Total hydrocarbon production during the first quarter averaged 2 946 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  up 9  year over year  The increase was due to higher contribution from Egina in Nigeria  Kaombo North in Angola  Ichthys in Australia  and Yamal LNG in Russia  along with the integration of

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 5 billion  The strong first quarter results were attributed to higher hydrocarbon production  backed by prolific plays like Bakken and Gulf of Mexico Quarterly hydrocarbon production was 299 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  up 17 3  year over year  Crude oil production increased from 134 thousand barrels per day in first quarter 2018 to 164

36304,257819,SLB,Oil Stocks To Watch For Q1 Earnings On May 9  CNQ  LNG   More,opinion,The first quarter 2019 earnings season is past the halfway mark for the energy sector  with majority of oil gas biggies having already reported their quarterly numbers  With a host of companies slated to release quarterly results by the end of this week  let s take a look at the oil and gas pricing scenario during the quarter  which is likely to affect energy companies  fortunes  Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report Card  Oil  Following the oil crash toward the end of 2018 that took everyone by storm  crude ended up posting the biggest quarterly gain in a decade  With oil popping up to  60 55 a barrel  the March quarter recorded the fastest rate of oil price hike since 2009 on the back of OPEC  deal and other factors  However  crude prices in first quarter 2019 compared unfavorably with the year ago period amid bearish outlook for Asian economies  increased inventories and softer y y demand projections  Average West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude prices in the month of January  February and March 2019 were recorded at  51 38   55 01 and  58 17 per barrel  respectively  per data from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   These average prices were considerably lower than the year ago respective prices of  63 55   62 16 and  62 87  Hence  energy producers having an oil weighted portfolio are likely to remain exposed to the vagaries of crude price fluctuations as they will derive less value for their products  Natural Gas  Per the EIA data  the average spot prices of Henry Hub natural gas in the months of January  February and March of 2019 were recorded at  3 11   2 69 and  2 80 per Million British thermal units  Btu   respectively  In the year ago comparable months  the average prices of the commodity were recorded at  3 15   2 65 and  2 70 per Million Btu  respectively  according to EIA  The y y improved pricing scenario of the commodity over the last two months of first quarter 2019 bodes well for the companies producing natural gas  Picture Thus Far Per the latest Earnings Preview   the energy sector s first quarter 2019 earnings are expected to decline 19 3  from the year ago period  while the top line is likely to improve 3 1   Notably  oilfield services giants Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  posted weaker y y first quarter 2019 earnings amid international market weakness  The bottom line of integrated oil majors like Chevron  NYSE CVX   ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   TOTAL and BP plc  LON BP  declined year over year primarily due to weaker crude price realizations and lower refining margins  Key Releases on May 9 Given the relatively weaker y y backdrop  let s a take a look at what s in store for these four energy explorers that are set to report first quarter results tomorrow  Canadian Natural Resources Limited   TO CNQ    Calgary based energy explorer is slated to release quarterly results before the opening bell    According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase the odds of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  In the last reported quarter  Canadian Natural reported a negative earnings surprise of 214 29  on lower liquids price realizations  Coming to earnings surprise history  the company missed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters  with average negative surprise of 39 58   Canadian Natural Resources Limited Price and EPS Surprise   However  this time around  things are looking favorable for Canadian Natural according to our proven model  as the firm carries a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of  0 85   You can see The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 39 cents a share on revenues of  3 726 million  However  the earnings and revenue expectation compares unfavorably with the year ago figures of 62 cents a share and  4 538 million  respectively  The company anticipates first quarter 2019 liquids production within 759 000 817 000 barrels per day  bbl d   indicating a decline from 854 558 bbl d reported in first quarter 2018  Further  natural gas output is projected in the band of 1 490 1 520 million cubic feet per day  MMcf d   lower than the year ago level of 1 614 MMcf d  Alberta government s mandated oil production cuts during the first quarter of 2019 is likely to result in lower y y output  While natural gas price realizations may provide some respite  the company is likely to bear the brunt of lower y y realized prices for liquids  which forms more than 75  of the firm s total output levels  Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG    The largest U S  liquefied natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy is slated to unveil quarterly numbers before the opening bell  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 27 78  on high operating expenses  Coming to earnings surprise history  Cheniere Energy missed estimates in three of the last four quarters  delivering average negative earnings surprise of 15 76    Cheniere Energy  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Per our proven model  the company is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this time as well  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 13   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 26 cents a share on revenues of  1 691 million  Notably  the earnings and sales projection suggests a y y decline of 78  and 25   respectively  With a first mover advantage in the LNG export market  Cheniere Energy is expected to gain from increasing y y volumes of LNG exports  However  exporting natural gas   by setting up large liquefaction plants   is a capital intensive business  As it is  the company is bearing the brunt of high costs since the last several quarters  High operating expenses and interest payment obligations associated with huge debt burden are likely to limit its profits  Crescent Point Energy Corporation   TO CPG    The Calgary based upstream player is set to post quarterly results before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 122 22  on lower y y output levels and weak crude price realizations  However  it managed to surpass earnings estimates in three of the preceding four quarters  delivering average positive surprise of 15 49   Crescent Point Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   However  our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Crescent Point in the to be reported quarter because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 2 cents a share on revenues of  622 million  Notably  the earnings and sales expectation compares unfavorably with the year ago reported figures of 9 cents a share and  740 million  respectively Crescent Point s attractive light oil reserves and new leadership bode well  Management s recent emphasis on focusing more on strengthening financials and reducing costs versus its historical priority of simple volume growth provides a

36331,257846,SLB,Some U S  fund managers finally convinced oil rally is for real,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  fund managers are barreling into the energy sector by making broad bets on anything connected with oil  finally convinced that gains in crude prices   on track for their fourth consecutive quarterly gain  the longest such stretch for more than 10 years   are more than a mirage   Ever since oil prices slid in late 2014 after rallying above  115 a barrel  U S  mutual fund managers have largely stayed underweight the sector  convinced that advances in fracking technology would allow U S  production to ramp up at any moment and keep a lid on prices   Yet with oil futures hitting 3 1 2 year highs on Thursday  up approximately 75 percent from this time last year after top exporter Saudi Arabia and No 1 producer Russia led efforts since 2017 to cap output  some U S  fund managers are convinced that high oil prices are finally here to stay   Fund managers from Westwood  Hotchkis and Wiley  and Hodges Capital are among those who say they are making broad bets on anything oil  They say that oil prices will not dip back down quickly because global demand is rising at a time when energy companies are showing less inclination to take on debt to fuel production and have tightened operations   Oil companies are so much more efficient then they were even a year ago and much more disciplined  I think that you can finally say that this is the real deal   said Gary Bradshaw  a portfolio manager at Dallas based Hodges Capital   At the same time  U S  President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday raises geopolitical risks  giving oil another leg higher  fund managers said   U S  crude hit  71 89 per barrel on Thursday  its highest since November 2014  A Reuters poll at the end of April forecast that oil would average  63 23 in 2018  Bradshaw expects crude oil prices to stay at roughly between  65 and  70 for the remainder of the year  boosting the earnings of companies such as Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Diamondback Energy Inc  Still  Bradshaw does not see them spiking high enough to significantly cut into consumer spending or the broader economy  although they may crimp the spending power for the most price sensitive customers  he said  which could eat into the revenues of value chains like  Dollar General Corp   NYSE DG   OIL COMEBACK The dramatic comeback in oil prices  which have jumped nearly 17 percent for the year to date  has helped the S P 500 Energy sector jump 5 4 percent over the same time  The broad S P 500 as a whole  by comparison  is up less than 1 percent since the start of the year   That  in turn  is prodding fund managers back into the sector they had largely shunned   Nine months ago  global funds were underweight energy stocks by 12 percent on average  the largest collective underweight since 2016  according to a September report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC    In April  by comparison  equity allocations to commodities and energy stocks hit eight year highs  Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted    We ve already had some of the catch up trade  but we still have a long way to go   said Bill Costello  a senior portfolio manager at Dallas based Westwood  who has been adding to his positions in energy companies such as Callon Petroleum Co and SRC Energy Inc While energy stocks have rallied  shares are still trading at levels that suggest that oil will remain between  55 and  58 a barrel for the remainder of the year  Costello said    If people believed in  70 a barrel plus for the next 18 months  they would be foolish to be underweight now   Costello said  adding that he expects more money to flow into the sector as fund managers sell utilities and telecom stocks that are getting hurt by rising interest rates   The stretched valuations of the S P 500  which is about 7 percent below the record high it hit in January  should provide another support for energy stocks  said Stan Majcher of the Hotchkis   Wiley Mid Cap Value Fund    We look at it and say the overall market is close to expensive and this is one area which is under owned and viewed in the last few years as a risky place   he said   Signs of declining production by OPEC countries such as Venezuela and bottlenecks that could slow production in the Permian Basin in the U S  could push oil prices well above  70 by the end of the year  leaving fund managers flatfooted  Majcher said    We think that the biggest risk is not preparing for higher oil prices   he said

36332,257847,SLB,Factbox  Hurricane season U S  stocks to watch,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Several Atlantic Ocean hurricanes in 2017 wrought heavy damage in the Caribbean and U S  mainland  but for U S  stocks in several industries  including hotels and transportation  they were a tailwind 
The first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season  Subtropical Storm Alberto  is projected to make landfall on Monday  Alberto forced the evacuation of oil workers in the U S  Gulf of Mexico on Friday 
In 2017  the hurricane season  which typically runs from June to November  caused more than  250 billion worth of damage in the United States  Hurricane Harvey struck the Houston area in August and Hurricane Irma hit Florida in September 
Also in September  Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico  where thousands of residents still lack electricity 
But car rental  hotel and home improvement companies benefited from an influx of customers seeking emergency resources in the wake of the storms  Freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by the hurricanes 
Not all industries fared as well  Several oil companies saw their operations disrupted by Hurricane Harvey  Insurance companies faced mounting catastrophe losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters 
Here are how shares of companies in these industries performed during last year s hurricane season 
CAR RENTAL
Shares of  Hertz Global Holdings Inc   N HTZ  and  Avis Budget  Group Inc  O CAR  surged during much of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on investors  anticipation of increased demand  Hertz shares climbed 156 2 percent between June and early November  while Avis shares rose 80 1 percent during the same time period 
Both companies  shares fell sharply after Nov  6  when Avis lowered its full year earnings forecast in part due to damage from hurricanes  Still  Avis shares ended the year 93 2 percent above their June low  and Hertz shares climbed 133 percent in the same time period 
FREIGHT
Between June 1 and Dec  1  shares of  USA Truck  Inc  O USAK  soared 172 9 percent  while shares of  XPO Logistics  Inc  N XPO  and  Old Dominion Freight Line Inc   O ODFL  climbed more than 40 percent  J B Hunt Transport Services  O JBHT  shares rose 26 7 percent over the same period

 Home Depot  Inc  N HD  shares rose 16 3 percent during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season  In November  the home improvement retailer raised its 2017 profit and sales forecasts in response to increased demand for emergency and rebuilding supplies 
HOTELS
For several hotel operators  the increased demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the damage the storms wrought on their properties in affected areas 
From June 1 to Dec  1  shares of  Hyatt Hotels Corp   N H  jumped 25 8 percent  while La Quinta Holdings Inc  N LQ  climbed 24 5 percent  Shares of Marriott International Inc  O MAR    Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc  N HLT  and  Choice Hotels International Inc   N CHH  rose between 15 9 percent and 18 9 percent

36337,257852,SLB,GE breakup leaves it with best and worst performers,news,"By Alwyn Scott  Reuters     General Electric   NYSE GE  Co said on Tuesday it will spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil services firm Baker Hughes  effectively breaking up the 126 year old conglomerate which was once the most valuable U S  corporation and a global symbol of American business power  The slimmed down company will focus on jet engines  power plants and renewable energy  which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years   This is really the culmination of 10 years of observations I ve had about the company   said Chief Executive John Flannery  a GE veteran who took the helm in August with a mandate to revamp the company  Flannery s comments came on a conference call with investors and analysts  GE said its plan will strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt  building up cash and further shrinking GE Capital  Shareholders will receive 80 percent of the value of GE Healthcare as a tax free distribution of shares  GE shares jumped 8 7 percent to  13 86  on track for their best day in three years  Effective Tuesday  GE was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average  the iconic stock index of which it was a founding member in 1896   The company will spin off the profitable healthcare unit over the next 12 to 18 months  and sell its Baker Hughes stake over two to three years  GE will likely either need to hold an initial public offering of Baker Hughes  organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors  or find an entirely new investor to acquire its holding since the only two strategic buyers of its stake  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co  would have major antitrust risks in the oilfield services market  analysts said  In an interview  Flannery declined to rule out selling healthcare or the Baker Hughes stake to strategic buyers  but he said the company intended to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders benefit from future growth  The decision to divest does not mean GE dislikes the businesses  he said   It s quite the opposite  We re trying to get these out directly into our shareholders hands and in an environment where they can grow more quickly    GE pledged to preserve its 48 cent a year dividend until the healthcare unit is spun off  partially appeasing investors who have expressed concerns about the company s ability to pay it   L2N1SU17A  The moves  which end a year long strategic review  mirror changes that analysts had sought a year ago   GE said its plan to divest  20 billion in assets  is substantially complete   leaving a  simpler and stronger  company that it hopes will boost growth  operating profits and shareholder returns  Major shareholder Trian Fund Management supports GE s plans and believes that the initiatives will create  substantial value for shareholders   it said in a statement   The remaining businesses  share similar technologies and industrial markets  in contrast to limited synergies that exist with GE Healthcare   Fitch analyst Eric Ause said in a note  To view a graphic on GE s market capitalization under past 4 CEOs  click   BEST AND WORST  But the changes leave GE with some of its best  and worst performing units  Aviation has been highly profitable  but power business profit has tumbled as sales of plants and services have slowed  and renewable energy profit margins are less than 5 percent  a result of fierce price competition  Flannery said in the interview that he expected gas powered electricity generation to keep rising over the next 30 years  But new power plant sales will be weak  and frankly we re planning for that as sort of indefinite   Flannery said    We re making management actions now premised on we ve got to live in that world   he said   If it changes  great  but don t hope   The healthcare unit spinoff follows rival Siemens AG s floating its medical business as a separate company  Siemens Healthineers  in March  On Monday GE said it agreed to sell its distributed power unit for  3 25 billion to U S  buyout group Advent  GE also has agreed to shed its transportation unit  which makes railroad locomotives  GE bought Baker Hughes in 2017 and combined it with its own oil and gas equipment and services unit to create a new company in which GE owns 62 5 percent  The unit reported sales of  17 23 billion in 2017  GE estimated restructuring costs at between  800 million and  1 2 billion  and said it plans to reduce industrial net debt by about  25 billion by 2020 and maintain more than  15 billion of cash on its balance sheet  The company has foundered in key markets in recent years  and a foray into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in 2008  GE has since largely divested GE Capital  but lingering liabilities forced it to take a  6 2 billion charge last year  and begin setting aside  15 billion more in reserves against insurance claims  Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt  who ran the company for 16 years  from shortly before the 9

36338,257853,SLB,GE s determined makeover could dim deal prospects,news,"By Harry Brumpton  Reuters     General Electric  Co s  N GE  plan to divest  20 billion worth of assets may have bankers excited about contacting potential buyers  breaking off other big chunks of the conglomerate  and creating an M A bonanza   GE s message to dealmakers  Not so fast  The company is wedded to a plan it outlined Tuesday to sell 20 percent of its healthcare unit and distribute the other 80 percent to shareholders through a tax efficient spinoff  people familiar with management s thinking said  Tax concerns make GE wary of entertaining other options for its healthcare business  said the sources  who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations   A provision related to the majority stake GE owns in oil services company  Baker Hughes   N BHGE  led to the plan it announced on Tuesday to gradually sell the stake down over 2 3 years  they said  In an interview  GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery would not rule out selling the healthcare unit or the Baker Hughes stake  but said the company intends to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders can still benefit from future growth   Our intention is to take it out as a stand alone company   Flannery told Reuters when asked if a sale was a possibility   My world view is there s no such thing as ruling out any option  but that s not our intention   We want to get these out into shareholders hands where they can grow more quickly   GE s slow and steady divestiture plan tracks the approach it has taken under Flannery who took the helm last August  For instance  when GE announced plans to sell its transportation business to Wabtec in an  11 1 billion last month  it kept a chunk of the business for itself and shareholders  The company is open to smaller divestitures  and several are in process  including GE s lighting division  parts of its project finance unit Energy Financial Services  its aerospace parts group Middle River  and its offshore positioning systems unit Converteam  Those transactions will only generate between  1 billion and  3 billion each  people familiar with the businesses said  Altogether  GE will probably generate another  5 billion or so in cash through more marginal deals  The most problematic asset GE is trying to sell is its insurance business  which has incurred hefty charges  sparked shareholder lawsuits  and an investigation by U S  regulators  Insurance liabilities stood at  38 billion at the end of 2017  according to GE s annual report  though it is unclear how such a deal would be structured or valued  bankers said  TWO GEMS There is already interest in GE s two gems   its healthcare unit and Baker Hughes   but each has complications preventing an outright sale  In April  medical equipment maker Danaher Corp  N DHR  approached GE about potentially acquiring the life sciences division of its healthcare unit  a major source of sales that makes X ray machines and hospital equipment  according to a person familiar with the matter  The Wall Street Journal first reported Danaher s approach  GE did not entertain talks at the time and remains unconvinced that any offer would be able to match how much the tax efficient spinoff will earn for shareholders  the person said  Another acquirer that could express interest in the healthcare unit is Thermo Fisher Scientific  N TMO   according to a separate person familiar with the matter  But GE plans to put roughly  18 billion of debt and pension obligations on the spinoff company  something that could dampen enthusiasm among potential buyers  For Baker Hughes  instead of an outright sale  GE will likely either hold an initial public offering or organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors  The company plans to stick to a lockup agreement it struck when acquiring the stake to remain a co owner at least until 2019  the people said  Although the oil services industry has come under pressure from falling commodity prices  GE sees potential in the business from cost cuts and growing customer relationships  they said  Even if GE wanted to find a single buyer for the stake  it would be tough

36356,257871,SLB,Enrich Your Portfolio With 5 Oil Stocks For A Likely Q1 Beat,opinion,Following the oil crash toward the end of 2018 that took everyone by storm  crude ended up posting the biggest quarterly gain in a decade  With oil popping up to  60 55 a barrel  the March quarter witnessed the fastest rate of oil price hike since 2009  Needless to say  rising oil prices have buoyed investors  optimism on the sector s first quarter 2019 results Q1 Progress Report  Oil Treads on Growth TrajectoryA bearish outlook for Asian economies  anticipation of soft demand  increased inventories  waivers on Iranian sanctions and many other factors pulled WTI crude down to around  45 per barrel level during 2018 end  However  oil prices jumped around 32  to more than  60 a barrel by March end  Various factors have been responsible for crude s bullish run during the quarter under review The OPEC  deal has certainly been one of the major drivers behind the uptick in oil prices  OPEC and Russia led oil exporters  decision to cut crude oil supplies by 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  beginning January 2019 aided the stabilization of oil prices In addition to OPEC  induced supply slashes  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also tightened the commodity s fundamentals  Output from this major OPEC member fell from the 2015 level of 2 4 million bpd to 961 000 bpd in March 2019  This  in turn  hurt global oil supply  leading to a positive pricing pressure Contrary to the lower crude demand projections made last year  IEA s forecast during the concerned quarter stated that demand for oil will rise 7 2 million bpd through 2024  The worldwide oil demand in 2019 is estimated to be 100 5 million bpd  up 1 2  year over year  Despite the swell in electric cars and green initiatives  usage of oil in the petrochemicals and aviation industry will be a key demand driver  Around 30  of the demand will result from these factors  Moreover  the spike in demand for oil from China and India has been pushing up crude prices It goes without saying that most oil related stocks are thus poised to gain traction from the recovery in prices of this commodity Picture Thus FarThe  Energy  sector kicked off this earnings season on a decent note  So far  three of the S P 500 energy stocks  namely Schlumberger   NYSE SLB    Halliburton   NYSE HAL   and Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  have released their first quarter results  While each of these companies reported in line earnings  Halliburton and Schlumberger s top lines surpassed estimates The world s biggest oilfield service provider Schlumberger posted first quarter 2019 earnings of 30 cents per share on  7 9 billion of revenues   Read More   Halliburton s adjusted net income came in at 23 cents per share on revenues of  5 7 billion   Read More   Both Schlumberger and Halliburton expect the rebound in the international markets to continue where the drilling rig count is rising and the final investment decisions on their clients  projects are likely to bear fruition on oil price strength  Kinder Morgan not only reported higher year over year earnings and revenues  it also hiked its quarterly dividend by 25    Read More   With this week turning out to be one of the busiest this reporting cycle  investors are keenly awaiting results from energy bigwigs like ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   which are scheduled to announce financial results before the opening bell on Apr 26 Picking the Prospective Winners for Q1The encouraging dynamics of the oil industry suggest that there are a number of

36360,257875,SLB,Egdon Resources  Resolution CPR Published Ahead Of Farm Out,opinion,"We have re visited our conventional valuation of Egdon Resources PLC  LON EGRE  post the company s interim results  to end January 2019  and the recent resource assessment for Resolution  We also factor in a decrease in our short term gas price expectations  lower than previously forecast production for FY19 and the removal of the risked value for Biscathorpe 2 exploration  As a result  our RENAV is reduced by 1 2p share to 11 5p share  These reductions are partly offset by an increase in our valuation for Resolution  from 3 2p share to 7 1p share   driven by Schlumberger s 2019 resource assessment and our revised economic model  We continue to believe that significant uncertainty remains regarding the commerciality of Resolution ahead of further appraisal  but we believe recent industry interest in SNS Zechstein gas appraisal increases the likelihood of a farm out 

Resolution resource upgrade
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  has provided an assessment of un risked 2C recoverable gas  excluding Carboniferous  for the Resolution field at 206 4bcf  1C 100bcf and 3C 389bcf   versus Egdon s last published internal estimate of 2C 337bcf  We continue to believe that there is significant uncertainty around recoverable resource and hence commerciality ahead of further appraisal  Key resource uncertainties include limestone fracture porosity  matrix porosity and gas recovery factor  Egdon is actively looking for a farm in partner to fund the acquisition of 3D seismic  followed by an appraisal well 
Springs Road  Improved drilling performance
Egdon has a 14 5  carried interest in the Springs Road 1 shale gas appraisal well operated by IGas  Further details on the core and log analysis is expected in Q219  The drilling performance  rate of penetration  has been ahead of operator expectations and reports of gas indications in the Millstone Grit  deeper parts of the Bowland Shale and the Arundian Shale are encouraging  We expect to review our probabilistic UK shale valuation model as further details emerge from SR 1 
Valuation  Funded through to mid 2020
Based on our current forecasts  Egdon is funded through to the middle of CY20  with activity at Springs Road fully carried and planned 3D seismic at Resolution expected to be funded by a farm out  Our current valuation is 1 5p share for producing assets  cash and net of SG A  rising to 11 5p share if we include risked exploration potential  Maintaining our last published UK shale model  we estimate an indicative P50 value of c 100p share for Egdon s UK shale acreage of 188 000

36362,257877,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Chevron Tops Q1 Earnings  Exxon   TOTAL Flops,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices settled lower but natural gas futures gained 
On the news front  integrated majors ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM    Chevron   NYSE CVX   and TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   reported first quarter earnings  
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 1 2  to close at  63 30 per barrel  natural gas prices gained 3 1  for the week to finish at  2 566 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark pulled back from multi month highs after the Energy Department s latest inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly increase  The commodity s downward movement could also be attributed to the prevailing uncertainty in the market following President Donald Trump s statement that he asked OPEC to bring down prices 
Nevertheless  oil has climbed more than 40  this year  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices rebounded slightly from their three year lows despite a government report showing higher than expected increase in supplies  The gain could be attributed to weather associated tailwinds that might lead to robust heating demand  While the fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The largest publicly traded integrated energy company  ExxonMobil  reported weak first quarter 2019 results due to significant lower contributions from its downstream and chemical businesses  The supermajor s earnings per share of 55 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents  Moreover  the bottom line declined significantly from the year earlier figure of  1 09 Liquid production increased year over year to 2 327 million barrels per day  MMB D  from 2 216 MMB D  courtesy of the ramped up activities in the prolific Permian Basin  However  natural gas production was 9 924 BCF d  billions of cubic feet per day   down from 10 038 BCF d in the year ago period During the quarter under review  ExxonMobil generated cash flow of  8 5 billion from operations and asset divestments  down from almost  10 billion in the year ago quarter  This energy giant returned  3 5 billion to its shareholders through dividends  Following its significant investment in the prolific Permian Basin in the United States  the company s capital and exploration spending shot up 42  year over year to  6 9 billion   Read more  2     America s No  2 energy producer Chevron reported better than expected first quarter earnings  boosted by production gains  The U S  energy major reported earnings per share of  1 39  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 26  However  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy company s bottom line fell from the year ago profit of  1 90 on lower crude price realizations and drop in profits in its downstream business  which refines crude oil into fuels like gasoline and diesel oil You can see  Chevron s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 6 5  compared with last year s corresponding period to 3 038 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d    the second successive quarter where volumes exceeded 3 million barrels per day  The U S  output rose 21  year over year to 884 MBOE d while the company s international operations  accounting for 71  of the total  increased 1 7  to 2 154 MBOE d Chevron delivered a solid cash flow performance this quarter   an important gauge for the oil and gas industry   with  5 1 billion in cash flow from operations  up marginally from  5 billion a year ago    Read more  3     French oil major TOTALreported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of  1 02 per share   0 90 per share   lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 09 by 6 4   The bottom line also declined 6 4  from the year ago figure of  1 09 per share   0 89 per share   This decline was primarily due to softness in the prices of commodities compared with the previous year Total hydrocarbon production during the first quarter averaged 2 946 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  up 9  year over year  The increase was due to higher contribution from Egina in Nigeria  Kaombo North in Angola  Ichthys in Australia  and Yamal LNG in Russia  along with the integration of Maersk Oil  partially offset by natural field decline and deterioration of safety conditions in Venezeula TOTAL s 2019 upstream production is expected to increase 9  from a year ago  It expects the startup of lara 1 in Brazil  Kaombo South in Angola  Culzean in the U K   Johan Sverdrup in Norway and the ones already started in 2018 to boost production levels  In 2019  it aims to invest in the range of  15  16 billion and is targeting cost reduction of  4 7 billion   Read more  4     Independent refiner Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO   posted first quarter 2019 income of 34 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents  The topline of  24 3 billion also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  23 6 billion  The better than expected results can be attributed to higher average ethanol production volumes and the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant Valero returned  411 million to its shareholders  of which  36 million was used to repurchase around 414 000 shares of its common stock and award shareholders with dividends worth  375 million Valero expects capital expenditure of  2 5 billion for 2019 and 2020  Around 40  of the budget will be used in growth projects  Notably  the company s Houston alkylation unit and central Texas pipelines and terminals are projected to be completed in the second and third quarters of 2019  respectively  The Pasadena terminal  St  Charles alkylation unit and Pembroke cogeneration unit are expected to come online in 2020  Moreover  the company s Diamond Green Diesel expansion and Port Arthur Coker projects

Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents and the year ago quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents  Revenues increased to  1 6 billion from  1 4 billion in the year ago quarter  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 5 billion  The strong first quarter results were attributed to higher hydrocarbon production  backed by prolific plays like Bakken and Gulf of Mexico Quarterly hydrocarbon production was 299 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  up 17 3  year over year  Crude oil production increased from 134 thousand barrels per day in first quarter 2018 to 164 thousand barrels per day in first quarter 2019  Natural gas liquids production totaled 40 thousand barrels compared  up from 37 thousand barrels in the prior year quarter Quarterly net cash flow from operations was  238 million at the end of the first quarter  Hess  capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled  542 million  up 41 1  from  384 million in the prior year quarter  As of Mar 31  2019  the company had  2 300 million in cash   cash equivalents and  6 550 million in long term debt  The debt to capitalization ratio at the end of the quarter was 39 4    Read

36398,257913,SLB,Factors To Know Ahead Of Halliburton s  HAL  Q1 Earnings,opinion,Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is expected to release first quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Monday  Apr 22  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 23 cents on revenues of  5 5 billion In the preceding three month period  the major oilfield service provider  the consensus mark by 10 8  after robust international activity more than offset slowdown in the North American completion services demand that led to pricing pressure in the hydraulic fracturing business As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Houston  TX based company is on a firm footing  having gone past met the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells can continue winning ways by surpassing earnings estimate this time around too  However  our model indicates that world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   might not beat on earnings in the first quarter Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results Factors to Consider This QuarterE P Capital Discipline  Strong commodity prices typically lead to robust upstream activities  As exploration  drilling  and production picks up  oil service providers see a surge in their sales and profitability  Going by this logic  the first quarter   where oil prices rebounded more than 30  to the best quarterly performance in a decade   should have been a great one for oilfield service providers like Halliburton However  clients are taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Per the new paradigm in the energy sector  a disciplined capital expenditure strategy  resulting in free cash flow  is being prioritized over reckless spending beyond operating cash flows  Consequently  major upstream oil companies are now committed to investor returns rather than adding production by outspending cash flows  This has created an extremely challenging operating environment for the service providers as there is not enough incentive to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity hurts overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for Halliburton s upcoming earnings release Lower Rig Count  During the first quarter of 2019  the U S  oil rig count decreased by 69  from 885 to 816  despite the oil price surge  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest weakening North American activity in the January March timeframe  Halliburton  with sizable presence in the region  is expected to affected significantly on this sentiment Permian Takeaway Constraints  Pipeline takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian Basin seems to be another reason for apprehension about Halliburton s prospects  Halliburton warned that a slowdown in the oil and gas rich Permian Basin activity due to pipeline constraints will only alleviate during the second half of the year By now  it is well documented that serious logistical constraints in West Texas s Permian  super basin  is forcing operators in the region   especially those without committed pipeline capacity   to sell their produce at hefty discounts  This caused operators to slow down their drilling and production activity  impacting demand for oilfield services  In fact  there is a backlog of more than 4 000  in the Permian Basin   indicating a slowdown in well completion activity As a proof of the market challenges  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter Completion and Production adjusted operating income is pegged at  335 million  lower than  496 million reported in the previous quarter  To put things in perspective  the Completion and Production unit makes up more than three fourths of the oilfield service provider s total operating income Recovery in International Operations  One bright spot in the otherwise gloomy earnings outlook is the recovery in overseas markets  In the last quarter  Halliburton s international business delivered top line growth of 7   We expect the recovery to continue on the strength of the national oil companies who do not alter their budgets based on short term oil price fluctuations  While one can expect normal seasonality to impact revenues to a certain extent  we are looking for project activity improvements in geographies like Asia Pacific  Africa and the North Sea  Importantly  the order uptick should be associated with incremental margins from aggressive cost controls    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 82  Zacks Rank  Halliburton currently has a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be sure of the positive surprise Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton  here are some companies from the  space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   has an Earnings ESP of  1 88  and a Zacks Rank  1  The firm is

36401,257916,SLB,Schlumberger  SLB  Q1 Earnings Meet Estimates,opinion,"Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 38 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest oilfield services company would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Schlumberger  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  7 88 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 47   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 83 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Schlumberger shares have added about 31 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 7  
What s Next for Schlumberger 
While Schlumberger has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

36402,257917,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Schlumberger   Halliburton s Q1  ConocoPhillips  Asset Sale,opinion,It was a week where oil prices were near flat but natural gas futures tumbled to the lowest in almost three years On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   and Halliburton   NYSE HAL   reported in line earnings  While the North America business environment remains challenging  both the companies expect further uptick in international drilling activity  confirming the region s broad based recovery  Meanwhile  upstream biggie ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   agreed to sell its North Sea assets for  2 7 billion   Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures held almost unchanged to close at  64 per barrel  natural gas prices fell 6 4  for the week to finish at  2 49 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark was little changed even as the Energy Department s latest inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly draw   the first in a month  The government data also revealed that both gasoline and distillate inventories declined but the magnitude was less than expected Nevertheless  oil has climbed more than 40  this year  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals Meanwhile  natural gas prices plunged to their lowest since June 2016 as a result of record levels of production  While the fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The world s largest oilfield services provider  Schlumberger  reported first quarter 2019 earnings of 30 cents per share  excluding charges and credits     in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate courtesy of contributions from Integrated Drilling Services   IDS   projects in Saudi Arabia  India and Mexico  The bottom line  however  declined from 38 cents a year ago owing to lower contributions from directional drilling in the land market of North America  Decline in OneStim revenues from the continent s land regions added to the concerns Schlumberger added that explorers and producers are constrained by the reduction in capacity for borrowings and increase in cost of capital  Also  the explorers are facing constant pressure from investors for higher returns instead of production growth  The headwinds are likely to lower investments by explorers and producers in the land market of North America by 10  through 2019  added the world s largest oilfield service firm The company is  however  expecting an improvement in the international markets where the count of drilling rigs is rising and final

36437,257952,SLB,Just When They Needed It Most  Shale Deserts Oil Bears,opinion,"Oil bears  love affair with U S  shale has fizzled for now 
After nearly five years of facilitating short sellers who profited by keeping oil cheap  U S  crude drillers have woken up  refusing to overproduce like before 
The U S  oil rig count is falling week after week and production estimates by researchers in the government to Wall Street and the media show that new record highs in output may not be achieved as easily as before 
This is happening as bears already feel overwhelmed by a cocktail of bullish factors in oil that include relentless OPEC production cuts  rigid Trump administration sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian oil and a virtually easy money regime in the U S   assured by a Federal Reserve determined not to hike interest rates like before 
A Perfect Storm For Oil Bears
Add to that the notion of better than expected recovery in China s economy and oil demand this year  and the result is a perfect storm for traders and funds caught on the short side of the market 

New York traded West Texas Intermediate  the benchmark for U S  crude  is up 36  year to date  while its London peer Brent  the global gauge for oil  has gained 29   Both are at five month highs  with Brent just shy of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia s target of  70 per barrel which the Kingdom hopes will be triggered for its next aspiration of  80 and above 
John Kilduff  founding partner of New York energy hedge fund Again Capital  acknowledged that there s zero incentive for the shale industry to collude with oil bears when there s more economic sense for it to play to the wishes of OPEC s price hawks 
Yet  he believes the tight controls employed by U S  drillers now i e  prioritizing cashflow and shareholder dividend over impulsive production ramp ups that contributed to the market crashes of 2014 2016 and 2018 is a sign of the times 
Shale Drillers Pushed By Investors  Banks To Become Capital Generators
Said Kilduff 

 The shale guys are being squeezed by their investors and banks to become capital income generators  
 It s more like a delayed reaction on their part after the price collapse of late last year  They ve circled the wagons and regrouped  realizing it s just not in their best interest to add unnecessarily to activity  Unfortunately  those who ll suffer most from that decision will be the oil bears  

Whipsaw volatility in oil has rewarded both longs and shorts handsomely at intervals over the past five years  though it can be argued that the bears have profited more  given the frequency and intensity of the selloffs 
The trend may be shifting now 
Reuters  oil columnist John Kemp noted on Monday that hedge funds have boosted their bullish position in six major crude contracts by a total of 421 million barrels over the last 11 weeks 
More Pain Coming Up For Bears 
Added Kemp 

 Prospects for rapidly slowing production growth and resilient consumption have removed the bearish bias in the market  

Scott Shelton  energy futures broker at ICAP in Durham  N C   also thought there could be more pain for oil bears in the near term as bullish Commodity Trading Advisors  or CTAs  take positions on the other side 
Said Shelton 

 I think this week could be a strong one for oil as there is physical support and also there could be some roll yield chasing coming from the index world  
 We could also see additional CTA buying as they have a ton of bullets to fire overall  

Bloomberg said in a report that the dramatic surge in U S  shale production over the past five years was running into a combination of technical and financial issues 
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   two of the largest providers of oil services  expect a double digit drop in spending from drillers in the U S  and Canada this year  Layoffs will also become more common  with Devon Energy  NYSE DVN  set to slash its workforce by about a third due to pressure on spending 
On the technical end  there are problems caused by  interference  between newer oil sources called  child wells  and their  parent   Too close  and the child wells can turn out to be less prolific than their parent  Too far apart  and drillers can end up leaving oil in the ground 
Even so  Big Oil companies are getting excited about shale as smaller  independent drillers become more conservative  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   for instance  have their sights on extracting an additional million barrels each from the Permian  the most productive shale basin 
New Pipelines Could Return Bears To Dependence On Shale
There is every chance for U S  crude production to rebound later in the year when new pipeline capacity comes on stream to carry up to five million bpd of oil out of the shale basins  so that they can eventually be exported to Asia and elsewhere  U S  crude exports hit a record 3 6 million bpd last month  Getting those up will be crucial to achieving government forecasts for record high production of above 13 million bpd by next year 
Kilduff believed that s when U S  drillers will be more inclined to completely turn the spigots on 
He said 

 The dependence of oil bears on shale to pressure prices isn t over by any means  It s just been delayed  With full blown export potential  U S  drillers will focus on volume rather than just price  Eventually  you re going to see a V shaped recovery in the production and rig count  ",2019-04-02,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/just-when-it-was-needed-most-shale-deserts-the-oil-bear-200402969,200402969

36439,257954,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Good News For TransCanada  Enbridge,opinion,It was a week where oil prices settled above  60 per barrel for the first time this year  while natural gas futures continued to tumble On the news front  Canadian midstream players TransCanada Corporation   TO TRP   and Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   received positive news on their ambitious Keystone XL and Line 3 pipeline projects  respectively Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures rose 1 9  to close at  60 14 per barrel  natural gas prices lost 3 3  to  2 662 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark rallied to the highest in almost five months  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals Further to this  hefty draws in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  boosted bullish sentiment in the energy market  Data showing drillers in the United States removing oil rigs   an indicator of lower future output in North America   also contributed to the gains   However  natural gas prices slipped further on smaller than average decrease in supplies and continued strength in production  Also  with the traditional withdrawal season  when supplies fall on heating demand due to cold weather  ending in March  consumption is likely to decline in the near term Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Bringing in pleasant news for TransCanada  Donald Trump issued a new presidential permit in an attempt to kick start the much delayed Keystone XL project  While the decision was criticized by environmentalists  the industry players have lauded the move of permitting this significant pipeline project amid infrastructural woes in Canada and the United States The  8 billion Keystone XL pipeline  with a capacity of 830 000 barrels  was designed by Zacks Rank  2  Buy  TransCanada to improve oil extraction from Alberta s oil sands and the Bakken region  The initial phase of the pipeline project was completed in 2011  A proposal was made to add another 1179 miles to the 2100 mile long pipeline  The proposed extension was strongly opposed by environmentalists and politicians  owing to the risk of emitting greenhouse gases in transporting bitumen and crude to the United States You can see  While Trump s clearance should have eliminated all the uncertainties associated with the Keystone project  the green campaigners are still very much against the pipeline s construction  and have vowed to continue the legal fights and prospects  Although the presidential permit seeks to bring the 10 year environment review to closure  we believe that the project is still likely to face hurdles   Read more  2     Enbridge has finally received the green signal from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission   PUC   for its proposed C 9 billion Line 3 crude oil pipeline replacement project  The regulatory authority unanimously rejected the pending petitions of reconsideration of the pipeline s future  One of the petitions was from the state Commerce Department  which had teamed up with tribal and environmental groups to oppose the pipeline s approvals In February  the Minnesota Court of Appeals sent back the case to the regulatory authority for further proceedings  Notably  the approval came a few weeks after Enbridge said that it expected the project to be delayed by one year due to regulatory approval issues  Hence  the recent consent from the PUC is expected to cheer up investors as well as producers  who ll use the pipeline to ship their products from Canada to the United States The aging 1 660 kilometre Line 3  operating since 1968  connects Canadian producers to the U S  refineries  Currently  the pipeline operates at half of its capacity  Once the replacement project is completed  the pipeline with a 36 inch diameter will operate at its daily approved capacity of 760 000 barrels   Read more  3     Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  recently shipped its first NGL cargo from the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas  FLNG  project in Australia  Notably  the flagship project is a joint venture among Shell  Inpex Corporation  Korea Gas Corporation and Taiwan s CPC Corporation  with Shell being the chief operator  owning a 67 5  stake in the project Prelude will handle the production  liquefaction  storage and transfer of LNG at sea  and processing  exporting and condensation of liquefied petroleum gas  The facility has a production capacity of around 5 3 million tons per annum  mtpa  of liquids  with LNG accounting for 3 6 mtpa or 68  of the total capacity In another development  the energy supermajor  which acquired U K  power supplier First Utility to lower its carbon footprint  now plans to rebrand the latter as Shell Energy Retail  Additionally  Shell declared that entire electricity supplied by First Utility will now come from renewable sources  This implies powering more than 700 000 U K  homes with 100  renewable energy   Read more  4     Noble Energy Corporation   NYSE NBL   announced that it has acquired a 40  interest in Royal Dutch Shell s two offshore blocks in Colombia  The company will also operate the blocks  per the agreement  The financial details of the transaction are not yet disclosed  Courtesy of this purchase  Noble Energy will operate Caribbean COL 3 and GUA OFF 3 blocks  which cover more than 880 000 hectares Although Shell will retain the majority interest in these offshore blocks  Noble Energy has been entrusted with the authority to operate the oil rich offshore blocks  At present  Noble Energy operates offshore assets in West Africa and Eastern Mediterranean  The company s existing expertise and knowledge to operate offshore oil and gas assets will definitely help it to manage the offshore South American assets Both the companies are expected to invest nearly  100 million for the exploration and development of the offshore Columbian blocks  The exploration of these offshore assets will support Columbia s goal of increasing its existing reserves to a level that will cover at least 10 years of Columbian oil consumption   Read more  5     Tullow Oil  LON TLW  plc   OTC TUWOY    along with its

36444,257959,SLB,Schlumberger  SLB  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"The market expects Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 1  
Revenues are expected to be  7 84 billion  up 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 21  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger 
For Schlumberger  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Schlumberger will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schlumberger appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-slb-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200405944,200405944
36445,257960,SLB,Earnings Optimism Following Bank Results,opinion,"The positive results from JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  have legitimately raised hopes that the March quarter earnings results may not be as bad as many in the market had begun to expect   even if bank results don t offer a lot of read throughs to the broader economy 
JPMorgan s net interest income   the difference between what it gets from its lending activities and what it has to pay to its depositors   came in at  14 45 billion  up  9  from the same period last year  Driving the gains was strength in the bank s consumer facing business  where loan volumes and margins increased meaningfully  This helped offset a flattish showing on the commercial side and weakness in the capital markets business 
The capital markets weakness wasn t surprising  as management had earlier guided towards soft ish  numbers  which was in line with the secular trends of the last few years anyway  Trading revenues were down double digits  both on the fixed income and equity sides  partly offset by gains on the investment banking side  Though weak  JPMorgan s capital markets and investment banking results were moderately better than expected  a function of low expectations reflecting the impact of a combination of factors like the government shutdown  subdued management guidance and tough comparisons to the year earlier period  
This has read through for Citigroup  C  and Bank of America  BAC  that are on deck to report results on Monday and Tuesday  respectively  This likely raises the market s hopes for Goldman Sachs  GS   which reports on Monday and is a pure play investment bank which has been struggling with its fixed income  currencies and commodities  FICC  franchise over the last few years 
The strength in JPMorgan s investment banking business is particularly notable for Goldman  whose advisory business has been in the top tier all along  even as the FICC unit lost its standing following the global financial crisis  Goldman s new leadership has been trying to pivot the firm s trading business away from the legacy trajectory and more toward lower risk and relatively more stable trading flows  This strategy shift will take a while to fully take shape  but the market will be looking for signs that it is moving in that direction 
The Growth Challenge 
Regular readers know that overall expectations for 2019 Q1 is for an earnings decline on the S P 500 index  the first since the middle of 2016  A big part of this earnings decline is because of the very tough comparisons to the year earlier period  which was boosted by the tax cut legislation 
We see this growth challenge in otherwise positive bank results as well  with JPMorgan s Q1 up  5 4  on  4 4  higher revenues  while Wells Fargo s earnings and revenues were modestly below the year earlier levels  That said  the better than expected results at both of these big banks have helped improve the growth picture modestly relative to what was expected before Friday morning  And if we aggregate these positive surprises to the entire S P 500 index  then it is reasonable to envision a Q1 earnings growth pace that may not be negative  after all 
We will have a good sense of the actual Q1 earnings growth picture at the end of the week after having seen results from another 49 S P 500 companies  taking the full tally of results by then to 78 index members  29 index members reported through Friday morning  
The tally isn t just comprised of the remaining banks and brokers  but rather a diverse cross section of the broader index  ranging from Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   NFLX  to Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   SLB  and IBM  IBM      
Expectations for 2019 Q1   the Initial Earnings Report 
Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  4  from the same period last year on  4 5  higher revenues  If actual 2019 Q1 earnings growth turns out to be negative  it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016 
Driving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad based margin pressures across all major sectors  with net margins for the index of 11  down from 12  in the year earlier period and 11 8  in the preceding quarter  The Utilities sector is the only one that is expected to have unchanged net margins in 2019 Q1 relative to the year earlier period  with margins expected to be lower for all of the remaining 15 sectors 
Q1 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit earnings declines for 5 sectors  including Energy and Technology  For the Technology sector  Q1 earnings are expected to be down  10  from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues and 270 basis points compression in net margins 
The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 

The growth picture for the Finance sector has improved following the better than expected JPMorgan and Wells Fargo results  with total earnings of the sector now expected to be up  2 8  from the same period last year on  6 9  higher revenues 
Q1 Scorecard  as of Friday  April 12th  2019 
Including Friday s JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reports  we now have Q1 results from 29 S P 500 companies  Total earnings for these 29 companies are down  3 5  from the same period last year on  3 8  higher revenues  with 79 3  beating EPS estimates and 58 6  beating revenue estimates   
Q1 growth for these 29 companies is tracking notably below what we had seen in the recent past and positive revenue surprises appear also to be on the weak side  as the comparison charts below show 

The growth comparisons  left hand chart  are obviously tough  and likely won t get any better as they move into the heart of this reporting cycle  but a bigger proportion of this admittedly early cohort of companies are beating EPS and revenue estimates relative to what we had seen in the preceding period from the same companies 
We will see if this trend continues through the remainder of this reporting cycle 
The chart below shows earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2019 Q1  the blended growth picture  contrasted with what we had in the preceding four quarter and what is expected in the following three quarters 

Expectations for 2019 Q2 and the following quarters will evolve as companies report Q1 results and provide commentary about ground level business conditions  We will be keeping a close eye on this revisions trend

36483,257998,SLB,Cana Woodford   Mississippian Witness Decline In Oil Rigs,opinion,"In its weekly release  Baker Hughes  a GE company  BHGE  reported a drop in weekly rig count in the United States 
More on the Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued at the end of every week since 1944  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
A change in the Houston based oilfield services player s rotary rig count affects demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG    
Details
Total U S  Rig Count Decreases  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1026 in the week ended Mar 15  down from the prior week tally of 1027  This marked a decline in the count for four weeks in a row   
Despite rig count slipping to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  it has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  The current national rig count is higher than the prior year quarter s 990 
The number of onshore rigs totaled 1001  down from 1004 in the previous week  However  the tally for offshore activities totaled 22  in line with the prior week  Three rigs operated in the inland waters  up from the count of one in the prior week   
U S  Removes One Oil Rig  Oil rig tally was 833  down from 834 in the week ended Mar 8  With this  the tally for oil drilling rigs fell to the lowest mark since April 2018 
However  the current total  far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is higher than 800 a year ago  
Natural Gas Rig Count Flat in the United States  The natural gas rig count of 193 is in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 8   
Moreover  like oil  the count of rigs exploring the commodity is above the prior year quarter s 189  Per the latest report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is almost 88  below the all time high of 1 606 hit in 2008 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 54 units  down from the previous week s tally of 56  However  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations also known as shale formations  increased by an unit to 972 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM  Rig Count Flat  The GoM rig count is 22 units  of which 18 were oil directed  The count was in line with the prior week s tally 
Conclusion
Five oil drilling rigs were removed from Cana Woodford basin while Mississippian basin witnessed the removal of three oil rigs  resulting in the drop in weekly rig count 
Investors should note that oil prices are likely to fall in 2019 from the prior year  Owing to this  explorers and producers have decided to lower capital expenditure in 2019  Thus  conservative investments in upstream activities might affect demand for rigs  Hence  drillers may continue to lower oil rig count in the coming weeks 
Despite the pessimism  there are a couple of upstream energy players like Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO   and Apache Corp    NYSE APA   that investors could keep an eye on  Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

	Financial stocks have been under pressure since the Fed announced a moratorium on rate hikes for 2019  However  today they bounced back  along with tech and energy 
	The S P continues to dance around 2800  It slipped slightly below the mark yesterday  but came roaring back today with a 0 72  advance to 2818 46  The NASDAQ was up 0 71  to 7691 52  These were the first positive closes since last Thursday

	 While I m hopeful a direction is chosen this week  we could just chop around for a couple days before a direction is chosen  We have been stuck in this 2800 area for most of the month  so it would be no shocker to stay here a bit longer

36513,258028,SLB,Baker Hughes clinches integrated services contract for PNG gas field,news,"By Ron Bousso LONDON  Reuters    Baker Hughes  now part of  General Electric   N GE   has won a major contract to provide a wide range of services to develop Papua New Guinea s first offshore gas field which is sees as a new model to help producers adapt to a world of low oil prices  GE Oil and Gas completed its merger with Baker Hughes last month to become the world s second largest oilfield services company  bringing together traditional drilling and pumping gear with technology such as software  sensors and three dimensional printing  The contract in Papua New Guinea  PNG   worth several hundred million dollars  contrasts with the traditional model where a company awards various parts of field development separately to different providers  It comes as the global oil and gas industry slowly emerges from a three year rout that brought new field developments to a near standstill  creating intense competition among oil industry service companies for contracts  Under the PNG contract BHGE will provide services to Australian exploration and production firm Twinza for the development of the Pasca A gas condensate field ranging from the initial stages of well drilling and appraisal through to production and gas processing  executives from the two companies said  Applying the integrated suite of services together with advanced technology can save companies up to 5 percent in a sector where projects often involve billions in investment  according to BHGE Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli   The price of oil continues to fluctuate  Capex spending is a moving target at the moment so productivity cost per barrel has to be the focus to get projects to a final investment decision   Simonelli told Reuters in an interview  In an industry historically plagued by cost overruns and project delays  the  fullstream  model removes logistical delays such as the late arrival of vessels  or the needs to hold several tendering competitions for contracts and adapt to different equipment standards  according to Visal Leng  head of BHGE Asia Pacific  Simonelli said there were  hundreds of millions  of dollars  associated with the development of the project   but did not give an exact figure for the contract  BHGE is already working with some of the world s top oil companies on using its integrated services  including a large project with  BP   L BP  in the Gulf of Mexico  Simonelli said  The integrated service model  also used by BHGE s larger rival Schlumberger  N SLB   means that national oil companies will become less dependent on the expertise of the world s top oil and gas companies such as  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  and Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  for the development of fossil fuel resources  Evercore analyst James West said   DECISION NEXT YEAR Twinza is expected to make a final investment decision  FID  for the Pasca A project in early 2018 after drilling one more appraisal well this year   The first phase of the field development will produce 14 000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids  NGLs  extracted together with the gas  Twinza Managing Director Huw Evans said  The gas will then be reinjected into the ground until the second phase of the project   The Pasca A development would be profitable  way below the current oil price  of around  52 a barrel  according to Evans  BHGE will also extend a credit line to Twinza to fund the appraisal of the field ahead of the final investment decision  A decision to go ahead with the development of Pasca A would make it one of the few projects expected to be given the go ahead in 2017 and 2018 as oil prices recover only slowly  despite a decision by OPEC and other producers to reduce their output  
 There was a lot of optimism at the end of 2016 with the actions OPEC took  Some of the optimism is being pushed to the right and you re seeing a progressive shift in some of the projects and people waiting a little longer for stability in the context of lower for longer  oil prices   or simply lower   Simonelli said ",2017-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-baker-hughes-clinches-major-integrated-services-contract-515663,515663

36515,258030,SLB,Meth  coke and oil  A drug boom in the Texas shale patch,news,"By Liz Hampton MIDLAND  Texas  Reuters    When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility  he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine  The 32 year old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing   It s easy to get back into that mentality   said Forsythe  of Midland  Texas  who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015   I d work 24 hours     I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic   Forsythe s experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation s shale oil boom   a parallel increase in substance abuse  drug crime and related social ills  While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide  it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U S  production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation s most dangerous sectors   with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries  according to 2015 federal statistics  Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers  according to drug counselors  hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas  the epicenter of the U S  shale sector  As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010  law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime  In Midland and Ector counties  home to many Permian Basin oil workers  state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine   up from less than four pounds in 2010  Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts  but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused   often to soften the crash after taking stimulants  drug addicts and counselors said  Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016  to 942 from 491  according to police data  In neighboring Odessa  total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016  to 1291 from 756  according to Odessa Police Department data  The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch  before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014  Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees  For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials  tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U S  Department of Transportation  Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries  Schlumberger NV  N SLB    Halliburton Co   N HAL  and  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  declined to comment  Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy    Pioneer Natural Resources  Co   N PXD  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  did not respond to requests for comment  The American Petroleum Institute  an industry trade group  declined to comment  LONG HOURS   ON METH Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse  many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay  said drug counselors  local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions  More than a third of clients at Midland s Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry  said Executive Director Steve Thomason  Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse  Thomason said   People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight   he said  Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment  often leased at high daily rates  runs through the night  and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations  Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized  Springboard s admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016  he said  The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period  according to data from energy services firm  Baker Hughes   N BHGE    Corporal Steve LeSueur  a spokesman for the Odessa police  said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources   The jail has been full   he said   A lot of crimes that are committed are drug related   simple property crimes  forgeries to feed their drug habits   METH AND MURDER Some offenses are more severe  In 2016  Shawn Pinson  an employee of a well construction company  was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug related dispute  The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine  police records show  The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder  according to an autopsy  At his trial  witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield  according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case  Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney  Michele Greene  did not respond to a request for comment   When oil jobs are plentiful  companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse  said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield   These oilfield bosses   they party  too   Forsythe said   As long as you re getting the job done and not making a scene  they won t drug test you    One recovering addict  who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry  said he was often high during long haul trips driving trucks transporting oil    I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch   he said   It ended up running me to the ground

36516,258031,SLB,The next oil major  Service firm Schlumberger s big bet on production,news,"By Liz Hampton HOUSTON  Reuters    The world s largest oilfield services company  Schlumberger NV  N SLB   is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers  oil and gas projects   investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise  The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions  oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts  the company has told investors  The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project   effectively locking out the firm s competitors  Schlumberger s gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry  as rivals including  General Electric  Co s  N GE  unit  Baker Hughes   N BHGE  say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies  The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk  giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail  The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly  Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures  according to its financial filings  Traditionally  oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects  they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs  Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services  such as well design  along with technology and staff to run rigs   Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business  Despite early setbacks  Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division  called Schlumberger Production Management  since its launch in 2011  Last year  it generated  1 4 billion in revenue  It had investment of  2 6 billion as of June 30  Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer  The company s investments have the firm co managing about 230 000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016   about as much as one of the largest U S  independent producers   Pioneer Natural Resources   N PXD    This year  the company stepped up the financing role  opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures  The company has not disclosed the size of the fund  Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as  Chevron  Corp  CVX  and  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM   Two of Schlumberger s newest partnerships   a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA  BA YPFD    involve decision making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers  In June  Schlumberger agreed to invest  700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp  and First Exploration   Production that would require global oil prices of between  50 to  60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit  research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July  Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range   COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS  As Schlumberger s production business has grown  it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output  according to interviews with customers  partners  investors and former Schlumberger executives  Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute  390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina s Vaca Muerta shale field  which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell  AS RDSa    Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers   He described the enterprise as  a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers  in remarks to investors in April   Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is  not significantly changing the risk profile     the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature  of the oil and gas industry    CAPABILITY AND CASH   Investors say Schlumberger  which held  6 22 billion in cash and short term investments at June 30  is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long term projects  As both project manager and service provider  Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations  said Mike Breard of Dallas based wealth management firm Hodges Capital  which invests in oilfield service companies    I like the long term aspect of it   the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work  and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator   he said   British based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC  L SOU  was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs  said the chief of British based natural gas explorer   Schlumberger will get 27 5 percent of revenue from the oil produced    We re smaller and entrepreneurial  Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash  That s the nature of the partnership   Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview   The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end    It s a  50  million  or  60 million bet for them so far   Parsons said   Schlumberger s appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals  Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about  10 million in financing to Twinza Oil s first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea  supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field    It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing   Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said   Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield  unlike some of Schlumberger s joint investments with producers   RISK AND LOSS  In 2014 and 2015  Schlumberger took nearly  400 million in combined write offs on oil production investments  including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed   It also is owed about  900 million by Ecuador  In July  the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another  1 billion in the venture   Schlumberger hasn t commented on the South American nation s disclosure  It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for  150 million in bills  It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to  4 9 billion over 20 years   The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships   
The firm s production division  used to focus on production management of well understood low risk oil fields   said Colin Davies  a Bernstein oilfield services analyst   Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures  ",2017-09-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-next-oil-major-service-firm-schlumbergers-big-bet-on-production-526725,526725

36534,258049,SLB,Options Trades Based On SPY Win Rate,opinion,"Here are some trade options ideas 
When the SMA 50 is greater than 100 and When the Williams  R crosses below  50  enter 
When the Williams  R crosses above  50  exit 
For SPY  there was an 89 7  win rate  with avg rate of 0 33  per trade  Currently  21  of SPY stocks fit these conditions 
Here are the first 30 actionable trades based on this  ranked on highest percent win rate 

These include highly liquid underlyings 
Let s go over 8 option trades that may be promising in light of the above 
First  let s look at the highest winner  ALGN  Align Technology   There is relatively low volatility here now  First  I put on a calendar trade  15 MAR 18 APR   250 call strike  and also put on a vertical in 18 APR selling the 290 280 put credit spread  bullish   If the stock goes down a little  stays the same or goes up  one would make money  BPR is about  1750 

Here is the P L graph

Next look at HOG  Harley Davidson   Here there is higher volatility so we open a butterfly  in 17 MAY 2018  we buy a CALL with buying 5 contracts of the  35 strike call  selling 10 contracts of the 37 5 call and buying of the  40 strike call  You risk very little  several hundred dollars  to make a  500  1000 if the stock stays within a fairly narrow range  and on avg  it moves 3  or about  1 2 increase 

And the P L

For the third trade  let s look at the always fashionable BABA  Ali Baba   Here we have a low volatility situation  so we ll put on a calendar AND a diagonal  Start with the  165 strike call calendar selling 3 of the 15 MAR calls and buying 3 of the 18 APR calls  Then add a diagonal  selling 2 MAR 15  200 puts and buying 2 of the MAR 22  165 puts 
This way  you benefit again  from rising volatility  time  and a slight decrease  no change  and increase in the price of the stock  giving you a very high probability trade that had a high probability to begin with  The trade 

And the P L 

Next  we have BIDU  which has high implied volatility  Here we can put on a BROKEN WING butterfly  which will benefit from decreased volatility  time and can profit in all scenarios except for a large decrease in the stock  For 18 APR  Buy 3 of the 180 Put  sell 6 of the 175 put  and buy 3 of the 160 put 

The P L 

Next  we have AYI  Acuity Brands   Again  we have a higher volatility situation  so we put on a broken wing butterfly  For 17 MAY  buy 2 of the 140 puts  sell 4 of the 135 puts  and buy 2 of the 120 puts 

The P L 

Next let s look at SLB  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB    Again  volatility is somewhat high so we put on a broken wing butterfly  For 18 APR  buy 5 of the  50 strike puts  sell 10 of the  47 5 puts and buy 5 of the  40 puts 
 
Here is the P L 
Next let s look at EFX  Equifax  NYSE EFX    This too has relatively high volatility  so again we put on a broken wing butterfly  For 29 MAR  buy 3 of the  120 puts  sell 6 of the 114 puts and buy 3 of the  100 puts ",2019-02-19,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sloperules-options-trades-200389478,200389478
36535,258050,SLB,U S  Targets OPEC Oil Autonomy As Production Cuts Bear Fruit,opinion,"Two proposed U S  legislations are threatening to deprive Saudi Arabia and Russia of autonomy in their oil policy  just as the OPEC  collaboration between the two countries brings crude back into a bull market 
The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  NOPEC   approved on Feb  7 by a U S  Congressional panel  and the Defending American Security From Kremlin Aggression Act  DASKA   originally proposed last year and revised a week ago by Congress  will have different market outcomes if enforced 
NOPEC could push oil prices lower by hindering Saudi coordinated production cuts  DASKA  on the other hand  could send crude rallying by issuing sanctions on Russian energy projects 
Both are bipartisan bills meaning they are supported by Republicans as well as Democrat lawmakers and both need White House initiative for action 
But while their outcomes may be different  the two bills pursue the same agenda  preserving U S  interests and energy policy over that of any nation 
NOPEC Strikes At Heart Of OPEC
Of the two  NOPEC in particular could inhibit the OPEC group by undermining the production policies that have been at the heart of the cartel s six decade long oil market management 

NOPEC s timing also couldn t be worse  coming just as the Saudi Russian oil price collaboration was beginning to bear fruit despite its inequities  From a Christmas Eve low of under  43 per barrel  U S   West Texas Intermediate crude has rallied nearly 25 percent this year to above  56 this week  U K  Brent has gone from under  51 to above  66 in the same period 
Julian Lee  a London based oil strategist for Bloomberg First Word  wrote in his weekend column that the so called OPEC  production cut pact was  standing on a single leg  the Saudis   and  starting to look a bit shaky  without adequate Russian support 
Lee cited January data that showed Saudi output at 10 213 million barrels per day versus a pledged 10 3 million bpd  while Russian production cuts came in at 42 000 bpd against a promised curtailment of 50 000 60 000 bpd 
OPEC  Deal Still Fragile
Lee added 

 It is clear that  while one leg is functioning strongly  the other is bearing little of the weight of the deal   and that could spell trouble for the future  
 Unless somebody lights a rocket under demand growth   and even a U S  China trade deal may not be enough to do that   the OPEC  output agreement is going to need at least two strong legs to stand on  

New York based consultancy Energy Intelligence noted in its weekly newsletter that despite its name  NOPEC reaches beyond OPEC  allowing the U S  Justice Department to target any state for acting  collectively or in combination with any foreign state  to  limit production or distribution of oil  natural gas or product   attempting  to set or maintain a price  for those commodities  or taking  any action in restraint of  their  trade  
The consultancy added 

 By threatening the key lever by which producer states  extract value from their most vital resource and theoretically dictating production policies the bill undermines producer notions of national sovereignty  Under a worst case scenario  if aggressively implemented  the law could deliver a seismic shock to the global economy  

NOPEC s Implications Could Trigger New Oil Crash
This is because a world without restraint on energy output could trigger another oil price collapse  just like in the fourth quarter of 2018 and through much of 2014 2017  The NOPEC bill would appear to discourage OPEC members from withholding spare capacity from the market as mere suspicion of collusion to use such capacity to influence prices could make them a target for violation pleas 
The White House has so far said it was only studying whether to support NOPEC  President Donald Trump seems apt in taking on OPEC with just his tweets  though there s no telling what such a powerful law could help him achieve 
Washington s OPEC allies in the Mideast Gulf had hoped a Trump led White House would reset relations after earlier tensions under the Obama administration  But U S  lawmakers  frustration with Saudi Arabia over the Yemen war  as well as Riyadh s apparent involvement in the murder of Saudi journalist and U S  resident Jamal Khashoggi  instead created an environment that would seem to favor the passage to NOPEC 
Proposed Legislations Could Cost America Too
But NOPEC could also be costly to U S  Saudi trade  threatening the U S  s own energy superpower ambitions by affecting Riyadh s investments in the United States  not to mention critical U S  arms sales to the Kingdom 
Similarly  in DASKA s case the victims could go beyond Russia if that bill passes  It could include BP  LON BP   which has already invested over  17 billion in Russia and has a near 20 percent stake in Rosneft  OTC OJSCY   In addition to this  BP recently agreed to jointly explore two additional oil and gas license areas in Russia together with Rosneft  Shell  LON RDSa  and Repsol  MC REP   meanwhile  are also looking for new projects with Gazprom Neft  LON SIBNq   including in West Siberia and on the Russian Pacific Coast 
The potential of DASKA and like sanctions have also prompted Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  not to pursue new energy ventures in Russia

36554,258069,SLB,Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling,news,"By Swetha Gopinath and Liz Hampton  Reuters    In today s U S  shale fields  tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth  The sensors are leading Big Oil s mining of so called big data  with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages  managing supplies and identifying safety hazards  The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas  But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies   one of many cost cutting efforts spurred by the two year downturn in crude oil  CLc1  prices  ConocoPhillips  N COP  says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas  By comparing data from hundreds of sensors  its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed  accelerating the extraction of oil  said Matt Fox  ConocoPhillips  executive vice president for strategy  exploration and technology  It is just one application  but if applied to the more than 3 000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin  those small sensors could lead to  billions and billions of dollars  in savings  Fox said in an interview   We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business   he said   And everywhere we look there are applications for this   The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely  Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off the shelf and custom programs  along with data repositories  The Houston based producer s employees use Tibco Software Inc s Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites  Tibco declined to discuss its pricing  Services firms including Schlumberger NV  N SLB  and  General Electric  Co  N GE  oil and gas unit sell sensor equipped gear  data repositories and software to improve producers  decision making   Back when oil traded at more than  100 a barrel   before the price crash in 2014   data analysis was an  afterthought  for most oil firms  said Binu Mathew  who oversees digital products at GE Oil   Gas  Now   with prices at about  43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about  26 in early 2016    the efficiency aspect is far  far more important   Mathew said  FINDING HIDDEN VALUE A survey by Ernst   Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than  100 million each in data analytics during the past two years  Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology  the survey found  Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems  according to firms selling and buying data driven technology  Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data  Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors  said Duane Cuku  vice president of sales for rig technology at  Precision Drilling  Corp  TO PD    The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well   and the performance and safety of his crews   as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls   Cuku said  Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells  A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil  Abhishek Gaurav  a petroleum engineer for closely held Texas Standard Oil  said he uses big data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore   Using Spotfire  the same program utilized by Conoco  Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion  production and geological variables   such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation  The technique  Gaurav said  has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours   and resulted in better decisions   We found value in properties when many other teams did not   he said  RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA Some of the information craved by oil firms isn t so easy to gather or analyze   Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling  for instance  are often not digitized  Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats  making integration and analysis a challenge   General Electric and its oil and gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms  and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients   GE sees huge potential for market growth  A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally  and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision making  the study found  Getting the industry more fully connected will take time   There is a huge amount of data prep  data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive   said Kate Richard  chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy   She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away  Oklahoma City based Warwick   which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas   is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California  Richard said

36570,258085,SLB,Energy Firms Step Into 2019 With Caution  Capex Cuts Galore,opinion,As we know  2018 was a tumultuous year for the Energy sector  with most of the oil and gas companies taking a beating amid commodity price volatility due to supply glut  U S  China trade tussle  weakening demand outlook and economic headwinds  West Texas Intermediate started the year just above  60 per barrel of oil and touched multi year highs of more than  76 in early October  However  the rally was pretty short lived  with the commodity plunging around 30  since then The recent weakness in the commodity prices has made the energy companies to rethink their strategies and consider capex cuts once again  Notably  after following capital discipline during the crude downturn  from mid 2014 to 2016   energy companies again resorted to boost their capital expenditure since 2017  However  pullback in the commodity price has convinced explorers and producers to take a relatively conservative approach on capital expenditure programs again this year  Instead of raising their capital outlays  the energy companies are now finding it more prudent to focus on shareholder value maximizationRemodeling of portfolio and strategies undertaken during the slump period made the companies more resilient to reduced crude prices  with many firms managing to achieve break even at a minimum oil price of  50 a barrel  However  renewed concerns regarding economic slowdown and slower U S  shale production growth rate  along with weakening oil demand are indications that crude prices may fall further   The companies are thus looking to cut down on spending  develop sophisticated technologies and generate strong cash flow from operations  Producers in the American shale resources are not planning to allocate money for drilling new wells this year but will instead possibly allocate their capital budget for drilled but uncompleted wells U S  Firms Trim Capex Amid Growing CrisisRecently  two oilfield service giants Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   and Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   released weaker year over year earnings  In response to changing market dynamics  both the companies are looking to cut down on spending  Schlumberger has set its 2019 capital budget in the range of  1 5  1 7 billion  lower than last year s  2 2 billion  Halliburton has also slashed its 2019 capital budget by 20  and now plans to spend  1 6 billion Drilling contractor Nabors Industries Limited   NYSE NBR   has also planned to restrict its 2019 capital spending at  400 million versus expected capital expenditure of  500 million in 2018   Read More   Permian pure play Parsley Energy  Inc    NYSE PE   also chopped its 2019 capital program to  1 350  1 550 million  which is lower than the updated 2018 capital expenditure guidance of  1 650  1 750 million   Read More   Parsley carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  Corporation has also lowered its 2019 capex budget from the 2018 level and now expects the same within  4 3  4 7 billion Amid the recent oil and natural gas liquids  price decline  Antero Resources Corporation has lowered its 2019 drilling and completion capital budget  and now expects the same in the range of  1 1  1 25 billion Oklahoma based upstream player Gulfport Energy Corporation expects 2019 outlay in the band of  565  600 million  lower than the 2018 level of  814 million   Read More   Very recently  EQT Corporation  NYSE EQT  also estimated its 2019 capital program in the band of  1 9  2 billion  lower than 2018 s anticipated spending of  2 4 billion Oklahoma based upstream player Chesapeake Energy Corporation   NYSE CHK   also plans to trim its budget level in 2019 by reducing rig counts by more than 20   from 18 to 14  Houston based Goodrich Petroleum Corporation has also cut its 2019 investment by  40 million and now plans to spend roughly  90  100 million Canadian Firms Also Facing Capex CrunchAs we know  pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil  forcing producers to sell their products at a discounted rate  While oil production is surging in Canada  the country s exploration and production companies remain out of favor  primarily due to the scarcity of pipelines  Moreover  infrastructural bottlenecks have resulted in a supply glut situation  Reeling under discounted crude prices and pipeline crisis  the Canadian energy sector is struggling to find a path to growth Considering the current state of affairs in the Canadian oil industry and Alberta government s plans to curb output  many Canadian players have slashed their capital expenditure budgets for 2019 Amid the growing crisis  one of the country s leading energy companies  Canadian Natural Resources Limited   TO CNQ   slashed its capital budget by C 1 billion  The company s 2019 capex is now estimated at C 3 7 billion  down 20  from the projected investment in 2018 and well below its preferred range of C 4 7 C 5 billion   Read More   Soon after  Canadian integrated firm Cenovus Energy Inc  also trimmed its 2019 spending levels by 4  and now plans to invest within C 1 2 C 1 4 billion Another integrated company Husky Energy Inc  also revised down its capex forecast to C 3 3 C 3 5 billion from prior guidance of C 3 7 billion Calgary based Crescent Point Energy Corporation   TO CPG   also chopped 2019 capital expenditure by around C 500 million  or 30   from a year ago  Crescent Point now forecasts 2019 capex in the band of C 1 2 C 1 3 billion   Read More   Very recently  Canadian oil sands producer MEG Energy Corporation also halved its 2019 capex to a maximum of C 275 million Wrapping Up With oil price volatility on the rise amid concerns over weakening demand  logistical constraints  U S  Sino trade tiff  global recession and financial turmoil  we appreciate the energy companies  efforts to revise their strategies and slash capex budgets

36572,258087,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Halliburton s Q4  Eni s ADNOC Deal   More,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices ended lower 
On the news front  oilfield service major Halliburton   NYSE HAL   reported fourth quarter earnings that outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while Italy s Eni S p A    NYSE E   was awarded a 20  share in state owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company s   ADNOC   refining subsidiary 
Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged down 0 7  to close at  53 69 per barrel  natural gas prices plunged 8 7  to  3 178 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark fell for the first time in four weeks on IMF s lower global growth forecast for 2019 and signs of economic slowdown in China   one of the world s biggest oil user  EIA s inventory release showing a surprise weekly build in crude stockpiles also contributed to the losses 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices registered a steep weekly decline following forecasts of warmer weather in February  which could impact the heating fuel s demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Oilfield services behemoth Halliburton reported higher than expected fourth quarter profit on robust international activity  This more than offset slowdown in the North American completion services demand that led to pricing pressure in the hydraulic fracturing business The world s biggest provider of hydraulic fracking noted that for operators in North America  where oil production has reached record levels  it s more about the returns and not growth  The volatility in the commodity price has convinced explorers and producers to take a relatively conservative approach on capital expenditure programs  Meanwhile  Halliburton is witnessing steady recovery in its international business In response to the changing market dynamics  the company is looking to cut down on spending  develop sophisticated technologies and generate strong cash flow from operations   Read more  2     Eni S p A  recently inked a Share Purchase Agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company   ADNOC   for acquiring 20  stake in its refining business  for a cash price of around  3 3 billion  marking one of the largest ever refineries related transactions  Austrian oil and gas producer OMV AG also acquired 15  stake in the business for around  2 5 billion  Following the closing of the transaction  ADNOC will retain the rest of the interest in the refining unit ADNOC s refining business is one of the largest businesses in the world with a refining capacity of 922 000 barrels per day  BPD   ADNOC operates three refineries in Ruwais East  Ruwais West and Abu Dhabi  Notably  the Ruwais complex has the fourth highest refining capacity in the world  The refining assets of ADNOC are strategically placed to supply Asian  African and European markets  The deal  which is expected to close in third quarter 2019  values the refining business at around  19 3 billion The deal is expected to boost Eni s existing global refining capacity of 548 000 BPD by 35   It will further reduce Eni s refining break even target margin by 50   The move can also enable the company to gain higher margin and diversify the downstream businesses via entering UAE s downstream market  Eni already has a presence in UAE s upstream market  The deal further increases Eni s footprint in the region  The company has operations in Oman  Bahrain  Lebanon and Iraq 3     RPC  Inc    NYSE RES   reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings of 6 cents per share  which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents  The bottom line also declined from the year ago level of 18 cents  The weak fourth quarter results stemmed from lower activity levels and pricing  especially in the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s pressure pumping service business You can see  Operating profit from the Technical Services segment  the company s major earner  came in at  19 9 million  lower than the year ago level of  67 million  The decline was mainly caused by lower activity levels in several of the larger service lines along with lower pricing in the pressure pumping service line The unexpected fall in crude prices toward the end of 2018 impacted RPC s clients  forcing them to be conservative on their drilling and completion plans  Many companies decided to re evaluate their budget  which brought uncertainty to RPC s business As a result  the company forecasts a cautious stance for 2019  It expects total capital expenditure for the year within  240  250 million  roughly in line with 2018   Read more  4     Amid severe pullback in the crude prices  PetroChina Company Ltd    NYSE PTR   expects a decline in fourth quarter earnings  This is particularly evident from the fact that the company now expects full year income to increase in the range of 123 132  versus a massive 177  rise in the first nine months of the year  PetroChina anticipates full year income to increase between RMB 28 000 million and RMB 30 000 million from 2017 s earnings of RMB 22 793 million Notably  the company has scrapped off some assets in 2018 and anticipates net loss related to the disposal of the non current assets to be higher than the prior year  Even if the write downs were not accounted for  its full year earnings would have risen only 149   lesser than 177  in the trailing nine months   This definitely indicates a sharp fall in the fourth quarter earnings figure as crude prices are going downhill amid supply glut  U S  China trade tussle  weakening demand outlook and economic headwinds While PetroChina s woes are largely attributed to the falling oil prices  factors like slowing economic growth of China along with U S  Sino trade tensions have also added to the worries  Given that the company generates majority of its revenues from China  increasing concerns over

Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited recently announced that domestic shale producers are planning to align this year s spending with free cash flow generation  Hence  uncertainty in upstream businesses may hurt their cash flow and result in conservative spending Schlumberger emphasized that crude volatility has forced shale producers to refrain from drilling new wells in 2019 but instead allocate capital for drilled but uncompleted wells Halliburton Company  another leading oil field service firm  announced that pricing for hydraulic fracturing in North America has become low following a plunge in demand for completions services through the October to December quarter of 2018  Further  the count for active hydraulic fracturing rigs in America s most prolific basin  Permian  has declined 27  through January this year since June 2017  per Reuters  With expectations that capital budget for shale producers will decline  there is possibility that growth in American oil production will be slower in 2019 as compared to 2018 when crude production growth is likely to have been the highest EIA Estimates Record Oil Production Growth for 2018Except last December  the crude pricing scenario in 2018 was considerably healthier than a year ago  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   the average monthly West Texas Intermediate  WTI  spot oil prices through January October 2018 was well above  60 per barrel  In comparison  the commodity traded at an average monthly spot price of well below  55 for most of the months in 2017 Strong crude prices backed shale drillers in the United States to produce record volumes of oil last year  Per estimation by EIA  domestic average crude production volumes in 2018 will be 10 9 million barrels a day  reflecting a year over year rise of 1 6 million barrels a day Crude Volumes Growth Slowing in 2019 Despite favorable crude price for drillers last year  the pricing of the commodity started to weaken through the last quarter of 2018 Through fourth quarter 2018  WTI crude plummeted from an average monthly price of  70 75 per barrel in October to  49 52 in December  per EIA s data  Oil price is unlikely to recover before May  when waivers of sanctions on Iranian oil imports issued by the United States to several countries are slated to expire  However  the global economy which is slowing at an accelerating rate could offset the pricing recovery  Hence  the volatility in crude prices has created uncertainty for the energy market through 2019 Following this  U S  shale drillers are curtailing their 2019 budgets  said Schlumberger  Unless the picture for oil price is getting clearer  domestic shale producers and drillers will continue to spend conservatively  announced oilfield

Industry s Current Valuation  Since midstream focused oil and gas partnerships use fixed rate debt for the majority of their borrowings  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive stocks  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 11 92X  higher than the S P 500 s 10 38X  It is also significantly above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 5 17X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 18 95X  as low as 11 04X  with a median of 14 19X

July On the news front  integrated majors ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM    Chevron   NYSE CVX   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   reported fourth quarter earnings that improved year over year and came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained 2 9  to close at  55 26 per barrel  natural gas prices plunged 11  to  2 734 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark rose for the fourth time in five weeks as Washington s export sanctions on oil rich Venezuela threatens to disrupt supplies  Lower OPEC production rates and data showing drillers in the United States cutting oil rigs to their lowest since May 2018 also contributed to the gains Meanwhile  natural gas prices registered another steep weekly decline following a below consensus decrease in supplies and warm weather conditions  which could impact the heating fuel s demand Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Energy giant ExxonMobil reported strong fourth quarter 2018 earnings despite weakness in crude prices  Robust downstream profits  owing to impressive margins from North American crude differentials  and ramped up liquids production from the prolific Permian primarily supported the outperformances  To be precise  the company reported earnings of  1 51 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 08 Total production averaged 4 010 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  MMBOE d   marginally higher than 3 991 MMBOE d a year ago  ExxonMobil s downstream segment recorded profits of  2 7 billion  surged from  0 9 billion in the October December quarter of 2017  thanks to strong margins from North American crude differentials During the quarter under review  ExxonMobil generated cash flow of  9 5 billion from operations and asset divestments  up from  8 8 billion in the year ago quarter  The energy giant returned  3 5 billion to its shareholders through dividends  Capital and exploration spending were down 13  year over year to  7 8 billion   Read more  2     Smaller rival Chevronreported a comprehensive beat in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the back of higher revenues  record production and rising crude oil prices  Significantly lower net charges due to the absence of a tax outgo of  2 47 billion also aided overall results  The U S  energy major reported earnings per share of  2 06  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 87 and also significantly improving from the year ago profit of 73 cents Importantly  Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance  an important gauge for the oil and gas industry   with  9 1 billion in cash flow from operations during the quarter  Notably  cash flow in the full year of 2018 totaled  30 6 billion versus  20 3 billion in 2017 You can see  On an encouraging note  the company maintained its dividend growth streak  marking the 32nd consecutive year of payout hike  The largest oil producer in the United States hiked its dividend by 7 cents per share  giving investors another reason to cheer  The company declared a dividend of  1 19 per share  payable on

up to Apr 29 in the third instalment of its three year  25 billion buyback program Apart from rising handsomely from the year ago period  the company s cash flow from operations soared 202  from the year earlier level to  22 billion  Importantly  the group raked in  16 7 billion in free cash flow during the fourth quarter   sufficient enough to take care of both its  2 5 billion in share buybacks and its  3 9 billion dividend Shell  which delivered on its  30 billion divestment target for 2016 2018  expects first quarter 2019 upstream volumes to be 10 000 50 000 BOE D lower year over year  mainly due to divestments and field declines  The company further add that production at its  Integrated Gas  segment will likely fall by some 140 000 170 000 BOE D  mainly attributable to asset sales

Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and improving significantly from the year ago 45 cents  The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations and strong volumes from the unconventional assets The production of oil and natural gas averaged 1 357 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  66  liquids   up 8  from last year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 298 thousand barrels of

March quarter of this year  the company projects production in the range of 1 290 1 330 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  However  production is likely to speed up in the second half of 2019

GE company   NYSE BHGE   reported fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  the bottom line rose 71  year over year from 15 cents  The earnings miss was owing to lower contributions from Bently Nevada and Controls businesses  However  the year over year higher results were aided by increase in activities associated to pressure pumping  artificial lift and drilling Despite the quarterly earnings miss  the stock rallied almost 5  in pre market trading as investors cheered the record quarterly order figure  Total

36598,258113,SLB,ConocoPhillips takes slow  steady route in race for oil profits,news,"By Gary McWilliams HOUSTON  Reuters    ConocoPhillips  N COP  has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year  after shedding  30 8 billion worth of energy assets in six years  But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street  Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields  ConocoPhillips  most recent sales of Canadian oil sands properties and U S  natural gas wells for a combined  16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near term shareholder payouts and pare debt  For a graphic  click  Lance told Reuters the sales to  Cenovus Energy   TO CVE  and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long term debt by 42 percent to  15 billion  fund  6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices   Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U S  output by the fourth quarter   I don t worry about production and reserves in the company   he told Reuters in an interview  citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time  ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties  after adjustments for sales  and deliver shareholder payouts  he said   But interviews with portfolio managers  former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short term fix  They worry ConocoPhillips  plan for modest production growth  flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates  The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil sands properties  Mike Breard  who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management  said the strategy lacks appeal    If I wanted yield  I d buy something else  If I wanted growth  I buy something else  I just don t see what customers would want to be in that in between situation   Breard said   The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1 16 million barrels of oil equivalent  boe    Barclays   LON BARC  expects overall it won t return to production growth on a full year basis until 2019   They ve sold a very valuable asset   said Marc Heilweil  senior portfolio manager at Atlanta based investment firm Gratus Capital  referring to the oil sands holdings  The deal will  make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line  because shale oil properties have shorter productive lives  he said  To ensure growth  oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil and gas properties  In 2012  ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business  leaving the ranks of the large  integrated companies like  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   and putting it among a group of mostly small U S  independent exploration and production companies   Lance  who was the company s technology chief  became ConocoPhillips  chairman and CEO upon the spin off  He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep water  oil sands and conventional oil and gas properties  That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed  forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production  ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend  Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently  The company s stock is down 4 3 percent year to date  even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a  3 billion addition to its share buy backs  In contrast  Chevron is 11 5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10 8 percent in the same period  Of analysts with published ratings on the stock  7 rate it a strong buy  11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold  That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings  12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings  VALUE FROM SHALE Last fall  Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about  5 billion a year  It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent  instead of up to 5 percent  and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs  He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil  CLc1  falls below  40 a barrel  ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells  from another oil sands property and liquefied natural gas  LNG  from operations in Australia   Meanwhile  rivals have cranked up their production much faster  U S  shale focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year  says consultancy Wood Mackenzie  and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends  ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1 25 million boe a day in 2019  estimates Barclays  In contrast  Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103 000 boe and 233 000 boe over 2016 s average 2 59 million boe  excluding divestitures  Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend  The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn t generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs  and the 2 percent dividend yield  about half that of Chevron  becomes the bigger part of returns  Henry Smith  co chief investment officer at Haverford Trust  which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains  sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy  ConocoPhillips  pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing  said Smith  But  he added   Exxon over the years has fit that bill   Haverford s oil industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM   Chevron and Schlumberger NV  N SLB   he said   Tom Bergeron  an equity analyst at Frost Bank  also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields   Lance  who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana  said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales

The smallest member of OPEC has built up debts for oilfield services that Schlumberger has described as causing  considerable financial stress  
Correa told reporters that Schlumberger had been given Central Bank Notes  known by the Spanish acronym TBC 
 Schlumberger is being paid     we have already given them  150 million in TBC  I believe   Correa said in the city of Guayaquil 
 There has been a somewhat inflexible position on the part of the company  but that debt will be paid   he said  without providing details 
Schlumberger said on Friday that production constraints imposed on its Ecuador project had impacted its latest quarter results as it struggles to collect on unpaid bills from state owned oil firm Petroamazonas

36615,258130,SLB,Schlumberger  SLB  Meets Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 48 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest oilfield services company would post earnings of  0 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 46  delivering a surprise of 2 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Schlumberger  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  8 18 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 46   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 18 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Schlumberger shares have added about 14 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 2  
What s Next for Schlumberger 
While Schlumberger has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Schlumberger was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 32 on  7 88 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 75 on  34 23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Field Services is currently in the bottom 7  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-slb-meets-q4-earnings-estimates-200377021,200377021

482 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The U S  crude benchmark scored a third straight weekly gain after the Energy Department s inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded a larger than expected draw  Continued optimism surrounding talks between the United States and China to resolve the trade war boosted prices  while the commodity also drew support from the OPEC agreed cutbacks  Data showing drillers in the United States cutting oil rigs by most in nearly three years brought further upside Meanwhile  natural gas prices also registered a weekly climb following an above consensus decrease in supplies  Investors were also buoyed by forecasts of colder weather  which should lead to the heating fuel s tepid demand Recap of the Week s Most

partially offset by the fall in OneStim revenues from the North American land market Schlumberger believes oil prices will recover gradually through 2019  However  the volatility in the commodity

Shell is contemplating the acquisition of sustainable energy provider Eneco  Notably  the Anglo Dutch giant has teamed up with pension fund manager PGGM to place a joint bid for the Eneco buyout The

36645,258160,SLB,Schlumberger revenues fall 20  in second quarter amid continued job cuts,news,"Investing com    Shares in Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  fell mildly on Thursday in after hours trading even after the world s largest oilfield services company reported unforeseen losses and continued job cuts over the previous quarter 
During Schlumberger s second quarter of 2016  the Houston based company reported losses of  2 16 billion or 1 56 share  down sharply from a profit of  1 12 billion or 0 88 over the same period a year earlier  Schlumberger also saw its revenues slump 20  to  7 16 billion  following the elimination of 8 000 positions for the three month period  As a result  Schlumberger said Thursday that the company suffered a pretax charge of  646 million on the quarter due to the reductions in its workforce headcount  With the layoffs  Schlumberger eliminated approximately 16 000 jobs over the first half of this year  
Since Schlumberger s workforce swelled to around 129 000 when the price of oil peaked at  115 a barrel two years ago  the precipitous decline in crude futures has forced the company to cut roughly 50 000 jobs or 38  of their workforce 
Schlumberger also said Thursday that it incurred significant losses from the restructuring charges associated with last summer s  12 7 billion acquisition of Cameron International  a leading global provider of flow equipment products  For the quarter  Schlumberger reported adjusted earnings per share of 0 23  excluding one time items such as integration charges  Analysts expected to see adjusted earnings per share of 0 21 on revenue of  7 13 billion 
 In the second quarter market conditions worsened further in most parts of our global operations  but in spite of the continuing headwinds we now appear to have reached the bottom of the cycle   said Schlumberger CEO Paul Kibsgaard 
 As we continued to navigate this challenging environment  we again delivered robust pretax operating income  operating margin  and free cash flow  This performance came as a result of our strong execution and  in some cases  at the expense of revenue as we began shifting focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high grading our contract portfolio   Kibsgaard added

36653,258168,SLB,Eyeing upswing  more U S  oilfield service firms restructure,news,"By Tom Hals and Tracy Rucinski   Reuters    After two years of hunkering down  struggling U S  oilfield service providers are preparing for an expected oil price recovery in an unexpected way  filing for bankruptcy  Companies that drill wells  haul water and provide other services to energy exploration firms have been waiting out a slump in oil prices by idling machinery  laying off workers and extending deadlines for repaying debts  Now they are turning to Chapter 11 creditor protection to shed debt and raise cash so they can spend and invest again   Without bankruptcy  many of small and medium sized service companies risk missing out on any upturn that could follow President elect Donald Trump s pro drilling agenda or OPEC s plan to cut oil production for the first time in eight years  restructuring advisors said   You ve got some zombie companies out there   said Jay Krasoff  a managing director with Chiron Financial in Houston   You have to give counterparties confidence you ll be in business to do their work  That s what s going on   Through the end of October  about 70 mostly private energy service companies have filed for Chapter 11 this year  up from 39 in all of 2015  according to Haynes   Boone  a law firm that specializes in energy restructuring  As the pace of filings accelerates  the size of companies restructuring in bankruptcy is also increasing   In June through October  nine companies with at least  100 million in debt filed for Chapter 11  with a total of  9 billion in liabilities  according to Haynes   Boone  That exceeded the total for the prior 18 months  which came to  8 2 billion in debt from seven filings with at least  100 million in debt  In all  energy services companies have restructured about  18 7 billion in bankruptcy  By comparison  the 20 companies in the Dow Jones U S  Oil Equipment   Services Index  DJUSOI  have a combined  82 6 billion in debt  according to Thomson Reuters data   Graphic     COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE The biggest oilfield service providers   such as  Halliburton Co   N HAL  and  Schlumberger Ltd   SLB UL    have the scale to ride out the production glut  despite losing more than 40 percent of their revenue since oil prices peaked in mid 2014  In a recovery  they can also respond more quickly than smaller companies that spent the past two years hibernating through the downturn  according to restructuring advisers  Hoping the energy sector has turned a corner  major U S  producers such as Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY    Chevron  Corp  N CVX    Pioneer Natural Resources  Co  N PXD  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  are preparing to add rigs   A bankruptcy filing allows a service company to restructure under a court supervised process in as little as two months  Creditors generally take ownership of the companies in return for forgiving debt  and shareholders generally lose all or nearly all of their investment   From a competitive advantage a lot of the service companies had to do that   said Steven Person  the chief executive officer of exploration company American Standard Energy  Person has served as an officer and director of energy service companies  including until 2004 at  Basic Energy Services Inc   N BAS   which completes oil and gas wells and transports and disposes of fluids  Basic Energy filed for Chapter 11 in October with a plan backed by its creditors to convert  825 million in debt to equity and raise more than  100 million in cash  Its confirmation trial is on Friday   David Johnston  a managing director of AlixPartners  has been advising Basic Energy and said in court papers the company opted to file for bankruptcy in part because competitors were    Several of Basic s competitors have delevered their own balance sheets through Chapter 11 processes  thus forcing even solvent companies to explore similar options to remain competitive   he said  Two of Basic s main competitors   Key Energy Services Inc   PK KEGXQ  and C J Energy Services Inc  PK CJESQ   filed for bankruptcy in recent months  Key won court approval on Tuesday to cut  1 billion of debt to  250 million and exit bankruptcy and C J s confirmation trial is set for Dec  16   Seventy Seven Energy Inc   PK SVNT   which provides drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  services  filed for Chapter 11 in June  By early August  the company had cut its debt by  1 1 billion and exited bankruptcy under the control of its creditors  The company said in its recent quarterly results that it had doubled its rig count in the past six months  About half of some 32 oilfield service companies still trading actively in major stock exchanges are distressed  including five or six that are severely distressed and likely to restructure  said Kim Brady  a partner and restructuring adviser at financial consultancy Solic Capital  Restructuring advisers said the stigma previously associated with Chapter 11  which tended to hit companies with serious problems  has vanished  opening the door to more bankruptcy filings  
 Now it s almost in vogue to be going through Chapter 11   said Jerrit Coward  former CEO of fracking services provider US Shale Solutions LLC who is now advising energy investors ",2016-12-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/eyeing-upswing,-more-u.s.-oilfield-service-firms-restructure-446417",446417

Analyst Blog  Top Analyst Reports for Boston Scientific  Southern Co  and BNY MellonThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Boston Scientific  Southern Company and BNY Mellon  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Boston Scientific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry over the past three months  losing  2 8  vs   8 5   The Zacks analyst thinks the company is suffering from significant cost escalation  which is weighing on its margins Also  a delay in LOTUS relaunch is hampering sales through 2018  Declining worldwide pacemaker sales is also hurting the CRM business  On a brighter note  the company is seeing growth across all business lines and geographies  Boston Scientific received a number of FDA approvals within the Cardiovascular group This apart  it launched LithoVue within Urology and rolled out the GUIDE XT in Europe  Three recent acquisitions  Claret Medical  VENITI and Augmenix  provide cause for optimism  These are expected to strongly contribute to the company s inorganic growth profile  Boston Scientific s significant progress related to its LOTUS valve relaunch is also encouraging  Also  post the suspension of LOTUS valve in Europe  ACURATE TAVR continues to build momentum  You can   Shares of Southern Company have underperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the past six months  losing  3 4  vs  2 7   The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company is one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the United States and has managed to surpass estimates in each of the last seven quarters The company s  12 billion AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  buyout has significantly increased its customer base and diversified offerings  With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  it is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years through long term power contracts However  elevated leverage of the firm  along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over two of its major projects   Vogtle and Kemper   are major overhangs  While the company s  25 billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded its budget and is years behind schedule  its Kemper project also suffered a setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations amid additional cost burden  This is why Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from the investors  You can   BNY Mellon s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the past year   18 8  vs   19 1    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in only two of the trailing four quarters  Further  the earnings estimates have been going downward ahead of the company s fourth quarter results The Zacks analyst thinks elevated operating expenses will likely continue to hamper bottom line growth to some extent  Also  the concentration risk  arising from significant dependence on fee based income  remains a matter of concern However  higher interest rates  increase in fee income and improving assets balance will support profitability  Further  enhanced capital deployment plan reflects strong balance sheet position  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include

36664,258179,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Shell s Olefins Unit Start Up  SemGroup s JV   More,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains 
On the news front  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  started up its fourth linear alpha olefins unit at its chemicals plant in Geismar  LA  while SemGroup Corp    NYSE SEMG   and KKR teamed up for the development of a Canadian midstream infrastructure platform 
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures rose 7 6  to close at  51 59 per barrel  while natural gas prices gained some 1 8  to  3 099 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark scored a second straight weekly gain  driven by Saudi Arabia s promise to lower its oil exports  while it also drew support from the OPEC  production cut agreement  Continued optimism surrounding talks between the United States and China to resolve the trade war and easing fears of a possible economic slowdown also boosted prices  Data showing drillers in the United States cutting oil rigs for second consecutive week brought further upside
Meanwhile  natural gas prices also registered a weekly climb following an above consensus decrease in supplies  Investors were also buoyed by forecasts of colder weather  which should lead to the heating fuel s tepid demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Royal Dutch Shell recently finished construction and commenced production from its fourth alpha olefins unit at the company s chemical facility located in Geismar  LA  This expansion added annual production capacity of 425 000 metric tons to the Geismar site  With this development  the total alpha olefin production capacity at the facility is ramped up to more than 1 3 million metric tons per annum  making it the largest alpha olefins producing site Construction started at the site in 2016 and operations began in December 2018  The alpha olefins unit is part of Shell s key growth projects for global chemicals business  The demand for chemicals is expected to remain high for a long term as these are used in many daily use products like hand soap  laundry detergents  lubricants  motor oils and others The start up of the new unit is in line with the company s intention to integrate downstream business  Notably  Shell owns manufacturing sites   which will supply ethylene feedstock to the Geismar plant   in Norco  LA  and Deer Park  TX  It had to sell much of its U S  ethylene production  which can now be used in the new alpha olefins unit  With global demand for polyethylene products on the rise  the integration will enable the company to benefit from this trend   Read more  2     SemGroup and U S  private equity company KKR

36666,258181,SLB,Oil Service Q4 Earnings Preview  What Investors Need To Know,opinion,As is the norm  oil services companies   providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   will kick off the fourth quarter earnings season for U S  energy firms  Considering the current weakness in the energy market environment amid the drop in crude prices in late 2018  the health of the oilfield service sector has taken a big hit  Consequently  most sector components   including well established big names like Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   and Halliburton   NYSE HAL     are likely to report disappointing results First  let s take a look at the main factors impacting oilfield services companies  revenues and earnings Oil and Gas Prices  Strong commodity prices typically lead to robust upstream activities  As exploration  drilling  and production picks up  oil service providers see a surge in their sales and profitability With the West Texas Intermediate  or WTI  crude oil prices crashing in the past quarter  clients are taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Oil prices around the  50 a barrel mark is certainly not enough to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity hurts overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for the upcoming earnings season E P Spending  The rig count in the United States is another yardstick in determining exploration spending by producers and therefore  the health of oilfield service providers  Usually  the more operating rigs there are  the more oil service companies make in revenues Interestingly  during the fourth quarter of 2018  the U S  rig count increased by 29  from 1 054 to 1 083  despite the oil price crash  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest steady North American activity in the October December timeframe  Oil service firms with sizable presence in the region are expected to gain favorably on this sentiment Apart from the above mentioned indicators  there is another factor in assessing the earnings prospects for oilfield service companies  the Permian drilling pullback Permian Slowdown  Make no mistake  the Permian Basin still remains the most sought after unconventional basin and continues to post the biggest production gains in the United States  However  pipeline bottlenecks out of the region  which is expected to last well into 2019  has taken a toll on drilling and production service demand By now  it is well documented that serious logistical constraints in West Texas s Permian  super basin  is forcing operators in the region   especially those without committed pipeline capacity   to sell their produce at discounts  This caused operators to slow down their drilling and production activity  impacting demand for oilfield services In fact  there is a backlog of nearly 3 800  in the Permian Basin   indicating a slowdown in well completion activity It s Not All Doom and GloomWith oil plunging to a 17 month low of  42 53 a barrel on Christmas Eve and down nearly 40  over the fourth quarter  oilfield service investors should brace for a tough quarter of results with more misses than hits However  there are still a couple of companies likely to beat our fourth quarter earnings estimates  Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  our proprietary methodology      makes it relatively simple  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate You could further narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can see  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  2 Stocks to Focus OnCSI Compressco LP   NASDAQ CCLP    A provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production  The Woodlands  TX headquartered partnership is focused on the key shale plays in the United States The service provider has been on a dismal run  it missed estimates in each of the last four quarters However  with an Earnings ESP of  4 17  and a Zacks Rank  3  an earnings beat is possible for CSI Compressco in the upcoming quarterly release The company is expected to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 26 ProPetro Holding Corp    NYSE PUMP    Founded in 2005  ProPetro Holding is an oilfield services company that primarily offers hydraulic fracturing to major oil and gas operators Coming to the earnings surprise history  this Midland  TX headquartered specialized service provider has been on a slippery slope  it went past estimates just once in the past four quarters But our model indicates that ProPetro is likely to beat on earnings this time around  as it has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of  7 19  The company is expected to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Mar 25 More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all

36667,258182,SLB,Can Schlumberger  SLB  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This world s largest oilfield services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 30  
For the last reported quarter  Schlumberger came out with earnings of  0 46 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 45 per share  representing a surprise of 2 22   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 43 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 38  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Schlumberger  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Schlumberger currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 30   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 18  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-schlumberger-slb-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200376748,200376748
36668,258183,SLB,Factors To Know Ahead Of Halliburton s  HAL  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is expected to release fourth quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Tuesday  Jan 22  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 37 cents on revenues of  5 9 billion In the preceding three month period  the major oilfield service provider  the consensus mark by 2  after robust international activity more than offset slowdown in the North American drilling fluids demand and pricing pressure in the United States land drilling business As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Houston  TX based company is on a firm footing  having gone past met the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells can continue winning ways by surpassing earnings estimate this time around too  However  our model indicates that world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   might not beat on earnings in the fourth quarter Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results Factors to Consider This QuarterStrong commodity prices typically lead to robust upstream activities  As exploration  drilling  and production picks up  oil service providers see a surge in their sales and profitability With the West Texas Intermediate  or WTI  crude oil prices crashing in the past quarter  clients are taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Oil prices around the  50 a barrel mark is certainly not enough to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity hurts overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for Halliburton s upcoming earnings release Interestingly  during the fourth quarter of 2018  the U S  rig count increased by 29  from 1 054 to 1 083  despite the oil price crash  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest steady North American activity in the October December time frame  Halliburton  with sizable presence in the region  is expected to gain favorably on this sentiment Meanwhile  pipeline takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian Basin seems to be the primary reason for apprehension about Halliburton s prospects  Halliburton warned that a slowdown in the oil and gas rich Permian Basin activity due to pipeline constraints will be a drag on fourth quarter earnings By now  it is well documented that serious logistical constraints in West Texas s Permian  super basin  is forcing operators in the region   especially those without committed pipeline capacity   to sell their produce at hefty discounts  This caused operators to slow down their drilling and production activity  impacting demand for oilfield services  In fact  there is a backlog of nearly 3 800  in the Permian Basin   indicating a slowdown in well completion activity As a proof of the market challenges  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter Completion and Production adjusted operating income is pegged at  466 million  lower than  613 million reported in the previous quarter  To put things in perspective  the Completion and Production unit makes up more than three fourths of the oilfield service provider s total operating income Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  for this company stands at  2 28   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  However  Halliburton s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton  here are some companies from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter Murphy USA Inc    NYSE MUSA   has an Earnings ESP of  29 37  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release earnings on Jan 30  You can see  Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   has an Earnings ESP of  4 12  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release earnings on Jan 30

36693,258208,SLB,Exclusive  Venezuela s PDVSA quietly issues new debt to pay off suppliers,news,"By Brian Ellsworth  Corina Pons and Marianna Parraga CARACAS HOUSTON  Reuters    Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA has issued at least  310 million in debt to companies including  General Electric  Co  N GE  as it negotiates private issuances to pay off its suppliers  industry sources told Reuters  stretching the finances of a company that bondholders already worry is on its way to default  The securities are not bonds but offer rights similar to those enjoyed by bondholders  and at least one issue offers dispute resolution via the Paris based International Chamber of Commerce  according to one of the three sources  who cited a term sheet   This means that if PDVSA defaults  investors holding their bonds may find that there are more creditors competing for compensation than they had originally anticipated  The overall negotiations on private debt issuance  which were confirmed by seven sources  come as weak oil markets and an unraveling socialist economy have fanned concerns PDVSA will be unable to make nearly  5 billion in bond payments between now and the end of the year  PDVSA and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro insist they will meet all debt obligations and dismiss default rumors as a right wing conspiracy  In addition to the  310 million  a package of  1 5 billion in such securities maturing in three to five years is being discussed as a way of settling debts with small and medium sized oil services firms  according to one of the sources  who was briefed on that proposal   PDVSA is struggling to prevent oil services providers from stopping work in Venezuela in protest over billions of dollars in unpaid bills  The company has worked with banks including  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  to structure fixed income securities such as promissory notes that can be sold to investors  according to one of the sources  a local trader who saw documents outlining the proposal    PDVSA has been offering promissory notes as well as other types of notes and financial instruments to settle debts with providers   said another of the seven sources  who was also involved in one such operation    They are offering them because there is no cash    Deutsche and GE declined to comment  PDVSA did not respond to an email seeking comment  The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are ongoing or because they are not authorized to comment publicly on the matter  The total amount of such securities that have already been issued by PDVSA could not immediately be determined  BACKED UP BILLS Promissory notes would typically be unattractive for oil services companies to keep on their own books  They are seen as too risky for many investment portfolios  because they trade in limited volumes and are therefore difficult to sell   As a result  they are generally structured by large foreign banks that ultimately end up buying the notes at a steep discount  according to another of the sources  who works in the finance industry   GE has agreed to convert  350 million in unpaid PDVSA invoices into  257 million in loan notes  which are interest bearing securities that can be sold to other investors  a GE source told Reuters   An oil industry source said that one company accepted  53 million in promissory notes that come due at the end of this year  asking that the company not be identified to avoid creating conflict with PDVSA  The notes are not registered with settlement agents such as Euroclear  the source added  Since the 2008 financial crisis  PDVSA has systematically allowed bills to pile up and later negotiated discounts with providers or paid them with global bonds which sell at a discount  Debts to providers in 2014 reached nearly  21 billion  according to that year s financial statements  PDVSA has not yet released 2015 results  The company has not made any cash payments in dollars to providers in at least six months as a result of its difficult cash flow situation  according to two of the sources  It has not been able to issue bonds on capital markets because of prohibitively high yields  Converting the unpaid bills into securities does not increase PDVSA s total debt burden  But it does have significant consequences in the event of a default  since the debt changes from a private obligation between two parties into a security held by investors  Payment difficulties led Schlumberger  N SLB   the world s top oil services company  to announce in April that it was halting operations in Venezuela   In response to an email seeking details  a Schlumberger official said the company was not in a position to discuss the issues because it considers them confidential   Services giant Halliburton  N HAL  also said it was reducing activities in Venezuela  without saying why  It said in its 2015 annual report that at the end of last year it had  31 million in surety bond guarantees associated with its Venezuelan operations  without providing details

36696,258211,SLB,U S  economic growth revised higher in first quarter,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  economic growth slowed in the first quarter although not as sharply as initially thought  as a surge in home building and steady inventory accumulation partially offset the drag from a steep decline in business investment 
Gross domestic product rose at a 0 8 percent annual rate as opposed to the 0 5 percent pace reported last month  the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate for the January March period 
That was the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2015  The economy grew at a rate of 1 4 percent in the fourth quarter 
But a sharp upward revision to income growth and a rebound in corporate profits in the first quarter brightened the picture  When measured from the income side  the economy grew at a 2 2 percent rate after expanding at a 1 9 percent pace in the fourth quarter 
Economists said strong income growth  together with signs the economy was picking up steam in the second quarter  could give the Federal Reserve the ammunition to raise interest rates as early as next month  The U S  central bank increased rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
 This gives us more confidence that growth will hit its marks in the second quarter     enough forward speed for the Fed to continue with its gradual pace of rate hikes   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York 
Minutes from the Fed s April 26 27 policy meeting  published last week  showed most of its policymakers considered it appropriate to raise rates in June if data continued to point to an improvement in second quarter growth 
Similar sentiments were echoed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen  who said on Friday the U S  central bank could hike rates  in the coming months   if the economy and the labor market continued to improve 
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
The dollar  DXY  rose to a two month high against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasuries fell  U S  stocks were trading higher 
The upward revision to first quarter GDP growth also reflected a modest hit from trade than previously estimated 
The economy has been hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand  which have eroded export growth  It has also been squeezed by lower oil prices  which have undercut profits of oilfield companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL   forcing them to slash spending on equipment 
Economists also believe the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite steps last year to address the problem  The economy has underperformed in the first quarter in five of the last six years 
REGAINING MOMENTUM
The economy appears to have regained momentum early in the second quarter  with retail sales  goods exports  industrial production  housing starts and home sales surging in April 
A report on Friday showed consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in May  with households  attitudes towards vehicle and home purchases improving 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second quarter GDP rising at a 2 9 percent rate 
Spending on residential construction increased at a 17 1 percent rate in the first quarter  the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012  It was previously reported to have risen at a rate of 14 8 percent 
Residential construction added 0 56 percentage point to first quarter GDP growth  up from the 0 49 percentage point reported last month 
Businesses accumulated  69 6 billion worth of inventory  instead of the  60 9 billion estimated last month  Inventories cut two tenths of a percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0 33 percentage point 
There was no revision to consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  Spending increased at a pace of 1 9 percent  a slowdown from the fourth quarter s 2 4 percent rate  Households were frugal in the first quarter  cutting back on purchases of long lasting manufactured goods like automobiles  Income at the disposal of households after accounting fortaxes and inflation was revised up to show it jumping at a 4 0 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 2 9 percent  Savings were revised up to  782 6 billion from  712 3 billion 
 The softish real consumer spending in the last couple of quarters is probably temporary and spending is likely to rebound in the second quarter  reflecting continued solid income formation   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   senior economist at RBS  LON RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut 
After tax corporate profits increased at a 0 6 percent rate in the first quarter after plunging at an 8 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter  when they were held down in part by a  20 8 billion transfer payment related to the  BP   L BP  oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 
Exports were not as weak as initially thought  That  together with a decline in imports  produced a smaller trade deficit  which subtracted 0 21 percentage point from first quarter GDP growth instead of the 0 34 percentage point reported last month 
A sustained plunge in energy sector investment undercutbusiness spending  Equipment spending tumbled at a steeper 9 0 percent rate  the fastest pace of decline since the second quarter of 2009  It was previously reported to have dropped at a rate of 8 6 percent 

Spending on equipment will likely remain weak in the second quarter  with a report on Thursday showing orders for manufactured capital goods excluding aircraft and defense declined in April for a third straight month ",2016-05-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-economic-growth-revised-higher-in-first-quarter-404997,404997

fracturing market  which is likely to impact its revenues till the first half of 2019  This has further weakened the outlook for Halliburton as North American business constitutes the major chunk of

still causing problems for its balance sheet  The deal was called off in early 2016  forcing Halliburton to book  3 5 billion in termination fees  one of the largest of these charges in U S  corporate

capacity concerns aggravating  many producers have now become reluctant to increase their spending levels until the takeaway problem is sorted  While there are several Permian pipeline projects lined

36710,258225,SLB,No Christmas Break For The Correction,opinion,"The session right before Christmas is supposed to be pretty calm  but that wasn t the case on Monday  Even with a half day of trading  there were still plenty of hours to continue this correction  In the end  it was the worst Christmas Eve for the market on record 
	Each of the major indices were down by well over 2   The Dow plunged 2 91  to 21 792 2 and the S P slipped 2 71  to 2351 1  The NASDAQ dipped 2 21  to 6192 92  This action is all the more disheartening since its coming off a horrible week that saw each of the indices drop by 7  or more 
	Stocks are still reeling from the not as dovish as hoped Fed decision from last Wednesday  However  the market has really been under pressure for the past three months with slowing global growth and the trade conflict with China contributing to the poor sentiment 
	And now we can add this partial government shutdown to the list  along with news reports that President Trump was looking into firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell  which have been denied by the White House   The market also looked askew at a statement from the Treasury Secretary that there was ample liquidity in the system  which was actually one of the few things that investors weren t worried about before the announcement 
	All in all  the market is in a horrible mood and cannot be consoled at the moment  Apparently  not even Christmas can help  The first day of what has historically been the Santa Claus rally was wasted on Monday 
	It may seem a bit Pollyannish to say  but there s still a chance we could see some improvement in the last days of 2018  December is shaping up to be even worse than October  so a bounce is way overdue  Let s hope good old St  Nick has enough room in his bag for a nice rebound  I have hope that we find buyers into the New Year  I can t stress enough some of the long term buying opportunities that I m seeing  Keep a cool head and be patient   said Jeremy in Counterstrike Today s Portfolio Highlights

36711,258226,SLB,Boot Barn  Mohawk  Azure  Canadian Solar And Real Goods Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 2  2018    Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   as the Bull of the Day  Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Azure Power Global   NYSE AZRE    Canadian Solar   NASDAQ CSIQ   and Real Goods Solar   NASDAQ RGSE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Sony Corporationis on sale as investors rushed to sell the big technology and gaming companies to end 2018   However  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  isn t struggling  It s expected to grow earnings by 38  in fiscal 2019 Sony is a global technology  entertainment and gaming company headquartered in Japan  It s most famous for its Sony Walkman but more recently  it s the PlayStation that gets the most love Big Beat in Fiscal Q2On Oct 30  Sony reported its fiscal second quarter 2019 results and blew by the Zacks consensus by  0 29  Earnings were  1 20 versus the consensus of  0 91  for a beat of 31  Sony has a solid track record of beating  This was the 6th consecutive earnings beat Total revenue grew 6  to  19 6 billion The Gaming division led the results  with gaming revenue  fueled by Playstation  jumping 27  year over year to  5 billion  On those sales it made  803 million in profit 75 1 million games were purchased  Playstation Plus  its subscription gaming service  also had record subscribers for a second quarter at 34 3 million  up from 33 9 million a year ago The Pictures segment has also recovered thanks to Hotel Transylvania 3 and the television licensing rights to Jumanji and Peter Rabbit  Pictures revenue actually fell 1  in the quarter  but at least it wasn t the drag it used to be Additionally  third quarter will see the results of the surprise global hit  Venom  Music revenue also declined 1  year over year but the company closed on its deal to purchase the rest of EMI Publishing on Nov 15  which was in the third quarter The  2 4 billion purchase will make it among the 3 largest music publishers in the world In an increasingly content dependent global economy  this should position Sony well for the coming years Surprising areas of growth included its smaller Semiconductor segment  which saw revenue jump 11   and the Financial Services segment which saw revenue jump 27  thanks to gains in Sony Life Insurance It s mobile division  which is the smartphone  was a disaster however  It continues to take losses against competitors like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  as sales fell 32   How much longer will it stay in this business Full Year Guidance RaisedSony is usually conservative with guidance so it s not a surprise that the company raised full year operating income guidance to 870b yen from 670b yen Zacks only has 2 full year estimates as not many analysts cover Sony  despite its size and reputation  because coverage of foreign companies is sparse The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 is now  4 54 up from  4 17 just 3 months ago  That s earnings growth of 38  as the company earned  3 29 in fiscal 2018 Analysts expect earnings to grow just 2 1  in fiscal 2020  however The Zacks Consensus of  4 63 has been stuck at that number for the last 60 days  However  Sony hasn t yet provided any guidance on fiscal 2020 so the 2 covering analysts appear to be on the sidelines  for now Shares are on SaleSony shares were having a nice 2018 until the November and December stock market sell off Shares fell 20  in the last 3 months of the year  including an 11  plunge in December They re cheaper than ever with a forward P E of just 10 6 They also have other classic value fundamentals including a P B ratio of just 1 7 and a P S ratio of only 0 8 Shareholders get a dividend  but it s just yielding 0 4  For investors looking for a blue chip technology and media company that is a hidden gem  Sony is one to keep on the short list Shares jumped on the earnings report and are still up 21 5  year to date However  they re still cheap  with a forward P E of just 12 9 Shareholders also get a small dividend  currently yielding 0 5  But for investors looking for a bargain amongst the big entertainment and gaming companies  Sony is one to keep on your short list  Schlumberger Ltd  shares hit a new 5 year low in 2018 as plunging oil prices spooked investors  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see flat earnings year over year in 2019 Schlumberger is the world s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization  drilling  production  and processing to the oil and gas industry  It has a market cap of  50 billion Schlumberger to Report Fourth Quarter Results in Mid JanuaryOn Jan 18  before the bell  Schlumberger will report its fourth quarter results It has an excellent track record of beating the estimate with just 1 miss in 5 years This will be heavily anticipated as the third quarter report was before the recent oil price plunge and subsequent production cuts by some countries Canada  for instance  has already cut its rig count in half in a matter of weeks Some of that is to prepare for the winter as the Canadians apparently routinely shut down rigs at the end of the year  but this year s cuts have been far more dramatic Shareholder FriendlyOn Oct 19  Schlumberger reported its third quarter results  It saw free cash flow of a  1 billion in the quarter It s been rewarding shareholders  During the third quarter  it repurchased 1 5 million shares for a total of  100 million The company also continues to pay a dividend  now yielding a juicy 5 5  Shares at Multi Year LowsInvestors fled the energy stocks at the end of 2018  Schlumberger shares fell 48  in 2018 and are now at multi year lows That s hard to believe because the energy stocks got pretty grim during the 2015 2016 downturn too Are they a deal They re not cheap  They still trade with a forward P E of 22 2 because 11 estimates for 2019 have been cut in the last 90 days lowering the Zacks Consensus Estimate to  1 65 from  1 78 3 Solar Stocks to Shine Your Portfolio in 2019 U S   stocks have been out of the spotlight in 2018  courtesy of President Trump s policies to revive the coal industry  For instance  at the onset of 2018  Trump imposed a 30  tariff on the import of solar panels that dealt a major blow to solar stocks However  not all is lost for the U S  solar space  Per the latest Solar Market Insight Report by Solar Energy Industries Association  SEIA   since fourth quarter 2017  residential solar installations have not deviated more than 1  on a quarter over quarter basis  demonstrating the steadiness of the sector Moreover  despite witnessing the lowest quarterly installation volume since 2015  utility solar photovoltaic  PV  accounted for the largest share of U S  solar capacity installed in the third quarter of 2018  Further  procurement of U S  utility solar exploded in 2018  with a total of 11 2 GWdc of projects announced over that time frame  In particular  declining costs of solar panels and modules along with grid developments have made the U S  solar industry an attractive investment space for big corporate houses  apart from utility providers What s Does 2019 Hold for the Solar Market The solar market is expected to witness accelerated deployment in 2019 driven by utility scale projects  Wood Mackenzie has lifted the utility solar forecast for 2019 to 7 2 GWdc from 6 9 GWdc  For the residential PV space  a stellar comeback is expected next year Factors like the declining costs of solar installations as well as increased adopted of solar power by nations like India and Japan are enhancing opportunities for U S  solar stocks  Although the import tariff may impede the initial rally of U S  solar stocks  there s no denying that renewables are the ultimate future and with America being one of the top five solar installers worldwide  prospects remain bright for its solar players   In view of this  we have picked three players from the Zacks  Industry with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  for investors  You can see  Our ChoicesAzure Power Global is an independent power producer and operator of utility and commercial scale solar PV power plants  The company  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  has an expected earnings growth rate of 83 08  for fiscal 2020 Canadian Solaris a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provides turn key solar energy solutions  The company  with a Zacks Rank  1  has an expected earnings growth rate of 10 62  for the next year Real Goods Solaris a provider of solar power systems and residential solar power  The company  with a Zacks Rank  2  has an expected earnings growth rate of 369 81  for the next year In addition to

36712,258227,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Elliott s QEP Bid  Transocean s Contract Win   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices rallied but natural gas futures took a hit 
On the news front  activist firm Elliott Management proposed buying QEP Resources Inc  NYSE QEP     NYSE E   for about  2 billion  while offshore driller Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   announced it has been awarded a five year contract for an ultra deepwater drillship by Chevron   NYSE CVX   
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 5 8  to close at  47 96 per barrel  natural gas prices plunged some 7 8  to  3 044 per million Btu  MMBtu  
The U S  crude benchmark booked its first weekly gain of the past four weeks after the Energy Department s inventory release showed that stockpiles remained essentially unchanged  While large build in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  played spoilsport  it was more than offset by bullish jobs data and optimism surrounding talks between the United States and China to resolve the trade war  Both these developments eased fears of a possible economic slowdown 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices recorded a weekly decline following a below consensus decrease in supplies  which indicate weak demand for the heating fuel 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     QEP Resources rallied 40 3  post an acquisition proposal from shareholder Elliott Management Corp  Elliott  which owns a 5  stake in the company  has expressed plans of taking over all outstanding shares of the upstream energy player for a consideration of  8 75 a share  which is at 44  premium to the stock s closing price on Jan 4 Elliott added that its intent to acquire QEP Resources is dependent on the completion of the company s Haynesville assets divestment  On Nov 19  Zacks Rank  3  Hold  QEP Resources signed an agreement to offload Haynesville shale play based natural gas and oil producing acres and supportive gathering properties for  735 million  The sale of its Haynesville operations reflects QEP Resources  aim to become a Permian pure play operator You can see  Elliott supports QEP Resources  move to become a pure play Permian firm but believes that those constructive efforts are yet to get reflected in the company s stock price  This is the reason QEP Resources is significantly undervalued and hence the acquisition of the firm will boost shareholders  value  added Elliott 2     Transocean recently announced that it has won a major five year drilling contract from Chevron  which will likely add  830 million to Transocean s backlog  The amount excludes mobilization and reimbursable charges  Notably  as of Dec 5  the company had a total backlog of  12 2 billion The drilling contract is for one of Transocean s two dynamically positioned ultra deepwater drillships  which is currently undergoing construction at Singapore s Jurong shipyard  The drillship is expected to come online in the second half of 2021 and operate in the Gulf of Mexico region  It will be rated for 20 000 pounds per square inch  psi  operations  marking the first ultra deepwater drillship with such a specification  It is expected to be the  industry s most capable ultra deepwater drillship   whose configuration will comply with Tier III International Maritime Organization emissions standards In case of termination of the contract  Transocean will receive compensation for its incremental 20 000 psi subsea investment in the rig  The termination  if occurred after April 2020  will fetch Transocean a  substantial termination fee    Read more  3     TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   has started production from the Egina Field

LLC  With Eni already holding 30  working interest in the oilfield  the Italian energy major s operating stake in the same  following the closing of the deal  will be 100  The oilfield is located around five kilometers off the coast of North slope in Beaufort Sea  Oooguruk  which came online in 2008  currently produces 10 000 barrels of oil per day  BPD   There are 25 actively producing wells in the oilfield along with 15 wells to inject gas water  The production facilities are installed on an artificial gravel island  at 1 5 meters of water depth  helping to keep the production trees dry The acquisition will enable the company to increase its total oil output from Alaska by 7 000 BPD  Moreover  the deal will boost the company s presence in the region  It has 100  working interest in the Nikaitchuq oil field  which is located around 13 kilometers North East of Oooguruk and produces approximately 18 000 BPD of oil  The deal is expected to lead to operational synergies and

United States to commence full service on the Gulf Connector Expansion Project  This provided the company the opportunity to ship 475 000 dekatherm gas per day  Dt d  through the Transco pipeline system in Texas and Louisiana The project is expected to support Cheniere Energy  Inc  s liquified natural gas export terminal at Corpus Christi bay and Freeport LNG s terminal at Brazoria County  TX  Both Cheniere and Freeport have plans to bring their LNG export terminals in Texas online  in a bid to offer commercial services within 18 months The approval from the FERC marks a significant landmark for Williams  as midstream asset developers in the United States are trying hard to connect their existing networks to the expanding natural gas export markets  The demand for liquified natural gas is expected to grow rapidly in 2019  as the search for cleaner energy sources is still on   Read more

36715,258230,SLB,Earnings Preview  Schlumberger  SLB  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 9  
Revenues are expected to be  8 13 billion  down 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 23  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger 
For Schlumberger  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of  0 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 46  delivering a surprise of  2 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Schlumberger doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-schlumberger-slb-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200374835,200374835
36716,258231,SLB,Top Analyst Reports For Boston Scientific  Southern Company   BNY Mellon ,opinion,"Friday  January 11  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Boston Scientific  BSX   Southern Company  NYSE SO  and BNY Mellon  BK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Boston Scientific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry over the past three months  losing  2 8  vs   8 5   The Zacks analyst thinks the company is suffering from significant cost escalation  which is weighing on its margins  
Also  a delay in LOTUS relaunch is hampering sales through 2018  Declining worldwide pacemaker sales is also hurting the CRM business  On a brighter note  the company is seeing growth across all business lines and geographies  Boston Scientific received a number of FDA approvals within the Cardiovascular group  
This apart  it launched LithoVue within Urology and rolled out the GUIDE XT in Europe  Three recent acquisitions  Claret Medical  VENITI and Augmenix  provide cause for optimism  These are expected to strongly contribute to the company s inorganic growth profile  Boston Scientific s significant progress related to its LOTUS valve relaunch is also encouraging  Also  post the suspension of LOTUS valve in Europe  ACURATE TAVR continues to build momentum 
 You can   
Shares of Southern Company have underperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the past six months  losing  3 4  vs  2 7   The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company is one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the United States and has managed to surpass estimates in each of the last seven quarters  
The company s  12 billion AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  buyout has significantly increased its customer base and diversified offerings  With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  it is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years through long term power contracts  
However  elevated leverage of the firm  along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over two of its major projects   Vogtle and Kemper   are major overhangs  While the company s  25 billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded its budget and is years behind schedule  its Kemper project also suffered a setback with the suspension of all coal gasification operations amid additional cost burden  This is why Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from the investors 
 You can   
BNY Mellon s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the past year   18 8  vs   19 1    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in only two of the trailing four quarters  Further  the earnings estimates have been going downward ahead of the company s fourth quarter results  
The Zacks analyst thinks elevated operating expenses will likely continue to hamper bottom line growth to some extent  Also  the concentration risk  arising from significant dependence on fee based income  remains a matter of concern  
However  higher interest rates  increase in fee income and improving assets balance will support profitability  Further  enhanced capital deployment plan reflects strong balance sheet position

36717,258232,SLB,Fed s Dovishness Confirmed  Focus On Brexit And Earning Season,opinion,"The US dollar continues to weaken in 2019  this week s decline was supported by the Fed s Minutes and a busy week of FOMC talk that cemented views that the Fed can wait on the next interest rate hike  The narrative now shifts from central bank focus to Brexit and earning seasons  Prime Minister May s Brexit deal is expected to be voted down in Parliament on Tuesday  There is no strong consensus as to what is next for Brexit  but after Tuesday  we will learn a lot more  The other key driver for the next big move in risk appetite could come the beginning of a very long earning season  We have seen many technology and consumer discretionary companies warn on their outlooks already 
May expected to lose Parliament Brexit Vote on Tuesday  January 15th
Earning Season kicks off
G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting  January 16 18th
Cable remains firm ahead of Brexit Vote
Looking at the Cable  some might find it hard to believe that the end could be near for PM May  She is widely expected to lose the Parliament vote on Tuesday and many are expecting the exit day or March 29th to be postponed  despite her office refuting any possibility of that happening  After losing the Tuesday vote  there are 5 scenarios that could occur  The scariest scenario for the UK is if nothing else happens and we see a no deal Brexit  Cable could fall anywhere from 5 to 10 percent and while it is the least likely result  it is still possible and should not be ruled out  If she loses the vote by a close margin  she could renegotiate with the EU  but she will have only few days to try to come up with a Plan B and get EU concessions  A general election is another potential scenario  but that would require May getting two thirds of MPs supporting the call  A vote of no confidence has a good chance of occurring as Labour has been very clear in stating they will call a formal vote of no confidence in the government following May s defeat  If the government loses the vote  we may not see a clear alternative choice and we could see a general election  Another referendum could be a fifth scenario  albeit a longshot  that would require an extension of Article 50  this however is unlikely to occur before the March 29th deadline 

Oil winning streak snapped on profit taking
Oil had its best week in two years on a soft dollar and as the OPEC   production cuts are being implemented  Friday s round of profit taking saw West Texas Intermediate crude snap the longest streak of consecutive session gains in nine years  This week s rally took oil out of bear market territory and the backdrop of a patient Fed and progressive trade talks among the US and China have been very supportive for oil markets 

Powell seals dovish stance
Fed Chair Powell s latest interview on Thursday was a reiteration of the Minutes of the December 19th meeting  noting that policymakers regard the economic outlook as solid  despite intensifying downside risks  The Fed is clearly going to be patient on the next hike and will wait for further clarity on risks to global growth and the effect on the US economy  For the US  rebounds are expected in New Home Sales  Empire Manufacturing  factory orders  housing starts and the Philly Fed Business Outlook  while declines are expected with the PPI Final Demand  Building Permits  University of Michigan Sentiment  and Industrial Production  Softer data prints could further support the Fed s dovish bias 
Earning Season kickoffs 
Two reasons stock markets have been roaring higher are from reassurances that the Fed is in a place where it can be patient and flexible and secondly  optimism from mid level trade talks between the US and China  Investor appetite for the next major move in stocks is likely to take a queue from the beginning of earning season  Citigroup  NYSE C  kicks the season off on Monday  Tuesday we will see results from Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   United Continental Holdings Inc  NASDAQ UAL   and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Bank of America  NYSE BAC  report on Wednesday  Thursday we will hear from Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and several other financial companies  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  report on Friday

36718,258233,SLB,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  J P  Morgan  Netflix  Schlumberger,opinion,"After gaining some strength over the past week  US markets are poised to enter perhaps one of their most crucial earning seasons this coming week  Depending on Q4 2018 results  investor sentiment could improve  on the back of positive developments in the US China trade talks and the Fed s more dovish tone regarding rate hikes in 2019  Conversely  disappointing reports and weaker outlooks could easily destroy what little optimism investors are currently harboring 
Our first peek into the health of corporate America starts midweek  when the nation s largest banks report  in what s become the official kick off to earning season  As the first entities in the line of fire if the economy is slowing  banks are an important indicator of the overall soundness of the economy  a key driver of consumer risk appetite 
Below are the three most important earnings announcements from a trio of sectors investors should be monitoring in the coming week 
1  J P Morgan
Wall Street s powerhouse commercial and investment bank  JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM   will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday  January 15  before the market opens  On average  analysts are expecting  2 21 a share profit  up from  1 76 a share during the same period a year ago  Revenue is expected to jump to  26 9 billion from  25 45 billion a year ago 

JPMorgan  which has a strong presence in all major banking areas of the US economy  must meet these expectations in order to calm investors who are increasingly convinced a recession is just round the corner  During the past quarter  the lender benefited hugely from the Federal Reserve s drive to hike interest rates 
Its interest income surged to  13 9 billion  which was the highest three month total in the firm s history  But despite reporting strong earnings  its stock fell victim to the general risk aversion  plunging more than 20  from the 52 week high of  119 33 during the past quarter  Shares closed at  99 88 on Friday 
If the bank s earnings momentum continues  its report this coming week may help recover additional losses for this well regarded financial stock 
2  Netflix
Video streaming giant Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX  reports fourth quarter earnings on Thursday  January 17  after the market close  Analyst consensus is calling for earnings of  0 24 a share  down from  0 41 a share during the same period a year ago  Average sales  however  are forecast to surge to  4 21 billion  a 28  jump from the same period a year ago  as the company benefits from an increasing number of subscribers globally 

On these bullish expectations  Netflix s stock has already gained 30  during 2019  outpacing all its FAANG peers  many of which are still struggling to regain momentum after a devastating 2018  However  this powerful rally  just ahead of its Q4 2018 earnings report makes the stock vulnerable to a selloff if Netflix fails to show strong growth in its subscriber number 
Up to now  investors have ignored the company s huge spending on new programming and marketing  believing that there remains a lot of room for expansion since the internet TV and video service has no real competitor in the field  Shares of Netflix closed at  337 59 on Friday 
3  Schlumberger
The world s largest oil and gas industry services provider  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   will report before the market opens on Friday  January 18  Analysts on average are expecting EPS of  0 37  down from  0 48 during the same period a year ago  Sales are likely to remain flat  around  8 billion according to expectations 

Last month  Schlumberger said it expects sales in the US and Canada to drop by 15  in the final three months of the year  compared with the third quarter a year ago  a result of the plunge in crude prices  exhausted exploration budgets and maxed out pipelines in America s busiest field  the Permian 
 We are seeing a significantly larger drop in activity than we expected  which is leading to a larger drop in pricing than we anticipated   Patrick Schorn  executive vice president at the Houston  and Paris based company  said in prepared remarks for an investor presentation in December   We continue to see the weakening of the hydraulic fracturing market as temporary  with the expectation of a gradual recovery taking place over the first half of 2019

36745,258260,SLB,U S  job market flexes muscle  Fed still seen on hold  ,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment increased solidly in March  underscoring the economy s resilience  but an influx of Americans into the labor market could temper nascent wage growth and keep the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 215 000 last month and the unemployment rate rose to 5 0 percent from an eight year low of 4 9 percent  the Labor Department said on Friday  The jobless rate edged up as more people continued to enter or re enter the labor market  a sign of confidence in the jobs market 
Average hourly earnings gained seven cents after slipping in February  The labor market has largely shrugged off slowing global economic growth  a robust U S  dollar that has hurt manufacturing exports  and the negative impact of cheap oil prices on the energy sector 
Economists see limited impact on monetary policy in the near term from the strong jobs report  as the growing number of labor market entrants supported Fed Chair Janet Yellen s view that there was still hidden slack in the jobs market 
 The rise in participation is creating breathing room  allowing the Fed to react very slowly to a strong labor market   said Ethan Harris  global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  in New York 
The Fed also appears to be more focused on international developments  Yellen said this week that slowing world growth and lower oil prices posed a downside risk to the U S  economic outlook  adding that she considered it appropriate for policymakers to  proceed cautiously in adjusting policy  
Fed officials last month downgraded their economic growth expectations and forecast only two more rate hikes this year  The U S  central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
Financial markets see a 30 percent chance of a hike at the Fed s June policy meeting  a 50 percent chance of such a move in September and a 64 percent probability at the December meeting  according to CME FedWatch 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing 205 000 in March and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4 9 percent  The economy created 1 000 fewer jobs in January and February than previously reported 
U S  Treasury prices fell after the data  while the dollar  DXY  rose against a basket of currencies  U S  stocks were trading higher 
The jobs report came on the heels of recent data showing sluggish consumer spending and weak business investment on capital in the first two months of the year  as well as deterioration in the international trade balance 
Those reports prompted economists to slash their first quarter GDP growth estimates to as low as a 0 9 percent annualized pace from as high as a 2 0 percent rate  The economy grew at a 1 4 percent rate in the fourth quarter 
Other data on Friday showed manufacturing activity expanded in March for the first time in six months as new orders surged  suggesting the worst of the factory rout was over  The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose 2 3 points to a reading of 51 8 in March 
WAGES BOUNCE BACK
Though employment gains have slowed after averaging 282 000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter  there is little labor market strain from the global slowdown  which helped to ignite a massive stock market sell off at the start of the year 
Wages increased last month  with average hourly earnings rising 0 3 percent  That lifted the year on year earnings gain to 2 3 percent from 2 2 percent in February  a welcome development after the recent wobble in consumer sentiment 
Economists say wage growth of between 3 0 percent and 3 5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed s 2 0 percent target  Though the Fed s preferred inflation measure is currently at 1 7 percent  Yellen has expressed skepticism over the sustainability of gains  citing transitory factors 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  rose a tenth of a percentage point to 63 percent in March  the highest level since March 2014 
It has increased 0 6 percentage point since dipping to 62 4 percent in September  About 2 4 million people entered or re entered the job market since September  the second largest increase in the labor force over a six month period on record 
 This sharp rise in the labor force can only mean formerly frustrated people are coming back to the labor market as their jobs prospects have improved   said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Research in New York 
But a broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment rose to 9 8 percent last month from a more than 7 1 2 year low of 9 7 percent 
Employment gains in March were broad based  Manufacturing  however  lost 29 000 jobs  the largest number since December 2009  despite signs of stabilization in the factory sector 
Mining purged 12 000 more jobs last month  Mining payrolls have declined by 185 000 jobs since peaking in September 2014  with three fourths of the losses in support activities 
Oilfield services providers Schlumberger  N SLB  and  Halliburton Co   N HAL  have announced thousands of job cuts as they try to cope with reduced profits from a prolonged slump in oil prices

36748,258263,SLB,U S  industrial output falls  signals weak first quarter GDP growth,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  industrial production fell more than expected in March as manufacturing output dropped by the most in a year and mining maintained its downward trend  the latest indication that economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter 
A rebound in growth is  however  anticipated despite other data on Friday showing a further erosion in consumer sentiment in early April 
Economists say a confluence of temporary factors  including an ongoing problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations  has contributed to lowering growth in the first quarter  The government last year took steps to refine the seasonal adjustment for some components of GDP  which economists said left residual seasonality in the data 
 The first quarter was clearly a dud  but there are reasons to be optimistic  There are still measurement issues  with the residual seasonality in GDP  and history shows that reverses in the second quarter   said Ryan Sweet  senior economist at Moody s Analytics in Westchester  Pennsylvania 
Industrial output declined 0 6 percent last month after dropping 0 6 percent drop in February  the Federal Reserve said on Friday  Industrial production has fallen in six of the last seven months  Economists had forecast industrial output falling only 0 1 percent last month  Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2 2 percentin the first quarter after decreasing at a 3 3 percent pace in the fourth quarter  Industrial capacity use in March fell to its lowest level since August 2010 
The report joined data on retail sales  business spending  trade and wholesale inventories in suggesting that economic growth slowed to crawl at the turn of the year 
Growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0 2 percent annualized rate  The economy grew at a 1 4 percent rate in the fourth quarter 
In a separate report  the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 89 7 early this month from a reading of 91 0 in March amid concerns that slowing economic growth would hamper job creation 
Sentiment has declined for four straight months  Households  long term inflation expectations fell back to their all time low  which could buy a cautious Federal Reserve more time to keep interest rates at current low levels 
 Persistently low price expectations increase the risks of monetary policy remaining highly accommodative for longer than currently expected   said Jesse Hurwitz  an economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  in New York 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government debt rose  U S  stocks were little changed 
WORST LIKELY OVER
The industrial sector has been undermined by a slowingglobal economy and robust dollar  which have eroded demandfor U S  manufactured goods 
It is also being weighed down by lower oil prices that have undercut capital investment in the energy sector  as well efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang  But there are signs the worst of the industrial sector downturn is over  with recent manufacturing surveys turning higher 
A third report on Friday from the New York Federal Reserve showed factory activity in New York state accelerated in April to its highest level in more than a year as new orders and shipments increased 
 It is likely the inventory correction and stronger dollar continued to weigh on the output data for the first quarter  and we remain hopeful that the worst of the drags from these factors have passed and that activity will pick up shortly   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
Last month  manufacturing output fell 0 3 percent  the biggest decline since February 2015  after slipping 0 1 percent in February  Manufacturing was dragged down by motor vehicle and parts production  which plunged 1 6 percent after rising 0 8 percent the prior month 
For the first quarter  manufacturing output rose at a 0 6 percent rate 
Mining production tumbled 2 9 percent as oil and gas well drilling plummeted 8 5 percent after diving 15 8 percent in February  Last month s drop in mining output was the largest since September 2008  when output was curtailed because of hurricanes  Mining production has declined in each of the last seven months

36751,258266,SLB,U S  economy stalls in first quarter as activity weakens broadly,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter to its slowest pace in two years as consumer spending softened and a strong dollar continued to undercut exports  but a pick up in activity is anticipated given a buoyant labor market  Gross domestic product increased at a 0 5 percent annual rate  the weakest since the first quarter of 2014  the Labor Department said on Thursday in its advance estimate  Growth was also held back by businesses stepping up efforts to reduce unwanted merchandise clogging up warehouses   Cheap oil  which has pressured the profits of oil field companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL   remained a drag  sending business spending tumbling at its quickest pace since the second quarter of 2009  when the recession ended  Almost all sectors of the economy weakened in the first quarter  with housing the lone star    The economy essentially stalled in the first quarter  but that doesn t mean it is faltering   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   Some of the restraints to growth are dissipating  Growth is likely to accelerate going forward    The dollar s rally is largely over  oil prices appear to be stabilizing and the bulk of the inventory liquidation is out of the way  In addition  the jobs market remains fairly robust  A separate report from the Labor Department showed first time applications for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week and the four week average of initial claims fell to its lowest level since 1973  Employment gains averaged 209 000 jobs per month in the first quarter  Also suggesting a pickup in growth in the second quarter  the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys  which are closely correlated to economic activity  rebounded in recent months  While the Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged economic activity had  slowed   it also said labor market conditions had  improved further   The U S  central bank appeared to view the threats from the global economy and financial markets as having diminished   The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and suggested it was in no hurry to tighten monetary policy further  It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade  Economists had forecast the economy expanding at a 0 7 percent rate in the January March period after growing at a 1 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter  U S  financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the Bank of Japan s decision overnight to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus  The dollar fell against the yen and U S  stocks were trading slightly lower  Prices for U S  government debt slipped  SEASONAL QUIRK Though the weakness in growth last quarter was broad based  economists believe the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite steps last year to address the problem   Residual seasonality has plagued first quarter GDP  with growth underperforming in five of the last six years since the recovery started in mid 2009  Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  increased at a 1 9 percent rate  That was the slowest in a year and marked a deceleration from the fourth quarter s 2 4 percent rate  Households have been frugal  cutting back on purchases of long lasting manufactured goods like automobiles  despite cheap gasoline  as they sock away modest wage gains and the gasoline savings  They have also reduced their debt  Income at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 2 9 percent in the first quarter after rising 2 3 percent in the prior period  Savings rose to a lofty  712 3 billion from  678 3 billion in the fourth quarter   Consumer spending will rebound in the second quarter on the basis of solid growth in income and lower energy costs  which are an under appreciated tailwind that could offset much of the drag from weak global growth   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   senior economist at RBS  LON RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut  Businesses continued to place fewer orders for goods in the first quarter  accumulating  60 9 billion worth of inventory  down from  78 3 billion in the fourth quarter  The small inventory build cut 0 33 percentage point from first quarter GDP growth   Trade subtracted 0 34 percentage point from GDP growth  with dollar strength weighing on exports and sucking in imports   The dollar gained 20 percent versus the currencies of the United States  trading partners between June 2014 and December 2015  So far this year the dollar is down 2 6 percent on a trade  weighted basis  A sustained plunge in energy sector investment undermined business spending  Equipment spending tumbled at an 8 6 percent rate  the steepest decline since the second quarter of 2009   Investment in nonresidential structures dropped at a 10 7 percent pace as spending on mining exploration  wells and shafts collapsed at a record 86 percent rate after contracting at a 39 6 percent pace in the fourth quarter  Economists said sluggish business spending suggested productivity will remain weak  
 It makes no sense that companies slashed capital spending but boosted payrolls in the first quarter   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York   The data portend another very weak productivity report for the quarter  ",2016-04-28,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/weak-consumer-spending,-trade-seen-hurting-u.s.-q1-growth-398481",398481

	The S P took the same route by gaining around 1  at its best before giving it all back and hitting a new low for the year beneath 2533  However  it regrouped and returned to breakeven with an advance of 0 01  to 2546 16 
	It was a pretty good session for tech  which gave the NASDAQ the best percentage performance of the day with an increase of 0 45  to 6783 91  However  it took the same volatile trip as the other major indices  The FAANGs were all solidly on the plus side with Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX    3 1   and Facebook  NASDAQ FB    2 5   out front 
	And now it s all about the Fed  The two day meeting concludes tomorrow and we should have a better idea what the committee plans for rates moving forward  The odds still strongly favor a fourth hike of the year tomorrow  but future increases are now less certain due to this sharp correction 
	The market would love a dovish statement that leaves any further tightening up to the data rather than a set in stone roadmap to be followed regardless of market sentiment  According to a lot of market watchers  this may be our last chance at a Santa Claus rally Today s Portfolio Highlights Stocks Under  10  This correction hasn t left many safe places for investors to hide  but Brian Bolan feels that a grocery store is more secure than most  People have to eat regardless of what the market is doing  and they re more likely to go to a warehouse style location such as Smart and Final Stores  SFS   This grocery store chain has 324 stores in the Western U S   mostly in California  Over the past four quarters  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate three times and matched once  It beat by more than 35  in its most recent report and now has a four quarter average surprise of nearly 26   Read the complete commentary for a lot more on this new addition TAZR Trader  The odds are still very high that the FOMC will hike for a fourth time this year tomorrow  but some Fed watchers are actually starting to doubt it with the collapse in oil  Since the portfolio is net short right now  Kevin recently said that he sees no problem in picking up a position like ProShares UltraPro QQQ  TQQQ  to pivot back long after a 17  correction in the Nasdaq 100  With the ETF dropping under  40 today  that idea was activated on Tuesday  If there isn t a hike tomorrow or the Fed is especially dovish  the portfolio will at least be in the starting blocks for a potential market rally  Read the complete commentary for more

36766,258281,SLB,Top Research Reports For Procter   Gamble  Oracle   United Parcel Service,opinion,"Friday  December 21  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Procter   Gamble  PG   Oracle  ORCL  and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Procter   Gamble s shares outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry in the past three months  gaining  8  vs  1 6   The Zacks analyst thinks that this can be attributed to the company s robust earnings history  having outpaced estimates for 14 straight quarters when it reported first quarter fiscal 2019  
Moreover  earnings grew year over year  Also  sales beat estimates  though it remained flat due to adverse currency fluctuations   which acted as a major deterrent in the first quarter and is likely to remain a concern in the second quarter  The company has been witnessing strained margins for last few quarters due to higher commodity and shipping costs  adverse currency  increased business investments and aggressive pricing from private label products  
Soft baby care business is also a concern  Nonetheless  the company is focused on improving productivity and cost savings to boost margins  Its focus on product improvement  packaging and marketing initiatives is encouraging 
 You can   
Shares of Oracle have underperformed the Zacks Computer Software industry in the past year  losing  2 4  vs   12 2   Oracle is one of the largest enterprise grade database  middleware and application software providers  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong adoption of its cloud based solutions  comprising Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM  among others  
Partnerships with the likes of Accenture  NYSE ACN  are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud base clientele  Also  anticipated strong demand for the next generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost competitive position against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS   
Nonetheless  stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to limit margin expansion  Further  lower hardware volumes are anticipated to hurt top line growth consequently keeping margins under pressure  Additionally  integration risks from buyouts remain a concern 
 You can   
United Parcel Service s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  losing  20 8  vs   27 1   United Parcel Service has been benefitting from strong e commerce growth  The company anticipates cross border e commerce volume to grow by 28  over the next three years  
The company s transformation plan  unveiled in September 2018  is aimed at boosting its bottom line  Approval of the deal by its freight workers is an added positive  The Zacks analyst is also impressed by UPS  efforts to reward its shareholders  
UPS  bullish full year forecast on free cash flow supports the possibility of a dividend hike in the near future  However  the company s high capital expenditures are a cause for concern  UPS spent  4 5 billion as capital expenditure in the first nine months of 2018  
Trade war related tensions and high debts pose further challenges to the company  In a year s time  the UPS stock has declined more than 20

Analyst Blog  Low Oil  Fed Hikes Push Energy Stocks to Fresh 52 Week LowsThe year 2018 has been quite a turbulent one for the oil and gas sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  started the year just above  60 per barrel of oil and touched multi year highs of more than  76 in early October  However  the rally was pretty short lived  The commodity has plunged around 38  since then on fears of oversupply and economic headwinds  Oil prices and stocks were already going through a rough patch  and the Federal Reserve added to the woes by raising the interest rates yet again yesterday for the fourth time in 2018  Markedly  all the three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   suffered correction yesterday  having declined 2   1 6  and 2 4   respectively  Post the hawkish stance by the Fed  WTI hit a fresh 15 month low of around  46 a barrel  In fact  Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   declined around 3  during the same time Crude in Bear Territory Amid HeadwindsCrude is reeling under the effects of supply glut along with fears of economic slowdown  which has been weakening commodity demand  Higher than expected output from Russia and record level of production from the prolific shale plays of the United States  even amid pipeline constraints  have been raising concerns  Markedly  the U S  crude market has shifted from year over year storage deficit to a surplus  Current crude supplies  which stand at 441 5 million barrels  are up 1 1 from the year ago figure and 7  from the five year average  Moreover  Fed rate hikes are likely to make borrowing costlier  impacting capital intensive sectors including energy and others  which will have to bear the rising cost of capital  This may rather slow down economic activities in general  undercutting oil demand further  Further  the dollar strength is playing a spoilsport by making the crude dearer for investors holding foreign currency  Stocks Plunge to 52 Week LowsAs it is  the oil price rally in the first nine months of the year did not really filter down to the stock prices quite well  Further  with the plunge in the crude over the past few months  share prices of the energy stocks have been on the red territory  Making things worse  Fed s decision of hiking rates and reducing outlook for 2019 took a beating on oil prices and spooked investors further  as is evident by the share prices of a host of leading energy companies that hit new 52 week lows yesterday  Oil supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp   Royal Dutch Shell plc and Chevron Corp  dipped to their respective one year low levels yesterday  albeit closing the session a tad higher  While ExxonMobil and Chevron both carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Shell holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see Various

to PersistNotably  the lingering trade conflict with China  an impending global economic slowdown and several geopolitical crises are likely to hinder growth of the U S  economy  As it is  the Fed slashed its 2019 estimate for U S  GDP growth to 2 3   lower than its September projection of 2 5   Weakening economic growth is likely to impact oil prices and demand  In fact  global oil demand is already showing signs of slowdown  especially in China and India  Moreover  the waivers on Iran oil sanctions are likely to continue till April  raising supply glut concerns  Further  the oversupplied oil market is not likely to wane anytime soon amid the softening demand  which is further expected to dent investors  sentiment  Hence  an immediate crude price rise may not be round the corner

36797,258312,SLB,Manufacturing weakening as job market firms,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for long lasting manufactured goods in December recorded their biggest drop in 16 months  the latest indication that U S  economic growth braked sharply at the end of 2015 
Despite the slowdown in growth  which was acknowledged by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday  the labor market remains on solid ground  Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits retreated from a six month high last week 
The economy has been blindsided by a strong dollar  spending cuts by energy firms bruised by the slump in oil prices and anemic demand overseas  Business efforts to trim an inventory overhang have also weighed on growth and the outlook has been dimmed by the recent stock market selloff 
The Commerce Department said durable goods orders plunged 5 1 percent last month  the biggest drop since August 2014  after slipping 0 5 percent in November  The decline was generally broad based  with orders for transportation equipment plunging 12 4 percent and bookings for non defense aircraft plummeting 29 4 percent 
The drop in aircraft orders is surprising as Boeing  N BA  received orders for 223 aircraft in December  up from 89 planes the prior month  according to information posted on its website 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders falling 0 6 percent last month 
Non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  decreased 4 3 percent in December  These so called core capital goods orders fell 1 1 percent in November 
The decline in orders for both durable and capital goods adds to weak data on retail sales  industrial production  exports and business inventories  suggesting the economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter 
According to a Reuters survey of economists  the government is expected to report on Friday that fourth quarter gross domestic product increased at a 0 8 percent annual rate after notching a 2 percent pace in the third quarter  There is  however  a risk that output contracted in the fourth quarter 
U S  financial markets were little moved by the data on Thursday as traders followed the gyrations in crude oil prices 
WEAK BUSINESS SPENDING
The Fed said on Wednesday  economic growth slowed late last year  and noted that business fixed investment has been increasing at a  moderate  pace in recent months 
The U S  central bank left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it was  closely monitoring global economic and financial developments  to assess their impact on the labor market and inflation 
The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
While cheap oil has been a boon to consumers  it has eroded the profits of energy companies  forcing oilfield services firms like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  to cut capital spending budgets 
Manufacturing  which accounts for 12 percent of the economy  has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat  which has undercut growth in new orders  The dollar has weighed on exports 
Pointing to weak business spending  shipments of core capital goods   used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP report   dipped 0 2 percent last month after falling 1 1 percent in November 
In a second report  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 16 000 to a seasonally adjusted 278 000 during the week ended Jan  23

36799,258314,SLB,U S  job growth slows  unemployment rate at eight year low,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded  but surging wages and an unemployment rate at an eight year low suggested the labour market recovery remains firm 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate was at 4 9 percent  the lowest since February 2008  the Labor Department said on Friday 
Data for November and December was revised to show 2 000 fewer jobs created than previously reported  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast employment increasing by 190 000 and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent 
Also taking the sting from the softer payrolls number  employers increased hours for workers  Manufacturing  which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand  added the most jobs since August 2013 
The sharp step down in job gains from the fourth quarter s brisk clip largely reflected payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather sensitive sectors like construction  January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers  which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales 
But coming in the wake of an abrupt slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter and a sharp stock market sell off  the closely watched employment report could add to concerns the U S  economic outlook was deteriorating 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
Against the backdrop of tightening financial market conditions  the deceleration in employment growth could further undercut the case for a Fed interest rate hike in March  The U S  central bank raised its short term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
FULL EMPLOYMENT
The economy grew at a 0 7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory 
Even with slower job growth  wages rebounded sharply after holding steady in December  Average hourly earnings increased 12 cents or 0 5 percent  That left the year on year gain in earnings at 2 5 percent as the unusually strong wage gains seen in January 2014 dropped out of the picture 
But with the jobless rate in a range most economists associate with full employment  wage growth is expected to pick up this year 
With its January employment report  the government published its annual  benchmark  revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations  It also incorporated new population estimates 
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 206 000 lower on a seasonally adjusted basis than it had reported  The shift in population controls means figures on the labour force or number of employed or unemployed in January are not directly comparable to December 
The labour force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job was at 62 7 percent  near four decade lows 
Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labour shrinks  unless a significant rise in wages lures more people back into the labour force 
In January  all the employment gains were in the private sector  which added 158 000 jobs  The services sector dominated the payrolls increase last month  with 118 000 jobs created 
Mining losing lost 7 000 more jobs  while the embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29 000 positions 
Mining payrolls have decreased by 146 000 since peaking in September 2014  About three fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining 
Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20 246 workers  Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months  forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger  N SLB  to slash their workforces 
Construction payrolls rose 18 000  cooling off after hefty gains in the fourth quarter  Courier services hiring fell 14 400  Retail employment added a strong 57 700 jobs after shedding 800 positions in December  But hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers  including Walmart  N WMT  and Macy s announced dozens of store closures

WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded  but surging wages and an unemployment rate at an eight year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151 000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped one tenth of a percentage point to 4 9 percent  the lowest since February 2008  the Labor Department said on Friday  The growth in January payrolls was a sharp step down from the average 231 000 jobs per month during the fourth quarter 
 The fact that payroll gains fell back to earth is not necessarily a bad sign  Most indications are that the job market in the U S  is on solid footing and improving   said Nariman Behravesh  chief economist at IHS in Lexington  Massachusetts 
Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190 000 in January and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent  The economy added 2 000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported 
On top of a 0 5 percent jump in average hourly earnings  which was the biggest gain in a year  employers increased hours for workers  Manufacturing  which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand  added the most jobs since August 2013 
Economists said the combination of solid wage growth and falling unemployment suggested a March interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve could not be completely ruled out 
The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies on the data after hitting a roughly 15 week low on Thursday  Prices for U S  Treasury debt fell as did stocks on Wall Street 
 The lower unemployment rate and rising wages further support the view that the labor market is doing nothing but tightening   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   Clearly  there are more uncertainties today than when the Fed raised rates in December and hinted that there could be four increases this year  But the labor market is absolutely not one of them  
Tightening financial market conditions and signs that both the domestic and global economies were slowing had undercut the case for a Fed rate hike next month and lowered the probability of monetary policy tightening this year 
The U S  central bank raised its short term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
WEATHER PAYBACK
January s softer job gains were payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather sensitive sectors like construction  January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers  which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales 
The economy grew at a 0 7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the buoyant dollar cutting into exports in December  causing the trade deficit to widen 2 7 percent to  43 4 billion

The private sector accounted for all employment gains in January  adding 158 000 positions 
The services sector created 118 000 jobs  the fewest in 10 months  That was because temporary help services fell 25 200 and courier and messenger employment declined by 14 400 jobs  Hiring in these categories normally rises during the holiday season 
Educational services lost 38 500 jobs  but retail payrolls added a strong 57 700 positions  But hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers  including Walmart  N WMT  and Macy s  N M  announced dozens of store closures

36803,258318,SLB,U S  fourth quarter GDP growth revised higher on strong inventory investment,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter  but not as sharply as initially thought  with businesses less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory  which could hurt output in the first three months of 2016 
Gross domestic product increased at a 1 0 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 0 7 percent pace  the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that fourth quarter GDP growth would be revised down to a 0 4 percent pace  The economy grew at a rate of 2 0 percent in the third quarter and expanded 2 4 percent in 2015 
U S  stock index futures extended gains after the data  while prices of Treasuries fell  The dollar  DXY  added to gains against a basket of currencies 
Businesses accumulated  81 7 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter rather than the  68 6 billion reported last month  The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining  utilities and construction 
As a result  inventories subtracted only 0 14 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0 45 percentage point 
The bigger inventory build is bad news for first quarter GDP growth as it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders  which will continue to hold down production 
 The weaker drag from inventories in the fourth quarter means that any rebound in the first quarter could be slightly more modest than we previously expected   said Paul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto 
 Nevertheless  it still appears that first quarter GDP growth is on track to rebound to a very healthy 2 5 percent annualized or higher  which should dampen any concerns about an imminent recession  
DOWNSIDE RISKS
First quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as a 2 5 percent rate  but the risks are tilted to the downside amid slowing world economies  a strong dollar and a recent global stock market sell off that has tightened financial market conditions 
Cheap oil has also been a drag on the profits of oil field companies such as Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL   prompting them to slash capital expenditure budgets 
The upward revision to fourth quarter GDP growth also reflected a smaller trade deficit than initially thought as imports contracted  The trade deficit subtracted 0 25 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the 0 47 percentage point reported last month 
Business spending on equipment contracted at a less steep 1 8 percent rate last quarter  compared to the previously reported 2 5 percent rate 
There was a small downward revision to consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  Consumer spending rose at a 2 0 percent pace rather than the 2 2 percent rate reported last month 
Unusually mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel in December and undermined demand for heating  But there are signs consumption picked up in January with the return to more normal winter temperatures 
With gasoline prices around  2 per gallon  a tightening labor market gradually lifting wages and house prices boosting household wealth  the fundamentals for consumer spending remain quite strong

and an assistant are peering through a scanning electron microscope  studying samples from the state s vast Bakken shale oil formation  Kurz  a hydrogeologist  is part of a team  which looks at using carbon dioxide to coax more oil out of wells that have already been hydraulically fractured  or fracked  in the process of extracting oil from shale rocks   No one is sure just yet how this process can work in the Bakken   said Kurz   We re hoping to crack that riddle   While energy firms around the world slash spending and cut jobs in response to crashing oil prices  research institutions and companies across North America are not letting up in their efforts to make production more efficient   In fact  demand for money saving solutions is greater than ever and research centers  helped by

funded by the federal government and industry partners  including  Marathon Oil  Corp  N MRO  and Continental Resources  N CLR   also works on alternative fuel and coal technologies  but the CO2 project is among the biggest  While carbon dioxide from coal fired power plants has been used for years to extract oil from older  conventional wells  it has yet to be applied commercially in shale drilling  Unlike spongy conventional oil reserves  shale is a rock and the scientists are now trying to find the best way for CO2 to flow through it and help bring oil to the surface   Elsewhere  efforts range from aggregating reams of data from field sensors to using medical scanning equipment or reducing the amount of water used for fracking  NEW URGENCY  We think this slowdown will actually be a plus for technology research and development   Jon Olson  head of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas Austin  told Reuters  Whether any breakthroughs

by about 10 percent  That  according to Reuters calculations  would bring costs to around  24 30 per barrel  below current market prices   So far  the process has worked in laboratory conditions  but not yet in field trials  so it is unclear how quickly it could be commercially deployed  Oscar Abbink  an oilfield technology expert at IHS Energy Insight  which is not involved in the North Dakota research  called the study promising and noted how the industry s interest in innovation has soared during the downturn   A few years ago  it was all about pulling more oil out of the ground  Now  the cost is much more important    Scientists at privately held WellDog Inc and  Blackbird Energy Inc   V BBI  are also looking into the carbon dioxide use  WellDog  which markets spectroscopy technology to shale clients to help them distinguish between types of natural gas  last December launched a new service that helps customers measure CO2 levels in older oil wells and could also serve to control volumes pumped into new ones   This is a growth area   said John Pope  WellDog s president  PUMPS  SCANNERS AND SUPERCOMPUTERS So far  ConocoPhillips  N COP  is the only large oil producer to cut research spending  Others could follow suit as cheap crude keeps exerting pressure on budgets  but for now several continue with their own research    Hess Corp   N HES   North Dakota s third largest oil producer  is studying how it can lengthen the horizontal wells and use cheaper materials in fracking  Services giant Schlumberger NV  N SLB   licensed a new process last fall that slashes the

control the process  John England  U S  oil and gas specialist at consulting firm Deloitte said he was confident there were more efficiency gains ahead   As we apply more technology  there s still a long way to go in terms of cost reduction   Data is one area where some major players expect the fastest progress and the highest rewards   Petroleum Geo Services ASA  OL PGS  says demand for services

36818,258333,SLB,Cana Woodford Basin Witnesses Removal Of 3 Oil Drilling Rigs,opinion,"In its weekly release  Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   reports a decrease in the U S  rig count    
More on the Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued at the end of every week since 1944  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
A change in the Houston based oilfield services players  rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Details
Total U S  Rig Count Decreases   Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1079 in the week ended Nov 21  lower than 1082 in the prior week  This marks a fall in rig count  after the tally increased for two weeks in a row    
Despite the rig count slipping to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  it has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 923   
For the week under review  the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations  The number of onshore rigs totaled 1052  down from 1058 in the previous week  However  offshore rig count increased to 25 from 22  The tally for inland water rig was in line with the count for the week ended Nov 16  Notably  two rigs operated in the inland waters last week 
U S  Removes Three Oil Rigs  Oil rig tally was 885  down from 888 in the week ended Nov 16  Notably  the tally increased in five of the last 10 weeks 
However  the current total  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly higher than last year s 747  
Natural Gas Rig Count Flat in the United States  The natural gas rig count of 194 was in line with the count for week ended Nov 16 
Importantly  like oil  the count of rigs exploring the commodity is above the prior year number of 176  However  per the recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is almost 88   below the all time high of 1 606 in 2008 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 77 units  up from the previous week s 72  However  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations also known as shale formations  decreased by eight units to 1002    
Gulf of Mexico  GoM  Rig Count Rises  The GoM rig count is 25 units  of which 18 were oil directed  The count is higher than the tally of 22 for the week ended Nov 16  
Conclusion
Weak crude pricing scenario led major basins in the United States to witness withdrawal of rigs  Cana Woodford basin saw the removal of three oil rigs  while one oil drilling rig was removed from each of Eagle Ford and Williston basins 
Although the U S  crude benchmark plunged to its lowest settlement since mid October 2017  the possibility that Saudi Arabia will consider curbing supply in the OPEC meeting on Dec 6 could give some respite to the commodity price  The positive development is expected to back oil drillers to resume adding rigs  reflecting favorable business scenario for explorers and producers 
Hence  investor friendly stocks like Energen Corp    NYSE EGN   and Antero Resources Corp    NYSE AR   are in focus  While Energen sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Antero carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   
Energen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  average positive earnings surprise being 18 6    
We expect Antero s earnings to skyrocket 230 3  year over year in 2018

	Every time the market rallies after getting some good news  volatility rears its ugly head again and we end up giving most of it back  It happened again on Tuesday  Stocks had been on the rise of late due to favorable developments on interest rates and trade  but today the major indices returned approximately half of the recent advances 
	The NASDAQ plunged 3 8   or more than 283 points  to 7 158 43  while the S P was off 3 24  to 2700 06  The Dow slipped 3 1   or nearly 800 points  to 25 027 07  Stocks ended near the lows of the session  These indices had each jumped approximately 6  in the previous 6 trading days 
	After such a strong runup  one would expect the market to give some of it back  But the extent of this selloff was surprising  The main problem was the flattening yield curve  bringing the yield spread between the 2  and 10 year Treasury bonds closer to an inversion  Markets have been worried about an economic slowdown for a while now  but that move shifted their concern into a higher gear 
	And further complicating matters  it seems that the good feelings from the G 20 have already waned  It doesn t help that President Trump was again talking tough on trade via Twitter  even calling himself a  Tariff Man   That 90 day delay in additional tariffs feels even shorter now  especially since the clock apparently started ticking on Dec 1 instead of waiting until Jan 1 
	What a difference a day can make  We were feeling pretty good yesterday  but this October like selloff sapped a lot of that enthusiasm  The media will probably be talking more about the possibility of a recession now  but its important to note that the yield curve did NOT invert  And we ve survived tons of tweets from the President  Hopefully  we can recover the ground lost today and then some during this historically strong month for the market  Looking forward though  it does make the Fed s future rate hike plans all the more important Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Stocks Under  10  On a day like today  stocks that manage to close on the positive side stick out like a green thumb  Case in point  while the market was selling off by more than 3   Fluidigm Corporation  FLDM  gained 1 63   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  operates as a biotech tools company that creates microfluidic based chips and instrumentation for biological research  Brian Bolan was most impressed with this company s resilience today given that there is a 16  short interest position  so he added it to the portfolio  Read his full write up for a lot more on FLDM Surprise Trader  Talk about bucking the trend  Not only did Restoration Hardware  RH  gain ground during a sharp selloff on Tuesday  but it jumped by 10 9  after a solid quarterly report  This luxury home furnishings company reported earnings per share of  1 73  which crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 27 by more than 36   It marked the 10th straight positive surprise and brings its four quarter average beat to 23 5   Revenues of  638 5 million also topped our expectations at  633 million

36821,258336,SLB,Schlumberger Expects North America Revenues To Fall In Q4,opinion,The executive vice president of Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB    Wells Patrick Schorn recently said in a conference that the company s total fourth quarter revenues from the North America can be impacted by a 15  sequential fall  owing to declining hydraulic fracturing pricing  The region is currently witnessing more than expected reduction in hydraulic fracturing activities  Notably  in the third quarter earnings call  the company projected its earnings per share to decline sequentially  due to the above negatives  Affected by the weakness in prices  producers in the North America are pulling back from fracking and well completions What s Ahead Schlumberger  one of the largest oilfield services companies of the world  generated  3 2 billion revenues from the North America  accounting for 37 5  of the total revenues  in the third quarter of 2018  This reflected a 2  increase from the year ago figure  However  the company now expects fourth quarter 2018 revenues from the region at around  2 7 billion  representing a 3 6  fall from the year ago quarter  First quarter 2019 revenues will also bear the brunt of low hydraulic fracturing activities  However  Schlumberger expects the region to undergo a gradual recovery till the first half of 2019 Schlumberger expects its international revenues  excluding the effects of Cameron businesses  to be in line with estimates  However  a few Latin American countries can reflect signs of weakness Stock Price MovementThe investors were not thrilled with the above news  as the stock fell 3 7  in the last session  Notably  in the past six months  the stock has declined 36  compared with the 28 4  collective fall of the  it belongs to  Where is it Headed WTI crude  the American benchmark  which popped above  76 per barrel and touched multi year highs in early October  plunged to  50 29 on Nov 28  The volatility in oil prices has brought uncertainty  which is expected to affect exploration and production expenditures for the coming year  This will  in turn  affect the results of oilfield services companies  Schlumberger expects its clients to choose more conservative ways until the recent volatility diminishes Exploration and production companies in the United States are looking forward for budget cuts in 2019 due to the current pricing scenario  For example  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC   estimated  1 6 billion adjusted free cash flow  assuming  60 per barrel of oil  for 2019  Needless to say  the close  50 price level is going to hinder that estimate  Hence  the company has reduced its full year 2019 capital expenditure guidance to  4 3  4 7 billion  compared with its  4 9 billion capital expenditure in first three quarters of 2018 Therefore  until the current volatility in the oil market clears up  the situation will keep hurting the oilfield services providers  The OPEC Non OPEC meeting slated to be held this week is  in this context Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Investors interested in the energy sector can opt for some better ranked stocks given below Houston  TX based Enterprise Products Partners L P    NYSE EPD   has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company s earnings for 2018 are expected to surge more than 36  year over year  You can see  Rome  Italy based Eni S p A    NYSE E   has a Zacks Rank  1  Its earnings for 2018 are expected to grow more than 100  from the 2017 level  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-expects-north-america-revenues-to-fall-in-q4-200365263,200365263

Heading into today  shares of the world s largest oilfield services company had lost 17 95  over the past month  lagging the Oils Energy sector s loss of 7 26  and the S P 500 s loss of 1 93  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from SLB as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 18  2019  On that day  SLB is projected to report earnings of  0 41 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 14 58   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  8 34 billion  up 1 97  from the year ago period 
SLB s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  1 67 per share and revenue of  32 99 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  11 33  and  8 36   respectively 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for SLB should also be noted by investors  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 96  lower  SLB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Looking at its valuation  SLB is holding a Forward P E ratio of 25 28  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 17 71  so we one might conclude that SLB is trading at a premium comparatively 
Meanwhile  SLB s PEG ratio is currently 4 21  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  SLB s industry had an average PEG ratio of 2 19 as of yesterday s close

has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  The current national rig count is higher than the prior year level of 931   For the week under review  the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations  The number of onshore rigs totaled 1050  down from 1051 in the previous week  The tally for offshore and inland water rigs  however  was in line with the counts for the week ended Nov 30  Through the week ended Dec 7  two rigs operated in the inland waters  while the count for offshore rigs was 23 U S  Removes 10 Oil Rigs  Oil rig tally was 877  down from 887 in the

36825,258340,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Chevron s Capex Boost  Schlumberger s Revenue Warning   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices climbed but natural gas futures dropped 
On the news front  U S  energy major Chevron   NYSE CVX   set its investment budget for 2019 at  20 billion  up 9 3  from its projected spending this year  Meanwhile  Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   warned of weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market 
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained 3 3  to close at  52 61 per barrel  natural gas prices fell some 2 7  to  4 488 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark rose last week after OPEC members and some non OPEC producers  led by Russia  committed to withhold production by 1 2 million barrels per day from January in an effort to tighten the market and boost prices  Data showing drillers in the United States cutting oil rigs the most in more than two years also contributed to the gains 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices dropped as predictions of milder weather  translating into weak heating gas demand  over the next few days more than offset the larger than expected decrease in supplies 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Chevron recently announced its capital and exploratory spending program for 2019  The budget for capital projects is reserved at  20 billion  higher than 2018 s projected investment of  18 3 billion  Notably  this marks the first budget increase in four years and reflects a 9 3  annual increase Chevron s upstream spending in 2019 is expected to increase 9 5  from 2018  which can enable the company to deliver steady growth in production  Downstream expenditure of the company will likely increase 13 6  in 2019  Moreover  the company expects 66 7  of its 2019 capital spending to realize cash flow by two years Chevron allocated 86 5  of its total budget toward upstream operations  The company has plans to spend  7 6 billion in the upstream projects located in the United States and  9 7 billion in the international upstream projects  The company will use around  10 4 billion to develop and grow its present producing assets  of which  3 6 billion will allocated to the Permian Basin and  1 6 billion for other shale related developments   Read more  2     The executive vice president of Schlumberger  Wells Patrick Schorn  recently said

of low hydraulic fracturing activities  However  Schlumberger expects the region to undergo a gradual recovery till the first half of 2019 You can see  Schlumberger expects its international revenues

36852,258367,SLB,Robust U S  jobs report bolsters case for December rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged in October and the unemployment rate hit a 7 1 2 year low of 5 0 percent in a show of economic strength that makes it much more likely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 271 000 last month  the largest rise since December 2014  the Labor Department said on Friday  In addition  average hourly earnings rose a respectable 9 cents  The payrolls jump followed modest gains in August and September 
The unemployment rate now stands at its lowest level since April 2008 and is in a range many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment 
 The employment report had everything you could have asked for  It more than offsets the weakness in the prior two months and positions the Fed to hike rates in December   said Michelle Meyer  deputy U S  chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  N BAC  in New York 
The reaction in financial markets was swift and sharp 
The dollar rallied to a near seven month high against a basket of currencies as investors braced for higher borrowing costs  U S  Treasury debt prices fell  with yields on the two year note hitting a 5 1 2 year high  U S  stocks ended mostly higher 
Rates futures implied a 70 percent chance of a Fed rate increase next month  up from 58 percent late on Thursday 
With speeches from several Fed officials  including Chair Janet Yellen  suggesting a low bar for a December rate increase  economists had said ahead of the report that monthly job gains above 150 000 in October and November would be sufficient grounds for the first increase in overnight borrowing costs since 2006 
The U S  central bank  which has held rates near zero for nearly seven years  has made clear  both in its statement after its October policy meeting and Yellen s subsequent comments  that a rate hike is firmly on the table at the Dec  15 16 meeting 
 We ve indicated that conditions look like they could be right for an increase   Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans  who has argued against a rate hike  said in an interview with CNBC on Friday   The real side of the economy is looking a lot better  
A Reuters survey of banks that deal directly with the Fed showed 15 of the 17 so called primary dealers expect monetary policy tightening next month  That compared with only 12 dealers in September 
BROAD BASED GAINS
Economists had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing 180 000 last month and the unemployment rate remaining at 5 1 percent 
The report added to strong services sector and automobile sales data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy at the start of the fourth quarter  It bolstered views that growth will regain momentum this quarter after braking sharply to a 1 5 percent annual pace in the July September period 
In addition to the unexpectedly stronger job gains last month  data for August and September were revised to show 12 000 more jobs created than previously reported 
Last month s rise in wages  which have been almost stagnant despite a tightening labor market  lifted the year on year reading to 2 5 percent  That was the biggest increase since July 2009 and could give the Fed confidence that inflation will gradually move towards its 2 percent target 
Combining hours  payroll gains and wages  a measure of take home pay increased 0 6 percent in October  and was up 4 6 percent over the past 12 months 
   The economy has regained momentum just in time for the holiday shopping season   said Bob Hughes  senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research in Great Barrington  Massachusetts 
There were improvements in other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they contemplate a rate hike 
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell two tenths of a percentage point to 9 8 percent  the lowest level since May 2008 
The employment population ratio rose to 59 3 percent from 59 2 percent in September  But the labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  held at a near 38 year low of 62 4 percent 
Employment gains in October were broad based  though manufacturing added no jobs and mining shed 4 000 positions as oil and gas extraction payrolls fell 2 700 
Manufacturing has been hurt by a strong dollar  efforts by businesses to reduce bloated inventory and spending cuts by energy companies cutting back on well drilling and exploration in response to lower oil prices 
The mining sector has shed 109 000 jobs since peaking in December 2014  Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV  N SLB  last month announced further layoffs in addition to the 20 000 jobs it has already eliminated 
Construction payrolls  however  increased 31 000 last month  the biggest gain since February 
The services sector added 241 000 jobs in October  with large gains in retail  health and leisure  Professional and business services added 78 000 jobs  the largest gain since last November  Temporary help  a harbinger of future hiring  increased by 24 500 jobs  the biggest rise in nearly a year

36853,258368,SLB,U S  consumer spending slowing  but business investment poised to rise,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer spending barely rose in October as households took advantage of rising incomes to boost savings to their highest level in nearly three years  pointing to moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter  Anemic consumer spending will probably do little do change expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month as other data on Wednesday showed a surge in business spending plans in October and a drop in new applications for unemployment benefits last week   As far as fourth quarter GDP goes  that is likely to keep estimates close to 2 percent  That s enough to justify a rate hike as long as next Friday s employment report is not a disaster   said Chris Low  chief economist at FTN Financial in New York  The Commerce Department said consumer spending edged up 0 1 percent after a similar increase in September  That suggests consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  has slowed from the third quarter s brisk 3 0 percent annual pace   The tepid rise in consumer spending could combine with an anticipated drag from an ongoing inventory reduction to hold the economy to around a 2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter  But the economy  which expanded at a 2 1 percent rate in the third quarter  could get support from business spending   In a separate report  the Commerce Department said non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  increased 1 3 percent last month after rising 0 4 percent in September  Coming on the heels of data this month showing a solid increase in manufacturing output in October  it suggested the worst of the drag from a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms was over   Fed officials had held off raising rates at their last two meetings as they assessed the degree to which dollar strength and a slowing in economies overseas would weigh on the United States    The surge in core capital goods orders could be a crucial signal that this important sector of the economy may be at a turning point  further bolstering the Fed s confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief U S  economist at TD Securities in New York Manufacturing  which accounts for 12 percent of the economy  has been slammed by the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector  The dollar has appreciated 18 1 percent against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners since June 2014  The pace of appreciation  however  is gradually slowing  Economists also believe that the bulk of spending cuts by oil field firms like Schlumberger  N SLB  in response to lower crude prices have already been implemented   U S  Treasury debt prices pared gains after the reports  while the dollar hit an eight month high against a basket of currencies  WAGES RISING Economists speculate that rising rents are diverting money from discretionary spending  While consumer sentiment increased in November from October  households continued to fret over their financial prospects  another report showed  But as the labor market continues to tighten  there is optimism that wage growth will pick up and encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings and boost spending  A fourth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 12 000 to a seasonally adjusted 260 000 for the week ended Nov  21  Claims have now held below the 300 000 threshold for 38consecutive weeks  the longest stretch in years  and remain close to levels last seen in the early 1970s  Strengthening labor market conditions are gradually lifting income  The Commerce Department said personal income increased 0 4 percent last month  accelerating after a 0 2 percent gain in September  Wages and salaries shot up 0 6 percent  the largest increase since May   Savings increased to  761 9 billion last month  the highest level since December 2012  from  722 9 billion in September  Higher savings could over time buoy consumer spending   There was still no sign of inflation  which has persistently run below the Federal Reserve s 2 percent target   A price index for consumer spending rose 0 2 percent in the 12 months through October after a similar rise in September   Excluding food and energy  the personal consumption expenditures price index  increased 1 3 percent for the 10th straight month

36855,258370,SLB,Sturdy U S  employment report a green light for December rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment increased strongly in November in a show of the economy s resilience  which most likely paves the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month for the first time in nearly a decade 
Nonfarm payrolls rose 211 000 last month  the Labor Department said on Friday  September and October data was revised to show 35 000 more jobs than previously reported 
The unemployment rate held at a 7 1 2 year low of 5 percent  even as people returned to the labor force in a sign of confidence in the jobs market  The jobless rate is in a range many Fed officials see as consistent with full employment and has dropped seven tenths of a percentage point this year 
 The employment report should remove the final doubts about a rate hike at the December meeting  The clear message from the labor market to the Fed is   Just do it    said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Research in New York 
The closely watched employment report came a day after Fed Chair Janet Yellen struck an upbeat note on the economy when she testified before lawmakers  describing how it had largely met the criteria the U S  central bank has set for the Fed s first rate hike since June 2006 
Yellen said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
The Fed s policy setting committee will meet on Dec  15 16  Market based measures of Fed policy expectations assign a probability of 79 1 percent to the central bank s raising interest rates at that meeting  according to the CME Group s  O CME  FedWatch site 
U S  Treasury debt prices initially fell on the data  but later reversed losses on news OPEC was raising its output ceiling despite lower oil prices  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies and U S  stocks were trading higher

The second month of strong job gains should allay fears the economy has hit a soft patch  after reports showing tepid consumer spending in October and a slowdown in services industry growth in November  Manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years 
A strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies have taken some steam out of the economy  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit widened in October as exports hit a three year low 
 Payroll gains were despite continued weakness in manufacturing and energy sectors  suggesting little spillover into the rest of the economy   said Samuel Coffin  an economist at UBS in Stamford  Connecticut 
Though wage growth slowed last month  economists say that was mostly payback for October s outsized gains  which were driven by a calendar quirk  Anecdotal evidence  as well as data on labor related costs  suggest that tightening job market conditions are starting to put upward pressure on wages 
Average hourly earnings increased four cents  or 0 2 percent from 0 4 percent in October  That lowered the year on year reading to 2 3 percent from 2 5 percent in October  The average workweek  however  dipped to 34 5 hours from 34 6 
Other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they consider lifting the benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero were mixed 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  rose to 62 5 percent from a near 38 year low of 62 4 percent 
But a broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment rose one tenth of a percentage point to 9 9 percent  That reflected an increase in part time workers 
Employment gains in November were broad based  though manufacturing shed 1 000 positions  Factory employment has declined in three of the last four months 
Manufacturing has been crippled by a strong dollar  efforts by businesses to reduce bloated inventory and spending cuts by energy companies scaling back well drilling and exploration in response to sharply lower oil prices 
Mining purged 11 000 jobs  with oil and gas extraction losing 2 400 positions  Mining employment has dropped by 123 000 since reaching a peak in December 2014  Three quarters of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining 
Oilfield services provider Schlumberger  N SLB  this week announced another round of job cuts in addition to 20 000 layoffs already reported this year  The company said it expected the slowdown in drilling activity to continue in 2016 
Construction payrolls increased 46 000 last month  the largest gain since January 2014  Retail jobs rose 30 700 and transportation and warehousing employment rebounded after two straight months of declines 
Professional services added 27 000 jobs and government payrolls increased 14 000 last month

The dollar has gained almost 20 percent against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners over the last 18 months 
Plunging crude oil prices  which on Monday plumbed their lowest levels since 2004  have put pressure on oilfield services firms like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL   forcing them to slash capital spending budgets

36860,258375,SLB,U S  payrolls surge in December in boost to economic outlook,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged in December and employment for the prior two months was revised sharply higher  suggesting that a recent manufacturing led slowdown in economic growth would be temporary 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 292 000 last month  the Labor Department said on Friday  The unemployment rate held steady at a 7 1 2 year low of 5 percent even as more people entered the labour force  a sign of confidence in the job market 
Payrolls for October and November were revised to show 50 000 more jobs created than previously reported  adding to the report s upbeat tone  The only wrinkle was a one cent drop in average hourly earnings  but that was most likely because of calendar effects which should reverse in the January report 
The robust employment data should soothe fears about the economy s health and suggests the recent weakness in activity is mostly limited to the manufacturing and export oriented sectors  which have been hit by a strong dollar  DXY  and anaemic global demand  Efforts by businesses to whittle down an inventory glut and spending cuts by energy companies have also inflicted pain 
 It is one more sign the domestic economy continues to chug along   said Kate Warne  investment strategist at Edward Jones in St  Louis  Missouri   It is not a game changer in terms of faster economic growth  but it offsets some of the other indicators that recently have suggested the economy might be slowing down  
In the wake of soft reports on manufacturing  construction spending and export growth  economists this week slashed their fourth quarter growth estimates by as much a full percentage point to as low as a 0 4 percent annual rate  The economy grew at a 2 percent rate in the third quarter of last year 
Friday s jobs report offered a respite to global stock markets after heavy selling this week sparked by signs of slowing growth in China  U S  stock index futures added to gains and the dollar rallied after the data  while prices of U S  Treasuries pared losses  U S  short term interest rate futures fell 
Economists had expected payrolls to increase only 200 000 last month and the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 5 percent  The U S  economy added 2 65 million jobs in 2015  compared to 3 1 million in 2014 
FOCUS ON WAGE GROWTH
While labour market resilience would favour another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in March  economists say recent financial market turmoil and concerns among policymakers over low inflation suggest the U S  central bank may stay on the sidelines a bit longer 
The Fed last month raised overnight interest rates by a quarter percentage point to between 0 25 and 0 50 percent  the first increase in nearly a decade  and a subsequent move at its next meeting this month was already seen as off the table 
Wage growth will come under scrutiny this year  Despite the drop in average hourly earnings in December  the year on year gain in earnings was 2 5 percent in December compared to 2 3 percent in November  That was mostly because wages were unusually weak in December 2014 
Wage growth is expected to accelerate by the middle of the year as the labour market settles into full employment 
Also being watched closely this year is the labour force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  While the rate increased one tenth of a percentage point to 62 6 percent in December  it remains near four decade lows 
There are concerns that persistently low participation could hamper job growth as the supply pool of workers shrinks  unless a pick up in earnings entices more Americans to return to the labour force 
The employment to population ratio increased to 59 5 percent  the highest since May 2009  from 59 4 percent in November 
Employment gains in December were concentrated in the services sector  with mining shedding 8 000 jobs  Employment in the mining sector declined by 129 000 in 2015 and more losses are likely after the price of oil  CLc1  this week tumbled to an 11 year low 
Oilfield services provider Schlumberger  N SLB  last month announced another round of job cuts in addition to 20 000 layoffs already reported in 2015  The company said it expected the slowdown in drilling activity to continue this year 
Manufacturing added 8 000 jobs last month  Unusually warm weather boosted construction payrolls  which increased by 45 000  There were also gains in the leisure and hospitality sector 

Retail payrolls rose only 4 300 as mild temperatures hurt sales of winter apparel  Temporary help increased 34 400 last month and government payrolls rose 17 000  The average workweek was unchanged at 34 5 hours ",2016-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-payrolls-surge-in-december-in-boost-to-economic-outlook-379255,379255

36871,258386,SLB,Texas And Alaska Witness A Fall In Onshore Drilling Rigs,opinion,"In its weekly release  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHGE    a GE company  reported rig count decline in the United States 
About the Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  which is issued at the end of every week since 1944  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
A change in the Houston based oilfield services player s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by firms like Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week ended Jun 15 and fell from 1062 in the previous week  This decline was a first as the tally rose for 10 weeks in a row 
Despite rig count slipping to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  it has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 933     
For the week under review  the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore operations  The number of onshore rigs totaled 1035  down from 1039  However  the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week  higher than three for the week ended Jun 8  Also  the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 20  in line with the prior week s tally 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count was 863  up from 862 for the week ended Jun 8  Moreover  the current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly higher than last year s 747 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count of 194 is lower than 198 for the week ended Jun 8  Per the recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is 88  below the all time high of 1 606 in 2008 
However  like oil  the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year ago tally of 186 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 60 units  down from 61 units  Along with that  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations   fell by two units to 999 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count is at 19 units  of which 16 were oil directed  The count is in line with the tally for the week ended Jun 8 
Conclusion
The number of total rigs exploring in the United States declined due to the removal of four onshore rigs in Texas and two in Alaska 
West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude continues to hover around  65 a barrel psychological mark  Investors are waiting for the OPEC meetings on Jun 22  2018  when the major crude producers including Russia will decide on extension or relaxation of the earlier signed production curb deal  In other words  the outcome of the OPEC meetings is likely to provide new direction to oil price

On the news front  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   said it has committed to the Fram gas field in the North Sea  while Canada s Baytex Energy Corp    TO BTE   agreed to snap up rival Raging River Exploration Inc  for  2 3 billion  Meanwhile  Petrobras   NYSE PBR   lost a wage dispute potentially costing the company 4 5 billion in U S  dollars

The U S  oil benchmark rallied after OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output  At the Vienna meeting  top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela 
Friday s consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting  while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser   at around 700 000 barrels a day   due to several member countries  inability to boost exports 
Earlier in the week  oil futures were buoyed by the federal government s EIA report that showed a large draw in crude stockpiles due to strong refinery runs  Data showing a reduction in U S  oil drilling rig count brought further upside 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices moved southward last week as a larger than expected increase in supplies overshadowed the commodity s growing use for air conditioning

the company s intent to finance the deal by the issuance of new stocks that in turn are likely to hurt its earnings per share metrics Baytex s operations are mainly focused on Eagle Ford  Peace River and Lloydminster regions while Raging River s activities are mainly concentrated in East Duvernay  where it holds 260 000 acres of land   and Viking areas  Thus  the buyout expands the geographical footprint of Baytex  creating an enviable diverse portfolio of oil assets in five core areas namely Viking  Peace River  Lloydminster and East Duvernay Shale regions in Canada  and the Eagle Ford play

the company has faced in the Brazil s Labor Court  which is expected to cost the company around 17 billion reals or 4 5 billion in U S  dollars The case is mainly centered on the Minimum Remuneration Level Regime  RMNR  policy  adopted by Petrobras in 2007  The employees argue that the payments related to special working conditions such as night shifts and hazardous working environment should not be included in the base wage calculation  which will thus lead Petrobras to make additional payment to comply with RMNR  In contrast  the company is of the opinion that such payments should be included in the base wage calculations itself The ruling in favor of the workers is likely to result in wage increase of around 35  for 59 000 employees  Petrobras intends to appeal the decision in

previous ruling from the lower court reduced the damage compensation by  93 4 million  The said Schlumberger technology is used for finding oil and gas under the ocean floor  The significance of the

36874,258389,SLB,Sector ETF Week In Review For August 13 17,opinion,"Summary

The performance tables are skewing more and more conservative 
Energy has underperformed 
With the right fundamental catalyst  energy could outperform in the coming weeks months 

As always  let s start with the weekly performance tables 
 
This is a very defensive table  staples  utilities  and healthcare led the pack  Industrial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLI  bounced back a bit  news that a resolution to the trade spat might be happening helped to boost the sector  Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK    which had led the market for most of the last year or so   barely rose  Energy sold off with the oil market  Remember this occurred in the context of the broader market rally this week approaching 52 week highs 
 
The 1 month table has the same pattern  it is led by healthcare  utilities  and staples  The Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  ETF is the fifth best performing sector  This only occurred because the sector had a great second quarter earnings season  With the yield curve flattening  that won t last  And energy is again at the bottom 
 
And finally  we have the three month chart  Notice a pattern  Defensive sectors are once again the top three performers  Because this has occurred in three different time frames  we can now say that the market is taking a very defensive posture  This is a typical  late cycle pattern  so it shouldn t be surprising 
But we can conclude two things from this development  First  traders think we re late in the market cycle and are trading accordingly  Second  it will be harder for the market overall to make new highs  Combined  these three sectors account for a little under 25  of the SPY  NYSE SPY  sector composition  Compare that to the technology s weighting  which alone is 26  
Let s place this information into context by looking at the sector rotation graph 
 
Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  and Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV  are leading the SPY  Staples are improving  Despite a great retail sales report this week  Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY  is weakening  as is tech and energy  Industrials and basic materials are lagging thanks to trade war issues  Financials are down as well 
It s here that I look in more detail at a specific sector  This week  I want to put a spotlight on the energy market for the following reasons 
1   It s underperforming in multiple time frames  It was the laggard in the weekly  monthly  and three month time frames  That means there could be some undervalued or overlooked issues in the sector 
2   Iran sanctions started at the beginning of August  And that could lead to issues with oil prices 

 August is never calm   said Michael Cohen  Barclays head of energy commodities research   Summer in the Middle East  you just never know what could happen  
Iran s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said the country would implement countermeasures if the U S  attempts to block Iranian oil exports  That followed a weekend war of words between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani  who started the back and forth by cautioning the U S  about pursuing hostile policies against Tehran 

3   Gas prices in the US are creeping higher 
 
At the national level  prices are about  2 75  Once they hit  3 gallon  we can expect negative news stories to hit  But these will be positive for the energy sector 
So  let s start by looking at the energy ETF 
 
Prices dropped to the 200 day EMA this week on heavy volume  Momentum dropped a bit  This development breaks their overall trend of trading between the lower and upper 70s  where they had been trading since late May  The key issue now is what happens with this ETF s price over the next few weeks  The 200 day EMA is a great place to hold technically  it s not uncommon for prices to hold this technical level for days  weeks  or even months  This is definitely something to keep an eye on 
Let s look at the yearly chart of XLE  NYSE XLE  ten largest members 
 
This collection of charts is not what I was expecting when I decided to focus on this sector  I was expecting a group of charts that were at least in the lower half of their 52 week trading ranges  However  we actually have a very good collection of charts  Seven are at near their 52 week highs  With the right impetus  such as a spike in oil prices   they could easily move to new 52 week highs  which should garner news focus  Only one stock  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   second row  second from right  is near a 52 week low  Exxon  NYSE XOM   bottom row  right side  is also in the lower half of its 52 week range  But those are the only two stocks with a decidedly bearish orientation 
The bottom line  Put some of these companies on your radar screen and wait for a fundamental catalyst 
Disclosure I we have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours

36875,258390,SLB,Market Votes For Clarity ,opinion,"Stocks moved higher in the run up to the midterm elections on Tuesday  The big question now is  Will tonight s results impact the market 
	The most widely expected outcome is that the Democrats take control of the House while the Republicans retain the Senate  If that indeed happens  then this week s most important event will likely be the Fed meeting  Of course  who really trusts polls after 2016 and Brexit 
	The biggest market reaction would probably be if the Dems have a better night than expected and take both sides of Congress  Longer term though  whether one party controls the Legislature or its split  the market should be fine  Ultimately  its much more interested in rising rates and trade than red or blue 
	It was a low volume session on Tuesday  but was still positive  Unlike yesterday  all three indices moved upward  They each threatened late to give back all of their gains  but eventually rallied into the close  The Dow was up 0 68  to 25 635 01 and the S P rose 0 63  to 2755 45 
	The NASDAQ failed to join its counterparts in the green on Monday as FANGs had a rough session  On Tuesday  those tech giants had a much better day with only Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX    1 46   failing to rise  The index managed to advance 0 64  to 7375 96 
	Regardless of whether or not the elections have a direct impact on the market tomorrow  it will be good to get one uncertainty out of the way  The trade issues and fear of rising rates are likely to be with us for much longer 
	The most important thing is that when the opening bell rings on Wednesday morning  we ll still have a strong economy and a market that has  hopefully  just emerged from a sharp correction Today s Portfolio Highlights  Counterstrike  Crude oil has slipped below  62 from  77 in the past month  but Jeremy has a feeling that a bounce back is coming  Actually  he has a very technical Fibonacci setup that is suggesting such a rebound  The editor wants to get some exposure today before it begins  Therefore  he added a small   starter  position in VelocityShares 3X Long Crude Oil ETN  UWT  with a 5  allocation  Read the full write up for more Stocks Under  10  Coming off such a sharp correction  it s not a bad idea to take a profit when you can  That s what Brian Bolan was thinking when he sold Energy Fuels  UUUU  on Tuesday  You may remember that this company was one of the top performers yesterday due to a big spike in volume  The editor took the chance to  sell into strength  and secure a nearly 12  return in just a little over a month  The portfolio still has exposure to basic materials through HighPoint Resources  HPR  and Halcon Resources  HK   so its covered if the sector jumps higher 
	The portfolio immediately replaced the position by adding Energous Corp   WATT   The company develops wire free charging technology and was once a real high flyer  but it has since come way back to earth  However  it recently reported a positive surprise of more than 7 5  for its third beat in the past four quarters  Brian likes the idea of this company as a disruptive technology  and believes it will be on the road to recovery if we have truly seen the end of this correction  Read the full write up for more on today s moves Surprise Trader  Dave sees a good report coming up for National Vision Holdings  EYE   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company in the optical retail business  Last time  EYE reported a positive surprise of more than 10 5   and today it has a nice Earnings ESP of 6 12  for the quarter coming before the bell next Tuesday  November 13  Furthermore  rising earnings estimates for next quarter has the editor thinking that the upcoming report could also include a bullish guidance  He added the stock on Tuesday with a 12 5  allocation  Read the full write up for more on all of today s moves TAZR Trader  The market bounced at just the right time for the portfolio s ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3X Bull ETF  TQQQ  position  which Kevin added on October 30 just as stocks were climbing out of the correction  But now the editor is seeing some resistance in SPX getting past 2750  Instead of waiting around to see if it has the energy to break through  Kevin decided to get out now and sell TQQQ for a 12  return 
	Speaking of breaking through  you ve probably heard that today is the midterm elections  The market would be totally fine if the power in Congress is split between the parties  but Kevin thinks this outcome could still bring an  exhale and sell  reaction this week  Therefore  he also sold Russell 2000 Small Cap 3X Bull ETF  TNA  on Tuesday for an 11 7  return and Direxion S P 3X Bull ETF  SPXL  for 2 3  Large Cap Trader  In what John calls  a no brainer swap   the portfolio sold the underperforming Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   NVO  and replaced it by adding Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   One look explains why this swap was such an easy decision  BMY is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with solid Zacks Style Scores across the board  It is also a rebound candidate that slipped to around  50 in the selloff and could be poised to bounce back to its 2018 high of  68 or more moving forward  BMY also has an attractive valuation with an annual dividend of 3 16   ALL of this is an improvement on NVO  Plus  this position stays in the defensive space of large cap pharma  Read the complete commentary for a lot more

The U S  crude benchmark entered bear market territory   a decline of 20  below a recent high 
The U S  crude benchmark tumbled to an eight month low on Friday  reflecting rising supply from major producers and fear that an economic slowdown will dampen the outlook for demand  U S  waivers on Iranian sanctions and data showing drillers in the United States adding oil rigs also contributed to the losses  while the dollar strength played spoilsport by making the greenback priced crude dearer for investors holding foreign currency

Eagle Ford assets Devon continues to advance on its  4 billion share repurchase plan  The company has repurchased 67 million shares  or nearly 13  of outstanding shares  at a total cost of approximately  2 7 billion  By the first quarter of 2019  it expects to exhaust the share repurchase authorization Currently  Devon s divestiture program has reached  4 7 billion and it expects to achieve the  5 billion divestiture target around year end  Year to date  the company retired  828 million long term debt  which will lower its annual interest expenses by  66 million and is likely to

35 cents  The weaker than expected results can be attributed to lower oil and gas production and higher spending However  the bottom line was significantly higher than the year earlier quarter s

a year ago During the three months ended Sep 30  2018  Petrobras  capital investments and expenditures totaled R 13 9 billion  47 8  higher than the R 9 4 billion incurred in the year ago period  The

36878,258393,SLB,Stocks Not In A Bouncy Mood Yet ,opinion,"We were all hoping for a good sized rebound after yesterday s sharp selloff  but it never materialized as morning gains gave way to more losses for two of the major indices 
	The beleaguered NASDAQ outperformed its counterparts with a breakeven session  Technically  it was up by 0 01 of a point  or 0   That kind of  gain  is usually not worth mentioning  but this index needs all the good news it can get these days since tech hit the wall 
	Speaking of  hitting the wall   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  was down another 1  on Tuesday  adding to yesterday s 5  plunge on news of a supplier cutting its outlook  However  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  managed meager gains in the session

36904,258419,SLB,U S  labor market shows some muscle despite slower job growth,news,By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth slowed in August  but the unemployment rate dropped to a near 7 1 2 year low and wages accelerated  keeping alive prospects of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike later this month   Nonfarm payrolls increased 173 000 last month after an upwardly revised gain of 245 000 in July  the Labor Department said on Friday  August s gain was the smallest in five months as the factory sector lost the most jobs since July 2013  The jobs count  however  may have been tarnished by a statistical fluke that has often led to sharp upward revisions to payroll figures for August after initial weak readings  Indicating the hiring slowdown was likely not reflective of the economy s true health  the jobless rate fell two tenths of a point to 5 1 percent  its lowest level since April 2008  In addition  payrolls data for June and July were revised to show 44 000 more jobs created than previously reported  bringing the average job gains for the past three months to a solid 221 000  Average hourly earnings increased 8 cents  the biggest rise in seven months and the length of the average workweek also expanded   The payrolls data is certainly good enough to allow for a Fed rate hike in September   said Alan Ruskin  global head of currency strategy at  Deutsche Bank   XETRA DBKGn  in New York   The big question is still whether financial market volatility will scupper the plans   Stocks on Wall Street  which could be pressured by higher rates  ended down more than 1 percent  Prices for U S  government debt rose  while the dollar fell marginally against a basket of currencies  While the mixed report did little to alter views that the U S  economy remains vibrant despite volatile global financial markets and slowing Chinese growth  it could further complicate the Fed s decision at a policy meeting on Sept  16 17  In the wake of a recent global equities sell off  financial markets significantly scaled back bets on a September rate hike over the past month  But Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC last week it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout had made an increase less compelling   With this jobs report     the Federal Reserve finds itself in a real uncertainty jam   said Mohamed El Erian  chief economic adviser at Allianz  XETRA ALVG  in Newport Beach  California  MISSING FORECASTS Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 220 000 last month  but they had also warned that the model used to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations is often thrown off at the start of a new school year  They said the data could be further muddied because of a typically low response rate from employers to the government s payroll surveys in August  But the evidence of a tightening labor market added to a string of upbeat data  including figures on automobile sales and housing  that has suggested the economy was moving ahead with strong momentum after growing at a robust 3 7 percent annual rate in the second quarter  The decline in the unemployment rate brought it into the range that most Fed officials think is consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation  and would likely bolster their expectation that a pick up in wages will help lift inflation toward their 2 percent target  A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 10 3 percent  the lowest level since June 2008  In August  construction payrolls rose 3 000 on top of the 7 000 jobs added in July  Mining and logging employment fell by 10 000 jobs  the eighth straight monthly decline   The sector has shed 90 000 jobs so far this year  with industries that support mining activity accounting for 80 percent of the drop  Oilfield giants Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced thousands of job cuts this year  Manufacturing payrolls slid 17 000 as sharp declines at metals  machinery and food industries offset a solid increase in employment in the automobile sector  The 0 3 percent increase in hourly earnings left them 2 2 percent above their year ago level  still well below the 3 5 percent growth rate economists consider healthy   Aggregate weekly hours rose 0 4 percent  the largest gain since November  The combination of more hours and higher earnings left workers with a 0 7 percent increase in their take home wages   Some analysts think average hourly earnings are being held back by falling wages in oil field services  But a tighter labor market and decisions by several state and local governments to raise the minimum wage should eventually translate into faster earnings growth  A number of retailers  including Walmart  N WMT    Target   N TGT  and TJX Cos  N TJX   have increased pay for hourly workers since the start of the year   Regardless of which meeting this year the Fed begins to raise rates  next year we expect core inflation to surprise on the upside  forcing the Fed into tightening policy more aggressively than the markets currently anticipate   said Paul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto

36907,258422,SLB,U S  consumer sentiment rebounds  industrial output weak,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer sentiment rebounded strongly in early October  suggesting that the economic recovery remained on track despite headwinds from a strong dollar and weak global demand that have weighed on the industrial sector  particularly manufacturing 
The snapback in sentiment reported on Friday underscored robust domestic demand and offered hope that consumer spending would remain solid enough to support economic growth  which has slowed significantly in recent months 
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 92 1 in early October from a reading of 87 2 September  The survey s current conditions sub index shot up to 106 7 this month from 101 2 in September 
The index at current levels has historically been consistent with roughly a 4 percent annualized rate of consumer spending growth  according to economists 
 This suggests that U S  household sentiment has turned an important corner  and is a hopeful sign on the outlook for consumer spending activity going forward  given signs of weakness in other parts of the economy   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York 
The rise in sentiment  which likely reflected cheaper gasoline prices  suggested limited impact from recent stock market volatility  Consumers were the most optimistic about their personal financial expectations since 2007 
Their views toward purchases of long lasting manufactured goods were equally bullish 
Consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity and has been the bright spot in the economy as the industrial sector wobbles under the onslaught of slowing global growth and the resurgent dollar  which have eroded demand for U S  manufactured goods 
It is also being weighed down by lower energy oil prices that have undercut capital investment in the energy sector  as well as an effort by businesses to whittle down their inventories 
U S  stocks were trading higher on Friday  while prices were U S  Treasuries were mostly weaker  The U S  dollar rose against a basket of currencies 
WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
In a separate report  the Federal Reserve said industrial output slipped 0 2 percent on renewed weakness in oil and gas drilling after dipping 0 1 percent in August  Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1 8 percent in the third quarter 
 We do not expect the recent slowing to lead to a broader pullback in aggregate growth  as service sector activity remains solid   said Jesse Hurwitz  an economist at  Barclays   L BARC  in New York 
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the U S  economy  Still  the weak industrial production report added to soft trade  retail sales and employment data that have pointed to a significant slowdown in growth after the economy expanded at a 3 9 percent annual pace in the second quarter 
Third quarter growth estimates are currently around a 1 5 percent rate  Slower growth and low inflation have diminished expectations of an interest rate hike from the Fed this year 
Manufacturing output fell 0 1 percent in September even though robust demand for automobiles lifted motor vehicle and parts production by 0 2 percent  Manufacturing output dropped by 0 4 percent in August  For the third quarter  manufacturing output increased at a rate of 2 5 percent 
There were declines in the production of computer and electronic products  as well as electronic equipment  appliances and components  Primary metals and machinery output increased 
Mining production fell 2 0 percent as oil and gas well drilling tumbled 4 0 percent after increasing for two straight months  An almost 60 percent plunge in oil prices since June 2014 has hurt the profits of oil field companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL    leading to deep cuts in their capital spending budgets 
Utilities production increased 1 3 percent in September  With output declining  industrial capacity use fell to 77 5 percent from 77 8 percent in August  Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much  slack  remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary 

The lackluster industrial production picture was reflected in a swathe of manufacturers  results on Friday  with  General Electric  Co  N GE  and Honeywell International Inc  N HON  reporting dips in revenue along with profits that were better than forecast ",2015-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-consumer-sentiment-rebounds;-industrial-output-weak-366530,366530

36912,258427,SLB,U S  factory orders fall  inventory liquidation under way,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for U S  factory goods fell for a second straight month in September as the manufacturing sector continues to struggle under the weight of a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies 
Motor vehicle production  however  remains a bright spot as orders surged in September  That trend is likely to persist as automakers reported on Tuesday that sales in October were the best in 14 years 
 This morning s report provides little new signal on the state of U S  manufacturing  Demand for many categories of manufactured goods continues to struggle from the effect of a stronger dollar  weak foreign demand and lower energy prices   said Jesse Hurwitz  an economist at  Barclays   L BARC  in New York 
The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods declined 1 0 percent after a downwardly revised 2 1 percent drop in August  Factory orders were previously reported to have declined 1 7 percent in August 
Orders for automobiles and parts rose 1 5 percent in September after falling 2 0 percent in August 
Auto sales jumped 13 6 percent in October from a year ago to an annual rate of 18 24 million units  the highest October level since 2001  according to Autodata Corp  Sales rose to a 18 17 million unit rate in September 
October s increase suggested that consumer spending remained robust after two straight quarters of strong increases and bolsters expectations of a December interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve 
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street rose  U S  government debt prices fell 
Factory activity  which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy  is also being constrained by efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang and tepid global demand  But the worst could be over for the sector after a report on Monday showed new orders rose in October for the first time since July 
The dollar has gained 16 8 percent against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners since June 2014  which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinational corporations like Procter   Gamble Co   N PG  and 3M Co   N MMM  
At the same time  a plunge in oil prices has pressured revenues for oil field companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and diversified manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  
INVENTORIES BEING LIQUIDATED
The factory orders report also showed a 0 4 percent drop in manufacturing inventories  which was bigger than the government had assumed for its advance third quarter gross domestic product estimate published last week 
Economists said the factory inventory drop suggested the third quarter GDP estimate could be lowered by at least one tenth of a percentage point to a 1 4 percent annual pace when the government publishes its first revision later this month 
A slow pace of inventory accumulation accounted for the bulk of the sharp step down in growth from the second quarter s brisk 3 9 percent rate 
Still  the September drop in factory inventories is an encouraging sign for the sector as it suggests orders will rise in the months ahead  The inventories to shipments ratio was unchanged at a still lofty 1 35 in September 
 A steady pace of liquidation will eventually boost output as orders move closer to sales and input utilization levels   said Kevin Cummins  N CMI   senior economist at RBS  L RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut 
Manufacturers reported on Monday a decrease in the share of customers who believed inventories were too high  and a fall in the stock of unsold goods at factories in October 
The Commerce Department also reported that September orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft   seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans   slipped 0 1 percent instead of the 0 3 percent drop initially reported last month 

This also supports the view that the worst of the manufacturing slump might be over  Shipments of these so called core capital goods  which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report  increased 0 5 percent in September as reported last month ",2015-11-03,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-factory-orders-fall,-inventory-liquidation-under-way-369484",369484

36923,258438,SLB,Oil Rig Count Continues To Tick Up In Permian Basin,opinion,"In its weekly release  Baker Hughes reported an increase in rig count in the United States 
Rig Count Details
Baker Hughes  data  issued at the end of every week since 1944  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
Change in this Houston based oilfield services player s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week  ended May 25  compared with the prior week s 1046  Notably  total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks 
Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  rig count has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 908   
For the week in discussion  the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations  The number of onshore rigs totaled 1036  higher than 1023  Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week  in line with the count for the week ended May 18  The tally for offshore rigs was 19  also in line 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count was 859  up from 844 for the week ended May 18  Notably  for the first time since the week through Feb 9  the market witnessed such a jump in weekly rig count 
Moreover  the current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly higher than last year s 722  The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks    
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count of 198 is lower than 200 for the week ended May 18  However  like oil  the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year ago tally of 185 
Per the recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is 88   below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units increased from 61 units  Moreover  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  rose by eight units to 993 units     
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count is at 18 units   15 rigs were oil directed   same as the tally for the week ended May 18 
Conclusion
The number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased  courtesy of the addition of 10 oil rigs in the Permian Basin  With this  rigs exploring oil in the region increased for four weeks in a row  It seems that drillers have been gathering in Permian despite the basin suffering from midstream infrastructure bottleneck 
The    Saudi Arabia and Russia    were in talks to boost daily oil production by roughly 1 million barrels  per media reports  This created a panic in the energy market  leading crude prices to fall below  70 a barrel through the week ended May 25 
However  the oil drilling market scenario is still favorable in U S  shale plays  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corp    NYSE APC   and Comstock Resources  Inc    NYSE CRK    Anadarko Petroleum sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Comstock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
We expect Anadarko Petroleum to witness year over year earnings growth of 229 6  in 2018 
Comstock will likely see year over year earnings growth of 90 8  in 2018

36926,258441,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Exxon  Shell  Petrobras   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April  However  natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important  3 level 
On the news front  energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM   outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  announced early production start up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico  Meanwhile  Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil s Petrobras   NYSE PBR   
Overall  it was another mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures lost about 3 1  to close at  65 81 per barrel  natural gas prices edged up some 0 8  to  2 962 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  oil benchmark slumped for the second week on fears of supply increase  bearish EIA inventory numbers  and soaring rig count 
Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela 
The commodity was also spooked by the federal government s EIA report that revealed increases in refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that U S  output edged up 44 000 barrels per day last week to 10 77 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 
Data showing the number of U S  oil rigs climbing   this time by 2 following a large increase of 15 last week   brought further downside 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices moved northward last week  Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller than expected increase in natural gas supplies  the commodity got a leg up from rising power sector demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     In its annual meeting  ExxonMobil Corporation announced its intention to increase earnings by more than two fold by 2025 and address the risks of climate change ExxonMobil s plan will be especially aided by lower cost of supply investments in U S  tight oil  deepwater and liquefied natural gas  LNG   This will be backed by a group of industry

where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April  However  natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important  3 level On the news front  energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell plc announced early production start up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico  Meanwhile  Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil s Petrobras Overall  it was another mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures

36956,258471,SLB,Consumer spending bolsters U S  second quarter growth,news,By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  economic growth accelerated in the second quarter as solid consumer spending offset the drag from weak business spending on equipment  suggesting a steady momentum that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to hiking interest rates this year  Gross domestic product expanded at a 2 3 percent annual rate  the Commerce Department said on Thursday  First quarter GDP  previously reported to have shrunk at a 0 2 percent pace  was revised up to show it rising at a 0 6 percent rate   This was a very constructive report and given the supportive domestic economic backdrop  we expect this positive momentum in activity to be sustained in the coming months  providing the Fed with the necessary justification to raise rates this year   perhaps as early as September   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York   The revision to first quarter growth reflected steps taken by the government to refine the seasonal adjustment for some components of GDP  which economists said left residual seasonality in the data  as well as new source data   The report also showed a pick up in inflation during the quarter  which economists say keeps the Fed on track for its first interest rate hike since 2006  The U S  central bank on Wednesday described the economy as expanding  moderately  while upgrading its view of the labor market and saying housing had shown  additional  improvement   A separate report from the Labor Department showed first time applications for unemployment benefits increased 12 000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 267 000  However  claims remained near their cycle lows  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasury debt were mixed  Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower  The economy grew 1 5 percent in the first half compared to 1 9 percent during the same period in 2014  Though second quarter GDP growth was a bit below economists  expectations for a 2 6 percent rate  the growth composition pointed to firming domestic fundamentals   A measure of private domestic demand  which excludes trade  inventories and government expenditures  increased at a solid 2 5 percent rate after rising at a 2 0 percent pace at the start of the year   Growth in the second quarter was boosted by consumer spending as households used some of the windfall from cheaper gasoline in late 2014 and early this year to go shopping  The strengthening labor market also encouraged consumers to loosen their purse strings  Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  grew at a 2 9 percent rate from a 1 8 percent pace in the first quarter  The saving rate fell to 4 8 percent from 5 2 percent  ENERGY DRAG PERSISTS The economy also got a lift from housing  exports  and state and local government spending  However  the energy sector continued to weigh on growth as it struggles with the lingering effects of deep spending cuts by oil field companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year  Business investment on equipment fell at a 4 1 percent rate  Spending on mining exploration  wells and shafts plunged at a 68 2 percent rate  the largest decline since the second quarter of 1986  This category dropped at a 44 5 percent pace in the first quarter  But there are signs that the energy spending rout might be nearing an end   Data last Friday showed U S  energy firms added 21 oil rigs last week  marking the third increase over the past 33 weeks  Schlumberger said last week it believed the North American rig count may be bottoming and that a slow rise in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year  Exports rebounded in the second quarter  despite a strong dollar  while imports rose moderately  That left a smaller trade deficit that added 0 13 percentage point to GDP growth   While businesses accumulated  110 0 billion worth of merchandise  down from  112 8 billion in the first quarter  inventories are still high and could hurt growth in the third quarter  The sturdy pace of consumer spending and a rise in oil prices pushed up inflation in the second quarter   The personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index rose at a 2 2 percent rate  the fastest since early 2012  after falling at a 1 9 percent rate in the first quarter  Excluding food and energy  prices increased at a 1 8 percent pace   The stronger recent core PCE number probably makes this report a little bit hawkish for Fed considerations   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York ,2015-07-30,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-second-quarter-gdp-seen-rebounding-on-consumer-spending,-housing-353582",353582

36961,258476,SLB,U S  second quarter GDP growth revised sharply higher to 3 7 percent,news,By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter on solid domestic demand  showing fairly strong momentum that could still allow the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates this year  Gross domestic product expanded at a 3 7 percent annual pace instead of the 2 3 percent rate reported last month  the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its second GDP estimate for the April June period   The GDP report  which was released in the wake of a global stock market sell off  should assure investors and cautious Fed officials that the United States is in good shape to weather the growing strains in the world economy   The U S  economy entered the current market turbulence with momentum  which will help it to shrug off the drag from China and other developing economies   said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago  Concerns over slowing economic growth in China sent global equity markets into a tailspin last week  raising doubts that the U S  central bank would raise its short term interest rate next month  Markets have since recouped some of the huge losses  On Wednesday  New York Fed President William Dudley said that prospects of a September lift off in the central bank s key lending rate  seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago    U S  stocks rose sharply on the GDP data  a day after posting their biggest one day gain in four years  Prices for U S  government debt fell  while the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies   The Fed could certainly hold off until later this year  citing the recent market turmoil  but the economic fundamentals would also justify a small September rate increase   said Stuart Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services in Pittsburgh  The upward revisions to second quarter GDP growth also reflected the accumulation of  121 1 billion worth of inventories   11 1 billion more than previously estimated  That meant inventories contributed 0 22 percentage point to GDP instead of subtracting 0 08 percentage point as reported last month  While the huge inventory build will likely weigh on growth in the third quarter  the blow could be softened by rebounding business investment in capital goods   Economists had expected that second quarter GDP growth would be revised to a 3 2 percent rate  The economy grew at a 0 6 percent rate in the first quarter  Output expanded 2 2 percent in the first half of the year compared to growth of 1 9 percent during the same period in 2014   STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND Underscoring the solid economic fundamentals  a measure of private domestic demand that excludes trade  inventories and government expenditures rose at a 3 3 percent rate in the second quarter  instead of the previously reported 2 5 percent pace  Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  grew at a 3 1 percent rate  rather than the 2 9 percent pace reported last month  Consumer spending got off a to brisk start in the third quarter  with retail sales rising solidly in July  A strong labor market  cheaper gasoline and relatively higher house prices are boosting household wealth  helping to support consumer spending   The employment picture was further brightened on Thursday by a separate report from the Labor Department showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6 000 to a seasonally adjusted 271 000 for the week ended Aug  22  It was the 25th straight week that claims remained below the 300 000 threshold  which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market  Economists also said they expected the recent stock market rout to have only a limited impact on the economy   As long as this is a garden variety correction  the impact on the U S  economy should be modest   said Ryan Sweet  a senior economist at Moody s Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania   The Commerce Department said investment in nonresidential structures was revised to show an increase rather than a contraction  reflecting stronger spending on commercial and healthcare construction   Spending on residential construction  which includes brokers  commissions  was raised  More gains are likely this quarter after a third report on Thursday showed an increase in contracts to purchase previously owned homes in July   In the second quarter  business spending on equipment was not as weak as initially thought  The energy sector continued to weigh on growth as it struggles with the lingering effects of deep spending cuts by oil field companies like Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  in the aftermath of a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices in the past year   Spending on mining exploration  wells and shafts plunged at a 68 3 percent rate in the second quarter  the largest decline since the second quarter of 1986  The trade deficit was smaller than previously reported  adding 0 23 percentage point to GDP growth   The GDP report also showed a rebound in after tax corporate profits  but a strong dollar and lower oil prices remain a constraint

36972,258487,SLB,Halliburton s  HAL  Earnings Streak Comes To A Halt In Q1,opinion,"Oilfield services behemoth Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   reported in line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays 
The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger s   NYSE SLB   income from continuing operations  adjusted for Venezuela write downs  came in at 41 cents per share  same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  revenues of  5 740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 760 million 
However  Halliburton joined fellow oil services majors Schlumberger and Baker Hughes  a GE Company   NYSE BHGE    in affirming increased activity in U S  shale  driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment Halliburton Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Segmental Performance
Operating income from the Completion and Production segment was  500 million  significantly higher than the year ago level of  147 million  The division s performance was helped by continued growth in the North American land drilling business  Further  Halliburton experienced a bump in the Europe Africa CIS completion services  while stimulation activity in the Middle East were higher as well 
However  the segment operating income could not match our consensus estimate of  534 million  The shortfall could be attributed to cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing  Rising prices of sand   used to hydraulically fracture new wells   increased the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and put upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton 
As it is  Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut downs disrupted deliveries 
Meanwhile  Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from  122 million in the first quarter of 2017 to  188 million this year  The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and North America 
But the segment income was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  180 million  Results were hampered by lower activity   primarily across various product lines   in Latin America  especially Venezuela 
Balance Sheet
Halliburton s capital expenditure in the first quarter was  501 million  As of Mar 31  2018  the company had approximately  2 332 million in cash cash equivalents and  10 428 million in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 55 4  
Zacks Rank   Stock Picks
Halliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months 
Meanwhile  one can look at a better ranked oilfield service player like Flotek Industries  Inc    NYSE FTK    Flotek Industries is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock

Flotek Industries provides a range of products and services to enhance returns for the oil and gas finders  The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston  TX based company is 32 cents  representing some 557 1  earnings per share growth over 2017  Next year s average forecast is  52 cents  pointing to another 62 5  growth

36974,258489,SLB,Big Oil Bets Big On Big Data To Increase Revenue And Cut Costs,opinion,"President Trump is not the only one using the words  mission accomplished   On April 13  the International Energy Agency  IEA  said that OPEC could use those words in its battle to reduce the global glut of oil that had been a problem since 2015    The IEA said oil stockpiles had dropped dramatically over the past year and could dip below five year average levels in the coming months  Lowering inventories to that level was a main target for OPEC and Russia when the two countries began to curb output in 2017 to balance an oversupplied market and bolster oil prices    Falling inventory levels and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East combined to push oil to its biggest weekly advance  in the week ended April 13  in eight months   up nearly 8    and it is still trading at the highest level since late 2014 
But that isn t the big news in the oil industry  Instead  the real news is the effect that Big Data is having on transforming the entire oil industry    Big Data  Big Results   The oil industry is finally starting to adopt the latest innovations in information technology  And it certainly needed to change  In late 2014  MIT Sloane Management Review and Deloitte scored the oil and gas sector s  digital maturity  at only a 4 68 out of 10    Techniques such as advanced data analytics   used by tech titans like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and others to disrupt any number of consumer related businesses  are now being applied to the energy industry  The end result should be similarly dramatic 
The opportunities being opened up by adoption of these techniques include analysis of rocks to target oil well placement more precisely in oil bearing areas  oil reservoir models and seismic analysis to allow production to be maximized through the lifetime of an oil field  and automation along with predictive maintenance that can make oil field operations more efficient and cheaper while also enhancing worker safety      There is the hardware side of this technological innovation too  For example  the Chevron  NYSE CVX  Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan  that will start production in 2022  will have about one million sensors collecting data  The cost of these types of sensors is falling while their sophistication is rising allowing for more and more data to be collected in all aspects of an oil field operation    But the real difference today is the rise of cloud computing  This makes it possible to store and analyze data at a relatively low cost  That is important to an industry that generates huge volumes of data   think temperature and pressure readings and video footage as well   And the amount of data is rising almost exponentially  Bill Brain  CIO at Chevron  told the Financial Times the volume of data the company handles has been doubling every 12 to 18 months    But the problem up to now has been that oil companies have done very little deep analyses of the all the data they have  Most of it went unused  But now with cloud computing  the data can be collected and correlated in one central location    The IEA estimates that oil production costs will be cut 10  to 20  by the adoption of digital technologies  although I believe the cost savings will be even greater  For instance  BP  LON BP  worked with a Silicon Valley start up on an optimization model that was able to raise output in its 180 well pilot project by 20     Either way  the likely result of all this innovation in the oil industry will be even more oil being produced cheaply  Currently  companies are recovering only about 8  to 10  of the oil in place in many U S  shale wells  So if adoption of new technologies could raise that rate by even a few percentage points  the results would be dramatic  The end result would be even more downside pressure on the oil price than caused by the advent of the shale revolution here in the U S    While this may not be good news for oil price bulls  the adoption of new technologies by the oil industry is great news for the companies that provide the technology   the oil service companies    Oil Technology Investments   The number one company here is the world s largest oil field services firm  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   which was founded in 1926  A sign of the change in its business since then is the fact that today it has a software technology innovation center that sits at the heart of Silicon Valley    In 2017  Schlumberger launched a new software system called Delfi  which makes it possible to bring together and coordinate the way oil wells are designed  drilled and brought onstream into production  This allows Schlumberger s clients to maximize output from an entire oilfield  The company also has worked with NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  in adapting its technology for viewing and analyzing seismic data 
The company s hope is that  by the end of 2018  oil companies around the world will be using its new technologies  on a regular basis   Schlumberger s executive vice president for technology  Ashok Belani  said to the Financial Times that adoption of this technology will cut production costs by 40  in U S  shale fields within the next decade    The next company is Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   which is the world s number two oil field services provider  Like Schlumberger  it is also working with Nvidia on adapting technology for viewing and analyzing seismic data    Last August  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  announced a major partnership with Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  to  transform the oil industry in radical ways   The goal is to digitize the entire upstream oil industry and improve exploration results through the application of deep learning and augmented reality to reserve estimates  modeling and simulations    The two firms are collaborating in areas including machine learning  augmented reality and user interactions  Halliburton will use Microsoft s HoloLens  Surface  Azure and its Internet of Things solutions    Finally  there is Baker Hughes A Ge Company LLC  NYSE BHGE   which is currently 62 5  owned by General Electric  NYSE GE   I expect GE to spin this off in the not too distant future    The company also has a partnership  announced in 2017  with Nvidia  but this one involves using artificial intelligence  AI  to help extract and process oil and gas more efficiently  It believes that it is just scratching the surface of what AI can do for the industry    It also has a California technology center that it shares with the software operations arm of GE  Baker Hughes uses GE s innovative industrial software program  Predix  in oil and gas applications    Schlumberger s stock is up 4  year to date  but is still down over 10  over the past year  Halliburton s stock is also up about 4  both year to date and over the past 12 months  Baker Hughes  stock is also up nearly 4  year to date  but is down a whopping 21  over the last 52 weeks    With the oil industry finally moving toward digitization  these stocks should have a brighter future ahead of them

36977,258492,SLB,3 Energy Stocks Set To Outperform On The New Oil Market Dynamic ,opinion,"Energy stocks have been on a tear lately  with the latest boost coming from surging oil prices  which jumped after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this month  Oil prices are currently trading close to their highest levels in around three and a half years  with Brent crude futures  the global benchmark  not far from the  80 level 

Even before the US Iran headlines  underlying sentiment in the oil market has been positive for quite some time  with prices up around 60  since last summer amid investor expectations that OPEC led production cuts would rid the market of excess supplies  Saudi Arabia and Russia have been leading efforts to hold back oil output by around 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  since the start of last year to slash global inventories to the five year average 
The recent surge in oil prices has prompted renewed bets that Brent could again reach  100 a barrel a level not seen since before the price crash of late 2014  Bank of America Merrill Lynch last week  a Brent price target of  90 a barrel by the second quarter of 2019  while noting a  risk of  100 a barrel  oil next year   Although  we are concerned these market dynamics could unfold over a shorter time frame   the analysts wrote in a note 
Famed technical investor Marc Chaikin  who is also the founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics  said recently that   energy is going to lead the market   while adding   I don t think the current price of oil is pricing in the full ramifications of the Iran deal   Indeed  the S P 500 energy sector is currently enjoying a five week win streak  the longest run of weekly gains since September  during which it rose roughly 13  

In addition to reaping the benefits of higher oil prices  energy firms have also posted impressive earnings  which further lifted optimism and bullish bets on the sector  According to Thomson Reuters data  companies in the sector have reported 86 5  earnings growth in the first quarter 
Higher oil prices may be the primary reason U S  energy firms are on fire  But an underlying shift regarding which oil market players are now the biggest beneficiaries of current pricing trends adds fuel to the longer term outlook for U S  crude producers in particular  Last week  in New Oil Market Dynamic  Saudi Calls The Shots But Real Winner Isn t OPEC  we concluded that the biggest winners of the new paradigm currently operating in oil markets have been US shale drillers 
That s clearly illustrated below  We ve taken a closer look at three stocks we believe are poised to outperform in the months ahead along with an additional group of runners up that also look promising  Our list ranges from well known oil majors to mid cap diamonds in the rough 
In order to weed out the thousands of energy related names trading in the market  we ll only touch on companies in the sector that are U S  based and currently have a market capitalization of  2 billion and above 
1  Most Attractive Oil Drilling Company
Whiting Petroleum   80  YTD
So far  2018 has been a fantastic year for Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL   the leader in oil production in the Bakken Shale Deposit in North Dakota  This oil   gas exploration company is up around 80  so far this year 

It s not difficult to see why Whiting has been rallying so hard this year when you take into consideration the conclusion of our article from last week  link  above  

 Perhaps the biggest winner from the new paradigm has been the U S  shale industry  which has reaped the benefits of higher oil prices  

Indeed  Whiting has taken advantage of the uptick in crude prices by boosting production to 11 43 million bpd in the first quarter of 2018  according to figures in its latest earnings report published on April 30  Oil prices averaged  62 92 per barrel during the first quarter 

For the full year  Whiting s production guidance is roughly 9  higher than its 2017 production outlook  forecasting annual output in a range between 46 5 47 2 million bpd 
The company s fundamentals have also improved significantly  It posted a net profit of  15 million  or 16 cents per share  in the quarter ended March 31  compared with a loss of  87 million  or 96 cents per share  a year earlier 
Looking ahead  Whiting s share price is still dependent on crude market fundamentals  As long as OPEC continues cutting production levels  Whiting Petroleum will be boosting them in order to maximize profit 
Technically  the action looks constructive as long as prices remain above their 100  and 200 day moving averages  which shows complete dominance by the bulls  The support levels are at  40 and  35

37003,258518,SLB,Sturdy U S  jobs report boosts chances of Sept Fed rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth accelerated sharply in May and wages picked up  signs of strong momentum in the economy that bolster prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 280 000 last month  the largest gain since December  the Labor Department said on Friday 
While the unemployment rate rose to 5 5 percent from a near seven year low of 5 4 percent in April  that was because more people  including new college graduates  entered the labor force  indicating confidence in the jobs market 
 Today s strong jobs report shows that the underlying trend in the economy is continuing to improve  This leaves the Fed on course to start hiking rates in September   said Michelle Meyer  senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  in New York 
The report joined May automobile sales and manufacturing data in suggesting economic activity was gaining traction after a slow start in the second quarter 
Doubts had sprung up in financial markets over whether the Fed would be able to raise rates this year after a first quarter contraction in GDP and a string of weak data in April  including soft figures on consumer spending and industrial production 
The jobs data helped dispel those doubts  The dollar rallied  hitting a 13 year peak versus the yen  Prices for U S  government debt dropped sharply  with the yield on the two year note rising to a more than four year high  U S  stocks  however  were little changed 
Average hourly earnings  which had long been the missing piece in the jobs recovery and one closely watched by Fed policymakers  rose eights cents  In addition  payrolls for March and April were revised to show 32 000 more jobs created than previously reported  giving the report a healthy glow 
Traders in futures markets brought up their expectations for a rate hike to October from December  Fed officials  who have kept overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008  meet on June 16 17 to plot their course 
GAINING MOMENTUM
Economists had forecast payrolls rising 225 000 last month  with the unemployment rate steady  May s payroll gains lifted job growth above last year s average of 260 000 jobs per month 
Despite last month s rise in the jobless rate  it remains not too far from the 5 0 5 2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment 
Policymakers will also be encouraged by the return of some discouraged job seekers to the labor market 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  increased 0 1 percentage point to 62 9 percent  a four month high  The number of discouraged workers in May was the lowest since October 2008  and the percentage of the working age population employed hit its highest level since June 2009 
 These formerly frustrated workers are returning to the labor force as a pick up in hiring activity and record high job openings have been increasing their chances of finding a job   said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Research in New York 
In May  28 6 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or more  the lowest rate in six years  A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment was unchanged at 10 8 percent 
Last month s increase in average hourly earnings took the year on year gain to 2 3 percent  the largest rise since August 2013  The mix of jobs gains and higher wages lifted the aggregate weekly payrolls index  a proxy for take home wages  0 5 percent in May and 4 9 percent over the year  
Further gains are expected given firming demand for entry level workers and a better composition of jobs that are being created  In addition  many states have raised the minimum wage and some corporations are increasing pay for workers 
Walmart  N WMT   the largest private employer in the United States  this week announced it would raise minimum wages for more than 100 000 U S  workers  its second wage hike this year 
Payroll gains last month were broad based  though the mining sector purged jobs again as it continued to work through the thousands of cuts announced by oil field companies  The 18 000 mining jobs lost in May marked a fifth straight monthly decline 
Among sector heavyweights  Schlumberger  N SLB  has announced about 20 000 layoffs this year  while  Baker Hughes   N BHI  and Halliburton  N HAL  are also cutting thousands of jobs 
Manufacturing employment increased 7 000  while construction employment payrolls rose by 17 000 ",2015-06-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/u.s.-jobs-market-seen-firming-despite-lackluster-growth-345189,345189
37004,258519,SLB,Small U S  frackers face extinction amid drilling drought,news,By Edward McAllister WEATHERFORD  Texas  Reuters    Oil field work was coming in fast when GoFrac doubled its workforce and equipment fleet at the beginning of last year  just one of hundreds of small oil service companies thriving on the revival of U S  drilling      Founded in November 2011 with a loan of around  35 million  the Fort Worth  Texas based company was by 2014 making nearly that much in monthly revenues  providing the crews and machinery needed by companies including ExxonMobil  N XOM  to frack oil and gas wells from North Dakota to Texas      Executives flew to meetings across the country in a Falcon 50 private jet  and entertained customers at their suite at the Texas Rangers baseball stadium in Arlington  The firm would soon move into a 22 000 square foot office on the 12th floor of Burnett Plaza  one of Fort Worth s most prestigious office buildings      Eighteen months on  however  without work and unable to meet monthly loan payments  GoFrac has closed its doors  its ambitions gutted by a steep dive in oil prices  Of the 550 odd employees on the payroll at the beginning of this year  only six remain       At GoFrac s only remaining outpost  a small warehouse and 40 acre gravel yard in Weatherford  30 miles west of Fort Worth  its huge fleet of sand haulers  chemical blenders and pressure pumps that months before were being used to frack U S  oil and gas wells  sit idle in long rows  waiting to be sold       We knew it was going to be rough  but nobody foresaw what was coming   said GoFrac chief financial officer Kevin McGlinch  who was hired in November 2014 to see GoFrac through the slowdown      GoFrac s end mirrored its beginning  steeper and faster than expected and driven by the unpredictable forces of international oil markets  U S  oil prices dropped 60 percent from June to January due to oversupply from U S  shale deposits  putting an end to the oil drilling boom and precipitating the sharpest industry downturn in a generation      The company s story  recounted to Reuters by six current and former executives and employees  is not an isolated one      The small  and medium sized firms that make up at least half of the nearly  100 billion a year U S  oil services industry that provides fracking sand and specialized chemicals for fracking have been hit far harder than their large  cash rich rivals by the downturn  experts say      While giants like Halliburton  N HAL    Baker Hughes   N BHI  and Schlumberger  N SLB  are weathering the slump by cutting tens of thousands of jobs  firms like GoFrac are going under or heading that way  starved of cash and unable to raise emergency investment       Halliburton and Baker Hughes  the second and third largest oil service companies globally after Schlumberger  announced in November that they were in talks to merge  creating a  67 billion company  The joined entity would still be smaller than Schlumberger  whose market capitalization is  125 billion       Even as oil prices rebound  and analysts expect production to grow again in 2016  the demise of the service sector raises questions about the U S  oil industry s ability to speed up again if prices rise further       It could slow down the ramp up   said James West  who researches the oil service sector for Evercore ISI in New York and said there could be dozens of bankruptcies in the U S  oil service sector       You may start to run into equipment and labor issues            NO RUNWAY     Founded by private equity groups The Crawford Group and Soave Enterprises  and oil veteran Frank Autry  GoFrac started work in November 2011  Richard Crawford  founder of The Crawford Group  is GoFrac s chief executive officer  He declined to comment for this article       Oil was  98 a barrel that day  high enough to fuel a drilling frenzy in Texas and beyond that would last for three more years       We were very successful when we started   said Autry  an oil industry veteran who stepped down as chief operating officer in September last year but who keeps a copy of the company s first invoice  a frack job for Oxxon Mobil s XTO Energy on November 17 2011      The first sign of trouble came around early summer of 2014 with a rare monthly loss  according to two former employees who saw company statements  At almost the same time  in June  oil prices hit a peak of  107 before falling for seven straight months      By Thanksgiving Day  as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies shocked the oil market by announcing that they would maintain production despite a growing glut  GoFrac was sending crews across the country to carry out what work it could  Time in the field increased as workers went further afield for jobs       As prices nosedived  GoFrac found itself undercut by larger companies offering up to 20 percent lower costs for their services       Some of the larger players were awarded the work for a price that we couldn t even cover the cost of the sand alone   said GoFrac CFO McGlinch      By the beginning of February  with its workforce eroded by two rounds of layoffs  GoFrac brought its equipment in from the field and halted operations      It owes debts across the board  from  3 million to New York based Icon Investments for leased equipment  to  60 000 to Great White Washing  a local outfit that pressure cleaned GoFrac s equipment       With a little more airspeed and a little more runway we would have got there  but we didn t and we shut down   McGlinch said           NOT ALONE     While most large public energy companies have been kept afloat with loans this year  lower profile private companies are struggling to survive      Frac Specialists  a Midland  Texas based company with 280 employees  filed for bankruptcy on May 17  Like GoFrac  Frac Specialists  rise was meteoric  Revenues   17 1 million in 2011  jumped to  204 1 million in 2014  Then the work dried up  the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has fallen for the last 27 weeks  down to a five year low of 635 last week from an all time peak of 1 609 in October 2014  according to a weekly survey from Baker Hughes      Frac Specialists declined to comment for this article      Other companies are struggling to meet loan payments and are fast approaching bankruptcy  lenders said       There has been an amazing fallout   said Eric Freeman  vice president at Summit Funding Group  which arranged a  43 million loan for GoFrac but which plans no more investment in energy firms       I have never seen anything like it   he said      Meanwhile  for GoFrac s remaining employees  the job is to find a buyer for its hundreds of pieces of equipment      In an auction in nearby Odessa on May 13  about a dozen pieces of GoFrac machinery were put up for sale  Bought 18 months ago for about  12 5 million  they were valued that day at  10 million      Bids at the auction were slow  however  despite attempts by the auctioneer to coax the price higher       This is the opportunity of a lifetime   he told participants   Think about what you are saving  not what you are spending       Bidding stalled and then stopped  The eventual sale price   5 4 million

37007,258522,SLB,Mixed U S  jobs report dampens September rate hike bets ,news,By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth slowed in June and Americans left the labor force in droves  tempering expectations for a September interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve   The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm payrolls rose 223 000 last month after a downwardly revised 254 000 increase in May  with construction and government employment unchanged  and the mining sector purging more jobs  April payrolls were also lowered  meaning 60 000 fewer jobs were created during the two months than previously reported  The unemployment rate fell two tenths of a percentage point to 5 3 percent  the lowest since April 2008  but that was a sign of weakness as 432 000 people dropped out of the labor force    While we ve been seeing positive signs of the economy picking up moving into the second half  this report certainly isn t pushing the Fed to accelerate the liftoff timeline   said Ted Wieseman  an economist at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in New York  Still  June s payrolls increase ran well above the average for the first five months and the jobless rate is near the 5 0 percent to 5 2 percent range most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment  Before the report  interest rate futures were pricing in a more than 50 percent chance of a December hike  but bets shifted to early 2016  Economists still believe the Fed  which has kept its short term interest rate near zero since December 2008  will tighten monetary policy this year   The dollar fell marginally against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasury debt ended higher  U S  stocks closed little changed on festering worries over Greece s debt crisis  From consumer spending to housing and consumer confidence  economic reports had taken a decisively strong tenor since May  prompting many forecasters to raise their second quarter growth estimates to above a 3 percent annual pace  CAUTION URGED The economy contracted at a 0 2 percent rate in the January March quarter  While the weak employment report raises the risk that growth will slow in the third quarter  economists cautioned against reading to much into the disappointing report as calendar and seasonal quirks could have influenced the data   The labor force participation rate fell to 62 6 percent  the lowest since October 1977  from a four month high of 62 9 percent in May    By far the biggest source of the increase in non participants was people transitioning from employment to not in the labor force   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   Far fewer transitioned from unemployed to not in the labor force    Economists had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising 230 000 last month and the unemployment rate dipping to 5 4 percent   Average hourly earnings were unchanged as mining and manufacturing wages fell  However  manufacturing overtime touched a four month high in June  Average hourly earnings increased 2 0 percent in the 12 months through June  decelerating from 2 3 percent in May  Anecdotal evidence and other measures of wage growth suggest paychecks are getting fatter   State and local governments have raised the minimum wage and surveys show entry level wages for new college graduates are rising  In addition  Walmart  N WMT   the nation s largest private employer  has announced wage increases twice this year  Though construction payrolls were unchanged in June  construction spending hit a more than 6 1 2 year high in May  Residential construction  building permits and new home sales are all at cycle highs   With housing showing so much forward momentum  we find it hard to accept that not a single net new person was hired in the construction industry   said Bernard Baumohl  chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group in Princeton  New Jersey  NOT ALL BAD There were  however  some encouraging signs in the employment report  Though the participation rate tumbled last month  other labor market measures that Fed officials are eyeing as they contemplate raising interest rates for the first time since 2006 improved significantly   A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 10 5 percent  the lowest since July 2008  from 10 8 percent in May  The number of discouraged workers in June was the lowest since October 2008  In addition  the number of long term unemployed continued to fall  touching its lowest level since late September 2008  Americans are also experiencing shorter spells of unemployment  Last month  factory jobs increased 4 000  adding to a 7 000 gain in May  Retail payrolls rose a solid 32 900 and temporary help  a potential harbinger of future permanent hiring  increased 19 800 jobs  the most since December   The mining sector  however  lost 3 000 more jobs because of layoffs in the energy industry  But the pace of declines is slowing  The sector shed 18 000 jobs in May  Oil field companies  including Schlumberger  N SLB    Baker Hughes   N BHI  and Halliburton  N HAL   have announced thousands of job cuts after a more than 60 percent plunge in crude oil prices last year

37021,258536,SLB,Why An Earnings Beat Is Unlikely For Halliburton  HAL  In Q1,opinion,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is scheduled to report its first quarter 2018 results on Monday  Apr 23  before market opens  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 41 cents on revenues of  5 760 million 
In the preceding three month period  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15 2  thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America    the company s largest market by sales 
On a further encouraging note  the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  as you can see in the chart below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise

   Even pricewise  the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year  it is up 4 5  in 2018 as against 0 2  loss for the  industry 

 
Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston  TX based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too 
Unfortunately  as per our model  the trend is likely to be broken in the first quarter  Evidently  multiple headwinds including fracking sand logistics issues have dampened expectations 
Thus  while U S  activity continues to accelerate and margins remain strong  Halliburton s underlying results are unlikely to come ahead of our expectations  The tepid sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been negative with four downward estimate revisions and none up in the last month 
Let s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton s third quarter results 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
With U S  rig count falling to record levels in 2016  oilfield services players  like Halliburton  were hit hard  Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds  However  as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up  the market for services companies is on the mend 
The U S  oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative  With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  the first quarter of the year saw U S  oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 
Consequently  spending on exploration projects have experienced a much awaited rebound  The energy explorers  buoyed by the jump in commodity prices  are set for improving sales and earnings   a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the oilfield service providers  In particular  the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased utilization and pricing    particularly for pressure pumping 
As a proof of the resurgence in activities  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at  3 822 million  higher than  3 804 million reported in the previous quarter and way above the first quarter 2017 sales of  2 604 million  To put things in perspective  the Completion and Production unit makes up around two thirds of the oilfield service provider s total revenue and operating income 
However  cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to drag down the company s bottom line  Rising prices of sand   used to hydraulically fracture new wells   increases the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and puts upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton 
As it is  Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut downs disrupted deliveries 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 42  
Zacks Rank  Halliburton is  3 Ranked  Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton  here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   has an Earnings ESP of  3 33  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release earnings on Apr 26  You can see

37057,258572,SLB,Shell challenges Exxon dominance with  70 billion bid for BG,news,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Karolin Schaps LONDON  Reuters    Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group  L BG  for 47 billion pounds   70 billion  in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade  closing the gap on market leader U S   Exxon Mobil   N XOM  after a plunge in prices   Anglo Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that values each BG share at around 1 350 pence  the companies said  This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90 day trading average for BG  setting the bar high for any potential counter bid by a company such as Exxon  which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand   The third biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil  East Africa  Australia  Kazakhstan and Egypt  BG has some of the world s most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas  LNG   where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal   Shell is already the world s leading LNG company and it would get BG s capacity in LNG logistics   complex infrastructure that includes terminals  pipelines  specialized tankers  rigs  super coolers  regasification facilities and storage points    We are seeing a gasification of energy demand  Shell clearly recognize this   said Richard Gorry  director at JBC Energy Asia   That said  Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn t go back up  in the next 24 months   I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow   BOOST TO RESERVES  Shell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent   Stitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould  the tie up follows a halving of oil prices since last June  putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration  Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals    We have been scanning quite a few opportunities  with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with   Van Beurden told a conference call   We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas    Britain s BG had a market capitalization of  46 billion at Tuesday s close  Shell was worth  202 billion and Exxon  the world s largest energy company by market value  was worth  360 billion  BG s bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence  Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982 5 pence  They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday  with  1 6 billion of BG shares changing hands and  3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares  BG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid June  when the slump in global oil prices began  The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG s share price of a year ago    In buying BG  Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the  70 90 level in the medium term   said Henderson Global Investors  Brent crude  was trading below  57 a barrel on Wednesday    Barclays   LONDON BARC  bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG s portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil   something that  in our view  has been far from evident of late    One source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely  The source said a U S  company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker  Pfizer  s  N PFE  attempted takeover of AstraZeneca  L AZN  last year   The deal represents a windfall for Shell s adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   BG s advisers are Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and the smaller Robey Warshaw   BAML has underwritten a 3 025 billion pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising  according to the offer documents  OIL PRICE IMPACT With BG  Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil  Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world s largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018  with output of 4 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day   Global LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year  The new Shell BG group would have 18 percent of world output   Van Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia  Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti trust authorities  but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales   The halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium  when large mergers reshaped the industry  Back then   BP   L BP  acquired rivals Amoco and Arco  Exxon bought Mobil and  Chevron   N CVX  merged with Texaco    A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector   said Paul Gait  an analyst at Bernstein Research   But some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega deals  saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure   If you re looking to the next big deal  Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger   said Wood Mackenzie   But don t expect a wave of late  90s style consolidation    Shell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven   The deal  which should generate pretax synergies of around 2 5 billion pounds per year  will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group   Last year  BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway s  Statoil   OL STL  to turn around the company  Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition   However  it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden  who took over as the CEO last year  and Gould  a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger  N SLB     I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us   Van Beurden told a conference call   What has happened in the last month  apart from it being a logical deal  it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective     1   0 6693 pounds

37060,258575,SLB,As Petrobras scandal spreads  economic toll mounts for Brazil,news,"By Jeb Blount ITABORA   Brazil  Reuters    For the 20 men hanging on at the Pousada do Trabalhador  a 600 bed boarding house on the dusty outskirts of this boom town northeast of Rio de Janeiro  the dream that Brazil s oil wealth would bring a better life was over  Their jobs at Comperj  a  15 billion oil refinery being built here in Itabora  by state run energy giant Petrobras  SA PETR4   are gone  and their employer   a mid sized engineering company   bankrupt  The men are the latest victims of Brazil s biggest ever corruption scandal  a multi billion dollar graft scheme involving Petrobras  engineering companies and politicians that is battering the world s seventh largest economy   As the scandal has deepened in recent months  key infrastructure projects have been suspended or scrapped  some suppliers have sought bankruptcy protection and job losses are mounting by the tens of thousands  Petrobras  size   it is Brazil s biggest company   amplifies the scandal  Each year it invests double the government s entire discretionary infrastructure budget  giving it enormous power to shape Latin America s largest economy  All told  economists expect the chain reaction set off by the scandal will tip an already weak economy into its worst recession in a quarter century  a harsh reversal for a country that was booming just a few years ago   Our employer went bankrupt  then bankrupted us   Ediney Mor o  38  an equipment operator from S o Paulo told Reuters as he prepared to leave the boarding house earlier this month    I took leave for Christmas and New Year  came back and suddenly  there s no work    He and the other men moved out the next day  and the boarding house closed  There are tens of thousands like Mor o  dependent on Petrobras  more than  40 billion of annual capital spending  Most job losses have come since November as police and prosecutors  backed by guilty pleas from key conspirators  unravel a web of price fixing  bribery and political kickbacks   FALLOUT Formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras accounts for more than 10 percent of Brazil s investment  87 percent of oil output and all domestic fuel production  Its annual revenue equals about 8 percent of gross domestic product  Two refineries worth a combined  30 billion have been canceled  Comperj  a  1 3 billion fertilizer plant and dozens of production and drilling ships  each costing hundreds of millions of dollars  are in limbo   Brazil is paying a huge price for depending so much on Petrobras   said Lucia Salgado  an economics professor at Rio de Janeiro State University  She expects the scandal to shave up to 1 5 percentage points from GDP this year  The damage spread quickly after the scandal prompted Petrobras to put 23 suppliers  including some of Brazil s largest construction firms  on a payment blacklist  Five of the companies   OAS Engenharia  Galv o Engenharia  Iesa  Schahin Engenharia and Alusa Engenharia  Mor o s former employer   have filed for bankruptcy protection since November  slowing projects like Comperj and halting the building of new production ships   More bankruptcy petitions are possible  Even if work returns  there will be less of it  Petrobras plans to cut 2015 investment by as much as third  The impact is also being felt beyond the oil industry  The 23 implicated firms are among Brazil s most ubiquitous  building everything from ports and highways to stadiums and other facilities for the 2016 Rio Olympics  Cooperating witnesses say politicians and political parties received kickbacks on inflated contracts from other state run companies such as utility Eletrobras  That has raised concerns the probe will delay completion of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  hydro dams and transmission lines needed to stave off electricity shortages   President Dilma Rousseff is also suffering  The scandal will delay oil and natural gas output and the royalties she has pledged to pay for schools and health care  It has damaged her reputation as a manager because she was chairwoman of the Petrobras board when much of the graft took place  Rousseff  whose popularity is at an all time low  denies wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes  But dozens of politicians  nearly all from Rousseff s Workers  Party and its allies in Congress  are under investigation for their alleged role in the scheme  complicating the passage of legislation aimed at curbing inflation and kick starting the economy   BOOM TOWN BUST In Itabora   many feel they were duped   Comperj was supposed to be Eldorado  People came from all over Brazil   said Reinaldo Souza  who runs a jobs center   Optimism about the future has been replaced by anger over corruption   The city government says there were 17 000 workers at Comperj in December and less than 3 000 now  In Itabora   new office parks  hotels  stores and high rise apartments stand empty   Nationally  Brazil shed payrolls for a third straight month in February  bringing job losses over the last year to 47 228    The scandal couldn t have come at a worse time   said Alexandre Fernandes  labor secretary for Maca   a city northeast of Itabora  where Petrobras has its biggest offshore oil base   Before the scandal  he said  Petrobras was already cutting back because new output had lagged spending for a decade  Then oil prices  fell to six year lows  adding to the woes  Schlumberger NV  N SLB   the world s largest oil services company  has laid off hundreds in Brazil  many in Maca   Brazil s government is so concerned that it is rushing to sign  leniency accords  with the banned companies  If they admit guilt  return stolen funds and pay fines  the ban on receiving money from Petrobras and the federal government will end  no matter the outcome of criminal and civil suits   We have about four months to get these deals done or face a nationwide infrastructure construction blackout   said Delc dio Amaral  a senator for the Workers  Party   You can t just restart this all from scratch    Smaller businesses  though  are unlikely to get such help  Marco Paulo Pires  the boarding house manager  said Itabora  s economy was  torn apart  by the scandal

37062,258577,SLB,U S  business investment plans fall for seventh straight month,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March  likely weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices  suggesting the economy could struggle to rebound from a soft patch hit at the start of the year 
The Commerce Department said on Friday non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  declined 0 5 percent last month after a revised 2 2 percent drop in February  which was the biggest drop since July 2013 
The so called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1 1 percent in February 
Business spending on capital goods has been undermined by the buoyant dollar  which has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies  At the same time  lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production  reducing demand for equipment by oil field companies  including Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0 3 percent 
Shipments of core capital goods  which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement  fell 0 4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0 1 percent gain in February 
Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0 3 percent  That downward revision together with March s weak reading could see economists trim their first quarter GDP growth estimates  which currently range between a 0 5 percent and 2 percent annual pace 
A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods   items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more   which rebounded 4 0 percent last month

37064,258579,SLB,Job growth rebounds  keeps 2015 Fed rate hike in play ,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven year low of 5 4 percent  signs of a pick up in economic momentum that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to hike interest rates this year 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 223 000 as gains in services sector and construction jobs offset weakness in mining  the Labor Department said on Friday  The one tenth of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate to its lowest level since May 2008 came even as more people piled into the labor market 
While the report suggested underlying strength in the economy at the start of the second quarter after a bad stumble  wage growth was tepid and March payrolls were revised downward  leading financial markets to push back rate hike bets 
 We see this report as reducing concerns that weak first quarter growth represents a loss of economic momentum   said Michael Gapen  chief U S  economist at  Barclays   LONDON BARC  in New York 
Nevertheless  he said the bounce back was not strong enough to think the Fed could bump rates higher before September  
March payrolls were revised to show only 85 000 jobs created  the fewest since June 2012  That resulted in 39 000 fewer jobs added in February and March than previously reported  underscoring the weakness in activity at the start of the year 
Investors on Wall Street cheered the report  with major stock indexes rising more than 1 percent 
Yields on U S  Treasury debt slipped and futures contracts showed traders clinging to bets the U S  central bank would raise rates from near zero this year  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies 
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
The drop in the unemployment rate pushed it within a whisker or two of the 5 0 percent to 5 2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment 
Some economists said the tightening labor market could push Fed officials to tighten monetary policy despite anemic wage growth 
 Even without wages or inflation picking up  we do not think the Fed will feel comfortable sitting at zero as the unemployment rate closes in on 5 percent   said Michelle Girard  chief economist at RBS  LONDON RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut Also encouraging  the labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  rose 0 1 percentage point to 62 8 percent  although that was just up from a 36 year low 
Other measures on the Fed s so called dashboard also improved further 
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell to 10 8 percent   the lowest level since August 2008 
In addition  the number of long term unemployed continued to fall 
Wages  however  were a weak spot  Average hourly earnings rose just three cents in April  While that took the year on year gain to 2 2 percent  it remained stuck in the range it has been in for the past few years 
The weakness in average hourly earnings is in stark contrast with other compensation measures that have suggested solid wage growth in recent months 
 With the unemployment rate approaching full employment levels it will only be a matter of time before wages start to rise at a somewhat swifter pace   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco 
Last month  the government reported that the economy expanded at only a 0 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter  but data earlier this week showing a wider than forecast trade deficit suggests GDP actually shrank 
There was a broad based acceleration in job growth in April  with the exception of the mining sector  where a plunge in crude oil prices has undercut energy production 
Schlumberger  N SLB   the world s No 1 oil field services provider  said last month it would cut a further 11 000 jobs  bringing total layoffs this year to 20 000   Baker Hughes   N BHI  and Halliburton  N HAL  have also announced thousands of redundancies 
Mining payrolls fell 15 000  logging the fourth straight month of declines  Manufacturing employment increased 1 000 after being flat in March as factories struggle with a strong dollar  Construction payrolls jumped 45 000 after falling 9 000 in March

37065,258580,SLB,Weak U S  data point to modest second quarter economic rebound,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  industrial production unexpectedly fell for a fifth straight month in April due in part to a further decline in oil and gas drilling  suggesting that the economy is growing at only a modest pace in the second quarter 
The economy s struggle to pick up steam after a dismal first quarter was underscored by other data on Friday showing a drop in consumer confidence to a seven month low in early May and only a mild rebound in factory activity in New York state 
Coming on the heels of weak retail sales and producer inflation data this week  the reports suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon 
 It means in the next month or so we are unlikely to see a massive rebound in growth momentum  These are not the numbers that would inspire confidence in the Fed to tighten policy   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York 
Industrial output slipped 0 3 percent after a similar decline in March  the Fed said  Economists had expected a 0 1 percent gain 
A plunge of 14 5 percent in oil and gas well drilling pushed mining production down 0 8 percent last month  It was the fourth straight monthly decline in mining output 
Crude oil prices have fallen by about 50 percent since last June  resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity 
Companies like Schlumberger  N SLB   the world s No  1 oilfield services provider  and Halliburton  N HAL  have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year   Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  has cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned that lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business 
Oil and gas drilling is down 46 5 percent over the year and there is no relief in sight despite the recent stabilization of crude oil prices  Oil rig counts continued to decline early in the second quarter 
 We see a further drop in mining investment over the next few quarters and are not convinced that business investment ex mining will be strong enough to sufficiently offset this drag   said Michelle Meyer  a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  in New York 
SENTIMENT SOURS
In a separate report  the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 88 6 early this month  the lowest reading since October  from 95 9 in April 
There were slight declines in consumers  attitudes toward purchases of motor vehicles and homes 
While economists noted the weak relationship between consumer confidence and consumer spending  they nevertheless saw May s decline as unfavorable  Many of them believe that consumer spending will accelerate in the second quarter as households start drawing on their savings from relatively cheap gasoline prices 
 All things considered  the decline in confidence means that the potential for a pick up in consumption growth over the next few months is probably smaller than we previously anticipated   said Paul Ashworth  chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto 
The economy was slammed earlier in the year by bad weather  port disruptions  a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms  The government reported last month that GDP expanded at a 0 2 percent annual pace in the first quarter 
But trade and inventory data published after the GDP snapshot suggested the economy actually contracted  Second quarter growth estimates are currently hovering around a 2 5 percent pace  well below the 4 6 percent pace in the same period last year 
U S  stocks were marginally weaker  while prices for longer dated U S  government bonds rose  The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies 
Last month  utilities production tumbled 1 3 percent  also contributing to the weakness in industrial output  Manufacturing production was unchanged after gaining 0 3 percent in March  It
was restrained by a 0 9 percent drop in machinery  though motor vehicle production rose 
Manufacturing  which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy  has been dampened by the dollar  Even as the greenback rally fades  factory activity is unlikely to rebound strongly 
In a separate report  the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 3 09 in May from  1 19 in April  A reading above zero indicates expansion

37079,258594,SLB,The Benchmark Oils  Brent Blend  WTI And Dubai,opinion,"The oil industry is as complex as the stock market  and it s not always easy to understand the movement in price per barrel as it is based on a variety of factors  including onshore vs  offshore drilling which impacts the price of transportation 

The Important Benchmarks for determining the health of the global oil market are as follows 

Brent Blend 
The International Petroleum Exchange developed the Brent futures contract after an unprecedented rise in demand in 1988 creating the ICE Futures Europe after UK North Sea and Norwegian oil production started to develop and became commercialized 
Brent refers to the oil produced in the North Sea comprising of Brent  Forties  Oseberg  and Ekofisk oil fields  The produce is low in sulfur content and is lighter and  sweet  in comparison to others  Since it is produced at the sea  the transportation of crude oil is easy and very sought after 
According to ICE Futures Europe  up to   s of the world s oil is priced relative to the ICE Brent Complex  traders in 5 continents look up to the ICE Brent for future prices 

West Texas Intermediate  WTI  

WTI is referred to as the oil extracted from oil fields and wells in the US and is landlocked  The crude is transported via pipelines and hence one of the drawbacks as it is fairly expensive to distribute and sell to other parts of the globe  This crude is light and  very sweet   WTI is the benchmark for crude in the United States 

Dubai Oman  

This refers to the crude oil produced in Middle Eastern countries and is lower grade than Brent or WTI  It has high sulfur content and is procured in Dubai  Oman and Abu Dhabi  This is the benchmark for the Persian Gulf produce and is mainly sent to Asia 

Estimize s Estimates of Crude oil and Energy  
Estimize collects both weekly change in oil inventories  as well as earnings and revenue estimates for all of the world s largest energy companies  In the chart below we take a look at the correlation between the expectations for the 10 largest energy companies on our site  NYSE XOM  NYSE SLB  NYSE CVX  NYSE HAL  NYSE KMI  NYSE RIG  NYSE DVN  NYSE APC  NYSE HP  NYSE NOV  and weekly crude oil inventories 
There is a negative correlation between the two estimates and it is interesting to see that the changes in the energy inventories are inversely proportional to the crude oil estimates

our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks  including United Technologies  Netflix and Schlumberger  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see United Technologies  shares have gained 13 3  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has lost  3 2  over the same period  United Technologies serves various end markets  which allows it to remain profitable even during tough economic times The company has offered bullish guidance for 2018 on healthy demand trends and is likely to deliver sustainable earnings growth in future with Rockwell merger  However  macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s bottom line growth A disruption in deliveries from suppliers  capacity constraints  production disruptions  price changes  or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules  thereby increasing its operating costs  You can   Shares of Netflix have increased 54 5  over the last three months  significantly outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry s gain of 22  during the same period  The company s efforts to attract viewers through investing in more regional programming are leading to robust addition of international subscribers The company remains confident of adding more subscribers as the trend of binge viewing is catching up fast  Netflix now has 117 58 million subscribers globally  We believe continuing subscriber addition and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward However  increasing market spends and higher investments on original acquired content will continue to hurt profitability  at least in the near term  Rising competition is also a major concern

37082,258597,SLB,Oklahoma   North Dakota See More Onshore Drilling Rigs,opinion,"In its weekly release  Baker Hughes   NYSE BHGE    a GE company  reported an increase in total rig count in the United States 
About the Rig Count
Baker Hughes  data  issued since 1944 at the end of every week  helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
Change in this Houston based oilfield services player s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   
Details
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 990 in the week  ended Mar 16    higher than the prior week s 984  Notably  the total count increased for the fifth time in the prior seven weeks 
Since it slipped to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  rig count has been rising rapidly in U S  shale resources  Punctuated by a few pauses  the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior year level of 789 
For the week in discussion  the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations  The number of onshore rigs totaled 973  higher than 967 
Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week  in line with the count for the week ended Mar 9  The tally for offshore rigs was also in line at 13 
Oil Rig Count  Oil rig count of 800 was up from 796 for the week ended Mar 9  Moreover  the current tally  though far from the peak of 1 609 attained in October 2014  is significantly higher than the previous year s count of 631  The tally for oil rigs increased five times in the last six weeks 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 188 for the week ended Mar 9  With this  the tally increased five times in the last six weeks 
Moreover  like oil  the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year ago tally of 157 
Per the recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is 88 2  below the all time high of 1 606 achieved in late summer 2008 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units decreased from 61 units  However  the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  increased by 10 units to 933 units 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count is at 13 units   12 of which were oil directed   in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 9 
Conclusion
The number of total rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States increased  courtesy of the addition of four and three onshore rigs in Oklahoma  and North Dakota respectively  Two onshore rigs were also added in Texas 
Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first quarter 2018  Given that oil has been trading mostly over the  60 per barrel mark since January  we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U S  shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities   
Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR   and Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO    Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Based in Oklahoma City  OK  Continental is primarily an upstream energy player  We expect the company to witness year over year earnings growth of 323 5  in 2018 
Headquartered in Midland  TX  Concho explores oil and gas resources in the prospective plays  The company is likely to witness year over year earnings growth of 73 2  in 2018

global demand is likely to grow by 1 5 million barrels a day this year to average 99 3 million barrels a day  This projection is 90 000 barrels a day above last month s estimate However  the Energy Department s inventory release   revealing a massive weekly build in crude stockpiles on the back of record domestic oil production   together with a rising rig count  kept the commodity s price gains in check Meanwhile  natural gas prices moved lower last week following a smaller than expected decrease in supplies  The 93 billion cubic feet  Bcf  withdrawal was also below the five year average net shrinkage of 97 Bcf for the reported week  A bearish weather outlook and ample production also played spoilsport Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to offload

37112,258627,SLB,Exclusive  With Baker Hughes  Halliburton cements leading North Dakota role,news,"By Ernest Scheyder WILLISTON N D   Reuters    Halliburton Co s  N HAL   35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes Inc  N BHI  will create an oilfield services powerhouse in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking  according to data seen by Reuters 
The deal  announced on Monday  will help Halliburton better compete with global leader Schlumberger NV  N SLB   as well as smaller peers Calfrac Well Services Ltd  TO CFW   Trican Well Service Ltd  TO TCW  and other oilfield services companies in North Dakota  the second largest oil producer in the United States 
The North Dakota market share projections for the combined company will be of keen interest to competitors and regulators  The deal faces stiff antitrust hurdles and likely will receive close scrutiny from regulators in the United States and European Union  Halliburton has said it would be willing to shed units that generate revenue of  7 5 billion to ensure the deal closes 
Even though oil production in the state s Bakken shale formation has grown exponentially in the past five years  more than 35 000 new wells are expected to come online in the state by 2030  highlighting the ongoing need for the services these companies provide 
 We will rule unconventionals now   one Halliburton manager in North Dakota told Reuters  speaking on the condition of anonymity 
In the Williston Basin  the oil rich geologic formation holding much of North Dakota s Bakken and Three Forks shales  the combined company will control 53 percent of the market to line a new well with cement to prevent leaks  according to the data  The step is required by regulators and a key process to safeguard drinking water supplies 
The combined company will also control roughly 36 percent of the Williston Basin market for hydraulic fracturing   the process commonly known as  fracking  where water and sand are blasted into a well at high pressure to extract oil  And roughly 35 percent of the market for directional drilling  the process to drill wells horizontally  will be held by the combined company  according to the data 
The Williston Basin market prowess in cementing and directional drilling would eclipse the united company s global share of those markets  Fracking market share in the basin would nearly match the new Halliburton  globally 
UNIFORM PRICING
Halliburton is very interested in Baker Hughes  artificial lift division  which makes products that help old wells boost their productivity  as well as its production chemicals unit  according to footnotes accompanying the data 
In a statement to Reuters  Halliburton said it is too early to discuss the status of the combined company   It is important to remember that until the close of the transaction  Halliburton and Baker Hughes remain separate companies   Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said 
It was not immediately clear what Schlumberger s market share is for various products and services in North Dakota  but the Halliburton Baker Hughes tie up gives the combined company clear dominance in most oilfield services performed in the state 
Schlumberger did not respond to a request for comment 
The deal could lead to higher prices for some oil producers  Baker Hughes historically has priced its services below Halliburton  and the deal will allow Halliburton to make pricing more uniform  Continental Resources Inc  N CLR   for instance  uses a plethora of oilfield service companies for various well completion processes  often choosing the lowest bidder 

The deal also gives Halliburton access to Baker Hughes  extensive North Dakota real estate holdings  including a training center it built earlier this year  Halliburton currently trains employees at centers in Oklahoma and Colorado

37116,258631,SLB,U S  companies face billions in Venezuela currency losses  Reuters analysis shows,news,"By Tim McLaughlin  Reuters    At least 40 major U S  companies have substantial exposure to Venezuela s deepening economic crisis  and could collectively be forced to take billions of dollars of write downs  a Reuters analysis shows  The companies  all members of the S P 500  and including some of the biggest names in Corporate America such as autos giant General Motors  N GM  and drug maker Merck   Co Inc  N MRK   together carry at least  11 billion of monetary assets in the Venezuelan currency  the bolivar  on their books  The official rate is at 6 3 bolivars to the dollar and there are two other rates in the government system   known as SICAD 1 and SICAD 2   at about 12 and 50  The black market rate  though  was at about 190 bolivars to the dollar on Sunday  according to the website dolartoday com   The problem is that the dollar value of the assets as disclosed in many of the companies  accounts is based on either the rates at 6 3 or 12 and only a limited number of transactions are allowed at those rates  The assets would be worth a lot fewer dollars at the 50 rate in the government system and the dollar value would almost be wiped out at the black market rate  The currency system is also about to be shaken up following an announcement by Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Jan  21  leading to fears of a further devaluation   American companies will also have additional exposure to the bolivar that isn t disclosed because they don t see the size of that exposure as material to their results  The Reuters analysis also doesn t look at the thousands of publicly traded and private American companies that aren t in the S P 500 and will in some cases have bolivar assets       BLACK MARKET RATE Some leading American companies have already decided that the stronger exchange rates   the official rate at 6 3 and the SICAD 1 exchange market at 12   are not reflective of the currency conditions they face in the South American country    Diaper and tissue maker Kimberly Clark Corp  N KMB  recently announced a charge of  462 million for its Venezuelan business  leading to a fourth quarter loss for the company  after it concluded that the appropriate exchange rate was the SICAD 2 exchange rate at 50 rather than the 6 3 it had previously used  Using the stronger exchange rates is unrealistic because of how hard it is to repatriate profits earned in Venezuela back to the United States at any rate  let alone those rates  securities analysts say  Citigroup Inc  N C  says it has not been able to buy U S  dollars from the Venezuelan government since 2008  Companies can seek dollars at the official rate if they are using those dollars to import raw materials for production of priority goods such as food and medicine  and some can buy dollars at the SICAD 1 rate at around 12 bolivars to the dollar through auctions that are typically held several times per month but are only targeted at specific sectors  As tumbling oil prices have left Venezuela with fewer dollars  its currency board has steadily reduced approval for repatriation of dividends at the official rate   leaving companies with growing quantities of bolivars trapped by currency controls    It s a huge deal and companies will get hit big   said Ali Dibadji  an analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein   Co Inc   Take a look at what Kimberly Clark did last week and what Clorox did a few months ago by getting out of Venezuela   Cleaning and household products maker Clorox  N CLX  last year decided to exit Venezuela altogether  Its CEO Don Knauss said at the time   We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country   The currency issues are hurting many U S  companies much more than their sales might suggest  Many of the companies in the analysis have been getting between 1 3 percent of their global revenue from Venezuela  Ford Motor Co  N F  and oil services company Schlumberger NV  N SLB   took big ticket hits to their quarterly profits because of their Venezuelan operations  Ford took a fourth quarter charge of  800 million and Schlumberger  472 million  A Ford spokeswoman said that it still values its Venezuela assets at about 12 bolivars per US dollar  But for Ford  the currency system and other conditions are so tough in the South American country that it has made an accounting change that will allow it to ring fence its Venezuela business so that it doesn t have a direct impact on the company s operating results  Schlumberger  which previously used the 6 3 rate  said it is now using the SICAD 2 rate of 50 as it  best represents the economics of Schlumberger s business activity in Venezuela   Another S P 500 company to switch to the 50 rate from 6 3 in recent weeks was industrial gases producer Praxair Inc  N PX   which took a fourth quarter charge of  131 million as a result  It also said the switch will hurt its revenue and earnings in 2015       ANOTHER DEVALUATION  Those changes don t reflect the prospect of another currency devaluation in Venezuela  as recently telegraphed by Maduro  who is struggling to keep a lid on consumer prices amid a 64 percent inflation rate and a plunge in oil revenue  The official rate was last devalued by 32 percent to the current 6 3 from 4 3 in February 2013  at that time the fifth devaluation in a decade   Maduro said in the Jan 21 announcement he would merge the two existing SICAD rates  the ones at 12 and 50 per U S  dollar   He also would introduce another new rate to offer dollars via private brokers to vie with the black market rate  There has yet to be a further announcement providing details of the new system and the rates  Currency uncertainties aside  foreign companies face a myriad of other problems in Venezuela  from weak demand to shortages of many goods  difficulty in importing parts and products  and relying on the government to approve price increases to keep pace with hyperinflation   Most of the S P 500 bolivar exposure is concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about  7 3 billion in assets linked to the country s currency system  according to the Reuters analysis of their latest quarterly financial statements  But if those companies used Venezuela s SICAD 2 currency rate  the one at about 50 bolivars to the dollar  their assets would decline by as much as  5 8 billion  All of these companies currently either use the rates at 6 3 and 12  It would be far worse if they used Venezuela s black market rate of about 190 for the currency  The companies  bolivar assets would be worth only a tiny fraction of their current estimated value if they used that rate  GM  which ranked No  1 out of the group analyzed  with  1 5 billion in Venezuela exposure  said it is closely monitoring conditions there   We have nothing to announce at this time   spokesman Tom Henderson said   Some U S  companies  such as Merck  N MRK   justify valuing their Venezuela assets at the most preferential rate because they are providing essential services and goods  like medicine  to the country  They report some success in translating bolivars into dollars at the 6 3 rate  Merck did not respond to a message seeking comment  Still  some of these same companies have prepared their investors for a currency hit in their latest round of quarterly disclosures  PepsiCo Inc  N PEP  said it would take an after tax charge of up to  440 million if it revalued its Venezuela assets at the 50 rate  As of early September  the company disclosed  505 million in bolivar denominated net monetary assets  
 I do think that more companies may consider exiting Venezuela if the inability to remove cash or take prices to offset devaluations persist   said Dibadji  the Sanford Bernstein analyst ",2015-02-02,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-companies-face-billions-in-venezuela-currency-losses,-reuters-analysis-shows-326079",326079

During a seven year period from early 2004 until about June 2010  Schlumberger s Drilling   Measurements segment provided oilfield services to customers in the two nations that were under sanction from the U S  government  according to court documents  At the time  the company engaged in an illegal scheme with a capital expenditure process that was used to predict the equipment needed for its oilfields throughout the world  according to the Department of Justice  In company emails  the unit concealed the identity of locations in Iran by referring to them as oilfields in the  Northern Gulf   and areas in Sudan by inaccurately describing them as  Southern or South Egypt   the Justice Department said in a statement 
The actions by Schlumberger s Drilling   Measurement segment were in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  IEEPA   
 The International Emergency Economic Powers Act is an essential tool that the United States uses to address foreign threats to national security through the regulation of commerce   U S  Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in a statement   Knowingly circumventing sanctions undermines their efficacy and has the potential to harm both U S  national security and foreign policy objectives   The guilty plea and significant financial penalty in this case underscore that skirting sanctions for financial gain is a risk corporations ought not take

37133,258648,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Schlumberger   Halliburton s Q4  BP s Horizon Woes   More,opinion,"It was a week where the price of oil finished lower and natural gas futures also pulled back from their highest levels since May 
On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   kicked off the fourth quarter energy earnings season  Importantly  both companies  apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers  indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve  Meanwhile  British oil giant BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   saw its Deepwater Horizon costs spill over  65 billion following a new   1 7 billion charge in the fourth quarter 
Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures lost about 1 5  to close at  63 37 per barrel  while natural gas prices edged down 0 5  to  3 185 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  oil benchmark recorded its first weekly decline in a month  The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  U S  output rose by 258 000 barrels per day last week to 9 75 million barrels per day  tantalizingly close to December s record of 9 789 million barrels per day    the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  In fact  the Energy Department believes that U S  output will break through the 10 million barrels per day barrier soon  thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies 
The negative sentiment was partially offset by another higher than expected weekly draw  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 33 of the last 41 weeks and are down more than 120 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 412 7 million barrels  current crude supplies are 15  below the year ago period and the lowest since 2015 
Meanwhile  natural gas   one of 2017 s worst performing commodities   settled lower following a smaller than expected decrease in supplies  The 183 billion cubic feet  Bcf  withdrawal was also below the five year  2013 2017  average net shrinkage of 203 Bcf for the reported week  pointing to tepid demand for the heating fuel 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The world s largest oilfield services provider  Schlumberger  reported fourth quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share  excluding charges and credits   ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year ago figure of 27 cents Surge in SIS software sales  ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America s onshore market supported the strong fourth quarter results On a further positive note  Schlumberger issued a positive outlook for 2018  The company  which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services  believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators  Meanwhile  the international market is expected to witness 5  higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline As of Dec 31  2017  the company had approximately  5 089 million in cash and short term investments and  14 875 million in long term debt  This represents a debt to capitalization ratio of 32 8   In the October to December quarter  Schlumberger bought back 1 6 million shares   Read more  2     Smaller rival Halliburton reported better than expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America    the company s largest market by sales  Halliburton s income from continuing operation  adjusted for Venezuela write downs and charges associated with U S  tax reform  came in at 53 cents per share  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents   the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance  Moreover  revenues of  5 940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 567 million Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased utilization and pricing  particularly for pressure pumping Additionally  the outlook for Halliburton s international market continues to improve  In fact  regional sales were up 11  sequentially in the fourth quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America  as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere Halliburton s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was  439 million  For the full year  capital spending was  1 373 million  As of Dec 31  2017  the company had approximately  2 337 million in cash cash equivalents and  10 430 million in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 55 5    Read more  3     BP is likely to pay additional charge of about  1 7 billion in fourth quarter 2017 relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon   DWH   spill  The Court Supervised Settlement Program   CSSP    which was established post the DWH  has ordered BP to pay a post tax non operating charge of about  1 7 billion for the remaining Business Economic Loss   BEL   and other claims related with the CSSP  The payment will be carried out over a multi year period The high claims determined by the CSSP along with the effect of the Fifth Circuit s adverse May 2017 ruling on the matching of revenues with expenses while appraising BEL claims has resulted in this charge The claims are about seven times higher than the company s expectations  By the end of September 2017  BP paid about  63 4 billion to cover clean up costs and legal fees connected to the largest environmental disaster in the U S  history where 11 rig workers were killed  Moreover  hundreds of outstanding claims have yet to be closed   Read more   4     Pipeline operator  Energy Transfer Partners   NYSE ETP   recently agreed to divest its compression units  CDM Resource Management and CDM Environmental   Technical Services LLC  to natural gas compression

Class B units to Energy Transfer Partners  However  there won t be any quarterly distributions for the Class B units in the first year following the closure of the transaction  which is expected by the first half of 2018 The deal is expected to strengthen Energy Transfer Partners  balance sheet by lowering its debt burden  As of Sep 30  2017  the partnership had long term debt  less current maturities  of  33 630 million  Debt to capitalization ratio was about 52 2   Apart from reducing the debt load  the cash proceeds of  1 225 billion can also be used for funding new projects  The move

Buy  company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state run Basra Oil Company by June 2018  Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014  with average capacity of 210 000 barrels per day  It is to be noted  Shell has a 45  operating stake in the Majnoon oil field  Malaysian national petroleum company  Petronas and Iraq s Missan Oil Company have 30  and 25  stakes in the field  respectively The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field  You can see  The divestment is in line with Shell s strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its  50 billion acquisition of BG Group  The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio   Read more

Schlumberger  Halliburton Comes Up with Upbeat Q4
The world s largest oilfield services provider  Schlumberger  reported fourth quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share  excluding charges and credits   ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year ago figure of 27 cents  Surge in SIS software sales  ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America s onshore market supported the strong fourth quarter results

The Road Ahead
Both companies  apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers  indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve 
Schlumberger  which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services  believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators  Meanwhile  the international market is expected to witness 5  higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline 
Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased utilization and pricing  particularly for pressure pumping  Additionally  the outlook for Halliburton s international market continues to improve  In fact  regional sales were up 11  sequentially in the fourth quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America  as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere 
What the Positive Results Mean for the Oilfield Services Sector
The strong earnings reports naturally pleased investors  Consequently  shares of Schlumberger and Halliburton have surged 4  and 7  since their respective releases  Moreover  the companies  positive outlook for their U S  and international operations bode well for the health of the oil industry  As it is  crude has been on a stellar run over the past few months 
The U S  oil benchmark wrapped up a strong fourth quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply demand narrative  With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market  oil ended 2017 at  60 42 per barrel   the first settlement above  60 since June 2015  A year ago  crude futures hovered around the  53 per barrel mark 
Importantly  higher commodity prices continue to spur U S  production to near record levels supporting the surge in oil production and drilling activity  The U S  rig count has jumped around 35  from same time last year  reflecting strong demand for oilfield services  And unlike the past few quarters  the tight domestic market is complemented by a gradually improving foreign business that is witnessing a spurt in tendering activity 
Overall  the improving macro scenario is likely to translate into significant cash flows for the oilfield service operators

The second quarter gains signal an industry wide recovery in North America after a two year slump  Reuters reported  Until recently  weak fuel prices had kept drilling firms away from natural gas basins  forcing Halliburton  Schlumberger and Baker Hughes to compete for a dwindling number of contracts 
All three firms suggested a bright outlook for the third quarter of 2014 as U S  offshore and onshore oil and gas drilling continues to pick up 

 We expect North America activity levels to continue to improve  with margins approaching 20 percent in the third quarter   Dave Lesar  Halliburton  s chairman  president and CEO  said in the quarterly statement 
 We have concluded  based on the strength of this outlook  that we will immediately accelerate additions to our hydraulic fracturing fleet and logistics capabilities  with new crews available for service beginning later this year   he said ",2014-07-21,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-natural-gas-drilling's-unabated-rise-lifting-corporate-profits-296452,296452
37163,258678,SLB,Offshore Fracking On The Rise In Gulf Of Mexico,news,"By    Global oil and gas firms are increasingly turning to offshore fracking to extract more fossil fuel riches from the bottom of the ocean 
The Gulf of Mexico in particular could see fracking activity grow by more than 10 percent over this year and next  according to Baker Hughes Inc  NYSE BHI  which operates about a third of the world s offshore fracking fleet  Bloomberg News reported  Thursday 
Though environmentally controversial  hydraulic fracturing  aka fracking  operations have taken place in waters around the world since the early 1990s  including in California s Santa Barbara Channel  the Arabian Gulf and the North Sea  Much like onshore fracking  the practice involves pumping vast quantities of water  sand and chemicals underground to crack open rocks and free up deposits of shale gas and oil 
Until recently  offshore fracking was primarily used to boost the productivity and reliability of existing deep sea wells rather than to drill new wells  The practice accounts for only about 5 percent of the fracking market as a whole  according to About Oil  But advances in fracking technology in recent years   coupled with vast offshore discoveries   have emerged to make large scale fracking an increasingly feasible business  Bloomberg noted 
In response to growing demand for offshore fracking  oil services companies like Baker Hughes and Schlumberger Ltd  NYSE SLB have increased their global fleet of fracking ships by 31 percent since 2007  according to an Offshore Magazine survey cited by Bloomberg  The ships  called simulation vessels  measure 300 feet long and carry roughly 7 million pounds of people and equipment  including rock crushing engines and stores of sand  Schlumberger said it launched five new vessels last year for work in the deepwater Gulf  Indian Ocean and North Sea 

The full scope of offshore fracking s environmental impacts is still a mystery to drillers and their regulators  While the process has been linked to groundwater contamination onshore  officials are less clear about what could happen in the depths of the ocean 
Fracking s effects  are not well understood  To date  little data has been collected   Alison Dettmer  a deputy director at the California Coastal Commission  told the Associated Press in February  At the time  the federal government had just approved three new fracking operations off the California coast 
Oil firms say that s why they are proceeding with caution   It s the most challenging  harshest environment that we ll be working in   Ron Dusterhoft of Halliburton Co  NYSE HAL  the world s largest fracking operator  told Bloomberg   You just can t afford hiccups  ",2014-08-07,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/offshore-fracking-on-the-rise-in-gulf-of-mexico-301922,301922

37165,258680,SLB,Oil Service Giant Pulls Workers From Russia On Sanctions,news,"By    Western sanctions against Russia s energy sector are forcing another U S  oil company to pull its workers from a Russian project  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB    the world s biggest oilfield services provider  said it will withdraw workers who are citizens of the United States and European Union  Bloomberg News reported Tuesday 
The Texas based company will pull out about 20 mid level and senior managers  according to two people who asked not to be identified  Bloomberg said  The news comes a day after U S  oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  said it is withdrawing from a joint project with Russia s state owned Rosneft  MCX ROSN  for offshore Arctic drilling because of the sanctions 
Exploration and production companies were expected to spend nearly  52 billion in Russia this year  according to estimates from Barclays PLC and cited by Bloomberg  A large chunk of that money goes to Schlumberger and other service and equipment companies 
The U S  and EU first targeted Russia s energy sector in July by banning Western companies from exporting advanced oil technologies to Russia  The country relies heavily on Western aid and expertise to carry out projects in two of its prized sectors  deep water and Arctic drilling  and shale gas exploration  The sanctions ramped up in August  prohibiting American and European energy companies from working with Russia on future oil and gas developments 
Last month  Schlumberger became the first U S  energy firm to say that its quarterly earnings will be negatively impacted by the sanctions  Reuters noted 

Schlumberger develops and provides technology for hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  which involves blasting open shale rock with a mix of water  chemicals and sand to free up oil and gas deposits  Russia relies on fracking for about one quarter of its oil production  and replacing technology developed by Schlumberger and firms like Halliburton Co  requires  colossal funds   said Vagit Alekperov  chief executive of Russia s OAO Lukoil  Bloomberg reported

37176,258691,SLB,5 Earnings Reports To Watch This Week  UNH  GS  IBM  GE  SLB,opinion,"Just like that  another earnings season is upon us  This time it s a big one too  Q4 2017  the final performance report for 2017 
Many companies will be reporting both quarterly as well as annual numbers  CEOs often also take more time during the Q4 earnings call to discuss the past as they look back on the year s successes and provide a forecast for the future as a way of inspiring investor confidence  and share purchases  for the year ahead 
This earnings season we ll provide a weekly preview of notable earnings reports scheduled for the week ahead  We ll highlight the numbers to watch and what to expect from the market s biggest and in our view most interesting companies 
Here are the five earnings reports to watch during the week of January 15 19 

1  United Health
 Reports Tuesday  January 16  Before the Open

Revenue expectation   51 52B  EPS   2 50


UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  is a diversified healthcare provider  specializing in health care coverage and benefits  as well as delivering actual health care services  The Healthcare sector is heating up and companies have been consolidating via a wave of mergers  Share prices have been rising throughout 2017 
Among the headline consolidations  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  intends to purchase Aetna  NYSE AET  for  69 billion  Humana  NYSE HUM  obtained a 40  stake in Kindred s  NYSE KND  home care business and United Health announced on December 6 that it is buying DaVita HealthCare Partners   NYSE DVA  primary care units for  4 9 billion  With a market cap of over  217 billion  United Health is well positioned as one of the primary players in the Healthcare industry  2017 was a very good year for UNH  Its shares rose 37   from  161 to  220 
The company s revenues have grown at least 7 5  every quarter in 2017  In addition  because they left the ACA marketplace  United Health is relatively safe from any volatility generated by the Trump administration s ongoing efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and they re now more robustly equipped to face any changes wrought by the shifting political landscape 
The company is fundamentally sound and although its debt levels have been expanding  its EBITDA has been rising as well  allowing it to not be excessively leveraged  The Healthcare sector will continue to change in 2018  but United Health looks to be positioned as one of the better companies in the sector 

2  Bank of America
Reports Wednesday  January 17  Before the Open

Revenue Expectation   21 3B  EPS   0 44


Bank of America  NYSE BAC  is on a roll of historic proportions  It just reached  30 dollar per share  for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis 
Bank of America is a very different entity from its pre crisis self  The days of its prominence in mortgage lending are largely gone  Regulations enacted since the great financial meltdown  ensure that banks can t nor won t take on added financial risks  as they once did before the crash remain in place  although the Trump administration is keen on repealing some of these 
As a rule  bank stocks are often slower to move  Over the past decade  BAC has been the perfect example of how slowly improving macro economic conditions will trickle down to impact banks  top and bottom lines  Three or more rate hikes in 2018  as well as improving US GDP growth  should continue to push BAC higher 
In general  bank stock performance tends to reflect two things  the regulatory environment and the state of the economy  Easing the regulatory burden alongside a robust economy are the perfect ingredients for a good year for banks  We think a small earnings beat is not out of the question for BAC in Q4 

3  Goldman Sachs
 Reports Wednesday  January 17  Before the Open

Revenue Expectation   7 61B  EPS   4 89


Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  is an investment bank and a securities and investment management firm 
First  the bad news  In late December  Goldman Sachs estimated that the newly enacted US tax legislation could reduce its Q4 earnings by about  5 billion  Most of the negative impact relates to the just passed repatriation portion of the tax law since it appears they could be bringing offshore profits home and will have an increased tax liability as a result 
This throws a spanner into any previous predictions regarding Goldman Sachs  performance in the fourth quarter and could cause the company to post a loss of about  3 billion for the quarter  should reconfigured estimates be accurate 
The longer term problem with Goldman is its expected growth rate  The investment bank is expected to grow at only 1 7  annually on earnings  Trading revenues have been down lately  fixed income trading   GS s biggest unit from a revenue producing standpoint   saw a 26  quarterly decline year over year 
The next breakthrough quarter from an earnings perspective isn t expected until Q4 2018  a year from now  This is also the estimated timeframe for a resurgence in Goldman s trading revenue  Until then its M A division and financial asset management group are expected to hold down the fort 
This could be a year of stagnating earnings for Goldman  During Wednesday s earnings call we ll be listening for comments on growth 

4  International Business Machines
Reports Thursday  January 18  After the Close

Revenue Expectation   21 94B  EPS   5 16


In an article last week called 5 Stocks To Watch In 2018  we singled out International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   saying that we believe the company will be at a crossroad in 2018  The biggest question we have going into Q4 is can IBM stop its negative streak of 22 consecutive revenue declines  If estimates are correct  IBM will indeed report growth of 0 7  year over year  putting at least a temporary end to its lengthy revenue slide 
There could be some serious volatility awaiting IBM after its Q4 report  News that it has finally been able to reverse its revenue slump should send the stock higher  while another disappointment could propel the stock even lower  weighing on its price more sharply than if the expectation had been simply for another quarter of declines 
During the conference call  regardless of the results  we ll be looking for any indication of short and longer term growth engines that IBM plans to rely on to help the company expand  Almost two years ago we said 

 If IBM wants to avoid obsolescence and be reborn  it needs something convincing to distance itself from the competition  We are still waiting for a clear plan showing how this will happen  even after two years of what the company has called  aggressive  repositioning  

Is IBM any closer now than it was two or even four years ago to some form of reinvention  Sadly  the answer is no 

5  Schlumberger 
Reports Friday  January 19  Before the Open

Revenue Expectation   8 13B  EPS   0 44


Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  is the world s largest oilfield services company  focused on enabling drillers through technology  equipment  and rig maintenance  The first thing to note about upcoming earnings from any oil and gas sector operation is that WTI has finally pulled out of its long price slump  rallying from  42 a barrel in June  to  64 a barrel today 
The outlook for Schlumberger  provided by Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard in Q3  was positive  It pointed to strong oil demand and global GDP growth as major factors in Schlumberger s 2018 forecast  That proved true  for a while  But  after a period of sustained growth  the weekly rig count has stagnated  even though oil prices are rising  This remains a critical metric in order to effectively evaluate Schlumberger s macro conditions  We ll have to wait and see how this potential speed bump plays out

bell   Last quarter  the company s earnings of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4 17  for the last four quarters   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Which Way Are Estimates Headed Let s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last seven days  It reflects growth of about almost 63  from the year ago quarter Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 116 million for the quarter  up 14 2  from the prior year quarter Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude increased almost 20  in the October to December quarter of 2017  per   Through most of November and the entire December  the commodity traded above the  55 per barrel psychological mark  The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude  On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  participated in the meeting  As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Saudi Arabia  Russia  and their allies have pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year Improvement in crude price will likely be favorable for Schlumberger as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price  This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of the company s business segments The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Reservoir Characterization segment s earnings before tax stands at  318 million  higher than  316 million recorded in the year earlier quarter Moreover  for the Drilling unit  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at  307 million  up from  234 million in the prior year quarter The balance sheet looks solid as Schlumberger s total current assets of  19 9 billion   as of Sep 30  2017   is higher than  13 billion of current liabilities  The long term debt level is slightly discouraging as  15 9 billion is higher than  10 6 billion as of Dec 31  2014   Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter  shares of Schlumberger underperformed the   The stock lost 3 4  compared with the industry s decline of 1 8    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 01   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 44 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  Meanwhile  we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell Rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions   Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger  here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Headquartered in Irving  TX  Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   primarily explores oil and gas and hence is an upstream energy player  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 45  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Headquartered in Houston  TX  Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   is also an upstream energy

37179,258694,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Shell s Acquisition  Apache   Encana s Production Guidance   More,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains 
On the news front  Anglo Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  agreed to acquire a 43 8  stake in Silicon Ranch   a solar energy company  while upstream players Apache Corp    NYSE APA   and Encana Corp    NYSE ECA   provided updates regarding their fourth quarter production outlook 
Overall  it was a bullish week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained about 4 7  to close at  64 30 per barrel  while natural gas prices soared nearly 15  to  3 20 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
Building on its second annual gain in a row  oil prices maintained its solid start to the New Year  The second week of 2018 saw U S  oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014  The major catalyst was the Energy Department s inventory release  which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher than expected weekly draw  On a further bullish note  domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the second time since October 
Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 419 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 13 2  below the year ago period and the lowest since 2015 
Meanwhile  natural gas   one of 2017 s worst performing commodities   registered a big jump following a record decrease in supplies  The massive  359 billion cubic feet  Bcf  withdrawal was blamed on strong demand due to freezing temperatures over bulk of the country 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     In a bid to bolster its renewable energy business  Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire a 43 8  stake in Silicon Ranch Corporation from Partners Group  The deal will help Shell leverage its position as one of the top three wholesale power sellers in the United States along with boosting its New Energies division Silicon Ranch is a leading solar energy company in the United States and the deal will make Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Shell its largest stakeholder  Silicon Ranch operates around 100 solar facilities across the United States  having about 1 9 gigawatts of solar based power facilities in its development portfolio  Per the deal  the company will continue to operate under its existing management and retain its brand  You can see  The transaction could be valued up to  217 million in cash  contingent on Silicon Ranch s performance  Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions  the deal is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2018  Further  the deal also provides Shell an opportunity to increase its stake in Silicon Ranch after 2021   Read more  2     Shares of Apache fell around 3  to eventually close the day at  44 55 on Jan 9 after the company issued drab production outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017  Houston based upstream player estimates fourth quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance   provided in October 2017   owing to weaker than expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138 000 140 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d  compared with its prior forecast levels of 150 000 160 000 BOE d  Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast  Nevertheless  Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes As it is  the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters  From January to September 2017  Apache s production averaged 345 495 BOE d  down 13  from the first nine months of 2016   Read more  3     Shares of Encana moved up around 2 5  to eventually

growth of approximately 31  in the fourth quarter of 2017  Further  the output also topped the high end of the company s guidance range of 25 30  While the exact total production figures have not been released  an increase of around 31  implies that the output from the core assets jumped to around 310 601 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d  in the fourth quarter of 2017 as against the 237 100 BOE d  or 74  of the total production  recorded in the year ago quarter   Read more  4     The Williams Companies  Inc  s   NYSE WMB   Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  refused to rescind New York s denial of a water permit to the project  The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers  endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England  which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013  However  the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice  which led to the resetting of the one year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC   In 2016  the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies From Interestingly  the project had received FERC s approval in early 2016  However  the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming

37211,258726,SLB,UPDATE 2 Baker Hughes to buy BJ Services for  5 5 billion,news,"  Baker Hughes to pay 16 pct premium
   Baker Hughes sees savings of  75 mln in 2010
   Baker Hughes sees deal adding to 2011 EPS
   Baker Hughes shares down 3 pct in thin trade
   BJ Services up 11 percent in thin trade 
  Adds details  background thoughout 
 NEW YORK  Aug 31  Reuters    Baker Hughes Inc  said
it will buy smaller competitor BJ Services Co  for  5 5
billion in stock and cash to expand its international business
and take advantage of BJ s pressure pumping expertise 
 The deal values BJ at a 16 percent premium over its closing
price on Friday  the companies said 
 Lower oil and gas prices have hammered the industry  with
both companies  as well as industry leaders Schlumberger Ltd
 and Halliburton Co   recently reporting sharply
weaker second quarter profit 
 BJ Services stockholders will receive 0 40035 shares of
Baker Hughes and  2 69 in cash for each share of BJ Services 
which totals  17 94 a share based on Friday s closing price  BJ
Services shares were trading at  17 20  up 11 percent  in thin
premarket trading  Baker Hughes shares were down 3 percent 
 Baker Hughes and BJ Services  combined market
capitalization will be about  16 3 billion  putting it ahead of
National Oilwell Varco Inc  in the oil services field 
but well behind Schlumberger  worth  68 8 billion  and
Halliburton  at  21 8 billion 
 The deal  will better position us to drive international
growth and to compete for the growing large integrated projects
by incorporating pressure pumping into our product offering  
said Chad Deaton  Baker Hughes chairman  president and chief
executive officer 
 In the spring  analysts at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
raised ratings and stock price targets on the sector  citing
stabilizing oil prices and the prospects for a return to growth
on the horizon 
 Baker Hughes expects annual cost savings of about  75
million in 2010 and  150 million in 2011  It expects the deal
to add to earnings per share in 2011 
 Baker Hughes shares closed at  38 09 Friday on the New York

heavy weights 
 The energy and materials sectors suffered as a stronger
U S  dollar hit commodity prices  while an analyst s comments
on a major railroad stock hurt the transportation sector

second biggest U S  railroad  slid nearly 7 percent after a
broker cut its price target on the stock and helped drive the
Dow Jones Transportation Average down 3 5 percent  An index of
S P industrial companies lost 1 7 percent 
 The U S  dollar strengthened after data showed the UK
posted its sixth straight quarter of contraction in gross
domestic product  the longest stretch on record  and
better than expected U S  housing data gave the greenback an
extra boost 
 A stronger dollar helped to push oil and commodity prices
lower  sending shares of companies in the energy and materials
sectors down  The S P materials sector  fell 2 2
percent 
  Any time the dollar shows signs of life  the stock market
goes down  There s a flight to safety   said Joe Saluzzi 
co manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham  New
Jersey 
  The  weak  UK GDP gave strength to the dollar  And when
the dollar is up  oil falls  
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129 61 points  or
1 29 percent  at 9 951 70  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
dropped 15 04 points  or 1 38 percent  to 1 077 87  The Nasdaq
Composite Index lost 10 66 points  or 0 49 percent  to

day after the company reported a 30 percent drop in quarterly
profit  The company hauls a variety of commodities such as
coal  grain  lumber  construction materials  automobiles and
consumer goods 
 An analyst at RBC Capital cut his price target on
Burlington Northern s stock to  87 from  91  while he kept his
rating at  underperform  
 Shares of the top U S  railroad Union Pacific Corp tumbled
6 percent to  57 37 
 Oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd  dropped 5 5
percent to  64 86 after it warned that natural gas drilling
activity would remain weak until late 2010  Globally  natural
gas prices have been too low to justify drilling many new
wells  Schlumberger said 
 U S  crude oil futures fell 69 cents  or 0 9 percent  to
settle at  80 50 a barrel  The S P energy sector index slid
2 1 percent

37219,258734,SLB,Halliburton Posts Strong Quarter On North American Margins,news,"By    Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL    the world s No 2 oilfield services company  forecast a 25 percent jump in earnings in the current quarter  helped by a recovery in margins in North America and growth in overseas markets 
The company  traditionally dominant in the United States  has been making a big push into international markets to combat weakness in North America 
 Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course   Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement 
Analysts said the forecast 25 percent growth in second quarter profit ending June would translate to 91 cents per share  in line with the average estimate 
Drilling activity in North America has fallen due to weak natural gas prices  intensifying competition among oilfield services providers for a smaller number of contracts 
Halliburton said it expects margins in North America to expand over the year due to increased activity across the region in the second half of the year and service intensive drilling in the United States 
Rivals Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Baker Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI  also spoke of improved markets in North America  after posting better than expected quarterly profits on Thursday 
Lower prices for pressure pumping services  higher logistics costs and disruptions in drilling due to harsh weather weighed on Halliburton s operations in North America in the first quarter ended March 31 
Robust activity in overseas oilfields helped the company offset weakness in North America as well as in Latin America 
Revenue and operating income increased 13 percent in the Middle East and Asia region in the first quarter 
Revenue in Europe  Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States  CIS  rose 9 percent  while operating income jumped 21 percent 
Revenue fell 9 percent in Latin America  while operating income declined 8 percent due to reduced drilling activity in Brazil and Mexico 
The company said it expected full year revenue and operating income from the region to be in line with 2013 levels 
Net income attributable to Halliburton was  622 million  or 73 cents per share  in the first quarter  compared with a loss of  18 million  or 2 cents per share  a year earlier 
Analysts on average had expected earnings of 71 cents per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
The year earlier quarter included a pre tax charge of  1 billion related to the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010 
Halliburton was a contractor for BP  BP LSE   owner of the well that blew out causing the worst offshore oil spill in the United States 
Revenue rose about 5 percent to  7 35 billion  beating analysts  average estimate of  7 24 billion 
Halliburton s stock gained 20 percent this year up to Thursday s close ",2014-04-21,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/halliburton-posts-strong-quarter-on-north-american-margins-278467,278467

Monday s Analyst Blog  Top Analyst Reports for Schlumberger  GM and MonsantoThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Schlumberger  General Motors and Monsanto  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Schlumberger s shares have lost  24 3  year to date  following the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry s  32 3  decline  However  this compares unfavorably with rival Halliburton s  18 6  decline  But the Zacks analyst stresses that Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with presence in every energy market across the world  Also  in all the operating business segments  the company is among the top players The firm has been banking on growing hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market  Schlumberger is also expected to generate significant cashflow from the Palliser Block project where the company will assist Torxen Energy in setting up more than 1 600 oil wells However  since 2015  Schlumberger s long term debt load increased considerably  Moreover  the company s cash balance has been declining over the last six quarters  reflecting significant balance sheet weakness Shares of General Motors have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last six months  increasing  21 2  vs   6 1   In November  the United States  the company reported 245 387 deliveries  The company was hugely successful in crossover lineup in November  Its Buick  Cadillac  Chevrolet and GMC brands recorded double digit rises in retail deliveries of crossovers In November  General Motors  along with its Chinese joint venture  JV  announced record vehicles deliveries of 418 225 in China  This marks a 13  rise on yearly basis  The company aims to focus more on the development of electric vehicles and plans to roll out 20 electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2023 The Zacks analyst likes its emphasis on strengthening its brands  increasing retail sales and maintaining operating discipline  However  frequent vehicle recalls  high inventory level of passenger cars and currency fluctuations are few concerns the company has been facing Monsanto s shares have outperformed the Zacks Agricultural Products industry over the last year  gaining  12 1  vs   11 3   The company believes that elevated sales of crop yield enhancing products as well as premium plant disease control solutions will boost its near term results Moreover  deeper penetration of the Climate FieldView platform and stronger innovation will be advantageous  Also  the completion of Bayer  DE BAYGN  s buyout deal is anticipated to open up a number of opportunities for Monsanto  However  commercial rivalry in the global seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry can prove detrimental Also  lack of any research   development as well as unfavorable commodity price fluctuations might be concerns  Over the last 30 days  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained stable for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Dollar Tree and United Continental Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8

37229,258744,SLB,Energy ETFs Head To Head  XLE Vs  IYE,opinion,"The energy sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately  Oil prices have been relatively stable lately  owing to the recent supply cut extension by OPEC 
What Lies Ahead for Crude 
OPEC recently extended its production cut till late 2018  in order to drive crude prices  Moreover  talks of OPEC working on an exit strategy for its supply cut have provided support to crude prices  Fading prospects of an abrupt end to the production cut deal when the excess inventories are cleared out led to a rally in crude prices 
Moreover  crude inventories in the United States fell 6 5 million barrels in the week ending Dec 15  compared with analyst expectations of a decrease of 3 8 million barrels 
However  there are increasing headwinds related to the future of crude oil  U S  inventories have been extremely volatile and whether it will be able to stabilize the prices is still uncertain  Moreover  the U K  North Sea pipeline is scheduled to restart in January  The North Sea pipeline carries around 450 000 barrels of crude per day to Britain and was closed after an inspection revealed a crack in an onshore section of the pipeline  This weighed on crude prices 
Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector 
Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the Energy Select Sector Index  It has AUM of  17 4 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year  It has 32 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as more than 72  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has exposure to Oil  Gas   Consumable Fuels and Energy Equipment   Services  at 85 4 and 14 6   respectively  as of Sep 30  2017   The fund s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX   and Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB    with 22 7   17 1  and 6 8  allocation  respectively  as of Dec 20  2017    The fund has lost 6 1  in a year and 4 7  year to date  as of Dec 21  2017   XLE has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a High risk outlook 
iShares U S  Energy ETF  NYSE XLE  
This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U S  Oil and Gas Index  It has AUM of  1 1 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year  It has 67 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 67  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has high exposure to Integrated Oil   Gas  Oil   Gas Exploration   Production and Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  at 42 4   26 3  and 12 5   respectively  as of Dec 20  2017   The fund s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp  Chevron Corp and Schlumberger Ltd  with 23 4   15 3  and 6 0  allocation  respectively  as of Dec 20  2017   The fund has lost 7 1  in a year and 5 2  year to date  as of Dec 21  2017   IYE has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a High risk outlook 
Bottom Line
XLE is more popular than IYE  as is evident from its higher AUM  Moreover  XLE may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio   However  IYE has a more diversified exposure in terms of a number of holdings 
At the same time  both the funds have had relatively similar performance  IYE has lost 0 5  more than XLE so far this year  whereas in a year  it lagged XLE by 1   Although the future for this space is still uncertain  prices seem to be gaining some stability on latest developments in the sector  Although U S  inventories continue to bother the markets  investors are optimistic about OPEC s plans to avoid a sudden exit from its production cut plan

37230,258745,SLB,ETFs In Focus In The Holiday Week,opinion,"Though the U S  stock market has had a spectacular run in 2017 on strong global economic growth and optimism related to President Trump s pro business policies  stock trading has been tight in the shortened holiday week due to low volumes  However  several events led to major positive or negative movements in some corners of the market  Here are a few of the developments 
Market Movers
The tech sector has been in the news this week  owing to recent developments relating to Apple s latest product  the iPhone X  Reports of weaker iPhone X demand led to a sell off in shares of Apple and its suppliers  driving the tech sector lower  Per a Reuters article citing  report  Apple is expected to slash its forecast sales of its flagship phone in the current quarter to 30 million units from the previous estimate of 50 million units 
The S P 500 Technology sub sector nosedived as a result  Moreover  various market analyses predict that the tech sector will not benefit as much as expected earlier from President Donald Trump s tax reform that was passed into law last week 
Another major sector that was in news was the retail sector  The retail sector saw holiday sales jump to a six year high  U S  retail holiday sales increased 4 9  year over year in the Nov 1 Dec 24 period  compared with 3 7  last year  Moving on to the online sales space  Amazon saw a blockbuster season  Moreover  per a Reuters  report  the online retail behemoth is in talks with authorities to expand into Saudi Arabia  which led to a rally in the company s share price  read    
Moving on to the energy sector  crude oil prices have been rallying owing to a set of events  Crude breached  60 a barrel this week  the highest since June 2015  This was primarily helped by an extension in supply cuts into late 2018 by OPEC and an explosion in a crude pipeline in Libya  Moreover  per the Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  commercial crude inventories decreased by 4 6 million barrels in the week ended Dec 22 compared with a Wall Street Journal  predicting a decline of 3 7 million barrels 
On the industrial metal side  strength in commodity prices led to a rally in U S  equities  Copper prices rallied to a near four year high on Dec 27  2017  driven by strong import demand from China  Imports of refined copper increased 19  year over year in November to 329 168 tons

37231,258746,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Hess  Oil Find  Petrobras   2 95B Settlement   More,opinion,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied to a three year high  However  natural gas futures were down sharply 
On the news front  energy explorer Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   announced a major oil discovery offshore Guyana  while Brazil s Petrobras   NYSE PBR   agreed to shell out  2 95 billion to resolve a U S  shareholder lawsuit over a graft scandal 
Overall  the sector started 2018 on a mixed note  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained about 1 7  to close at  61 41 per barrel  natural gas prices fell 5 4  to  2 795 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
Building on its second annual gain in a row  oil prices saw a solid start to the New Year  The first week of 2018 saw U S  oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014  The major catalyst was the Energy Department s inventory release  which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher than expected weekly draw 
On a further bullish note  political turmoil in Iran has raised the specter of production disruption in OPEC s third biggest producer  Data showing the number of U S  oil rigs falling for a second straight week helped cement those gains 
Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 424 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 11 4  below the year ago period and the lowest since 2014 
Meanwhile  natural gas   one of 2017 s worst performing commodities   registered another drop following a below average decrease in supplies  Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment  bringing prices down sharply 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Hess announced that the sixth oil discovery   Ranger 1 exploration well   since 2015 in the Stabroek Block  offshore Guyana  was a success The five world class discoveries in the block   Liza  Payara  Snoek  Liza Deep and Turbot  are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent  Further  resources related with the Ranger 1 discovery will raise this estimate The drilling of the Ranger 1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  Corporation s associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd  on Nov 5  2017  It hit about 230 feet  70 meters  of high quality  oil bearing carbonate reservoir  The well was drilled to a total depth of 21 161 feet  6 450 meters  in water depth of 8 973 feet  2 735 meters   ExxonMobil  the operator of Stabroek Block  holds 45   while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30  and 25   respectively The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana  This is likely to attract other oil giants to boost financial returns and create significant value for shareholders   Read more  2     Petrobras  which has been reeling under severe graft and corruption charges  recently agreed to pay  2 95 billion to settle class action lawsuits filed by investors  The payout marks the biggest such payment in the United States by a foreign entity and one of the largest securities class action settlements in the U S  history  The settlement seeks to put to rest one of Brazil s most notorious cases of fraud The Brazilian oil giant was at the heart of the massive corruption scandal    dubbed  Operation Carwash     which incriminated other industries like banks  construction firms and shipyards along with high

Top Analyst Reports for Schlumberger  American Express and BlackRockThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Schlumberger  American Express and BlackRock  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Schlumberger s shares have lost  11 4  over the last one year  following the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry s  19 8  decline  However  this compares unfavorably with rival Halliburton s  4 9  decline  But the Zacks analyst stresses that Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with presence in every energy market across the world Also  in all the operating business segments  the company is among the top players  The firm has been banking on growing hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market  Schlumberger is also expected to generate significant cash flow from the Palliser Block project where the company will assist Torxen Energy in setting up more than 1 600 oil wells Since 2015  Schlumberger s long term debt load has increased considerably  Moreover  the company s cash balance has been declining over the last six quarters  reflecting significant balance sheet weakness Shares of Buy rated American Express are up  31 6  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry  which has gained  10 9  over the same period  The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics  plus lower operating costs The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position and strength in the card business  Significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments are key growth drivers  Strategic initiatives focusing on the platinum card portfolio and the OptBlue program will drive business volume  Cost reduction and return of significant capital to shareholders through dividend and share buyback are also positives However  an increase in provision for losses  high rewards expense and cost of card member services are some of the headwinds  American Express will likely incur nearly  2 4 billion charges in fourth quarter 2017 from tax reform  which will cause its 2017 earnings to fall short of its guided range of  5 80  5 90 per share Strong Buy rated BlackRock s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry in the last six months    22 1  vs   17 1    This performance is supported by its impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters The Zacks analyst likes the initiatives taken to restructure its actively managed equities business with an aim to meet changing client needs  These along with technological changes and its efforts to expand globally via acquisitions will further help top line growth going forward  However  mounting expenses mainly due to continued rise in marketing costs is likely to hurt the bottom line growth Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Aflac and Deutsche Bank Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras

 NEW YORK  July 7  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday as
investors turned cautious ahead of earnings season  and talk of
a second stimulus package underscored worries about the U S 
economic recovery 
 Signaling the economy s difficulty in rebounding from a
deep recession  a member of the Obama administration s economic
advisory panel said the United States should plan to possibly
provide a second round of stimulus funds to prop up the
economy 
  Talk of a new stimulus plan is actually a confidence
killer   said Joseph Battipaglia  market strategist at Stifel
Nicolaus in Yardley  Pennsylvania   That would mean we ve added
a trillion dollars to debt without anything to show for it  
 Investor concerns over mounting debt was also underpinned
by a report showing cash strapped consumers fell behind on
their credit card bills in record numbers in the first
quarter 
 Investors also have their eyes set on the quarterly
earnings season that gets underway this week  with Alcoa Inc
set to report on Wednesday  Alcoa  a Dow component  is expected
to post a third consecutive quarterly loss 
  We re coming into earnings  which are expected to be down 
and the anticipation is that Alcoa s report will be even worse
than expected   Battipaglia added 
  The expectation of a speedy recovery is starting to slow
because there is no evidence to support it  
 The Dow Jones industrial average shed 70 58 points  or 0 85
percent  to 8 254 29  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell 6 29
points  or 0 70 percent  to 892 43  The Nasdaq Composite Index
dropped 14 41 points  or 0 81 percent  to 1 772 99 
 The loss of confidence in the economic recovery has sent
oil prices tumbling  New York crude fell more than 1 percent 
and its five session slide has pressured energy stocks  a large
sector of the S P 500 
 Oil services company Schlumberger Ltd fell 2 5 percent to
 50 19 while blue chip Exxon Mobil Corp lost 1 8 percent to
 66 84 
 The S P energy sector index lost 1 7 percent 
 The broad S P 500 index rallied about 40 percent from
12 year lows hit in early March on expectations of a speedy
economic recovery  But the rally wilted in the last month  as
investors sought stronger evidence that conditions were
improving ",2009-07-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/equities-news/us-stocks-wall-st-falls-on-recovery-worries;-earnings-loom-69398,69398

 NEW YORK  July 7  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday as
talk of a second government stimulus plan stirred fears that
the economy is far from well  raising the specter of an anemic
second quarter earnings season 
 A member of the Obama administration s economic advisory
panel said the United States should plan to possibly provide a
second round of stimulus funds to prop up the economy  implying
that recovery is still far off 
  I think it s insane  the first stimulus package has not
even been spent yet   said Andre Weisbrod  president   chief
executive of Staar Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh 
  They are creating what I would call the government bubble
    When that bursts we are in huge trouble  
 The recent rotation into non cyclical areas of the market
continued as investors sought out companies better positioned
to weather a weak economy 
 Healthcare  a classic defensive sector  was the only S P
500 sector to avoid losses  rising 0 5 percent  Consumer
staples  another defensive sector  had the smallest loss at 0 2
percent 
 Drug maker Pfizer Inc rose 0 6 percent to  14 65  while
food producer Kellogg Co rose 0 8 percent to  48 19 
 But cyclical stocks in the materials  energy  and
industrial sectors  which have ridden a recent upswing in raw
material prices  lost ground as commodity prices eased as hopes
dimmed of a quick recovery  Copper  a barometer of global
economic strength  fell nearly 2 percent 
 Caterpillar Inc  a maker of heavy machinery for
construction and mining companies  shed 3 5 percent to  30 60 
 A preview of the second quarter performance of natural
resource companies will come on Wednesday when Alcoa Inc kicks
off quarterly earnings season  The aluminum producer  a Dow
component  is expected to post a third consecutive quarterly
loss 
 Doubts about the strength of an economic recovery and
subsequent demand for oil have sent crude prices tumbling in
the last week  New York crude fell 1 5 percent on Tuesday and
is down about 14 percent from the intraday peak hit on June 30 
Its slide has pressured energy stocks 
 Oil services company Schlumberger Ltd fell 2 8 percent to

report showing a record number of cash strapped consumers
falling behind on credit card bills in the first quarter 
 Shares of credit card company American Express Co shed 1 9
percent at  23 07 and the S P Consumer Finance index fell 2 7

 NEW YORK  July 7  Reuters    U S  stocks fell to their
lowest level in 10 weeks on Tuesday as talk of a second
government stimulus plan heightened fears that the economy is
not yet on the path to recovery and that the corporate earnings
season starting this week will be weak 
 A member of the Obama administration s economic advisory
panel said the United States should plan to possibly provide a
second round of stimulus funds to prop up the economy  The
comments come as investors question earlier optimism for a
quick recovery  which had driven stocks as much as 40 percent
higher since early March 
  It s clear that over the last three plus weeks that
investors are becoming concerned that the recovery in the
economy will not come as soon as expected and will not be as
strong as expected   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment
officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany  New York 
  When there s talk about another stimulus plan that adds
fuel to that fire  it intensifies the concerns about the timing
and strength of the recovery  
 Cyclical stocks in the materials  energy  and industrial
sectors  which had ridden a recent upswing in raw material
prices on recovery hopes  led the market down as commodity
prices eased  Copper  a barometer of global economic strength 
fell nearly 2 percent 
 Caterpillar Inc  a maker of heavy machinery for

 An initial snapshot of the second quarter performance of
natural resource companies will come on Wednesday when Alcoa
Inc kicks off quarterly earnings season  The aluminum producer

quarterly loss 
 S P 500 corporate earnings are expected by analysts to have
declined about 36 percent from a year ago  according to data
compiled by Thomson Reuters  That would be roughly the same as
the decline seen in the first quarter 
 Doubts about the strength of an economic recovery and
subsequent demand for oil have sent crude prices tumbling in

 Non cyclical areas of the market  which have been stronger
in recent weeks as investors sought out companies better
positioned to weather a weak economy  initially withstood the
sell off on Tuesday  But by the end of the day even the
defensive sectors fell victim to selling 
 Health care  a classic defensive sector  traded in positive
territory for most of the day but by the close the S P
healthcare index fell 0 3 percent    still outperforming the
wider market 
 Drug maker Pfizer Inc  one of the few Dow stocks to finish
in positive territory  edged up 0 1 percent to  14 59 
 A rally in the broad S P 500 index that had boosted it
about 40 percent from 12 year lows hit in early March has
wilted in the last month as investors sought stronger evidence
that economic conditions were improving

industrials above the 9 000 level for the first time since

fourth quarter revenue figures that missed expectations  The

 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  July 24  Reuters    The Nasdaq fell on Friday
following Microsoft Corp s disappointing quarterly results  but
gains in pharmaceutical and energy shares held the Dow and the
S P 500 near break even 
 Microsoft shares fell 9 percent to  23 28  a day after the
software maker posted quarterly revenue below Wall Street s
estimates  Web retailer Amazon com Inc also missed sales
expectations  sending its stock down 8 percent to  86 38 
 The results cast a cloud over what is largely shaping up to
be a stronger than expected second quarter earnings season 
 Even so  investors took Wall Street s initial drop on
Friday as an opportunity to scoop up shares in other sectors 
including energy and big pharmaceuticals 
  Microsoft is going through a product transition and no
great visibility on the Windows franchise  but in general the
tone this quarter for a good many companies has been strong  
said Owen Fitzpatrick  head of U S  Equity Group at Deutsche
Bank Private Wealth Management in New York 
  We are not probably going to see a major shift here in the
negative direction  so it s probably going to be overall
positive for earnings season  
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0 75 points  or 0 01
percent  to 9 070 04  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index slipped
0 36 points  or 0 04 percent  to 975 93  The Nasdaq Composite

    Valero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 27  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s refining segment earnings is  1 372 million  higher than  990 million recorded in the year ago quarter and  959 million in the prior quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  20 183 million for the third quarter  up 2 7  from the year ago quarter Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too  When we issued its Q3   the company had an Earnings ESP of  0 27  and carried a Zacks Rank  2 Marathon Petroleum Corporation   NYSE MPC   an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens The Findlay  OH based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters  In the preceding three month period  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0 96  on lower gross margins and elevated costs Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    However  our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 09  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at  419 million  36 9  higher than the reported figure in third quarter 2016  We also expect profitability in its midstream  or pipeline transportation  segment to be 62 8  higher than the year ago quarter to stand at  420 million  Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes  along with contribution from investments in new projects Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too  When we issued its Q3   the company had an Earnings ESP of  0 14  and carried a Zacks Rank  3 Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco  Inc    NYSE NOV   will report its results after the closing bell National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history  courtesy of its cost reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies  The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10 46  in the trailing four quarters National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Based on our model  National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  13 04  Rising momentum in the U S  markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is  672 million compared with  614 million reported in second quarter 2017 and  526 million recorded in the year ago quarter Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too  When we issued its Q3   the company had an earnings ESP of  10 91  and carried a Zacks Rank  3 Upstream energy player EQT Corporation   NYSE EQT   is set to report results before the opening bell Last quarter  the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents  EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102 17  in the trailing four quarters EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    However  our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of  31 31  and a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2 303 million cubic feet equivalent per day  MMcfe d   which is higher than 2 177 MMcfe d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2 131 MMcfe d in the year ago quarter  The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U S  drillers continue to bank on shale plays However  we are concerned by the increased spending of the company  EQT is expected to spend  1 5 billion in 2017   During first half 2017  EQT s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66   If the trend continues  it might hurt EQT s earnings Even earlier  our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season  When we issued its Q3   the company had an Earnings ESP of  163 91  and carried a Zacks Rank  3 Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ",2017-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-stock-q3-earnings-roster-for-oct-26-vlo-mpc--more-200220910,200220910
37275,258790,SLB,Energy ETFs Head To Head  XLE Vs  VDE,opinion,"The energy sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately  With increasing geopolitical tensions  talks of further OPEC cuts and decreasing production  oil prices are having a good time 
Reason Behind the Appeal
OPEC is scheduled to meet on Nov 30  2017 to decide on the future of oil production cuts  The markets believe that the OPEC will be extending the output cut deal to 2018 to further stabilize oil prices  Investors breathed a sigh of relief as they appear convinced that member countries are adhering to the OPEC deal  read    
The impact of hurricanes in the United States led to a decline in U S  oil production  Declining U S  drilling activity has provided support to prices  U S  oil rigs drilling for new production fell to 736 in the week ending Oct 20 compared with 743 in the previous week  per an  article citing Baker Hughes data 
Moreover  clashes between government forces and Kurdish groups in Iraq have led to supply problems in the world s second largest oil producing country  Adding to the agony  President Donald Trump proposed new sanctions on Iran and accused the Middle Eastern country of not adhering to the landmark nuclear deal which imposed curbs on Iran s nuclear capacity in exchange for freeing assets and easing international trade restrictions  Although still uncertain  oil prices have been rallying on risks of new sanctions on Iran 
Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to energy equities 
Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the Energy Select Sector Index  It has AUM of  16 5 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year  It has 32 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 72  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has exposure to Oil  Gas   Consumable Fuels and Energy Equipment   Services  with 85 4  and 14 6  exposure  respectively  as of Sep 30  2017   The fund s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX   and Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB   with 23 9   17 5  and 6 8  allocation  respectively  as of Oct 23  2017    The fund has lost 4 0  in a year and 10 5  year to date  as of Oct 23  2017   XLE currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  4  Sell  with a High risk outlook 
Vanguard Energy ETF  NYSE XLE  
This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Energy 25 50 Index  It has AUM of  3 9 billion and charges a fee of only 10 basis points a year  It has 134 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 65  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has high exposure to Integrated Oil   Gas  Oil   Gas Exploration   Production and Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  with 40 1   26 7  and 14 2  exposure  respectively  as of Sep 30  2017   The fund s top three holdings Exxon Mobil Corp  Chevron Corp and Schlumberger Ltd with 21 8   15 0  and 6 6  allocation  respectively  as of Sep 30  2017   The fund has lost 5 9  in a year and 12 6  year to date  as of Oct 2  2017   VDE currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  4 with a High risk outlook 
Bottom Line
XLE is more popular than VDE  as is evident from its higher AUM  However  VDE may be more appealing to investors  owing to its cheaper expense ratio   VDE also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings 
However  XLE has clearly outperformed VDE  both in the year to date frame and in a year  With growing optimism about production cuts and relatively less volatility in oil prices  these ETFs might be an attractive bet  However  since the factors driving growth in this sector are still quite uncertain  a more popular ETF like XLE might help alleviate some of the uncertainties prevailing in the sector

37276,258791,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Exxon  Chevron  TOTAL Report Strong Q3,opinion,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in nearly eight months  However  natural gas futures fell sharply 
On the news front  integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   came up with stronger than expected earnings reports  driven by higher oil prices

The U S  oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March  The agreement  already renewed once  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut 
Further support came from the U S  Energy Department s inventory release  which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories on rising exports 
Upbeat third quarter U S  GDP data and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices 
Meanwhile  natural gas futures finished the week down despite a smaller than expected increase in supplies  Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity s production  induced the drop in prices 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp  posted strong third quarter 2017 results  courtesy of increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved

Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months Notwithstanding the bullish oil market sentiment  the Energy Select Sector SPDR   a popular way to track energy companies    failed to keep up and generated a  0 4  return last week  The worst performer was U S  major Chevron whose stock fell by 3 9

37277,258792,SLB,Oil And The Saudi Shake Down,opinion,"It seems the move by Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to arrest members of the royal family and their business associates in a corruption crackdown is proving to be wildly popular among the Saudis young population  Yet  at the same time it is adding a new sense of an oil price risk against a backdrop of a tighten global petroleum market 
Most Saudi citizens are in their 30 s and have grown to be upset with the lavish lifestyles of the multitudes of royal family members and cousins while they struggle to make ends meet  The move by bin Salman to purge and drain the Saudi swamp is playing well at home even as it raises fears internationally of a potentially unstable Saudi Arabia  a long time American ally 
It also raises concerns about a more aggressive Saudi Foreign policy that could lead to an expansion of the war in Yemen as well as a direct confrontation with Iran  The Saudi s say a missile strike from Yemen on the capital of Riyadh was from Iran and that they would soon respond in an appropriate manner  Concern that an escalation of the War in Yemen could directly impact oil routes and even Saudi or Iranian oil production  Not to mention the risk oil of transportation through the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab el Mandeb Strait 
Yet  even without the Saudi oil drama the fundamentals for oil are exceeding bullish  Oil supply and product supply are draining at a record rate as demand goes on a surge that cash strapped shale producers can t keep up with  Huge decline rates on shale and the inability to raise cash or get frac crews are creating a logistical nightmare making it difficult if not impossible to respond quickly to the current market situation 
Still U S  shale producers still say that they can have their cake and eat it too  Reuters reported that U S  shale producers are telling investors  impatient for better returns  that they can keep boosting oil output aggressively and do so while still making money for shareholders 
Reuters say that investors have pushed top U S  shale companies to focus on returns  rather than higher production in a move that threatened to slow the breakneck growth in supply  Reuters says that in comments during recent third quarter earnings calls  shale executives signaled they expect to deliver both higher returns and output 
At least seven of the largest U S  shale companies  including Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  and Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   forecast 10 percent or better production gains this quarter in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  the largest U S  oil field  Yet is 10 percent enough to offset growing demand and OPEC and Non OPEC cuts  Absolutely not 
While shale producers say they are proving they can drive output higher even after several last summer reported some Permian wells had begun delivering more natural gas  a sign of aging fields many I talk to in the industry still has their doubts
The FT reported that U S  oil production growth this year is on course to be significantly lower than government forecasts  as companies struggle to find the operators and equipment they need to complete the wells they have drilled  according to a new energy research firm  The steady rise in shale oil output from the U S  has weighed on global crude prices but the projections Kayrros  a Paris based research firm  backed by former Schlumberger chief executive Andrew Gould  suggest there may be less oil coming than expected on to world markets over the next few months 
The signs of capacity shortages are also good news for oil field services companies such as Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   enabling them to raise rates after steep cuts during the industry downturn that began in 2014  but suggest the profitability of U S  oil and gas producers will remain under pressure 
Once a shale well has been drilled it needs hydraulic fracturing or fracking and other procedures to start production  The number of drilled but uncompleted wells  often known as DUCs  in the U S  main shale oil and gas regions has been rising sharply this year  going from 4 944 last December to 6 031 in June  according to the U S  government s Energy Information Administration 
Reuters reported that U S  shale output is expected to hit 6 1 million barrels of oil per day  bpd  this month  up 35 percent from a year earlier  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  Yet many doubt the accuracy of these figures  Harold Hamm of Continental Resources says that the EIA has consistently overestimated shale oil production because it has a flawed way of measuring the decline and flush rates of newer wells  Regardless of what shale scenario you believe  the truth is that it won t change the fact that U S  oil inventories are going to continue to plummet into the end of this year 
While everyone kept focus on supply everyone forgot about demand  An improving U S  economy and global economy is driving demand through the roof  Oil Prices says that oil consumption reached a 10 year record of 21 million barrels a day during the summer of 2017  August consumption was 300 000 barrel a day ahead of the year before  The IBD reminds us International Energy Agency said last month that global supply and demand will balance next year as demand growth rises 1 4  in 2018  Gasoline demand from China remains especially robust thanks to a 17  increase in SUV sales  And in the U S   trucks and SUVs remain popular 
AAA reported yesterday that U S  gasoline demand in October hit the highest level since 2006  That is one of the reason why we have seen gas price go up at the pump  AAA says that according to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   the latest gasoline demand measurement is the highest for the end of October since 2006  At  2 53  today s gas price is six cents more than a week ago  two cents more than a month ago and 31 cents more than a year ago 
 October has seen strong demand numbers likely  in part  due to consumers taking advantage of the unseasonably warm weather rather than spending time indoors   said Jeanette Casselano  AAA spokesperson   As consumers fill up their tanks more frequently  we are seeing supply levels tighten and gas prices increase  However  we don t expect this increase to be long term  
All and all it is why we have seen oil hit a two year high  The last time when oil prices failed two years ago July was because of three historic oil events that set prices tumbling  First it was the July 4 Greek exit vote  You know when Greece voted to leave the EU and decided to stay when their banks ran out of cash  That set back EU growth and slowed demand  Then later in that month President Obama started the process of lifting oil sanctions on Iran  Another bearish event  Then came the Chinese currency devaluation that set the stage for global economic stability leading to a slowdown in growth so dire that 6 month later lead to one of the worst starts in U S  stock market history 
We are now in a much different world  Global growth is on fire  Oil demand should not stop growing unless we get an economic shock  If you look back at the double bottom at  26 a barrel and where we are now it is clear that  that was the bottom of an oil cycle  And now we are behind the curve 
We said natural gas bottomed last week and it sure looks like it  Weather demand and supply tightness in storage has set the stage for further gains  Tonight  we get the API report  We are looking for big draws on oil  gasoline and distillates  We have some interesting plays coming up going into the end of this year ",2017-11-07,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-and-the-saudi-shake-down-200263323,200263323

   Oil rises on expectations OPEC to cut supplies
   European stocks rise  as oil prices drive energy shares
   U S  dollar rebounds against yen
  Recasts with close of U S  markets 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 17  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Friday
after weak U S  housing and consumer confidence reports added
to growing worries about a widening slowdown  while oil prices
rose on growing expectations OPEC will cut crude supplies 
 Trading was volatile on Wall Street and other financial
markets as a wave of forced selling pushed security prices
wildly up and down in what has become a daily occurrence 
The U S  dollar rebounded against the yen in signs of
greater risk appetite but gold dropped after the dollar rally
triggered heavy liquidations by commodity funds 
 The Dow capped its best weekly gain in five years and the
broader S P 500 had its best week since February after a
disastrous three weeks that had knocked U S  stocks deeply into
bear territory 
 Oil jumped 2 9 percent  spurred by a broader rise across
many financial markets and expectations that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries could cut output at an
emergency meeting next week 
 U S  crude  settled up  2 to  71 85 a barrel  while
London Brent crude  gained  1 76 to settle at  69 60 a
barrel 
 The rise in oil prices pushed energy shares in Europe
sharply higher  driving up markets across the continent 
 U S  stocks had risen solidly earlier on reassuring results
by technology leaders Google and IBM  as well as
bargain hunting 
 But a growing fear of recession loomed over investors on
reports that showed U S  consumer sentiment suffered its
steepest monthly drop on record in October and housing
construction starts fell to a 17 1 2 year low last month 
 Given the number of signs that the global economy was
headed into a potentially deep recession  investors remained
cautious 
  Sentiment remains fragile   said Sudakshina Unnikrishnan 
analyst at Barclays Capital   The macroeconomic uncertainty
and recession fears coupled with volatility in the financial
markets means any sort of recovery we see in prices could be
viewed as temporary   she said 
 There were more advancing shares than declining shares on
the New York Stock Exchange  but among the 25 most active
decliners outnumbered advancing stocks by 2 to 1 
 Wall Street turned lower in late trade after a
roller coaster session  Analysts said options expirations could
have increased stock market volatility on Friday 
  There is not a whole lot of depth and liquidity in the
market  That is what is causing these wild intraday swings in
the stock benchmarks   said Thomas Haugh  chief investment
officer of brokerage and money manager PTI Securities and
Futures in Chicago  who said he doubts the options expiration
is a factor in these wild swings 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 127 04
points  or 1 41 percent  at 8 852 22  The Standard   Poor s 500
Index  slipped 5 88 points  or 0 62 percent  at 940 55 
The Nasdaq Composite Index  shed 6 42 points  or 0 37
percent  at 1 711 29 
 A number of companies warned of quickly slowing economic
growth 
 Schlumberger Ltd   the world s largest oilfield
services company  warned that the credit crisis and softening
global economy could trim spending expectations in the oil and
gas industry next year  Its shares fell 5 6 percent 
 Honeywell International Inc  cut its fourth quarter
profit forecast below Wall Street s expectations and said it is
bracing for  recessionary conditions  in the United States and
Europe next year  sending its shares down 6 percent 
 In Europe shares gained 4 2 percent  ending a volatile week
on a strong note thanks to energy stocks that tracked a
recovery in crude  while drugmakers rose ahead of key company
reports next week 
  What helps is that we ve ended the week in the same way it
started  on an upbeat note   said Mike Lenhoff  chief
strategist at Brewin Dolphin 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 finished the week 6 3
percent higher 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed up 4 2 percent at 894 77 points  The index has lost 39 9
percent this year on recession worries and the effects of
banking failures 
  This is the most volatile week we ve seen   said Thierry
Lacraz  strategist at Swiss bank Pictet in Geneva   The sole
intelligent thing is to remain on the sidelines and not make
any huge bets  
 U S  government debt wavered as rising stocks tempered the
flight to safety 
  Along with everyone else  the eyes of Treasuries investors
are glued to what s going on in the stock market   said Chris
Rupkey  chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi 
 When stocks go up  the bid for Treasuries goes down  When
stocks go down  the bid for Treasuries comes back  
 Investors moved money into U S  government debt in the late
stock market sell off  but signs of more credit supply pared
the safe haven appeal of ultra short debt 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  rose
10 32 in price to yield 3 93 percent  while the 2 year U S 
Treasury note  was unchanged in price to yield 1 62
percent 
 The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies  with
the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 21 percent at 82 458 
 The euro  fell 0 45 percent at  1 3424  and against
the yen  the dollar  fell 0 24 percent at 101 36 
 Gold dropped 2 percent  concluding a volatile week of
selling  as a lack of confidence in the financial system and a
dollar rally triggered heavy liquidation by commodity funds 
 Gold s status as a hedge against inflation was also
weakened as investors fretted that a recession could not be
avoided amid a deepening financial crisis 
 Gold bullion  fetched  785 80 an ounce at 2 23 p m 
EDT  1823 GMT   down 2 3 percent from Thursday s close of
 804 50  Earlier it touched  771 30  the lowest since Sept

37308,258823,SLB, Non monopoly  oil firms safe from seizure Venezuela,news,"   Non monopoly  well service firms not subject to seizure
   Clarification follows nationalizations last month
 By Pascal Fletcher
 BASSETERRE  St  Kitts  June 11  Reuters    Venezuela has
 no reason  to nationalize foreign oil well drilling service
companies that are not  monopolistic   in contrast to gas and
water injection projects seized last month  the country s oil
minister said on Thursday 
 Rafael Ramirez said oil well service operations  such as
drilling rigs run by Halliburton Co   Schlumberger Ltd
 and Baker Hughes   did not fall under the
specific terms of reference of the law that nationalized the
gas and water injection units recently taken over 
  There is no reason to touch that kind of service    
because they are not monopolistic   Ramirez told Reuters  in
response to a question whether these major oil well service
firms also could be hit by nationalization 
  They are not within the context of that law   he added 
 Ramirez was speaking after a meeting in St  Kitts and Nevis
of regional energy ministers from the 18 nation PetroCaribe
energy alliance  that allows Caribbean and Central American
states to buy Venezuelan oil on easier payment terms  Leaders
of the Venezuelan backed alliance are to meet on Friday 
 Last month  President Hugo Chavez ordered the takeover of a
gas injection project in Venezuela owned by Williams Companies
Inc   along with a smaller water injection operation 
both used to enhance output from oil fields 
 Clarifying the move  Ramirez said that while these gas
injection operations and other Lake Maracaibo oil service
activities seized were  monopolistic  in character  drilling
services could be contracted freely from one company or
another 
 Nevertheless  Venezuela s latest oil service company
nationalizations  following the takeover by the government of
mammoth heavy oil projects in 2007  have stoked fears of more
government seizures in the strategic oil industry 
 Halliburton  Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide a range
of services including exploration and enhancing output at
existing fields 
 If it occurred  the takeover of their operations in
Venezuela could have repercussions in production and future
investment in one of the world s major oil exporters 
 Venezuela s state oil company PDVSA has run up large debts
with service companies including Halliburton and Schlumberger
and is trying to renegotiate tariffs with them 
 Ramirez said this week the company had paid off  2 billion
in debts to its service providers  of more than  7 billion it
owed at the end of 2008  A preliminary report given by PDVSA to
the national assembly earlier in the year had put the debt at
almost double that

37321,258836,SLB,Why An Earnings Beat Is Likely For Halliburton  HAL  In Q3 ,opinion,Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is scheduled to report its third quarter earnings on Monday  Oct 23  before market opens In the preceding three month period  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21 1   Moreover  both Halliburton s segments   Completion and Production  as well as  Drilling and Evaluation   reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America On a further encouraging note  the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  as you can see in the chart below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Importantly  this Houston  TX based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the third quarter  Evidently  multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space With U S  activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong  Halliburton s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations  The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been solid with eight upward estimate revisions and just one down in the last two months Consequently  the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year  it is down 17 5  in 2017 as against 30 2  loss for the  industry  Let s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton s third quarter results A Likely Positive Surprise With U S  rig count falling to record levels last year  oilfield services players  like Halliburton  were hit hard  Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds However  as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up  the market for services companies is on the mend  Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014  spending on exploration projects have experienced a much awaited rebound  The energy explorers  buoyed by the jump in commodity prices  are set for improving sales and earnings   a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long struggling oilfield service providers In fact  during last quarter s earnings release  the company also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased utilization and pricing   particularly for pressure pimping As a proof of the resurgence in activities  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at  3 430 million  much higher than  3 132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017  Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be  1 888 million  more than the prior quarter figure of  1 825 We also appreciate Halliburton s successful cost management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices over a length of time  Last year  the company successfully implemented on its plan of pruning annual costs by  1 billion  In fact  Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage  mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less What Does Our Model Say Our proven model too shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   for this company stands at  0 08   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  On the other hand  the Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store Halliburton is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season  Here are some companies from the space which  according to our model  also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter National Oilwell Varco Inc    NYSE NOV   has an Earnings ESP of  10 91  and a Zacks Rank  2  The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26  You can see  Suncor Energy Inc    NYSE SU   has an Earnings ESP of  29 60  and a Zacks Rank  2  The Canadian integrated energy company is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25 The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s

deepwater exploration permits in 2013 with the acreage spanning more than 32 000 square kilometers  Chevron intended to drill four wells but has decided not to proceed with the plans owing to weak oil

37324,258839,SLB,Slowdown In Shale,opinion,"Another big drop in U S  rig counts and warnings from major oil service firms is making it clear that the Shale oil slowdown that I predicted is here  Baker Hughes reported a plunge of 7 oil rigs and eight natural gas rigs  Some of the drop is storm related but a lot of the drop is not  We know that in the prolific Permian basin rigs fell by 6 as Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  CEO Paal Kibsgaard warned that U S  energy and production companies seems to be moderating and that while he expects continued growth in the U S   he believes the pace would slow  He also said that  There are clear signs the global oil market is balanced  which would support higher oil prices and investments if sustained  the head of Schlumberger said according to UPI  He said  The reduction in global oil inventories in the third quarter is clearly showing that the oil market is now in balance  which is reflected in the upward movement in oil prices over the past month  
Reuters reports that  Baker Hughes  CEO Lorenzo Simonelli was more pessimistic  saying the oilfield services industry continues to be volatile and describing the business environment as  challenging  with customers pushing out some equipment purchases   We have seen some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments   he said 
The FT also is reporting that shale oil firms are finally focusing on profitability and not just volume of production  That means that shale producers will reduce production until they can start making money  Yet even with the cutbacks there are rising production costs per well and a shortages of oil workers that are tired of getting hired only to be fired a few months later  The frac crews will now command higher wages and that will increase to cost per well 
It also means that it will be more difficult for frac producers to ramp up production  this should mean that U S  shale production will continue to be revised downward by major reporting agencies  We are still hearing reports that the production per well is falling 
This comes as global demand is red hot  Reuters reports China s oil demand remains voracious  hitting a January to September average of 8 5 million barrels per day  bpd   India s fuel thirst is also increasing  India imported a record 4 83 million barrels per day  bpd  of oil in September as several refiners resumed operations after extensive maintenance to meet rising local fuel demand  India s September imports stood 4 2 percent above this time last year and about 19 percent more than in August  ship tracking data from industry sources and Thomson Reuters Analytics showed 
With the U S  tightening  flows from Iraq reduced due to fighting between government forces and Kurdish groups  and production still being withheld as part of a pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and non OPEC producers to tighten the market  much will depend on demand going forward  Reuters reported that as of Sunday  oil exports from Iraq s Kurdistan via the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan were still flowing at sharply reduced rates between 200 000 and 250 000 barrels per day  two shipping sources said  Flows had increased slightly to 255 000 bpd by Monday  one source said  Typically  the pipeline transports around 600 000 bpd  Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al Luaibi said on Saturday oil exports were increasing from the southern Basra region by 200 000 bpd to make up for a shortfall from the northern Kirkuk fields 
In a landmark visit to Iraq  Saudi Arabia s Energy Minister Khalid al Falih praised the two countries  collaboration within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production in an effort to prop up prices  Iraq said the two countries would continue to cooperate in implementing decisions by oil exporting countries according to Reuters 
The market balance is here  While oil may be reluctant to breakout just yet  it will only be a matter of time  The so called seasonal slowdown in demand will soon be ending and we expect to see significant tightening of suppl  As we predicted the lifting of the U S  oil export ban was very timely and the US is now a major factor in the global oil export market  This will allow for more global economic growth as oil will get to where it need to be to foster growth ",2017-10-23,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/slowdown-in-shale-200220340,200220340

However  the gains were kept in check by concerns over a new wave of domestic shale oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market

credits   in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year ago figure of 25 cents The strong results were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the North American land market  This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq  where the company wrapped up major service contracts The oilfield service player expects activity in North America   where Schlumberger has a significant client base   to continue growing but cautioned that the rate might slow down from previous quarters on account of flattening rig count As of Sep 30  2017  the

research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Boeing s shares have surged  93 7  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace   Defense sector  which gained  43  during the same time period  Boeing is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue  orders and deliveries  and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors The company s 20 year market outlook  forecasts commercial jetliner demand to increase by 3 6   The single aisle jets are expected to be the major driver behind demand growth  Further  the company s defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs and strong order bookings However  the company continues to face challenges from order cancellations  stiff competition as well as falling delivery numbers  Boeing s 787 Dreamliner s deferred production cost also remains a cause of concern for the company  For its

company s dividend yield is higher than Zacks Oil Field Services industry However  lack of exposure to profitable U S  shale plays might reduce the number of oilfield service contracts for Schlumberger  Moreover  since 2015  long term debt at Schlumberger has been on the rise  Also  the company s cash balance has been going down steeply since the beginning of 2016  You can   JPMorgan s

37361,258876,SLB,How Trump s Decision On Iran Nuclear Deal Will Affect Energy,opinion,"U S  President Donald Trump is expected to decide on the fate of the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the close of business this week 
As per various reports  the American administration might  decertify  the 2015 accord   forged by then President Barack Obama   declaring that the Persian Gulf country is in breach of the spirit of the agreement  which no longer serves U S  national security interests  A declaration of that sort would then give Congress 60 days to decide on re imposing sanctions on OPEC s third largest oil producer 
The Iran Nuclear Deal
On Nov 24  2015  Iran reached a temporary accord with six world powers   the U S   Great Britain  France  Russia  China and Germany   to restrict its nuclear activities in return for the Persian nation s relief from international sanctions on oil  auto parts  gold and precious metals  Ultimately  the embargo was lifted in January 2016 after certification from the UN nuclear watchdog 
What Trump Wants Out of Tehran 
For long  Trump has been expressing his opposition to the Obama era agreement  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA   terming it as  catastrophic  with bad terms for the U S  His government now wants to delegitimize the pact in its entirety by asking for additional concessions from Iran on some key portions of the deal  The U S  President is also trying to curb Tehran s ballistic missile program  cyberattacks and support for terrorist groups   issues mostly outside the purview of the JCPOA 
Renewed Sanctions Will Amplify Iran s Struggles to Attract Foreign Capital
The 2015 deal was seen as a big win for Iran with the infusion of tens of billions of dollars into the Middle Eastern nation s hobbling economy in return for curtailment of its nuclear program and site inspections  However  the country is still struggling to attract foreign investment  which is way short of the level required for it to achieve its economic ambitions  Things may become even tougher if U S  President Donald Trump follows through with his rhetoric 
The non renewal of the nuclear deal will likely lead to tougher U S  restrictions against Iran  In particular  Trump s decision could choke off foreign investment the Islamic Republic needs to restore the health of its ageing oilfields and boost output following years of crippling earlier sanctions 
Scrapping of the Iran Deal Will Affect Energy Markets
Following the lifting of sanctions in January 2016  Iran s crude oil production and exports have been on a rise  As per OPEC s latest monthly report  the country s daily oil output reached 3 8 million barrels in September  of which around 2 3 million barrels were exported 
The current statistics marks a considerable jump from an average of around 2 8 million barrels per day in 2013 when Tehran was under international sanctions for its nuclear program  Exports languished at about 980 000 barrels per day 
Therefore  it s quite obvious that the return of sanctions would put pressure on Iran s energy industry and affect the oil market in general  
An American pullout of the nuclear agreement won t immediately curb the flow of the Gulf country s swelling crude exports as the U S  is not a buyer of Iranian oil  Moreover  it is also quite unlikely that Trump will get Europe or China   Iran s biggest clients   in reinstating the embargo on Tehran 
However  the U S  might threaten the buyers of Iranian crude or any company with major investments in the country s upstream sector  with financial penalties  This could force some of the companies  especially those with assets in the U S   scale back purchases investments out of fear of being kept out of the world s largest capital markets 
A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market  thereby boosting crude prices    
Which Companies Stand to Lose 
With the U S  still maintaining certain bilateral sanctions  domestic companies can t enter into physical partnerships with their Iranian counterparts  However  some U S  firms have been trying to bypass this by approaching the Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC    the Treasury Department s sanctions administrator   for licenses in specific sectors including oil and gas  provided these do not hurt U S  policy interests 
However  there is no such problem for European and Asian companies  who have already started negotiating with local players to expand and fortify their presence in the Iranian market  Biggies from across the pond like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and Eni SpA   NYSE E   are among the firms who have been shortlisted for work in the OPEC member s upstream sector oil and gas projects  Oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   is also in the fray to potentially develop Tehran s massive energy resources 
But it is French energy giant TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   that stands to be the biggest casualty  In July  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company announced that it has signed an agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company  NIOC  for the development and production of phase 11 of South Pars  SP11    the world s largest gas field  This project will have a capacity to produce 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day or 400 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate  You can see   
The development contract marked the reentry of TOTAL in this reserve rich Middle East nation  which it exited in 2006  TOTAL is the first among the global oil   gas major to strike a deal with the Iranian administration and begin work for the development of existing resources of Iran

37394,258909,SLB,Decent Oil Service Earnings Fail To Perk Up ETFs,opinion,"Oil price worries have been rife this year despite the ongoing OPEC output cut  The prolonged travails of the commodity oil saw a short lived reversal following the OPEC output cut deal signed late last year and the extension of the same this year  Against this backdrop  a close monitoring of the energy space that deals with the extraction of oil is warranted 
Presently  the Zacks Industry Rank for oil service companies is in the bottom 17   Thanks to a downbeat industry rank  energy investors should be on high alert this earnings season as everyone is keen on finding out where the space is heading  Let s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space 
In this piece  we have considered two stocks  namely   Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Among the duo  Halliburton reported earnings results on July 24 before the market opened while Schlumberger reported on July 21  read    
Results in Detail
Halliburton   the second largest oil service company   beat on both lines  Its adjusted income per share from continuing operations  excluding special items  came in at  0 23  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 19  Continued and effective cost management led to the outperformance  Halliburton posted revenues of  4 957 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 856 billion 
Schlumberger   the world s largest oilfield services provider   came up upbeat Q2 results  Earnings of  0 35 per share  excluding charges and credits  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 30 and the year ago figure of  0 23  Total revenue of  7 462 billion improved from the year ago level of  7 164 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 227 billion 
Market Impact
The space got mixed signals thanks to decent performances by industry bellwethers were outweighed by long standing oil price worries  We would like to note that in the OPEC and non OPEC meeting held   Saudi Arabia announced its plans to take further action to boost waning oil prices  The Saudi oil minister also noted that the country s oil exports would be fixed to 6 6 million bpd  which reflects a decline of almost a million bpd from last year s export level  With this  things might turn positive in the days to come  though we believe it is likely to take time 
Still  investors might want to know the impact on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies  Below we highlight three oil services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus following oil service earnings  see  here  
iShares US Oil Equipment   Services ETF  
This ETF invests about  195 3 million of assets in 35 securities  focusing solely on the energy world  The in focus SLB takes up the first position here with 15 87  of holdings  Generally  when one stock accounts for as much as 20  of an ETF s weight  its individual performance decides much of the fund s price movement  HAL takes up the second position with about 9 89  of total assets  read    
VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF  
OIH invests  1 0 billion of assets in 26 holdings and devotes as much as 19 54  of the portfolio weight to SLB  followed by 14 70  in HAL 
Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  
XLE invests  15 4 billion of assets in 36 stocks  The fund puts 7 51  of the portfolio weight in SLB  followed by 3 09  in HAL

37395,258910,SLB,Venezuela On The Brink  Opportunity For Oil Investors ,opinion,"Venezuela is sliding closer and closer toward the brink  and things look as if they ll get worse  unfortunately  before they improve 
A country that boasts the largest proven oilfield in the world should not be facing such dire food and medicine shortages  not to mention rampant protests and violence in the streets  But that s what happens when far left  authoritarian socialist regimes threaten to dissolve economic freedom  the rule of law and democracy itself 
As you might have heard  a vote passed in Venezuela on Sunday that could permanently amend the country s constitution for the worse  President Nicolas Maduro is now poised to become the world s next absolute dictator 
Last Wednesday  the U S  Treasury Department  on 13 current and former Venezuela government officials in an effort to encourage Maduro to drop the election  which let s be honest was likely rigged in his favor  According to Transparency International  Venezuela is among the  ranking 166 out of 176 in 2016 
 We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela  including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly as a result of today s flawed election   the  said in a statement issued Sunday 
So why am I telling you this  Again  Venezuela sits atop the world s largest proven oil patch  Crude accounts for roughly 95 percent of its export earnings  If Maduro does not relent  the U S  could very possibly target the country s oil industry next 
As Evercore ISI put it last week  the Treasury Department s decision is  the first step toward comprehensive sectoral sanctions  including crude oil imports into the U S  
This would be phenomenally disruptive to Venezuela s already fragile economy  Right now  the U S  is the country s top cash generating market  Unlike most other markets  the U S  pays its oil import invoices in full and on time  Venezuela could always boost exports to other existing clients  but the cash would dry up 
To be fair  such a move wouldn t be exactly painless for the U S  either  Venezuela is currently its third largest supplier of crude  following Canada and Saudi Arabia  Several large American producers  including Chevron  NYSE CVX   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   have joint venture contracts with Petroleos de Venezuela  PDVSA   the South American country s state run oil company  And a number of oil refineries in the U S  are equipped specifically to handle Venezuela s notoriously extra heavy crude 

Speaking to MarketWatch last week  Oil Price Information Service energy analyst Tom Kloza said the  possibility of chaos  in Venezuela  that the most recent global production cuts have failed to achieve  Despite the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC  December agreement to trim output in an effort lift prices  crude fell more than 14 percent in the first six months of 2017 and is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years 
Venezuela s vote this past weekend  followed closely by fresh U S  Treasury Department sanctions  could be the  only true element that would change the dynamic for crude   Kloza says 
Crude Gains on Inventory Draw
West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude climbed to a nearly two month high last week but not entirely in response to the upcoming Venezuela vote  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported that crude oil inventories  not including those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR   sharply fell 7 2 million barrels in the week ended July 21  Stocks now stand at slightly more than 483 million barrels  Although still historically high  inventories have now decreased for four straight weeks 

Last Tuesday  oil jumped 3 34 percent  its biggest one day gain since November 2016  The commodity is on track to have its first positive month since February 
Also supporting oil right now is speculation that domestic producers could soon start slashing capital budgets after months of depressed prices  Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  made headlines last week after becoming the first major U S  producer to announce cuts  The Texas based company plans to trim  300 million from its 2017 budget 
But don t expect domestic output to slacken anytime soon  In its Short Term Energy Outlook  released last week  the EIA forecasts crude production to reach a record high of 9 9 million barrels a day on average in 2018  That would push it over the previous record of 9 6 million barrels a day  set way back in 1970 

Not everyone agrees with this assessment  In a report last week  Capital Economics writes that 

 after more than a year of steady gains  the number of active drilling rigs will decline in the second half of the year  Accordingly  while mining structures investment probably posted another rise in the second quarter  these gains won t be repeated in the second half of the year  


It s important to remember  though  that a common theme among American frackers is that operations have become exceedingly more efficient than ever before  When oil prices collapsed more than two years ago and rigs were mothballed  output remained strong  So it s possible that even with fewer rigs actively pumping crude  and less capital going into mining structures  we could still see domestic production reach 10 million barrels a day by next year 
OPEC Compliance at Six Month Low
Obstructing price appreciation right now is news that a number of OPEC countries are not complying with production guidance laid out earlier in the year  The compliance rate fell from 95 percent in May to a six month low of 78 percent in June  with monthly output from Algeria  Ecuador  Gabon  Iraq  the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela totaling more than what should be allowed 
Meanwhile  Libya and Nigeria which are exempt from the OPEC agreement because recent political instability in those countries knocked out months  worth of production dramatically increased output that reportedly has Saudi Arabia worried 
Peak Oil Demand in 10 Years  Looking ahead on the demand side  we could see global oil consumption peak as soon as the late 2020s or early 2030s 
That s according to Ben van Beurden  CEO of Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa    van Beurden cited growth in electric vehicle sales as well as countries switching from fossil fuels to renewables as major catalysts that would trigger peak demand much sooner than previous estimates  Back in November  the International Energy Agency  IEA  said it didn t expect demand to peak 
But things are changing more rapidly every day  In June  Volkswagen  OTC VLKAY  the world s number one manufacturer by sales announced it would cease selling fossil fuel burning automobiles by 2020  Both France and the United Kingdom recently said gas and diesel cars would be banned by 2040  India  the fastest growing automobile market  set a similar target for 2030 
Even when oil demand peaks whether in 2030 or 2040 it won t  go out of fashion overnight   van Beurden said  Planes  ships and heavy trucks will continue using fossil fuels all around the globe  and smaller emerging markets will not be able to make the transition to renewables so easily as larger economies such as Western Europe  China and India 
 Supply will shrink faster than demand can shrink   he explained   and therefore  working on oil and gas projects will remain relevant for many decades to come  
Shell reported knockout second quarter earnings as cash generation rose sharply  The Anglo Dutch producer s earnings attributable to shareholders rose to  1 9 billion in the June quarter  a whopping 703 percent increase over the same period last year  Free cash flow stood at an incredible  12 1 billion  up from negative  3 1 billion during the same quarter in 2016

37396,258911,SLB,Is Schlumberger s Russian Deal In Trouble On U S  Sanctions ,opinion,Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited s   NYSE SLB   recent decision to acquire 51  stake in Russian drilling service provider  Eurasia Drilling Company Limited  might hit a rough patch due to the political turmoil between US and Russia  The tensions erupted after new sanctions were imposed by the U S   government About the SanctionsThe latest sanctions against Russia are the result of Moscow s alleged interference in U S  elections and target Russian energy export pipelines  The bill of the sanctions received major support from the Congress before it was signed by President Trump in Aug 2017  It bans U S  entities from providing goods  information  services  technology and support to energy export pipelines of Russia Their ImpactSchlumberger applied to the Federal Antimonopoly Service  FAS  of Russia seeking approval for the purchase in Jul 2017  after shareholders of Eurasia Drilling agreed to sell Schlumberger 51  of the total issued shares  However  the new sanctions may create a trade war and affect Schlumberger s future in Russia In this context  we would like to remind investors that several other U S  oil companies are also facing the uncertainty due to their link with Russia  For example  Chevron   NYSE CVX   and ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM   have   which uses a Russian pipeline The Failed First AttemptWe note that the latest deal is Schlumberger s second attempt to invest in Eurasia Drilling  The company tried to buy 45 65  of Eurasia Drilling s stake for  1 7 billion in 2015  However  FAS objected to the same as the watchdog thought that the deal could help Schlumberger gain control of Russia s biggest oilfield service providing company  What s Next In the current scenario  Schlumberger will require a special approval from the U S  Treasury  It s only after the approval from the U S  government that FAS will consider the deal  Even if the deal sees the green signal from the U S  Treasury  Russia s Natural Resources Ministry is likely to impose limits on Schlumberger s ownership due to the industry s strategic importance for Russia  We note that a clause in the deal indicates that Schlumberger will receive full control of Eurasia Drilling after three years of operation Importance of the Deal for SchlumbergerAlthough expanding shale production in North America is driving revenues  Schlumberger is facing pressure in international and offshore operations due to weak oil prices  Low oil price is acting as a hurdle for the company in Europe and Asia  The deal will help Schlumberger to penetrate these markets as it will renew the strategic alliance between Schlumberger and Eurasia Drilling that started in 2011 Completion of the deal will give Schlumberger access to Russia s hydrocarbon industry  which has witnessed sustainable capital spending even in a low oil price environment  Also  Schlumberger can receive benefits from Eurasia Drilling s operations that include over 650 offshore and onshore rigs  In the second quarter of 2017  the Russian company had drilled 421 wells About the CompanyHouston  TX based Schlumberger is a leading oilfield services company  providing technology  project management and information services to the global oil and gas industry  Schlumberger s reporting segments can be categorized under four segments  Reservoir Characterization  Drilling  Production and Cameron The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Price Performance Schlumberger has lost 21  of its value in the last six month compared with 29 9  decline of its   Another company operating in this industry is Subsea 7 SA   OTC SUBCY   One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-schlumbergers-russian-deal-in-trouble-on-us-sanctions-200207912,200207912
37397,258912,SLB,North Dakota Oil Output Drops But Stays Above 1M Barrels,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output fell 0 8  in Jun after dropping 0 9  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in Jun averaged 1 032 495 barrels a day  down 8 500 barrels a day from May 
Along with Oil  Gas Production Falls Too
While daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fifth month in a row  the small decline reflected in the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in the amount of oil extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  Interestingly  it must be noted that at the end of June  the state s total number of producing wells tallied 13 915  a new all time high 
With crude  natural gas output came down too   from May s record 1 853 528 thousand cubic feet per day to 1 849 807 thousand cubic feet per day  As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken  wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude  present gas flare rate of around 12   
Current Production a Shadow of Earlier Highs
Churning out as high as 1 227 483 barrels day in Dec 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  47 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb 2016  The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 
Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise Further
Some 55 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jun  up from 50 in May and Apr  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  North Dakota had just 28 rigs operating  A closely watched yardstick of oil industry s strength  the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production 
Notwithstanding recent gains  the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling  Moreover  with oil prices tumbling some 19  year to date  the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year  It s because the current crude levels just won t support any more drilling rigs 
Increase in Wells  Rig Count Offset by Lack of Fracking Crews
Even as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs  production is being stymied by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews  At present  there are just around 22 frack crews in the state  not even half of the number of rigs  In particular  major oilfield service providers like Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Baker Hughes  a GE company   NYSE BHGE   and Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   are struggling to get experienced  qualified workers following mass layoffs triggered by the three year crude slump  The ongoing labor shortage is primarily responsible for the recent drops in North Dakota s oil production numbers 
Shale Industry Caught in a  Catch 22  Situation
While more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota  the current sub  50 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable  And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U S  shale driven production 
Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques 
With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more 
In other words  the U S  shale  including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas  is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again 
What Lies Ahead 
The fall in Jun production assumes greater significance considering that the oil bust is now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018  In fact  with Jun production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark  there are chances that output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure toward the end of 2017 if prices fall under  45 a barrel and stay there for an extended period  But as of now  output should remain steady for at least the next two months 
Dakota Access Pipeline  Can It Revive Production 
While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018  there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output   the 1 100 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline 
Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L P  s   NYSE ETP    3 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration  As a result  disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  the sponsor brought the controversial conduit  in early Jun 
With the project s arrival  operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market  In fact  around 78  of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines  with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24  earlier in 2017 to less than 10  
Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  Set to carry about 500 000 barrels of oil daily  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output  the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins 
This  industry observers hope  will set the ball rolling for Bakken s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR   and EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG

37399,258914,SLB,ETFs To Watch On Oil Price Rise And Debt Limit Deal,opinion,"In a landmark deal  President Donald Trump sided with the Democrats to increase the debt limit and fund the government till mid December  Republicans had earlier rejected this proposal by the Democrats  Trump unexpectedly agreed to the deal disappointing fellow Republicans  who were pushing for a longer extension 
Debt Limit Deal
In a meeting with Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  Trump passed the deal to back a short term debt ceiling extension to fund the government till Dec 15  2017 and bundle a relief package for Hurricane Harvey victims 
House speaker Paul Ryan accused the Democrats of playing  politics  with the debt ceiling and stated that a short term extension would provide them with immense leverage over the Republicans  He also said that a faster recovery from Harvey would be doubtful with such a deal 
Trump s dealmaker title is being doubted by the markets now  Not only did he accept the short term  debt ceiling plan proposed by the Democrats  he also stated that he wanted to legalize the DACA program working closely with the opposition  The DACA program  which the Trump administration aims to phase out in six months  protects young immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents and allows them to work in the United States

37439,258954,SLB,What s In The Cards For Halliburton  HAL  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is set to release second quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 24 In the preceding three month period  the Houston  TX based company reported better than expected operating earnings on improved utilization from growing North American rig count The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  The company posted a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters  the average being 68 49   Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014 Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Factors to Consider This QuarterDrilling activities have increased of late due to an improvement in North American land market  This is likely to help Halliburton witness higher revenues in the domestic markets  During the second quarter  the count of U S  rigs have increased around 15  to 940  Over the last one year the U S  rig count has increased around 116   This increased rig count bodes well for the oilfield service player Halliburton  During the quarter  the international rig counts also rose by about 2   Halliburton  which generated 48  of its total revenue from international operations in the last quarter  is likely to benefit from the higher international rig count   President Trump s exit from Paris Climate accord also provided an impetus to drilling activities Moreover  the company s new CEO  Jeff Miller  is contemplating about raising the company s various services rates  which are likely to boost the revenues of the company  Halliburton expects the prices to increase by at least 10  and in some cases 20  or more this year During the quarter  the company acquired the Tulsa based Summit ESP  We expect Halliburton to gain from this acquisition given that devices manufactured by Summit ESP are in high demand and are being utilized by upstream energy players for extending the life of shale wells  The development is likely to help the company to earn significant cash flow for stockholders  However  the cost of acquisition may weigh on the financials of the company in the quarter  As it is  the company has weak financials with high debt and low cash reserves We appreciate Halliburton s successful cost management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices  However  with the rise in North America s shale oil patch activities  the company is actively engaged in increasing its headcount  Halliburton has increased its active fleet by 30   which required the company to increase employment by more than one third of its workforce to 2 700 workers in the Permian Basin  The increased costs on this account might adversely effect earnings Further  weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for oilfield services  During the second quarter  oil and natural gas prices fell 8 4  and 5   respectively  Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities  This could lead to lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of the oilfield services companies  This is also reflected in the share price of Halliburton which witnessed a decline of around 14  in the second quarter Halliburton Company Price    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings estimates

37440,258955,SLB,Halliburton Vs  Schlumberger  Which Is Better Pre Earnings ,opinion,"Analysts have made their predictions  Now it s time for the actual results  Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc    NYSE KMI   kicked off the energy earnings season when it reported second quarter results yesterday after the market close 
Now  it s the turn of the oil services companies   providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   to come out with Apr Jun numbers  which are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector s prospects in the near future  In particular  key oil services earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next  including Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    assume greater significance 
The world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is scheduled to report on Jul 21  while smaller rival Halliburton will release its second quarter earnings report on Monday  Jul 24  As such  this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  Both of them carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Let s dive in 
Schlumberger and Halliburton are both major players in the  industry  which is ranked a lowly 208 out of the 256 industries in our coverage  bottom 19    The broader  sector of which it is a part  is also staring down the barrel   currently sitting at the bottom of the Zacks Sector Rank  16 out of 16    To learn more visit    
Price Performance
Schlumberger and Halliburton shares have suffered this year  as have shares of all oil related companies  to reflect the commodity s price slide and uneven outlook  That said  both have done better than their peers  While the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services Industry has lost  28 4   Halliburton is down by just  15 7  year to date and Schlumberger has witnessed its share price decrease by  19 7  since Jan 

Earnings History and ESP
Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  As far as recent history is concerned  the TX based firm delivered earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 68 49   On the other hand  Schlumberger has delivered positive surprises in just two of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of a modest 4 55  
The situation does not change when considering  values as well  with Halliburton clocking in at  15 79  while Schlumberger s reading stands at  3 33   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Dividend Yield
Schlumberger s dividend yield over the last one year period is 2 97   higher than the broader industry s figure of 2 12   With a dividend yield of 1 58  Halliburton shareholders earn significantly lower dividend yield than Schlumberger as well as the industry at large 

Valuation
Compared with the S P 500  the Oil and Gas   Field Services industry is undervalued  This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future  The industry has an average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio   which is often used to value oil and gas stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses   of 8 56  which is below the S P 500 average of 11 01  Hence  it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry 

Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with an EV EBITDA ratio of 34 16 Halliburton is overvalued compared to the S P 500 and the industry  However  though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry and the S P 500  with an EV EBITDA ratio of 11 69  it defeats Halliburton decisively 

Investment Style
According to the Zacks   Halliburton has a Value Score of D  Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of A  This stock is therefore most suitable for growth and momentum investors 
Schlumberger has a Value Score of D  Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F  which means that the stock is best avoided 
Other Metrics
Schlumberger s expected EPS growth for  3 5 years  is 16 10   This is better than Halliburton s growth rate of 8 00  
Also  beta for Schlumberger is 1 02  which shows marginally less volatility than Halliburton s beta of 1 04 
Net profit margin for Schlumberger is 4 95   This is way better than Halliburton s net profit margin of  0 29  
Also  Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt to equity ratio of 0 40 compared with Halliburton s ratio of 1 20 
Conclusion
The comparative analysis shows Halliburton has witnessed a more favorable share price movement throughout the year  possesses a fantastic surprise history  which means it is more predictable  and boasts of a better style score  Additionally  it carries a much higher ESP reading of  15 79   as against Schlumberger s figure of  3 33 
However  Schlumberger is superior when considering dividend yield and valuation  Moreover  when considering EPS growth  profit margin and debt load  Schlumberger is clearly a better stock

This week is key because there will be a big cross section of names reporting earnings from many different sectors including the railroads  big industrials  technology and regional banks 
We should get a good look at the US and global economy through these reports this week 
It s not easy to beat the estimate nearly every quarter for years  But these companies have been doing just that 
Each has missed on earnings only once in the last 5 years  That s impressive  especially in some industries  like energy  where business has gotten shaky over the last few years 
Can they keep up their earnings streaks this quarter 
5 of the Best Earnings Charts This Week
1     CSX   NASDAQ CSX   has missed just once in the last 5 years and it was all the way back in early 2014  They kept their earnings streak alive despite falling rail volumes over the last year  The railroads are poised for a comeback  though  Will we see improved numbers this quarter 
2     Honeywell   NYSE HON   has one of the best looking charts on the Street yet it gets so little love from most investors  Shares are up 16 5  year to date  That s not too shabby for one of the  former  old school Dow Industrial components 
3     Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   has seen its shares sell off in 2017 on fears that crude may go lower again  Still  it has beat four quarters in a row  If you want to know what s going on in shale drilling  this is one to watch 
4     United Rentals   NYSE URI   is a Trump Trade stock  This equipment rental company would likely see big business if the infrastructure stimulus is passed  But how is business in the meantime 
5     Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   has missed only once in the last five years but shares have been on a roller coaster  Will this earnings report give it a boost 
 In full disclosure  the author of this article owns shares of URI in her personal portfolio

37524,259039,SLB,Can Power Generating Kites Disrupt Traditional Technology ,opinion,"According to Bloomberg  energy giants Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   and E ON SE  DE EONGn  are likely to start testing power generating kites in the U K  this summer  This disruptive technology   namely Kite Power Systems   KPS     has the potential to replace the traditional offshore wind turbines 
In Dec 2016  KPS raised  6 4 million from the three energy service providers  KPS will start testing the machinery in July or August in Scotland 
About the Technology
KPS is designing a 17 meters long device that can float on air currents  high above the sea level  The device will be able to produce renewable power by moving in a circular looping path and pulling a cable attached to a generator  The technology will be able to reduce the cost of offshore wind as the materials and maintenance tools for KPS are much cheaper than the conventional offshore wind turbines 
The system is expected to generate electricity 55 58  of the time  which is much higher than the existing wind turbines  KPS has developed a 500 kilowatt producing kite in the past and now working on its 3 megawatt version 
The technology is expected to generate 6 megawatts from each kite machine  With 3 gigawatts of existing offshore wind power generating systems set to be rendered obsolete in 2020  the grids and infrastructure are likely to be used by installing kites to generate power

37527,259042,SLB,There Will Be Blood In The Energy Sector,opinion,"The stark 2007 film  There Will Be Blood  featured one of my all time favorite actors  Daniel Day Lewis  as a self proclaimed  oil man  who comes to Little Boston  California to capitalize on the town s newly discovered oil reserves  As the movie s ominous title implies  the plan doesn t go exactly as expected  and the movie eventually culminates with a dark  bloody scene in a bowling alley  parental supervision strongly advised   
Lately  the fate of oil bulls has been similarly dark  Plenty of bullish blood has already been spilled in the oil market  and with Tuesday s drop to a new year to date low in West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude  the outlook looks likely to get worse before it gets any better 
The proximate fundamental cause for this week s drop has been news that Libya is pumping the most crude oil in four years after a deal with Wintershall AG enabled at least two fields to resume production  In addition  the amount of oil stored in offshore tankers reached its highest level of the year at 112M barrels  As any economics 101 student will tell you  a large increase in supply will inevitably push down price  cetis paribus  
Six weeks ago  we took a deep dive into the absolute and relative performance of the S P 500 s energy sector  see  XLE Bears Have All The Energy    At that point  we concluded that    w ith this year s breakdown from the 2016 s  bearish flag  pattern  the long term underperformance of energy stocks could carry over through 2017 and beyond   Updating the relative performance chart from that early May piece suggests that  if anything  the outlook for energy stocks has worsened with the latest drop in oil prices

Clients are still long the Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE   iShares US Energy  NYSE IYE  ETF s 
There were several seemingly bullish developments for Energy in the last few weeks and the price of crude oil continued to fall 
1   The IMF raised both the global GDP and the US GDP forecasts 
2   China growth came in stronger than expected last Sunday night  a pleasant surprise 
3   The API and EIA inventory showed bigger than expected draws the last two weeks  and crude oil did nothing  This week  gasoline showed a little bigger build than expected  which could be at the heart of the problem  but crude oil fell 3 5  Wednesday on very little news 
Clients are now more neutral weight Energy directly  but with General Electric Company  NYSE GE  being a top 10 holding  and clients now owning Emerging Markets to the tune of 5    7   including Brazil  there is still a correlation to Energy in client accounts that likely exceeds the 7  Energy market cap weighting in the benchmark 
This weekly earnings has a slightly different thread to it than typical Saturday posts  since as I thought about it this week  the correlations between the auto business  including Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   small long in Tesla   and Energy and Commodities and Emerging Markets was surprising 
President Trump and his team are expected to be out by the end of April with new emission standards for auto s but California  which is the largest state by car registrations  as I understand it  has already said that whatever the Federal government comes up with  California will adhere to Zero Emission Standards or ZEV s  zero emission vehicles as their goal  
The point is that about 50  of the demand for crude per the IEA is for gasoline distillation  so as long term gas demand declines as more EV s  electric vehicles  are on the road  in addition to potentially more supply as as the rig count rises every week  is perhaps why crude oil has continued to see selling as it trades into the mid  50 s 
Ford  GM  Chrysler  etc  supposedly wrote a letter to President Trump the day after the election requesting relief from the CAFE standards 
The point is with California going their own way on emission standards  the auto OEM s may go the way of the PC giants of the late 1990 s  i e  the market may make them obsolete far faster than their own lousy products of the last 30 years  and I actually think Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  and GM are making far better products today than at any point since the 1970 s   Long more GM than F  both of which report earnings this week  
And yet Ford s and GM s stock are trading poorly  possibly due to auto credit  falling used car pricing  etc  etc

We get a slew of Technology earnings Thursday night and I expect the quarter s to be fine  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  is always volatile around earnings   it seems like it is routine for the stock to be up or down  25    50 post earnings 
The point of this post today is that so much of the Energy Commodity Emerging Market returns starts with crude oil  Commodities and the EM s bottomed with crude in Q1  16 and then rallied for the rest of the year  If crude oil continues to slip  will the chain reaction begin again  
The stock market action this week  particularly the rally on  tax cut talk  tells me fiscal policy still matters  I just with the President and Congress would  talk less  and get on the same page

37564,259079,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  SLB   HAL s Q1 Earnings  CVX s Canadian Sale   More,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices suffered big losses 
On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   kicked off the energy earnings season  Importantly  both the companies indicated that activity in North America have improved but it would still take some time for international operation to rebound  Meanwhile  the second largest U S  based oil company Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   agreed to sell its Canadian oil refining and marketing business for  1 5 billion    
Overall  it was a brutal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures lost 6 7  to close at  49 62 per barrel  while natural gas prices fell 3 9  to  3 101 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Suffering its first loss in a month  oil prices were pressured by the U S  government data that showed a surprise build in U S  gasoline stockpiles   pointing to stuttering demand for the fuel in the summer driving season  The continued growth in U S  production and a burgeoning rig count   both pointing to the ever increasing shale drilling activities   further stymied the commodity 
Meanwhile  natural gas also turned lower following a larger than expected storage injection 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd  reported first quarter 2017 earnings of 25 cents per share  excluding charges and credits   in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This may be attributed to improvement in production of the Kuwait and Egypt developments and increase in directional drilling works in North America However  the bottom line decreased substantially from 40 cents per share earned in the year earlier quarter  Slowdown of drilling works in the international market resulted in the year over year deterioration While Schlumberger maintained that while the North American land market continued to recover both in terms of activity and pricing  another challenging year awaits the international markets   Read more    2     Smaller rival Halliburton Co  reported better than expected first quarter profit thanks to improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count  However  revenues of  4 279 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 281 4 million amid a difficult international market Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly  driven by increased activity  As it is  rig counts have generally been rising during the last ten months since plunging to an all time low of 404 in May 2016  with the addition of a flood of new units  As a proof of the recovery  Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 30  sequentially However  the international market recovery is set to start slower  with lower capex spend for the third successive year affecting economics across deepwater and mature field markets  To make things worse  the sluggish recovery and persistent pricing pressure are signs of another challenging year in the offing   Read more    3     California based integrated energy company Chevron Corp  is planning to divest its stake in Canadian downstream fuel

locations  Parkland will also acquire three terminals in British Columbia and a wholesale business which includes aviation fuel sales to Vancouver International Airport  Chevron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The agreement is well aligned with Chevron s strategy to improve its cash flow in 2017  The company is focusing on divestment opportunities to exit noncompetitive projects and cost and capex reduction which in turn will provide a more competitive and leaner business model for the company   Read more    4     Energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan Inc    NYSE KMI   reported first quarter 2017 earnings of 17 cents per share from continuing operations  The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents per share but increased about 42  from 12 cents reported a year ago The lower than expected earnings may be attributed to higher expenses and the negative impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016  However  the year over year improvement in the bottom line was driven by higher contribution from Elba Express pipeline along with improved CO2 volumes Kinder Morgan reaffirmed its dividend guidance  The company is likely pay dividends of 50 cents per share in 2017  It continues to expect EBITDA and distributable cash flow of about  7 2 billion and  4 46 billion

37609,259124,SLB,4 Energy Stocks Investors Should Avoid Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"With a market thumping 24  return   Energy  was the top performing S P sector in 2016  The incredible gains of last year stoked high expectations going into 2017 
Let s take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the first three months of this year 
Q1 Report Card  Prices Move Lower but Recover from Year Ago Lows
Despite hope offered by the biggest oil deal in a decade and a new pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  crude prices logged a loss of almost 6  for the first quarter as traders focused on the rising flood of U S  shale driven production  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more 
With the recent uptick in U S  shale production putting more pressure onto the market  oil ended the first quarter at  50 60 per barrel  5 8  lower than year end 2016 prices 
Natural gas fared worse  dropping more than 14  in the Jan Mar period  thanks to one of the mildest winters on record  A warmer winter translated into tepid requirement for the heating fuel and upended demand forecasts 
Despite the sequential fall  both oil and natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016  While crude slumped to a 12 year low  natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years 
Year Over Year Gains Leads to Bullish Expectations
Ending the dismal trend from the past few quarters  a look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector finally turned the corner  driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index 
The Oct Dec 2016 period turned out to be a rather good one with the OPEC deal and extreme weather conditions engineering a hefty rise in oil and gas prices during the fourth quarter 
A historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers saw oil prices end the year at  53 72 a barrel  representing a gain of 11 4  sequentially and 45  for the year  Meanwhile  natural gas embarked on its own upward journey  with futures jumping around 25  just in the fourth quarter  Ending the year at  3 724 per million Btu  MMBtu    up 59  from 2015   the heating fuel was buoyed by a cold snap that translated into strong demand 
As a result  following 8 back to back quarters of earnings declines  analysts said that the sector was likely to get better in the fourth quarter and clock its first positive earnings growth after 2 years  With estimate revisions going up following OPEC s Algeria grandstand  the Oil Energy sector s earnings were expected to improve 8 8  from the fourth quarter 2015 levels 
True to the predictions  the sector came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 index  total Q4 earnings were up 18 1  on 2 0  higher revenues 
The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q1 earnings season as well  This is not surprising  considering that oil and gas both fell to multi year lows in the year ago period  In fact  the  Energy  sector is set to turn around from a modest loss in the year earlier period to improving positive earnings this quarter 
Importantly  as per our  report  the aggregate dollar amount of earnings increase for the Energy sector is the highest of all 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy expected to earn a total of  8 1 billion in Q1 as against a loss  1 6 billion in the year earlier quarter  The top line is likely to show an impressive growth of 32 6  from the first quarter 2016 levels 
Not all Stocks Will Outperform Estimates
Sure  investing in companies that positively surprises estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat 
But  the flip side  not all energy companies will deliver positive earnings surprises despite the promising backdrop  And when a stock negatively surprises and its stock plummets subsequently  it can destroy a trade  set back an entire portfolio  and make a trader lose his confidence  Few things can decimate a stock like a negative earnings surprise 
Utilizing Zacks   system can greatly increase your odds of finding these potential underperformers before they report  And excluding these stocks from one s portfolio can actually increase return by minimizing losses  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Apart from Earnings ESP  we have relied on our proprietary  and  systems to help you avoid a few oil and gas companies this earnings season  Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  along with a VGM score of  D  or lower are best avoided  You can see

37610,259125,SLB,What s In The Cards For Schlumberger  SLB  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Oilfield services behemoth  Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   is expected to report first quarter 2017 earnings on Apr 21  before the opening bell Last quarter  the company s earnings of 27 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but decreased from 65 cents reported a year ago  Investors should note that the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Schlumberger N V  Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors to ConsiderThe recent agreement by OPEC and non OPEC players to cut oil production is expected to bring the much needed stability to the market as crude prices are set to improve significantly  Schlumberger will likely capitalize on this opportunity as it might get more contracts from drilling players to set up additional oil wells Moreover  the Schlumberger Cameron merger is likely to create technology driven growth by integrating the reservoir and well technologies of the former with the wellhead and surface equipment  flow control and processing technology of the latter  The results are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results However  shares of Schlumberger underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year  During the aforesaid period  the company s shares lost 1 8  compared with 0 5  decline for the broader industry  Also  the company saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter being revised downward in the last 60 days Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  7 69   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 24 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company stands at 26 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions   Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger  here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Antero Resources Corporation   NYSE AR   has an Earnings ESP of  100 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to release earnings on Apr 26  You can see  Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   has an Earnings ESP of  15 79  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings on May 4 Rowan Companies plc   NYSE RDC   has an Earnings ESP of  61 54  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings on May 2 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what's-in-the-cards-for-schlumberger-(slb)-in-q1-earnings-200183456,200183456
37611,259126,SLB,Will Halliburton  HAL  Q1 Earnings Reflect Rising Costs ,opinion,Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   is set to release its first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Monday  Apr 24 What Investors Need to KnowThe company has seen its shares fall 10 3  year to date after gaining more than 50  for 2016  Moreover  The Houston  TX based company has a poor industry rank  It is one of the major players in the  industry  which is ranked 149 out of the 256 industries in our coverage  bottom 42    Halliburton also has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   so fundamentals are pretty tepid for this stock To make things worse  it has an  F  for its  On an encouraging note though  the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  as you can see in the chart below Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    Also  Halliburton s unimpressive stock performance notwithstanding  the company has managed to beat the broader industry across the past six months  and 1 year periods Therefore  true to Halliburton s  Hold  rating  the signals are mixed and it seems as if it could be a rockier report than one might think Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider This QuarterThe oil services companies  like Halliburton    providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   kicks off what is expected to be a relatively good earnings season for U S  energy firms With U S  rig count falling to record levels last year  oilfield services players  like Halliburton  were hit hard  Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds However  as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up  the market for services companies is on the mend  Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014  spending on exploration projects have experienced a much awaited rebound  The energy explorers  buoyed by the jump in commodity prices  are set for improving sales and earnings   a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long struggling oilfield service providers We also appreciate Halliburton s successful cost management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices over a length of time  Last year  the company successfully implemented on its plan of pruning annual costs by  1 billion  In fact  Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage  mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less On the flip side  Halliburton has already warned that it is likely to  owing to rising costs mainly from reactivation of equipments and increase in headcount  Moreover  pricing pressure is expected to continue over the near term with the oil service companies dishing out some big concessions to producers in recent years Add to this project delays and job cancellations  which are likely to translate into margin contraction Therefore  notwithstanding the nice bump in oil prices  it will take some time for service providers to translate it into earnings gain Bottom LineIt is hard to bet against Halliburton when it comes to beating earnings estimates  given the company s impressive track record  Moreover  the company s recent share price weakness may render it attractive to the eyes of some investors  particularly those that are in the practice of buying beaten down securities with strong growth potential But with contract rates yet to improve sufficiently and a deteriorating credit metrics  it is hard to get excited by Halliburton ahead of their report either  The failed merger with Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   meanwhile literally burned a hole in Halliburton s stomach as it had to shell out  3 5 billion in termination fees   one of the highest in U S  corporate history   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  That is not the case here as you will see below     Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  25 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 3 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher  at 4 cents Zacks Rank  Halliburton has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton  here is one firm from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter RPC Inc    NYSE RES   has an Earnings ESP of  25 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is likely to release earnings on Apr 26  You can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars                                                                       Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply

  GM  strongly rejects the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities and will vigorously take all legal actions  within and outside of Venezuela  to defend its rights   it said in a statement  GM said the seizure showed a  total disregard  of its legal rights  and that authorities removed assets such as cars from company facilities

Oil companies like Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI   and Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   have shut down their rigs stationed in Venezuela in the past year  citing unpaid bills from the government  The country is home to some of the world s largest oil reserves  but because of its economic crisis  and these huge energy giants leaving  Venezuela s oil production is experiencing a sharp decline 
Companies like Oracle   NYSE ORCL    Ford   NYSE F    General Electric   NYSE GE    and IBM   NYSE IBM    among others  have all mentioned the dangers of exposure to Venezuela in earnings reports over the last two years  and many have stopped counting any revenue from the country

37647,259162,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Schlumberger  Halliburton Beats And Sees Drilling Upswing,opinion,"It was a week which saw oil prices hit a 15 month peak  while natural gas futures fell below the psychologically important  3 threshold 
On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   kicked off the energy earnings season with better than expected numbers  Importantly  both the companies indicated that their North American clients have returned to drilling this summer 
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged up 1  to close at  50 85 per barrel  natural gas prices plunged 8 9  to  2 993 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices notched up their fifth successive weekly gain as investors clung on to optimism generated by OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets next month 
Apart from the OPEC announcement  oil prices were also supported by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed that domestic crude stockpiles declined unexpectedly 
To a large extent though  the optimism was tempered by the Baker Hughes report revealing an eighth straight rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities
Meanwhile  natural gas turned lower following a higher than expected build  The commodity has also been hampered by a warmer than normal autumn weather that translates into weak demand 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     The world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd  reported third quarter 2016 earnings of 25 cents per share  excluding Cameron merger and integration charges   which came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents  Higher activities in the land market of the U S along with fracturing work recovery in North America led to the earnings beat  This clearly indicates that oil producers are putting more rigs in the continent again However  the bottom line decreased substantially from 78 cents per share earned in the year earlier quarter  Continual decline in deepwater operations led to the year over year deterioration Schlumberger expects the demand for oil to increase in 2017  According to the company the increase in demand as well as the OPEC s intention to cut crude production would lead to oil price recovery in the long run   Read more    2     Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company reported surprise third quarter profit on the back of continued and effective cost management  The world s No  2 oilfield services company s ninth consecutive quarterly outperformance was also helped by improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count  Halliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Halliburton s net income per share came in at 1 cent  contrary to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 7 cents  However  revenues of  3 833 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 897 million amid the oil slump Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the current industry upturn will boost rig count further  As a proof of the recovery  Halliburton reported 9  sequential growth in North American sales  However  most of this bullish sentiment was offset by lower business in other parts of the world  Halliburton warned that fourth quarter activity is likely to be weak due to holiday and seasonal weather associated disruptions  Moreover  pricing pressure is expected to continue over the near term with international business set to be flat sequentially   Read more    3     Denver  CO based oil and gas producer SM Energy Co    NYSE SM   agreed to acquire almost 35 700 net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas for a consideration of  1 6 billion in cash and stock  Simultaneously  the company decided to divest its resources in North Dakota s Williston Basin for roughly  785 million The acquisition plan reflects SM Energy s focus on increasing its resources in the most productive properties so as to be able to earn significant cash flows for shareholders in the long run  Notably  the latest deal  which is anticipated to complete in December this year  will increase SM Energy s asset base in the Permian Basin to 82 450 net acres We note that SM Energy has been selling assets that do not fit its portfolio to enhance its presence in the Permian Basin  In fact  a major part of the aforesaid Permian Basin acreage buyout will be funded using the proceeds generated from the sale of Williston Basin properties  The remainder will likely be financed from the company s revolving credit line   Read more    4     Brazil s state owned energy major Petrobras   NYSE PBR   agreed to settle four lawsuits by investors in New York federal court  The lawsuits   led by PIMCO Total Return Fund  et al   Dodge   Cox International Stock Fund  et al   Janus Overseas Fund  et al   and Al Shams Investments  et al   claimed losses resulting from a vast corruption scandal that engulfed the Rio de Janeiro headquartered company  The plaintiffs alleged that Petrobras gave false information to investors about the scope and scale of the graft scheme that has wiped billions of dollars in value from the company s books Following the settlement  Petrobras will include a  353 million provision in the third quarter to cover the costs  Denying all allegations of wrongdoing  Petrobras maintained that the settlement was meant at eliminating the uncertainties and costs associated with the litigations5     Integrated energy major Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  recently announced that its affiliate  Shell Canada Energy  has entered into an agreement to divest around 206 000 net acres of non core oil and gas properties in Western Canada to local natural gas producer Tourmaline Oil Corp  This sale is expected to garner more than  1 billion Per the Anglo Dutch energy giant  the proceeds comprise  758 million in cash and Tourmaline shares valued at  279 million  The deal is effective Nov 1 and expected is to close at the end of 2016 This sale is part of the Shell s plan to raise around  30 billion from assets sales in the three years through 2018 to help shore up its finances following its mega merger with BG Group  Notably  the merger with BG Group raised Shell s total debt level to  90 3 billion from  52 9 billion a year earlier   Read more

37648,259163,SLB,Merger Madness Continues With GE  Baker Hughes Oil Deal,opinion,"On Monday  manufacturing giant General Electric   NYSE GE   announced that it will be combining its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes   NYSE BHI    an oilfield services provider  in a move that both companies hope will combat the continued slump in oil prices 
The deal will create a newly publicly traded company  but will structure it as a partnership jointly owned by both GE s and Baker Hughes  shareholders  The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that the companies were in talks to merge 
GE will own 62 5  of the new company  while Baker Hughes will have 37 5  stake  After the deal closes  Baker Hughes stockholders will receive a special  one time cash dividend from GE of  17 50 per share  or about  7 4 billion 
In terms of revenue  the merger of GE Oil   Gas and Baker Hughes will create the second biggest oilfield services player in the industry after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB    In 2015  the two businesses had  32 billion in revenue  with operations in more than 120 countries 
 This transaction creates an industry leader  one that is ideally positioned to grow in any market   Jeffrey R  Immelt  the G E  chairman and chief executive  said in a    Oil and gas customers demand more productive solutions  This can only be achieved through technical innovation and service execution  the hallmarks of GE and Baker Hughes  
The merger between GE and Baker Hughes comes as North American oil and gas producers are gearing back up after an oversupply in the industry zapped prices  While global oil prices have risen to trade at around  50 a barrel this year thanks to expectations that OPEC could freeze or cut production it is still well below the highs seen back in 2014  where oil was going for over  100 a barrel 
Back in May  Baker Hughes was in the midst of a different merger  though with Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    another oil and gas industry giant  in a deal that would have been worth  35 billion  After a long regulatory review  as well as a lawsuit by the Justice Department on antitrust concerns  the transaction was called off 
The combined GE Baker Hughes company will have headquarters in London and Houston  Texas  Mr  Immelt will serve as chairman and Lorenzo Simonelli  who is currently the president and chief executive of GE Oil   Gas  will serve as president and chief executive of the new company 
Like any major merger  the deal is subject to regulatory approval and Baker Hughes  shareholders  It is expected to close by mid 2017 Centerview Partners  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   and the law firm Shearman   Sterling advised G E   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and the law firm Davis Polk advised Baker Hughes

37649,259164,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  XOM   CVX Beat Q3 Earnings  BHI To Merge With GE Unit,opinion,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices finished sharply lower 
On the news front  earnings from the top global integrated oil firms remained front and center as both ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   defied low crude prices to beat per share forecasts  In another important development  oilfield services major Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   is set to combine with the oil and gas business of General Electric Co    NYSE GE

Oil prices sank to their first loss in six weeks as investors remained anxious about the OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets  With divisions in the cartel becoming apparent  the future of the ambitious OPEC announcement looks more and more uncertain  Apart from Iraq s wish to be excluded from output curbs  indications of record output from the group also kept industry watchers on tenterhooks   
In fact  the pessimism surrounding the OPEC deal more than offset the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed a surprise fall in domestic crude stockpiles 
Meanwhile  natural gas also turned sharply lower despite an inline inventory build  The commodity was hampered by a warmer than normal autumn weather that translates into weak demand

37651,259166,SLB,The Season for Consolidation,opinion,"Last year saw a record number of mergers and acquisitions  M As   altogether valued at a monumental  4 78 trillion worldwide 
Since then  M A activity has sharply declined overall  with deals limited mostly to larger  multinational corporations  According to M A database group PitchBook itself to be acquired by Morningstar Inc  NASDAQ MORN  there were 31 deals with estimated values of at least  10 billion in the third quarter alone  more than the entirety of 2015 
Despite tightening regulatory and antitrust hurdles  more of these monster size deals are on their way  including stalwart American brands 
Reach Out and Touch Someone No doubt you ve heard by now that AT T  NYSE T  is about to get into the movie and television business  The Dallas based telecommunications giant announced last week that it would be purchasing Time Warner  the world s largest media empire  whose vast portfolio includes CNN  TNT and HBO  as well as reliable cash cows Harry Potter and DC Comics  home to Superman and Batman 
Barring any antitrust obstacles  the  85 4 billion deal is expected to close by the end of 2017 

The deal makes a lot of sense  People s viewing preferences are changing such that they re just as likely now to get their programming on WiFi enabled devices as they are via cable and satellite  Traditional TV still plays an overwhelmingly huge role in most of our lives  but with online streaming services such as Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime adding subscribers every day  more and more of the content we consume is migrating to laptops  smartphones and other non TV screens 
According to Pew Research  as many as one in four American adults now report being either a cord cutter or so called  cord never  someone who s never subscribed to cable or satellite 
This trend is turning up even in National Football League  NFL  ratings  Once believed to be immune to changing viewing habits  professional football viewership is actually down about 10 percent from last season  Part of this has to do with presidential election coverage  but it s also a function of games being streamed live on Twitter and other online channels  which takes market share away from TV networks 
This is all bad news for traditional cable and satellite providers  good news for AT T  which is betting hard that people s tastes will increasingly favor online content and distribution  The company is set to roll out a 100 channel   35 a month package called DirecTV Now  which will be delivered to you over the internet no cable box or satellite dish needed 
The AT T Time Warner deal was followed by news that General Electric  NYSE GE  would be combining its oil and gas business with Houston based Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI  
The resultant company 62 percent owned by GE  37 percent by Baker Hughes is expected to give GE a more cost efficient way to take advantage of a recovery in the energy space  It will also put it in a better position to compete against industry giants Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  
Both Time Warner and Baker Hughes stock saw significant pops following the announcements 

A Record Number of Failed U S  Deals These gargantuan deals follow a relatively tepid first half of the year  In the U S  alone  59 deals worth a combined  463 billion crashed and burned in the first half  the  according to Fox Business 
One of the biggest failed deals involved U S  drug maker Pfizer  NYSE PFE   whose attempted  160 billion acquisition of Ireland based Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  was scuttled by the Obama administration s anti inversion regulators in April  Halliburton and Baker Hughes were likewise  announced back in November 2014  Antitrust concerns also squashed the  6 billion merger between office supply rivals Staples Inc  NASDAQ SPLS  and Office Depot Inc  NASDAQ ODP  

Other factors that could have influenced M A activity include geopolitical uncertainty specifically  Brexit and the upcoming U S  presidential election 
A recent report from Chicago based law firm Baker   McKenzie estimates that the global M A market could see a deficit of up to  1 6 trillion in lost dealmaking opportunities  unless an orderly and swift Brexit process is followed   We already know the divorce proceedings will take two years 
How  orderly  they will prove to be is anyone s guess at this point 
And then there s the U S  election  Historically  M A activity has slowed during election years  especially when both parties nominate non incumbent candidates  as is the case this year  Companies have tended to put deals on ice until after it s known who will end up in office and what his or her policies will be 
But as we all know  this year has been anything but typical  That AT T  GE and others are willing to move ahead with their plans so close to the election shows how strong the need for consolidation is right now

Adding to the pessimism was the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed a record build in domestic crude stockpiles

The annual EPS estimates at the top of today s blog show that the overall S P 500 earnings growth has been flat for three years now  and is poised to materially break out to the upside  earnings growth  that is  
Here is our 2017 prediction for the S P 500  and nothing has changed since  although President elect Trump s priorities and the potential for a  cross border  tax make me nervous  There is a lot of optimism built into the Congressional and Republican agenda for 2017  and President elect Trump has shown he can be unpredictable ",2017-01-15,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekly-earnings-update:-expect-strong-q4-’16-sp-500-earnings;-likely-up-200172410,200172410

37656,259171,SLB,Market Lulls As President Trump Takes Office,opinion,"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher  the brewer  or the baker  that we can expect our dinner  but from their regard to their own interest    Adam Smith

As the world anticipated the Dow breaking past the 20K mark  the index has not been able to surpass the momentum to overcome the nice round number  The failure can be attributed to anything one might seem logical  valuation  season  lack of earnings power  political uncertainty  national debt  interest rates  etc  etc  Still  some view the inability to break through as a major problem  others see it as a temporary obstacle which inevitably will be eclipsed 
Early last week  Janet Yellen indicated she thought interest rates might see some strengthening during the rest of 2017  maybe even up to as many as three increases  Mrs  Yellen s interest rate policy is going in the opposite direction than most of the rest of the world  intending to normalize the cost of money as a way to preempt possible inflation  In doing so  the actions of the Fed are consistent with Mr  Smith s famous quote about self interest  a bedrock principle of economics  As you will see later  there is another person who believes in Adam s philosophy 
In other interesting developments last week  investment bank and scourge of the earth  according to Bernie and Elizabeth  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  posted strong earnings on the strength of improved fixed income results  US Bank  a solidly run  large regional bank  also turned in steady results by meeting expectations  United Health Group  the largest health insurer in the country  showed the losses from being involved with the exchange business aren t hurting shareholders much 
If you are a small business  you know you can count on health insurance premiums going up every year by nearly 10   and in some cases a heck of a lot more  IBM  NYSE IBM  beat expectations but has seen revenues decline for many quarters as the enterprise computing space gets even more competitive thanks to the cloud  At the end of the week  Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   Proctor  and Slob  Schlumberger   NYSE SLB  also met consensus estimates  You can see it was a full week on the earnings front  and next week the whole corporate world reports  so there is plenty to watch on that front 
Yesterday s peaceful transition of power between the outgoing and incoming president elect was memorable  as almost all inaugurations are  The traditions and pageantry of the ceremony are remarkable in their enduring nature  It is also always interesting to see the raw emotions of the political actors who all show up to display their envy  disappointment  Hillary   jealousy  other Republicans   and maybe even anger  Bernie  at the ultimate winner 
In this case  Donald Trump took the oath of office and made a  muscular  speech detailing the dominant theme of his administration   America First   In it  clearly self interest lies at it s heart as contrary to the belief of the outgoing leadership  there are plenty of issues in the country which need to be addressed  Now  as was the case hundreds of years ago  one s own welfare remains at the center of economics

37691,259206,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  RSP Permian s  2 4B Buy  Chevron s Bangladesh Exit Plans,opinion,"It was a week which saw oil prices hit 1 year peak  while natural gas futures soared to their highest level since Dec 2014 
On the news front  independent oil and gas player RSP Permian Inc    NYSE RSPP   agreed to acquire private equity backed producer Silver Hill Energy Partners for  2 4 billion in cash and stock  while supermajor Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   is looking to raise around  2 billion by selling its Bangladesh natural gas assets 
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 1 1  to close at  50 35 per barrel  while natural gas prices rallied 2 9  to  3 285 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices notched up their fourth successive weekly gain as investors clung on to optimism generated by OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   whose member nations supply around 40  of the world s crude  said it would cut production by as much as 750 000 barrels a day starting in November in order to keep oil prices from falling further  The group also claims to have firm commitments from non OPEC biggies like Russia to participate in a collective effort to cut the supply glut 
Apart from the OPEC announcement  oil prices were also supported by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed that domestic crude production declined to a level not seen since Jun 2014 
Meanwhile  natural gas raced to a 22 month high following another thinner than expected build   the 23rd in a row  The commodity was also buoyed by a government report that lifted price forecast for 2016 and 2017 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Upstream energy player RSP Permian Inc  announced its decision to acquire Silver Hill Energy Partners  The transaction value has been estimated at roughly  2 4 billion that includes both cash and stocks  The move reflects RSP Permian s intention to expand its resources in the Permian Basin in Texas  RSP Permian currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Silver Hill Energy has controlling interest in 68 000 gross  41 000 net  acres within the Delaware basin that contributes to about 15 000 net barrels of oil equivalent every day  BOE D   RSP Permian already operates huge acreages in the Midland Basin that cover almost 63 000 net acres of land  The acquisition will now give the company access to 3 200 gross undeveloped areas in the Delaware  Silver Hill Energy also owns 58 producing wells  of which 49 are horizontal The Permian Basin acreage is one of the cheapest for developing U S  onshore oil fields  Hence  RSP Permian s decision to acquire more properties in the region is undoubtedly a prudent one  According to media reports  this deal will likely boost production of RSP Permian by almost 50    Read more    2     Chevron Corp   the second largest U S  oil producer  confirmed that it is contemplating the sale of its natural gas assets in Bangladesh to counter weak commodity prices  The assets that are likely to be sold produce natural gas and condensate from three fields in the northeast of the country In Bangladesh  Chevron operates the Bibiyana  Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields  The company sells all the production to state oil company Petrobangla  Its net daily production last year averaged 720 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3 000 barrels of condensate As per reports  Chevron is seeking about  2 billion from the potential sale of natural gas assets in Bangladesh  Notably  the proposed sale has drawn interest of several Indian and Chinese oil producers   Read more    3     British oil major BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   announced its decision to discontinue exploration drilling program in the Great Australian Bight   GAB    offshore South Australia The appraisal and evaluation of BP s upstream strategy in early 2016 led to this move  BP believes that  in the near future the GAB project will not be competitive enough for as much capital investment as other upstream opportunities in its global portfolio BP has also discussed this with its joint venture partner Statoil  OL STL  ASA  The latter has displayed a complete understanding of BP s change in strategic direction and accepted its decision BP was rewarded exploration licenses for four blocks in the Ceduna area of the GAB in Jan 2011  The company acquired seismic data in the area in the period between late 2011 and early 2012  In 2013  Statoil farmed in 30  in the licenses  while BP remained the operator with an interest of 70    Read more    4     Downstream operator Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   entered into an agreement with its master limited partnership Phillips 66 Partners L P  to drop down properties worth  1 3 billion to the latter Phillips 66 would give 30 assets that comprise crude pipelines  refined products and natural gas liquids pipelines and terminal systems  The agreement includes units supporting the parent company s refineries in Bayway  New Jersey  Billings  Montana  Borger  Texas and Ponca City  Oklahoma This apart  Phillips 66 will enter into a decade long terminaling and throughput agreements that will include minimum volume commitments covering about 85  of expected volumes  On completion of the deal   expected sometime in Oct   the partnership will be entitled to receive cash earnings related to the acquired assets as of Oct 1  2016   Read more    5     Italian energy company Eni SpA   TO E   announced that the first batch of export crude oil has been dispatched from the onshore processing plant of the massive Kashagan oil field The field was re opened a little while back  upon successful replacement of pipelines  Production is now estimated to increase up to a first level of 180 000 barrels per day  The consortium for the development of Kashagan aims for a production level of 370 000 barrels per day by the end of 2017 Located in the North Caspian Sea  the giant oilfield is about 80 kilometers southeast of Atyrau  in Kazakhstan  Kashagan is one of the largest oil fields discovered in the last four decades and is estimated to hold reserves of 35 billion barrels of oil in place  In fact  the oil field is considered to be one of the most complex and challenging industrial projects worldwide in terms of its size  the specifications  as well as the environmental and logistical characteristics involved Kashagan is operated by NCOC  North Caspian Operating Company  which operates within the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement  NCSPSA   Eni has a stake of 16 81  in the project   Read more    
Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months Notwithstanding the past week s increase in oil prices  the reaction in energy stocks was negative  As a result  over the course of last week   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  was down 1 45   Consequently  investors witnessed selling in most market heavyweights  The worst performer was Houston based oil and gas finder ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   whose stock price fell 5 27  
But longer term  over the last 6 months  the sector tracker has gained 7 54   Oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   was one of the major beneficiaries during this period  experiencing a 4 56  price increase

This is especially true given the latest talks of OPEC curbing the production limit in the November meeting and a 9 9  jump in WTI crude ETF United States Oil  NYSE USO    V USO   and an 8 1  advancement in Brent crude ETF United States Brent Oil   AX BNO   in the last one month  as of October 20  2016   read

Results in DetailHalliburton   NYSE HAL     the second largest oil service company   came up with a mixed Q3 on October 19  2016 wherein earnings of  0 01 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 07  Revenues of  3 833 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 897 billion amid the oil price slump 
Shares were up 4 3  in the key trading session following the declaration of results  Halliburton indicated that the current industry uptrend would boost rig count further  Halliburton reported 9  sequential growth in North American sales that was mostly pared down by a 6  sequential decline in international revenue  HAL has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  On October 20 after the closing bell  Schlumberger   NYSE SLB     the world s largest oilfield services provider   came up with a mixed Q3  Adjusted earnings came in at  0 25 per share  which edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 22  However  earnings fell 68  from the year ago level 
The total revenue of  7 019 billion declined 17  year over year and fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 130 billion  However  the company sounded hopeful on the future movement of oil prices as it indicated that  the supply and demand of crude is now more or less balanced    read    
Reducing petroleum inventory levels and the beginning of persistent drawdowns toward the end of the quarter mainly in North America should help the oil price movement  Plus  if the OPEC decides to cut the output level in November  that would offer the oil patch a shot in the arm 
But management also indicated   In terms of 2017 E P investment  visibility remains limited as our customers are still in the planning process   Financial strain is rife in the industry  though activity may tick up in North America land  the Middle East and Russia markets next year  Shares slumped only 0 02  after hours  read

37734,259249,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Rice Energy s Acquisition  Schlumberger s Venezuela Contract,opinion,"It was a week which saw oil prices retest the psychologically important  45 per barrel level  while natural gas futures briefly climbed to a 20 month high 
On the news front  domestic energy explorer Rice Energy Inc    NYSE RICE   has struck a deal to buy fellow independent Vantage Energy for approximately  2 7 billion  while oilfield services major Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   won a huge new contract with Venezuela s state oil company 
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 2  to close at  44 48 per barrel  while natural gas prices edged up by a meagre 0 2  to  2 955 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices notched up a weekly gain after the U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop  As per the federal government s EIA report  oil inventories decreased by a massive 6 2 million barrels for the week ending Sep 16  2016 
A relatively strong refining activity for this time of year led to the big stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer  Following the third consecutive unexpected weekly inventory decline  the current supplies   at 504 6 million barrels   are at their lowest level in 7 months 
Apart from the bullish government data  oil prices were also supported by the decision by Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates  As widely expected  the U S  central bank opted to leave the current 0 25 0 50 rate unchanged  This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency 
The commodity was also helped by heightened expectations that prominent oil producing countries may make headway on a production freeze deal  Statements made by various members of OPEC over the weekend suggested that an agreement could be arrived at Oils Energy Sector Price Index

Meanwhile  natural gas eked out a miniscule gain following another below average build   the 20th in a row   which further narrowed the supply overhang  But to a large extent  this was offset by predictions of tepid demand with sudden change in forecasts that showed cooler weather ahead

37735,259250,SLB,Will OPEC Ever Really Agree To An Oil Production Freeze ,opinion,"This Wednesday  OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria  As they did in Doha last spring  members plan to discuss a potential oil production freeze 
Rumor  rhetoric  and innuendo about this oil freeze has overshadowed almost every other energy related issue since the meeting was scheduled  Oil markets rose on Monday as OPEC members arrived for the start of the IEF conference  The instigation of this price gain was a hope that OPEC will reach an agreement to cap production 
Investors  however  should be prepared for a let down  Despite the mood of cautious optimism in Algeria  the key players have little incentive to make a deal at this point  Indeed  most of OPEC and other major oil producers are preparing for a future of continued production expansion 
Here is rundown of the position of each key player and the likelihood that that country will support a freeze on oil production 

Algeria  1 01 million bpd
Algerian oil minister Nouredine Bouterfa has been spouting some very optimistic rhetoric  Specifically  he has said that Algeria will propose that OPEC reduce production by 1 million bpd  He has been trying to use Algeria s presence as host country to push a deal forward  but none of the other OPEC members seem to be taking him as seriously as the oil market  Algeria produces less than every other OPEC member except Indonesia and Gabon and  therefore  has very little clout in the organization  Bouterfa s bluster is at least partially directed at the Algerian populace to position himself as a strong leader who is doing his best to improve its economy  Meanwhile  Algeria is proceeding with plans initiated over the summer to increase its own production 
Position  Algeria will support a freeze deal but its resolution to cut OPEC production will not be successful 

Venezuela  2 1 million bpd
President Maduro supports an oil freeze deal and told reporters last week that a market stabilizing deal is  close   Venezuela s oil production has actually decreased since oil prices collapsed  because the country cannot afford the electricity needed to keep up oil production  Despite the fact that the country lacks enough food to feed its citizens  Venezuela recently signed a new contract with   NYSE SLB  to drill 80 new oil wells in the Orinoco Belt  The ambition is for this endeavor to add 250 000 bpd to Venezuela s output by 2019 
Position  Venezuela may say a deal is  close   but the government is making plans to increase production  Venezuela will support freezing production for the short term price increase that would result  but its long term plans are to increase production 

Iraq  4 35 million bpd
Iraq claims it supports an oil freeze deal but with a big caveat  Iraq seeks an exemption from any production freeze because of its years of war and current conflict with Isis  Iraq seeks to increase its production to at least 5 million bpd and recently signed an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government to resume exports from areas under Kurdish control 
Position  Iraq could be convinced to join a production freeze if OPEC reaches a consensus  because it is currently OPEC s second largest producer  If production is frozen at current levels  Iraq will not have to worry about Iranian production usurping its market share  However  if other nations demand exemptions  then Iraq will join them 

Iran  3 6 million bpd
President Rouhani s recent  reveal Iran s position on a potential oil freeze deal 

 Instability and falling oil prices are harmful to all countries  especially oil producers  Tehran welcomes any move aimed at market stability and improvement of oil prices based on justice  fairness and fair quota of all the oil producers  

This means that Iran supports a deal in which other OPEC nations freeze their production while Iran increases its own production  Iran s position is that  justice  and  fairness  would provide it an exemption because of the sanctions it faced for years 
Over the past year  Iran has said that it seeks to increase production back to its pre sanctions levels   around 4 million bpd  Since Iran is reportedly on the cusp of this number  many analysts believe that the country is ready for a deal  This is not the case 
Recently  Iran revealed much    of at least 5 million bpd  Now that the Iranian government approved a new  slightly more promising model for foreign companies to invest in Iranian oil development  Iran has no desire to restrict its production  Not only that  but the country recently turned down an offer from Saudi Arabia to cut its own oil production if Iran would agree to freeze production at 3 6 million bpd 
Position  Iran will only support a freeze deal if it is granted an exemption 

Saudi Arabia  10 7 million bpd
Since Saudi Arabia s meeting with Russia  on the sidelines of the G20 conference  oil minister Khalid al Falih has said very little on the subject of a production freeze  The Russian Saudi meeting  a short spike in oil prices when investors thought they would announce a freeze 
However  oil prices immediately fell back down when it became clear that the agreement they signed fell considerably short of that  Just last week  al Falih met with his Iranian counterpart at OPEC headquarters in Vienna  and the Saudis offered to cut oil production back to January levels  This was Saudi Arabia offering to cut oil production to non summer levels  just as the end of summer approaches and the Saudis need less oil domestically to power their air conditioners  
In exchange for this  cut   al Falih sought an Iranian production cap of 3 6 million bpd  Iran rejected the offer  The parties also disagreed on how production would be measured  Iran wanted to self report while Saudi Arabia demanded an independent source to verify the numbers  This suggests that even if Iran had agreed  it had no intention of complying 
Position  Saudi Arabia does not see an imperative to freeze production at this time  The country will most likely support a production freeze  but only if all OPEC nations and Russia join  Saudi Arabia would not support any exemptions for other countries and would demand independent verification 

Russia  11 9 million bpd
At the beginning of September  President Putin expressed support for a Russian   OPEC oil production freeze with an exemption for Iran  Since then  however  Russia has walked back that position 
Oil minister Alexander Novak is attending the IEF conference but may leave before the OPEC meeting even takes place  He has stated that Russia will not consider a production freeze unless OPEC resolves its internal divisions on the subject  Meanwhile  Russia is planning new investments to increase oil recovery in its older  so called  brown   fields  In addition  Rosneft  MCX ROSN  and Gazprom Neft  MCX SIBN  plan to drill new wells in areas considered  hard to recover  
Despite the increased expense  these firms believe such wells will be profitable even if oil remains in the  40 a barrel range  Russia recently stated that it sees no need for an oil freeze and Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev said that the country should prepare its  for the next three years based on a price of  40 a barrel   Note  though Russia is not an OPEC country  its participation would be vital to any freeze because of its production volume  its competition with Saudi Arabia for sales in key markets  and its relatively centralized control of ostensibly private oil companies  
Position  Russia does not have high hopes for an OPEC consensus and is not particularly interested in joining a freeze deal even if OPEC reaches one  Even if a freeze materialized  Saudi Arabia would remain suspicious of Russia s intentions to comply given Russia s support for Iran ",2016-09-27,"Ellen R.

37737,259252,SLB,Halliburton  HAL  Q3 Earnings Preview  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  Oct 19 
What Investors Need to Know
The company s stock performance has been pretty exciting lately  Shares are at fresh highs these days  and the stock has recovered nicely from its rough start to 2016 when oil prices fell to a 12 year low 
In fact  Halliburton has run up 14  in the past month thanks to commitments by OPEC and non OPEC players to slash production targets   but this report will be a test if this trend can continue heading into 2017 
The world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   also has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  as you can see in the chart below HALLIBURTON CO Price and EPS Surprise

   However  there are some questions for Halliburton too  The company has a terrible industry rank   in the bottom 35  overall   while it has an  F  for its VGM score 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
The oil services companies  like Halliburton    providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   kicks off what is expected to be another tough earnings season for U S  energy firms 
With U S  rig count falling to record levels  oilfield services players have braced themselves for a prolonged period of contraction in drilling activity  Moreover  as the 2016 budget cycle represents a further fall in upstream players  capital spending  product and service pricing will suffer  This is particularly true for the independent exploration and production firms that dominate the shale plays  Add to this project delays and job cancellations  which are likely to translate into margin contraction  Needless to say  profitability levels will suffer 
Therefore  notwithstanding the nice bump in oil prices  it will take some time for service providers to translate it into earnings gain 
Bottom Line
It is hard to bet against Halliburton when it comes to beating earnings estimates  given the company s impressive track record  Moreover  the company s recent share price rally may render it attractive to the eyes of some investors  particularly those that are in the practice of buying securities with strong momentum 
But with onshore service business yet to bottom and a poor industry outlook  it is hard to get excited by Halliburton ahead of the report either  A sequential decline in revenue and operating income reflects the company s struggles  The failed merger with Baker Hughes Inc    NYSE BHI   meanwhile literally burned a hole in Halliburton s stomach as it had to shell out  3 5 billion in termination fees   one of the highest in U S  corporate history    
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of 6 cents 
Zacks Rank  Halliburton has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton  here is one firm from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
CONE Midstream Partners L P    NYSE CNNX   has an Earnings ESP of  2 7  and a Zacks Rank  1  The partnership is likely to release earnings on Nov 4  You can see

37738,259253,SLB,Big Jump In SPX Forward 4 Q EPS Growth Rate,opinion,"It was one year ago almost exactly the S P 500 was in the midst of a powerful rally  after the China yuan devaluation  that started late July  2015 
The rally started on  nonfarm payroll Friday  in early October  15  with the S P 500 opening lower on a weak September  15 jobs number  and then reversing higher  and the subsequent rally then carried through to mid to late November  15  and lasted 6   7 weeks 
Then  the final commodity flush started 
After topping out the first week of November  15  the Energy ETFs and crude oil started their final collapse into the January 21   February 15   16 flush  The Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE  peaked near  72 in the first week of November  15 and 6   8 weeks later was trading near  50  eventually bottoming there   See chart below  
High yield spreads started to widen substantially  through February  16 
Commodity prices and Emerging Markets also started their final crescendo into the early  16 bottom 
The bank stocks were crushed in late  15   early  16  I wrote at the time about a client that was a leasing officer in a major Chicago bank  where the OCC  why    came through and told the bank to write down their Energy credits loans to zero  whether performing or not   Presumably  if this was being done at one bank  by the regulators  it was being done at others  
Crude oil bottomed near  28 in Q1  16  basically wiping out the sector s profits entirely in Q1  16 
Early  16 was the start of what is now called the Great Rotation  commodities were at the bottom of the  asset class  return tables  from 2011 through 2014  as well as Emerging Markets  and now that has begun to shift 
The point of this mini history lesson is that we are now starting to lap these comps as we roll into the last 10 weeks of 2016 and head into early  17 
Here was  in late 2015  expecting a 10  return for the S P 500 in 2016  I still think we get there by December 31  16 
Thomson Reuters S P 500 earnings data  by the numbers   
Forward 4 quarter estimate   129 22  down slightly from last week s  129 54

S P 500 earnings yield  6 06   some nice rallies have started when the S P 500 earnings yield has ended the prior week over 6 
Year over year growth of forward estimate   3 26   and the highest print since early January  15 s 5  growth rate 
Conclusion  To be upfront with readers  I thought this acceleration in the y y growth rate of the forward estimate  would have started a year ago  but the October  15 through Jan  16 flush in commodities  particularly crude oil  delayed the ramp considerably  Q3  16 Energy earnings growth is expected to decline 70  y y  but Q4  16 is expecting flat growth  see    Energy earnings start this coming week with Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   no positions   which is the most stressed of the Energy sector  i e  the services companies with  deep water  segments   Schlumberger  and Halliburton are in a better competitive position than Transocean  NYSE RIG  and Diamond  NYSE DO   the two latter companies being deep water drillers  which are thought to be in secular decline  
Bottom line  S P 500  forward  earnings growth should start to improve and take out the early  15 high of  5   over the next 6   9 months  or through Q2  17 earnings 
 One interesting tidbit  Thomson Reuters puts out the  This Week in Earnings  report on Friday night of each week  but cuts off the data as of Thursday night  Hence  this weeks  forward 4 quarter  estimate  does not include the major bank results of Friday morning  October 14  16  Nor does the  Financial Sector  expected earnings growth for Q3 and Q4  16  incorporate Friday morning s bank results  Currently Q4  16 Financial sector growth is  15    pretty good for the Financial sector   that could get revised higher this coming week  It s been a long time since investors have seen a bank rally supported by earnings and revenue growth  ",2016-10-16,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-jump-in-sp-500-“forward-4-quarter-eps-growth-rate”--sp-500-earnings-200158966,200158966

37804,259319,SLB,What s In Store For SLB   Other Oil Stocks In Q2 Earnings  ,opinion,Crude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 in February as investors panicked over the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and contracting producers  profit margins However  indications of easing supply helped oil prices to rebound some 90  since then and took the commodity past  50 The surge in the benchmark crude was driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude The upward pressure in oil prices also reflect the U S  Energy Department s recent inventory releases that show crude stockpile builds turning into draws Q2  Best Quarter for Oil in 7 YearsUnlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with crude advancing more than 26  sequentially    the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  40 and  50 per barrel All s Not Well for Oil Despite oil s massive recovery since February  its price is still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  Therefore  the commodity is not yet out of the woods Even the industry  which is cutting deeper  seems to think so  Companies around the world continue to slash jobs  defer cancel projects worth billions of dollars and renegotiate contracts with suppliers to help protect their balance sheets Consequently  things are looking bleak for the upcoming Q2 earnings season  Per our  report  the Oil

services companies   providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   kicks off what is expected to be another tough earnings season for U S  energy firms With U S  rig count falling to record levels  oilfield services players have braced themselves for a prolonged period of contraction in drilling activity  Moreover  as the 2016 budget cycle represents a further fall in upstream players  capital spending  product and service pricing will suffer  This  coupled with project delays and job cancellations  is likely to translate into margin contraction  Needless to say  profitability levels will suffer Therefore  notwithstanding the nice bump in oil prices  it will take some time for service providers to translate it into earnings gain Get Ready for 5 Big

37806,259321,SLB,After Earnings  What s In Store Oil Service ETFs ,opinion,"A lot is being said about oil price recovery over the last few months  Oil prices  in fact  have recovered significantly after the acute plunge it took earlier in the year  The recent rebound in oil prices came in mainly on reducing supply glut  Against this backdrop  a close monitoring of the energy space that deals with the extraction of oil is warranted  read    
Presently  the Zacks Industry Rank for oil service companies is in the bottom 45   Thanks to this outright bearish backdrop  the sector is grabbing investors  attention this earnings season as everyone is keen on finding out where the space is heading  Let s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space 
In this piece  we have considered two stocks  namely   Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL    Among the duo  Halliburton reported earnings results on July 20 before the market opened while Schlumberger reported the next day after the market closed 
Results in Detail
Halliburton   the second largest oil service company   came up with narrower than expected second quarter 2016 loss  Nevertheless  lower pricing and reduced global activities   especially North American pressure pumping works   hurt results significantly over the year ago quarter 
Loss per share from continuing operations came in at  0 14  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 19  But the company had posted profits of  0 44 in second quarter 2015  The company s revenues of  3 84 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 74 billion  The top line declined 35 2  year over year  Shares were down 1 6  in the key trading session 
On a bullish note  Halliburton expects rig count to step up modestly during the second half of 2016 and indicated that the ailing  may slowly turn around in the coming days 
Schlumberger   the world s largest oilfield services provider   came up with a decent Q2  Adjusted earnings of  0 23 per share  excluding special items  edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 22 but fell 74  from the year ago number of  0 88  Also  the GAAP loss per share of the company was  1 56 versus earnings of  0 88 per share 
Continued decline in rig activity amid the oil price carnage was behind the year over year decline  Revenues were hit hard by sluggish activity  persistent price pressure and  a  in operations in Venezuela  
Total revenue of  7 16 billion declined 20  year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 13 billion  The company cut another 8 000 jobs in Q2 after 1  SLB lost over 0 3  after hours 
Market Impact
The space got mixed signals thanks to better than expected performances  on a proforma basis  from industry bellwethers  overshadowed slightly by weaker year over year results  which was in fact expected 
We would like to note that both companies indicate that the     With this  things might turn around for the positive in the days to come  though we believe it is likely to take time  read

Stocks closed higher for the fourth straight week  with the S P hitting a new record high  The rise capped the longest run of weekly gains since March  The Dow Industrial Average did not close at a record high but has been positive for 10 of the last 11 sessions  A three week rally in global equities has added more than  4 5 trillion in value 
The next big event for the markets likely will be the two day Fed policy meeting slated for July 26 27  Although the central bank isn t expected to push benchmark rates higher  market participants will pore over the updated policy statement for clues on the pace and timing of the next rate hike  which could influence the U S  dollar  Treasuries and the broader stock market 
  there was a  dramatic deterioration   in the British economy  that according to a one time report from Markit Economics published this morning  Services and manufacturing shrank and a gauge of the private sector economy plunged to 47 7  well below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction  The slump is the strongest evidence yet that politics is propelling the world s fifth largest economy into recession  It intensifies pressure on the Bank of England to deliver fresh monetary stimulus and on the government to reverse fiscal austerity 
The pound dropped after the report was published  with Markit saying its latest readings put the economy on course to contract by 0 4  this quarter   did not fall as much as expected in July  despite Brexit jitters and the Bastille Day massacre  as Markit s flash PMI for the region dropped to 52 9 from June s 53 1 
 reported a sharp rise in adjusted net income in the second quarter  as its aviation  healthcare and power businesses countered weak demand for oil and gas and transportation equipment  During the quarter  GE returned  18 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks  The company shed its designation as a non bank systemically important financial institution after divesting most of its GE Capital business  GE s results included four different earnings per share numbers 
The conglomerate has said year over year comparisons are difficult as the company has recorded both gains and losses from sales of several businesses as part of its GE Capital exit plan  acquired Alstom  PA ALSO  and recognized pension costs and restructuring charges  The actual bottom line based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  was earnings of  2 74 billion  or 30 cents a share  compared with a loss of  1 36 billion  or 13 cents a share  in the same period a year ago  GE shares dropped about 1 6  
Boeing  NYSE BA  has revealed more expensive stumbles with the production of new commercial and military jets  saying it would take  2 1 billion in charges in its coming earnings  The pretax charges stem from delays in developing its new Air Force refueling tanker  demand concerns about its 747 jumbo and the original high costs of its 787 Dreamliner 
American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  reported better than forecast second quarter earnings but profit fell even though the airline managed to cut fuel costs   a major expense   by one fifth  Overall operating revenue is down  while the average airfare paid fell 6 4  and load factor   a measure of how full flights are   dropped one half percent  Earlier this week  United and Southwest both reported similar revenue pressures  Reduction in spending on the part of the airline and the consumers is a sign of a weakening global economy or  at the least  a sign that growing concern the global economy is headed that way  Britain s historic vote to leave the EU  is one reason 
American Airlines President Scott Kirby said during the earnings call   We have seen historically that if there is a business confidence problem  the first thing businesses do is cut entertainment and travel budgets   In fact  for everyday consumers  air travel is also one of the first budgetary items to be cut when there is concern about the economy  As a result  softness in airline revenues and a decline in demand for air travel can be seen as a bellwether for looming economic issues 
Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   the world s two largest providers of oilfield drilling and fracking services  have said that the worst of the two year old oil market crash may be over  The first half of the year has seen something of a pick up in deals  while the backlog of drilling  but not fracked  wells in the U S  has stopped growing  The one thing that is missing from the picture so far is a recovery in oil prices  WTI crude oil prices dropped about 3  this week 
Even though Schlumberger thinks the oil patch has hit bottom and may be turning around  they will cut more jobs  The world s largest oil field services provider earned an adjusted  0 23 a share  topping estimates of  0 21  Revenue of  7 16 billion edged out the  7 15 billion that Wall Street was expecting  Schlumberger says it cut 16 000 jobs in the first half of the year  leading to a  646 million restructuring charge 
Meanwhile  the latest news from baker Hughes shows oil rig counts increased by 14 in the last week   up 6 of the last 7 weeks  So  as we look at rebalancing in the oil patch   50 a barrel looks like the level where the rigs pump come out of hibernation  This week s report from EIA revealed a slight draw down in crude oil inventories  Crude oil stocks were down 2 3 million barrels  posting the ninth straight week of declines and adding momentum to a slow but steady oil market balancing  Still  oil inventories stood at 519 5 million barrels as of mid July  about 60 million barrels higher than year ago levels  Combined  all U S  crude oil and refined product stocks jumped to 2 08 billion barrels  an all time high  This comes at a time of year when peak demand is supposed to draw down on inventories 
There was some strong economic news this week  existing home sales were up  and it looks like first time buyers made up about one third of all buyers last month  The low interest rate environment is certainly a factor on home sales  It suggests that important cylinders of the US economic engine continue to fire  despite the slowdown in China and the weakness in Europe 
Aside from homes  cars another interest rate dependent sector are going strong too  GM s profit was up 150  when they reported earnings the other day  All those new cars are more efficient  they get better mileage  which might explain why we have an oil glut right now  Refiners are contributing to the draw down in crude oil stocks  pulling oil out of storage  but they are simply spinning that into gasoline  which then ends up in storage because people are not using as much as the industry thought it would  As summer comes to an end and refiners turn to maintenance and cutback on refining runs  the upward pressure on gasoline inventories could subside  but the demand on crude could also fall 
Automakers are betting big on electric cars  in part to meet aggressive U S  fuel economy standards that project the vehicle fleet will average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025  And while the cars are efficient  they still have to charge up with electricity  The Energy Department has announced a plan to provide  4 5 billion in loan guarantees to build car charging stations  aiming to complete a U S  network by 2020 to make  coast to coast  nationwide zero emissions travel  a reality 
Stepping into the student loan marketplace  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  has formed a partnership with Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   in which the bank will offer interest rate discounts to select  Prime Students   The offer  which will shave a half percentage point off WFC s student interest rates  will be accessible to Amazon shoppers who want loans to attend college and those who want to refinance existing loans

37808,259323,SLB,Enjoy The Low Oil Prices While You Still Can,opinion,"Oil prices continue to feel pressure from a rising U S  dollar and rising rig counts  but the long term outlook for the global oil market is looking ever more scary  As the oil industry continues to contract  the investment in oil for the long haul continues to retrench 
While we are focused on what we are calling oversupply due to an uncertain economic outlook  we continue to see a long term outlook that will mean sharply higher prices down the road 
Baker Hughes reported the number of active U S  rigs drilling for oil increased for the fourth week in a row  putting more pressure on oil on the perception that the U S  energy industry is making a comeback  While the active U S  oil rig count rose 14 to 371 last week  U S  oil rigs are 288 rigs lower than one year ago levels 
Even though we are seeing a pop in U S  oil rigs counts  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the oil field service giant  doesn t believe that anything changed fundamentally for the oil producers in what they call the most serious industry downturn on record 
They are warning that the short term improvement in the oil industry is due to a redistribution of profits and cash flow that kept producers alive  and not any long term future change in investment trends  They still see a  significant  global supply deficit in the future despite modest improvement in recent oil rig counts 
Oil workers are not feeling the rebound excitement  The Wall Street Journal reported last week that energy companies continued to cut thousands of jobs during the second quarter  even though many chief executives are now voicing optimism that the oil market crash is ending and a rebound in drilling is afoot 
The Wall Street Journal says that among the recent job cuts were 8 000 employees from Schlumberger and 5 000 from Halliburton  NYSE HAL   FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI   which makes offshore oil equipment  cut 1 000 workers in the spring and summer  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   one of the biggest U S  oil producers  confirmed another 1 000 employees will be let go by the end of September 
This brings global energy jobs lost during this downturn to more than 385 000 people 
We did not see an upturn in natural gas rigs last week as they fell by one  as demand for natural gas may be hitting records right now  Natural gas should make a test of the  293 resistance 
In the meantime  oil will focus on the Federal Reserve this week  The strength in the dollar as the Fed drops hints that a rate hike may be in our future is a headwind for rising oil prices  Can the Fed deliver

37809,259324,SLB,USD Pressures Crude Oil,opinion,"Last week WTI crude traded in a range of USD 43 75 to 46 05 barrel  Overall  WTI closed the week down 2 32   Brent Oil fell 2 70  and diesel was down 1 51   The rise in the value of the U S  dollar last week likely helped place negative pressure on the price of oil 
The market was marked by the following events 

U S  gasoline consumption in June reached a record 9 64 million barrels day  up 2 7  from one year earlier  Despite this significant increase in demand  gasoline reserves were at their highest seasonal level in two decades 
Iran is in talks with Mitsui   Co   Ltd   T 8031  and Total SA  PA TOTF  as part of its push to attract USD 60 billion in foreign investment to double the country s output over the next decade 
The oil field services company Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  joined its competitor  Halliburton  NYSE HAL   in saying that North American prices have bottomed out for the second half of 2016 and should rise through the rest of the year 

On Wednesday  July 27 the markets will react to the U S  Federal Reserve s monetary policy decision  Any appreciation in the value of the U S  dollar will lead to higher fuel prices in Canadian dollars

37810,259325,SLB,Here s Why I Remain A Nervous Energy Bull,opinion,"Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  reported their 2nd quarter  16 financial results last Friday  and the results   particularly Exxon s   took some of the shine off the forward estimates of the Energy sector  that were in fact looking quite good  as we headed into the 2nd half of 2016 
Q4  16 s Energy sector earnings growth had been looking pretty good week after week as I updated this blog each Saturday  Look at this attached spreadsheet  
The first block highlighted is the trend in 4th quarter  2016 estimates  note the sharp drop in Q4  16 s growth between July 29th and Monday August 1  16 
As soon as Exxon s numbers hit the wires Friday morning  July 29th  my first thought in terms of the sector earnings revisions was  This won t be good  and that was an accurate  off the cuff assessment  After writing aboutEnergy and Basic Materials on July 23rd  knowing Exxon and Chevron were poised to report their Q2 s I was convinced the Energy sector would continue to outperform into the back half of 2016 
While there is a little more anxiety over the sector given the trend in crude oil and Exxon s and Chevron s numbers  note the bottom half of the above linked spreadsheet  Exxon s numbers and expected growth in 2017 didn t budge at all with last Friday s huge miss 
The other aspect to the Exxon forward estimates is that forward revenue growth is improving far faster than EPS  Exxon s 2016 revenue growth   despite last Friday s horrid miss   is still showing steady improvement 
Here is the recent Energy sector revenue growth history 
Q2  16   24 7   as of 8 1 16 
Q1  16   29 6 
Q4  15   35 4 
Q3  15   35 9 
Q2  15   31 7 
Q1  15   34 7 
Q4  14   13 5 
Q3  14   2 6 
Q2  14   3 3 
The bottom sure looks to be in for the Energy sector in terms of the deteriorating revenue growth rate 
Conclusion  Remember  there is a difference between the commodity crude oil  and the Energy stocks  The PROJECTED revenue and EPS growth  even if it is just half of what is expected  is still a healthy rate of growth 
What makes me nervous   Gasoline consumption drives about half the demand for US crude oil distillation  Electric cars  better mileage  aluminum trucks  etc  etc  all are poised to reduce the demand for gasoline over the next 5  10  20 years 
Exxon  Chevron  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  are the lion s share of the Energy sector s revenue and EPS  All these stocks remain above their 200 day moving averages and the technicals have improved nicely since the Q1  16 bottom   Long XLE  IYE  OIH for clients  with a small position in XOM directly  
The sentiment around the sector is pretty uniformly bearish  with the July drop in crude oil  My plan is to hold the above ETFs into 2017 and evaluate the earnings results each quarter  However the positions can change at any time ",2016-08-02,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/remaining-a-nervous-energy-bull-200145711,200145711

37845,259360,SLB,Where Will Oil Flow  Top Picks To Go Long Or Short,opinion,The energy space is brimming with excitement as oil has seen a dramatic resurgence from its 12 year lows reached in February to the current level of just under  50  And the joy multiplied when the International Energy Agency  IEA   the OECD energy watchdog  proclaimed that the long beleaguered commodity s volatility is now a thing of the past  In fact  the IEA sees crude moving toward stability This was aptly reflected in the most recent monthly report of the Paris based agency which raised its estimate for global daily oil demand this year by 0 1 million barrels to 96 1 million barrels Will the Crude Rally Last We feel the party for the bulls is here to stay as more good news has poured in  In its June Oil Market Report  the IEA revealed lower stockpiling of oil then originally apprehended  The momentum we saw last week  when oil prices climbed above  51 bbl to an 11 month high  lifted the spirits of investors  The support came from the ongoing outages in Nigeria and Canada as well as a steady decline in U S  oil production Looking forward  we see brakes on production being pulled by an economically devastated Venezuela and an ISIS affected Libya  Per IEA  in May  outages in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and non OPEC countries cut global oil supply by nearly 800 000 b d Or Are Oil Prices Still Slippery On the bearish side  however  in the last four sessions  the commodity stayed below the  50 per barrel mark  The downcast mood was precipitated by the dual effect of a surprise build in U S  crude inventories last week per the American Petroleum Institute  API  alongside the buildup toward Britain s referendum  Brexit  next week over its future association with the European Union  These events cast a pall over the broader market and dragged the German 10 year note to the negative return territory for the first time in history  simultaneously making the greenback stronger  Our bearishness stems form the fact that the strength in the greenback would make exports dearer at a time when excess domestic supply is breathing heavily on crude prices  The return of some of the production outages could also adversely affect the commodity Verdict  Crude at a CrossroadWe feel investors may be tizzy as the fortunes of the commodity have come at a crossroads  Per British multinational banking and financial services company  Standard Chartered  LON STAN  plc the state of commodity currently reminds of what can be called   reverse Goldilocks   it s not hot enough and it s not cold enough  If you re bearish  it s may be not low enough for the bears and it s not high enough for the bulls    The way for investors we feel could be clearer by Wednesday s decision by Fed about whether to go for a rate hike  Although market consensus points to another status quo our apprehension is fuelled by dismal domestic jobs report may push towards rate hike making crude exports uncompetitive at this time of oversupply Picking Stocks Either Way The energy sector has gone haywire with the crude carnage  On top of that its wide array of players are muddling up investors  stock picking power  This is where the Zacks methodology could offer some relief  One could narrow down the list using our   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  Inversely the tool can be used to zero on stocks by removing the positive aspects and pick losers that are great pick for shorting  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on Zacks Rank and VGM score Top Stocks to BuyMcDermott International Inc    NYSE MDR   is a global provider of integrated engineering  procurement  construction and installation  EPCI  services for upstream field developments McDermott International has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 15 5  over the next five years  It has a P E  F1  of 89 44  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved 25 0  over the last 30 days Tallgrass Energy GP  LP   NYSE TEGP   based in Leawood  KS is engaged in the transportation  storage and processing of natural gas  along with the transportation of crude oil Tallgrass Energy has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of more than 90  for the current year  It has a P E  F1  of 24 14  which is lower than the industry average of 24 90  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved 10 2  over the last 30 days Best Stocks to ShortMost investors aren t comfortable shorting stocks because of the potential of unlimited loss  Unfortunately  this creates missed opportunities in volatile markets  A short seller in a volatile market can play offense  while everyone else plays defense  This opens up more creative ways to make money  For those who might be new to the world of shorting stocks  we encourage the use of stop loss orders to minimize risk TX based Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI   is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America  The company operates approximately 84 000 miles of pipelines transmitting natural gas  refined petroleum products  crude oil  carbon dioxide  CO2  and additional products The stock has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and sports a VGM Score of D  Looking minutely  the stock fares poorly with a score of D in both parameters of Value and Growth Houston  TX based Schlumberger Limited   NYSE SLB   is a leading oilfield services company  providing technology  project management and information services to the global oil and gas industry Carrying a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and sporting a VGM Score of F  the energy behemoth is another strong contender for shorting  Analyzing closely  the stock fares poorly in terms of Value and Growth with a score of F and D  respectively Bottom LinePick your poison  Regardless of which path you choose  the underlying strength of the commodity crude remains the same  It all boils down to how confident you are in the bear argument for oil over the short term  If you re following the commodity closely and see a gradual recovery from the current prices  then going long is probably right for you   Then again  if you are bearish and have a low

37846,259361,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Crude Down On Brexit Vote  Court OKs Energy Transfer s Pullout From Williams Deal,opinion,"It was a week where oil was a casualty of Brexit fueled selloff  while natural gas was one of the few commodities to buck the trend 
On the news front  Energy Transfer Equity L P    NYSE ETE   got legal permission to walk away from the merger with Williams Companies Inc    NYSE WMB   
Overall  it was another mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged down 0 7  to close at  47 64 per barrel  natural gas prices were up 1 5  to  2 662 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices moved south for just the fourth time in 12 weeks  as chaos and uncertainty prevailed following the U K  electorate s vote to leave the EU in a historic referendum  As expected  the undeniable and immediate fallout was the plunge in the value of the British pound  which crashed to 1985 lows  This led to a flight toward safe haven currencies like the dollar  whose strength made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency and suppress prices 
The negative effect of Brexit   the short way of saying Britain s exit from the EU   was partially offset by the Baker Hughes report  which showed a fall in the U S  oil rig count for the first time in 4 weeks   indicating a break in shale drilling activities Oils Energy Sector Price Index
Natural gas rose again following a lower than average build and predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Texas pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity L P  is no longer bound by its agreement to buy rival natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc   according to the recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Delaware Notably  the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Williams to hold Energy Transfer Equity to the deal  In May  Williams took the legal step when Energy Transfer Equity expressed concerns over the merger citing that the deal had not secured the necessary legal opinion to make it tax free for shareholders  This marked the third separate lawsuit filed by the company over the span of six weeks  Per Williams  Energy Transfer Equity was using the tax opinion as a ruse to miss the merger deadline of Jun 28  and was deliberately trying to disorganize the deal However  much to the dismay of Williams  the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Energy Transfer Equity  The court concluded that Energy Transfer Equity had not breached the merger agreement when in March it reported a tax problem that would prevent the deal from closing on the scheduled date   See More    2     Oil and gas producer Newfield Exploration Co    NYSE NFX   provided a provisional operations update and increased production expectations for the second quarter and full year 2016 The company now expects its second quarter net production to exceed the mid point of its previous guidance by about 0 5 million barrels of oil equivalent  MMBOE  and is projected to be about 15 2 MMBOE  The earlier guidance was in the range of 14 4 14 9 MMBOE Domestic net production is estimated to be more than 13 6 MMBOE  up from the previous projection of 13 0 13 5 MMBOE  International net production  on the other hand  is anticipated to be about 1 6 MMBOE  up 14 3  from its earlier guidance of 1 4 MMBOE  Full year net production is now projected to be between 56 0 MMBOE and 58 0 MMBOE compared with the earlier range of 54 5 56 5 MMBOE   See More    3     Calgary  Alberta based energy explorer Encana Corp    NYSE ECA   announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest its Gordondale assets in northwestern Alberta to another Calgary based company   Birchcliff Energy   for C 625M  This sale includes about 54 200 net acres of land with wells churning out an average of 25 200 barrels of oil equivalent a day  65  natural gas   The sale of Gordondale resources   situated in the Montney basin   will leave Encana with 9 000 potential drilling locations  More than 65  of those wells will be situated in the condensate rich part of the play The transaction will help Encana to strengthen its balance sheet and provide financial flexibility  especially in this low commodity price environment  It will also free the company from as much as C 100 million in future spending commitments on the property  which in turn  will help Encana focus on core areas in Canada and the U S   See More    4     U S  energy holding company Energen Corp    NYSE EGN   announced that it has signed purchase and sale agreements  PSAs  for its non core Delaware Basin and San Juan Basin assets  Per the agreement  the total gross proceeds after including all sales transactions with multiple  undisclosed buyers comes to  551 7 million  The transactions are expected to close by mid August  The company expects to incur minimal taxes in association with these transactions Total production for all the properties to be divested averaged 9 0 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day in Apr 2016  of which only 34  was oil  The majority of the production is in the San Juan Basin  In the Delaware Basin  the assets to be divested consist of unproved leasehold of approximately 55 000 net acres With the sale of its San Juan Basin assets  Energen would transition into a pure Permian Basin operator  The future focus would be on drilling and developing its high quality acreage positions in the Midland and Delaware basins   See More    5     Independent energy company QEP Resources Inc    NYSE QEP   announced the acquisition of oil and gas properties in the northern Midland Basin of the Permian Basin for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  600 million  The company will partly fund the buyout from the proceeds of its recent stock offering With this acquisition  QEP Resources will add over 430 potential horizontal drilling locations   that spread over 9 400 acres of land   with its existing core Permian Basin properties  The to be acquired properties have a production capacity of about 1 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and hold net proved reserves of approximately 76 million barrels of oil equivalent  The deal is slated to close in September but awaits customary closing conditions   See More    
Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months Over the course of last week   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  fell 3 19  following the Brexit referendum result  Consequently  investors witnessed selling in some large companies  The worst performer was oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   that lost 5 08  of its stock price

37847,259362,SLB,Look For Q2  16 Upside Surprises In Energy And Basic Material Sectors,opinion,"Energy and Basic Mat are just 10  of the S P 500  but commodities as an asset class have been at the bottom of the asset class return table for the last 5 years 
However that began to change in February  16 
The  Great Rotation  talked about this Spring    has begun to play out in earnest  and it looks like it will continue  Much of the rotation  I thought  would be catalyzed by a steady to slightly weaker dollar  but even with the dollar s strength post Brexit  commodities  Emerging Markets  and the out of favor sectors didn t give much back

37848,259363,SLB,Crude Oil  Losing The War On Independence,opinion,"For years this country bemoaned being dependent on Middle Eastern oil  We learned of the real risk to our national security after the Arab Oil Embargo and swore that someday we would free ourselves from the slave like binds of dependency on Middle Eastern oil  We vowed energy independence  even as many thought that was an unrealistic pipe dream  Yet we continued to strive towards that goal by becoming more energy efficient  We used determination and innovation  When prices soared  smart Americans did the impossible and unleashed the shale revolution  After decades of trying to become energy independent  it was within out grasps only to have it taken away by the OPEC oil production war  According to a new report by the International Energy Agency  the Middle East producers  like Saudi Arabia and Iraq  now have the biggest share of world oil markets since the Arab fuel embargo of the 1970s 
The Financial Times reported that Fatih Birol  International Energy Agency executive director  said policymakers risk becoming complacent as rhetoric surrounding a rise in North American energy supplies has overshadowed the world s growing reliance on Middle Eastern crude   The Middle East is the first source of imports   said Mr  Birol   The higher the demand growth the more we  consumer countries  will need to import   The FT says that Middle Eastern producers now make up 34 per cent of global output  pumping 31m barrels a day  according to IEA data  This is the highest proportion since 1975 when it hit 36 per cent  In 1985  when North Sea production accelerated  their share fell to as little as 19 per cent  The FT says that   Demand has since surged as prices more than halved following years of trading above  100 a barrel  Mr Birol said efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions were being thwarted as motorists returned to buying fuel guzzling cars  
In the U S   as I have stated before  we have been badly damaged and may struggle to make a comeback  The Wall Street Journal today reports that   Revving Up Oil Fields Won t Be So Easily Done   The Journal says that   oil field services companies are depleted after slashing prices and laying off workers  and their slow recovery could crimp the energy industry s overall ability to bounce back from the oil bust  The workhorses of the energy sector  the services companies  which range from giants such as Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  to small family run operations  provide much of the muscle and specialty know how needed to extract oil and gas  They pioneered the technologies that allowed producers to unlock massive volumes of oil and gas trapped in shale rock formations  and marshal critical equipment and people to drill and pump wells from remote corners of North Dakota to platforms miles offshore  But they have borne the brunt of two years of belt tightening in the oil patch  leaving them short on cash and manpower as prices slowly rebound and companies need them again to increase production  IHS Energy estimates that nearly 70  of fracking equipment in the U S  has been idled  and 60  of field workers involved in fracking have been laid off  
In the meantime  the Obama Administration has fought the U S  petroleum industry every step of the way and helped reverse the U S  drive towards energy independence  This retreat will cost us all in the long run  We have seen this coming  We warned that there would be long term consequences for losing the OPEC production war  The loss of trillions of dollars of cap spending by oil companies will allow OPEC to pull the strings in the global oil market again  In a few years when supplies start to tighten we will wonder why we stood idly by and allowed OPEC to destroy our industry and keep us behind the barrels 
In the short run  oil is focused on oil inventory  We say a stunning 6 3 million barrel drop in the API report  Natural gas and petroleum numbers will come later  We should see a below average 40 bcf injection and that should  along with hot temperature forecasts  reignite the bullish momentum ",2016-07-07,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-07-16-200140497,200140497

Readers need to understand that Energy is roughly 7  of the S P 500 by market cap  but just 1  of earnings weight   see the spreadsheet from last week    so there is substantial room for earnings to improve 
When Energy started to crater in mid 2014  Energy was roughly 12  13  of the S P 500 by market cap

Already today after the S P 500 made a new all time high this past week  the pundits were out in full force saying the market was overbought  and the 10 sectors of the S P 500 were overbought  and almost as soon as the S P 500 traded above 2 135  the commentators were saying  wait for a pullback

2017 bottom up EPS estimate as of April 1  16   136 44
2017 bottom up EPS estimate as of July 1  16   135 28
Note how 2017 s EPS estimate fell  6 38 in the first 90 days of 2016  but just  1 16 the next 90 days 
The downward pressure on forward S P 500 estimates is getting much less onerous  and that is a very good sign

37886,259401,SLB,U S Q1 Growth Revised Up,opinion,"U S  economic growth slowed in the first quarter although not as sharply as initially thought  amid a surge in spending on home building and a steady increase in inventory investment by businesses 
Gross domestic product rose at a 0 8 percent annual rate as opposed to the 0 5 percent pace reported last month  the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate on Friday 
It was the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2015 
The upward revision to first quarter GDP growth also reflected a smaller drag from trade than previously reported  The government also reported a rebound in after tax corporate profits  which increased at a 0 6 percent rate in the first quarter after plunging at an 8 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter 
When measured from the income side  the economy grew at a 2 2 percent rate after expanding at a 1 9 percent pace in the fourth quarter 
The economy has been hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand  which have eroded export growth  It has also been squeezed by lower oil prices  which has undercut profits of oil field companies like Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL N   forcing them to slash spending on equipment 
Economists also believe the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal despite steps last year to address the problem 
Residual seasonality has plagued first quarter GDP data  with growth underperforming in five of the last six years since the economic recovery started in the middle of 2009 
There are signs the economy regained momentum early in the second quarter  with retail sales  goods exports  industrial production  housing starts and home sales surging in April 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second quarter GDP rising at a 2 9 percent rate  But the continuing high level of inventories poses a downside risk to this forecast 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected first quarter GDP growth would be revised up to a 0 9 percent rate  The economy grew at a 1 4 percent rate in the fourth quarter 
INVENTORY ACCUMULATION
Spending on residential construction increased at a 17 1 percent rate in the first quarter  the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012  It was previously reported to have increased at a rate of 14 8 percent 
Businesses accumulated  69 6 billion worth of inventory  instead of the  60 9 billion estimated last month  Inventories cut two tenths of a percentage point from first quarter GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0 33 percentage point 
There was no revision to consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  Spending increased at a pace of 1 9 percent  a slowdown from the fourth quarter s 2 4 percent rate 
Households were frugal in the first quarter  cutting back on purchases of long lasting manufactured goods like automobiles 
Income at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation was revised up to show it surging at a 4 0 percent rate in the first quarter instead of the previously reported 2 9 percent  Savings were revised up to  782 6 billion from  712 3 billion 
Exports were not as weak as initially thought  That  together with a decline in imports  produced a smaller trade deficit  which subtracted 0 21 percentage point from first quarter GDP instead of the 0 34 percentage point reported last month ",2016-05-27,Dean Popplewell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s-q1-growth-revised-up-200132614,200132614

Gross domestic product in the United States climbed at a 0 8 percent annual rate compared to the 0 5 percent rate reported in the previous month  the Commerce Department stated in its second GDP estimate on Friday  It registered the weakest performance since the first quarter of last year 
The upward revision to the first quarter gross domestic product growth estimate also mirrored a smaller drag from trade than previously reported  In addition  the government reported a rebound in after tax corporate earnings  which has been boosted at a 0 6 percent rate in the first quarter after plummeting at 8 4 percent pace during the fourth quarter 
On the other hand  the US economy grew at a 2 2 percent rate after growing 1 9 percent in the fourth quarter when measured from the income side 
The world s largest economy has been rattled by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand  which have deteriorated export growth  Furthermore  it has been weighed down by lower oil prices  which have undermined the earnings of oilfield companies such as Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   forcing them to cut spending on equipment 
Market analysts also believe that the model applied by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not entirely reaching its goal  despite measures last year to resolve the issue

There are some indications that the economy regained momentum at the beginning of the second quarter   with retail sales  goods exports  industrial production  housing starts and home sales soaring in the previous month 
Meanwhile  the Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently expecting a 2 9 percent increase in second quarter gross domestic product  However  including the consistent high level of inventories suggests a downside risk to this outlook

However  losses in oil prices were curbed to some extent after Baker Hughes    NYSE BHI    reported that U S  oil rig count fell from 320 to 310  declining for the eighth straight week  Moreover  disruptions in Nigeria led the country to reduce crude output to its lowest level in more than 20 years  Nigeria s Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun said that crude production has fallen from 2 2 million bpd to 1 65 million bpd following recent militant attacks 

Decline in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   to decrease 1 3  and to become the second biggest loser among the S P 500 sectors  Dow components Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    and Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    fell 1 4  and 1 1   respectively  Other key energy stocks including  Schlumberger Limited     NYSE SLB     Pioneer Natural Resources Co     NYSE PXD     Southwestern Energy Company    NYSE SWN     Halliburton Company    NYSE HAL     EOG Resources  Inc     NYSE EOG    and Transocean Ltd      NYSE RIG    decreased 2 2   2 1   5 1   2 5   2 3  and 4 4   respectively

SolarCity Corporation    NYSE C    also posted disappointing earnings results  but Electronic Arts Inc  NASDAQ EA      and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Limited    reported better than expected earnings results 

Additionally  during the week Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL     hit its worst closing level since June 2014  following concerns over a slump in iPhone sales  Total market cap of Apple yesterday was  494 7 billion  lower than Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc s    market cap of  494 9 billion  making Google the world s biggest company  However  Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  plc    gained after the company gave approval to a new share repurchase program of  10 billion and the company posted better than expected quarterly reports 

In economic news  rise in initial claims negatively impacted the market  but decline in crude inventories boosted oil prices  Further  disruptions in Nigeria and Canada reduced crude oversupply worries by a significant extent  which also pushed oil prices upward  Both the WTI crude and Brent crude rose 3 5  and 5 3   respectively for the week ",2016-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-market-news-for-may-16,-2016-200130133",200130133
37930,259445,SLB,Goldman Sees Oil Deficit  What This Means For Energy Players,opinion,"Are good times for oil exploration and production players really knocking at the door  The question may jolt investors out of their blues especially after witnessing the markets closing in the red on and off due to plunging crude prices  In fact  the general belief is that wherever oil goes  the market follows 
However  the oil market is no longer oversupplied  In fact  a deficit in the space has been pointed out in a statement issued by leading investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group Inc    NYSE GS    With this shortfall  the bank believes that oil price will rise to  60 by this year end 
Going Deep into the Story
Major energy companies have been hit hard for long by weak oil prices following an oversupplied commodity market  Even big oil producers met a few times to figure out measures to lower production as they saw this as the best way to make crude price take a U turn amid lackluster global demand 
But unfortunately none of the major players agreed on production cut despite continuously falling oil price that touched the 12 year low in February this year  In other words  they have been in a race where the fittest will survive and the others will simply be wiped away from the market 
It is to be noted that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  have been increasingly pumping crude since their economy is highly dependent on oil  According to Reuters  last month  OPEC extracted almost 32 44 million barrels of oil per day  Bbl d   which is up by 188 000 Bbl d from March this year  Most importantly  this monthly jump is the highest level since 2008  
However  in such a scenario  Goldman revealed that it is surprised by the sudden deficit that it has felt in the oil market after the glut seen for two years  In fact  the crude market has turned deficit sooner than the investment management firm expected  
Let s analyze the factors that led Goldman to believe that the crude market has likely become deficit in May and will remain so for the rest of this year  
Supply Disruptions  Goldman s projection of a deficit in the oil market throughout the second half of this year stems primarily from interrupted crude supply in Nigeria  the U S  and China 
Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM    the world s largest publicly traded oil company  has suspended exporting Qua Iboe crude following a pipeline attack in Nigeria  This took Nigeria s output to a record low mark in decades  Qua Iboe oil was pumped from many offshore fields in south eastern Nigeria and is the largest source of oil in the country 
In the U S   many shale producers   who relentlessly went on producing crude last year for a lead in the market share race with OPEC players   have gone bankrupt following ballooning debt in their balance sheet  As per U S  Energy Information data  domestic crude production has fallen to a level which is 8 4  below the peak seen in 2015 
Moreover  according to media sources  China witnessed crude output of 4 04 million Bbl d in April this year  reflecting a 5 6  decline from the year ago level 
Sustained Demand  Goldman projects 2016 worldwide crude demand to improve by 1 4 million Bbl d  which is higher than its prior expectation 
Conclusion
With supply disruption and increased expectation for global oil demand in 2016  Goldman foresees oil price to improve to  60 by this year end  So definitely it will be a huge development on the crude front if the deficit turns into a reality 
This will be great news for oil exploration and production players and for the integrated energy firms  This is because they will be able to sell the commodity at improved prices and thereby generate considerable cash flows in the coming quarters for their shareholders  Some major energy players that might benefit are Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc   NYSE BP    Oil field services companies like Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB   and drilling players like Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   may also be favored since they help upstream energy firms to efficiently drill oil wells 
However  Goldman said that this deficit crude market will not last forever  In fact  the investment bank added that the oil market will again become oversupplied from the start of 2017  This might be because increased oil price in 2016 will encourage producers to get into more exploration and production activities  leading to a glut in the oil market again ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman-sees-oil-deficit:-what-this-means-for-energy-players-200130228,200130228

Oil s horror show has seen black gold s price come down from some  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  45 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb  The commodity s collapse has threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 
Oilfield services companies have been some of the hardest hit by diving commodity prices as top energy companies have resorted to spending cuts  particularly on the costly upstream projects  owing to lower profit margins  This  in turn  means cancellation or contract renegotiation for equipment suppliers like FMC Technologies and Technip  In fact  the latter s stock has fallen about 20  in the past year  while FMC Technologies is down 30  
In these trying circumstances  merger and acquisition deals have helped service providers to cut their average costs and benefit from mutual technical expertise exchange 
Terms of the Deal
Under the terms of the transaction  Technip shareholders will receive two shares in the new business for each share they hold  while each FMC Technologies share will be converted into one share of TechnipFMC  Post merger  Technip investors will own around 50  of the combined firm while FMC Technologies shareholders will own the remaining half

37965,259480,SLB,Declining Oil Prices And Real Estate,opinion,"Oil prices continue to fall   months  a year  anyone   after most observers thought they had already reached a bottom  Many consumers are benefiting  and the energy expenses of businesses are declining  What s not to like 
Surprisingly  a lot  In many regions of the country  and particularly across business sectors that thrive on the capital expenditures that the oil and gas business can provide  Big Oil s decline has had a bigger effect on the economy than perhaps many initially foresaw  This may concern investors in real estate crowdfunding sites like RealtyShares 
The Obvious Effects
Oil service giants like Schlumberger NV  N SLB   Halliburton  N HAL  and Baker Hughes Incorporated  N BHI  have  collectively  announced 51 000 layoffs since the oil crash began  In the U K   BP  L BP  is cutting 1 in 5 jobs North Sea jobs  Together with numerous independent oil and gas producers  estimates are that worldwide job losses may now have reached 200 000 people  And  of course  oil exploration company profits will be down  In October  analysts at Oppenheimer expected only 2 of the 15 exploration and production companies it covers to post positive earnings per share for 2016 
Oil refineries are reaping the benefits of   with strong recent profit data  Refineries are highly mechanized facilities  though  and there doesn t seem to be much talk of huge employment gains being driven by the refineries  good fortune 
And Some Less Obvious 
Some less considered effects of the price decline  however  are the number of related service companies that have felt the pinch  Far from the oil fields of Texas or North Dakota  several companies in Southern California  for example  have felt the pinch in a serious way  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc  N JEC   Tetra Tech Inc  O TTEK   Worley Parsons Ltd  OTC WYGPY   and Aecom Technology Corporation  N ACM  have all been affected 
Travis Hoium  a contributor to Motley Fool  noted that   A  decline in oil prices doesn t just impact energy companies  There are companies that supply fracking material  housing for workers  insurance  and other goods consumed by energy companies  Energy is one of the largest consumers of commodities like steel and aluminum  which are used to produce everything from drilling rigs to pipelines  Companies like United States Steel Corporation  N X  have seen demand drop like a rock since oil prices started to decline  
In addition  the benefits of lower gasoline prices seem to be more limited than originally expected   While great for gasoline consumers  the reduction in pricing seems to be limited to gasoline for our autos  and hasn t been reflected in other transportation sensitive sectors like grocery items  which have catapulted in price  said Gary London with the London Group Realty Advisors 
What does this mean for real estate 
Big job losses are never a great thing  Real estate markets in Texas  Oklahoma  and Louisiana will all likely feel the effect of the decline in oil prices  Some observers claim that   but the sector s job losses began a while back  so the real estate downturn there has already started  and is unlikely to turn anytime soon 
The significant drop in capital expenditures from the major exploration companies will have an adverse effect on many regional economies with construction and engineering firms that counted those companies as major customers  But few places are as dependent on the oil and gas market as is Houston   
It s conceivable that apartment complexes in the Houston area might have benefitted from this downturn there  with reluctant homebuyers instead turning to high end apartments  The market seems to suffer from too much supply  though  and some have fretted about Houston s recent abundance of luxury  upscale apartment complexes   I m very concerned about the overbuilding in apartments   said Patrick Jankowski  senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership 
In some regions  however  some analysts argue that home prices and energy costs move in the opposite direction  These observers believe that  in the Northeast and Midwest especially  home prices tend to rise after oil prices fall 
Despite the troubles in the oil and gas industry  the nation as a whole finished 2015 with strong employment growth figures  The year ended particularly strong  with December figures showing that employers hired an additional 292 000 people  and upward revisions for October and November  Employment grew most vigorously in professional and business services  which added 73 000 workers  while the construction industry added an unexpectedly strong 45 000 jobs last month

37966,259481,SLB,2 Stocks Yield A Surprising Win Win In The Decimated Oil Patch,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
The last time oil traded above  100 was in July 2014  That s nearly two years ago 
Since then  we ve witnessed a spectacular collapse  mainly due to major oversupply concerns and China s slowing economy and demand for oil  From the beginning of the year we ve seen oil hit  26 05  a 12 year record low  Unfortunately for many companies and their investors  the profitability of the energy sector within equities markets is directly linked to commodity prices 
For example  Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  has almost been reduced to ashes  down 74  over the last year   Then there s Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU   down from  76 this time last year   a staggering 96 8  loss as of Friday s close 
Obviously  this plays into one of investors  biggest fears watching a company in which you hold a stake go bankrupt  leaving  if you re lucky  some money on the table for bondholders and owners of preferred shares  Holders of common stock  however  rarely see any capital returned 
So why bother investing in the energy sector at all right now 
Fortunately  not all energy companies are created equal  While some will crumble under the weight of low commodity prices  others  like Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   remain relatively stable during the current market turmoil  As well diversified industry leaders  it is expected they ll survive the recent storm and keep their positions at the top of the industry 
However  survival for Exxon and Chevron right now means little capital growth achieved  We ve found two oil companies with greater rewards  Each is relatively safe from bankruptcy in the short  and medium term  and each offers even bigger upsides 
Baker Hughes
Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  is an American industrial services company  specializing in providing technology  drilling  production systems and reservoir consulting to the oil industry  As of today  it s the third largest oil services provider in the world  From an investor perspective  there are a few reasons why Baker Hughes is in an excellent position 
First  the company was growing steadily prior to 2015  when its revenues fell  as demand for its services slackened alongside falling oil prices  In 2014  the company grew its revenues by more than 10   It is also financially sound from another perspective  though it has  2 7B in current liabilities  it also has  2 3B in cash on its books  not including inventory or receivables 
All told  Baker Hughes  current assets amount to  9 2B  a significantly larger sum than its long term debt of  3 6B  But that s just the picture of the company s internal health 

In November 2014  a merger between Baker Hughes and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  was announced  According to the deal s terms  Halliburton would pay  19 cash   1 12 of its own shares for every Baker Hughes share 
Currently  this offer values every Baker Hughes share at  58 3  Given that the stock closed at just below  43 on Friday  the merger should it go through will yield a premium of about 35  per share 
Of course  there s a good chance the merger won t go through because of European Union and US anti trust laws  Should that happen  Halliburton would pay Baker Hughes a  3 5B breakup fee for its trouble  At today s prices and with 438M of Baker Hughes shares outstanding  this  3 5B fee is an additional  8 of value per share  or an extra 18  to the  42 95 a share costs today 
A growing company that remains outside the extended oil slump  with manageable short  and long term debt  in the middle of an acquisition  where the shareholders benefit whether the deal goes through or not  That s a win no matter which sector you opt into 
Halliburton
On the other side of the proposed merger  Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   is in pretty good shape too  Halliburton is the world s second largest oil services provider  ahead of Baker Hughes but well behind industry leader Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   which is currently worth  90B  three times Halliburton s market cap  Hence the necessity and potential difficulty of the merger 

However  with or without the merger Halliburton is doing just fine  Its cash holdings are almost double its current liabilities  meaning the company is very unlikely to go bankrupt anytime soon 
Should the merger go through  Baker Hughes will add overseas lines to HAL s stable  providing a nice cash flow boost as well as fracking capabilities  But Halliburton can also take the heat of a failed merger  if that were to occur  And while the  3 5B resulting liability would represent a little over 10  of Halliburton s market cap  it wouldn t be enough of a blow to shut down the operation 
No one knows exactly when  or if  an oil recovery will take place  as it is infamously controlled more by international  power politics than by simple supply and demand  While uncertainty continues to reign in the oil sector  here are the key considerations to look for and invest in  strong and resilient companies with little chance of going under  whose operations are also primed for a strong recovery  Halliburton and Baker Hughes both resoundingly meet these criteria ",2016-04-04,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-surprising-win-win-in-the-decimated-oil-patch-200123826,200123826
37967,259482,SLB,Why The Energy Sector Remains The Key To This Market,opinion,"There are a couple of reasons I think Energy remains the key to this market and the key to 2016 S P 500 earnings  and why I m more positive than most 
Energy is still a 5  6  market cap weighting in the S P 500  bigger than Basic Materials by 2 x  and far bigger than the  ex Chemical  Basic Materials weighting  meaning copper  aluminum  gold  silver  i e  industrial and precious metals weighting   thus of all the  commodities  crude oil remains the most important commodity 
Forward Energy estimates for 2016 have started to turn positive which surprised me when I looked at the data this morning 
With consensus Street estimates expecting a 27  decline in Energy revenue in Q1  16 and a 103  drop in Energy sector earnings  Thomson data source  just from a sentiment perspective it is hard to think that the earnings and revenue estimates revisions get much worse 
High yield looks to have bottomed with crude oil  and the Financial sector particularly the big banks have undoubtedly felt the weight of the regulators on their Energy loan books  as we have written previously on this site  The point being that if crude bottoms  the Energy sector doesn t see the expected default frequency and severity expected  then that takes some of the pressure off the Financials  particularly if the regulators forced the banks to write down the loan books too much 
The point is that if crude oil and Energy turn is sustainable  the S P 500 makes all time highs  Remember  the S P 500 has basically been flat since crude oil peaked in August  14  The 2 134 2 135 peak prints in the S P 500 in mid 2015 were new all time highs  but the S P 500 has basically gone nowhere since late 2014 
Energy estimates  how are revisions faring   
While the data will be more meaningful after looking at the full month of April  16  here is how forward Energy estimates have fared in the last week 
Q1  17  not available
Q4  16   14 2  vs  11  just one week ago
Q3  16   53 9   vs  54 7  just one week ago
Q2  16   76 6  vs  77  just one week ago
Q1  16   103 3  vs  101 9  just one week ago
Again  a 1 week time period is too small to get really excited about an Energy sector earnings turn  but there haven t been too many time periods since the Spring of 2015 where forward Energy sector earnings growth improved at all  The other plus is that Energy is facing very easy compares over the next 8 months in terms of y y gains 
Readers will be updated on how 2nd half Energy sector earnings and revenue growth develop 
Technical analysis 
 a great crude oil chart on Friday  April 8th that readers need to see  Crude oil bottomed in the  42  43 area in 2015  before taking the one final leg lower to  26 in late  15  early  16 
 42 is also where crude peaked in mid March  16  A trade through  42  43 and Energy gets new life  in my opinion  At worst  I don t think we see  26 for a while either 
Conclusion  I think the Energy sector remains the key to this market  and I believe we ve seen the lows for the sector  Clients probably have their largest Energy weighting in years at 4  5  of their accounts  depending on the client  size of the account  etc    and that weighting could grow  but readers can also play the sector and commodity bounce through Emerging Markets   Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets  NYSE VWO   iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM    which have horrible 10 year returns and also look to be stabilizing  Clients also own the VWO and EEM for the first time ever in the last 6 months  A weaker dollar and rising commodity prices would be a new tailwind for an asset class that has gotten truly trashed in the last 10 years   Client positions can change at any time for various reasons  
Energy companies don t report in bulk until late April  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  will be the first reports the week of April 21  and then Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  report the very last days of April ",2016-04-10,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings:-why-the-energy-sector-remains-the-key-to-this-market-200124496,200124496
37968,259483,SLB,Schlumberger CEO Sees  Full Scale Cash Crisis  In Oil Sector,opinion,"Net income declined to  501 million from  975 million a year ago
Profit per share was 1 cent more than 39 cent average estimate
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  cut more jobs in the first quarter  as the world s largest provider of oilfield services sees the industry in an unprecedented downturn 
The global headcount dropped to 93 000 at the end of the first quarter with the reduction  Joao Felix  a spokesman for the company  said by e mail  The company let go about 8 000 people in the quarter  and reclassified about 5 500 contractors as permanent workers  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said Friday in a conference call with analysts and investors  One third of Schlumberger s workforce  or roughly 42 000  has now been cleaved off since the worst crude market crash in a generation began in mid 2014 
 The decline in global activity and the rate of activity disruption reached unprecedented levels as the industry displayed clear signs of operating in a full scale cash crisis   Kibsgaard said in a statement announcing first quarter earnings Thursday   This environment is expected to continue deteriorating over the coming quarter given the magnitude and erratic nature of the disruptions in activity  
Oilfield service providers were the first to feel the pain when crude prices began falling in the middle of 2014  Of the more than 250 000 jobs cut globally in the energy industry during the downturn  service providers continue to be the most heavily impacted after customers slashed more than  100 billion in spending last year  with promises of more cuts to come 
Second quarter revenue  excluding what s expected from its new acquisition of Cameron  is forecast to fall at a similar rate to the company s 16 percent sequential drop in the first three months of this year  said Kibsgaard on the conference call 
Tight Margins
Schlumberger s profit fell in the first quarter as the company  which helps explorers find pockets of oil underground and drill for it  adjusts to shrinking margins in North America as customers scale back work  Customers are slashing spending by as much as 50 percent in the U S  and Canada 
Net income declined to  501 million  or 40 cents a share  from  975 million  or 76 cents  a year earlier  the Houston  and Paris based company said  Profit was 1 cent more than the 39 cent average of 37 analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg 
 It s a weak beat mainly because they guided estimates down   Rob Desai  an analyst at Edward Jones in St  Louis  who rates the shares a buy and owns none  said in a phone interview   North America came in weaker than we expected  
Challenges from the collapse in crude prices were seen in North America  the world s largest hydraulic fracturing market  where Schlumberger reported a loss of  10 million  before taxes  Elsewhere  the company announced earlier this month plans to cut back activity in Venezuela  holder of the biggest oil reserves of any country  due to unpaid bills 
Total receivables in Venezuela are now at  1 2 billion  Kibsgaard said Friday 
 New Up 
Pricing for hydraulic fracturing  which blasts water  sand and chemicals underground to free trapped hydrocarbons  was essentially unchanged during the first quarter in most of the major U S  basins  according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report  citing data from industry consultant Spears   Associates  Oil service pricing may actually be nearing a low point  Andrew Cosgrove  an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence  wrote Thursday in a report 
 Any enthusiasm  however  may need to be checked  as forecasts for 2H activity may show no real signs of a material recovery   Cosgrove wrote 
Schlumberger was expected to generate a North America operating profit margin at break even  according to Capital One Southcoast  That s better than smaller competitors reporting margins as low as negative 30 percent 
 Break even is the new up   Luke Lemoine  an analyst at Capital One in New Orleans who rates the shares the equivalent of a buy and owns none  said in a phone interview before the results were released   In this environment  it s hard to defend the 5 percent margins in North America they had talked about  
Excess Costs
The second quarter is expected to get worse for Schlumberger  with North American margins dipping as much as 4 percent into the red  Lemoine said 
 A lot of it is carrying excess costs   he said   Service companies have cut personnel and facilities  but they re unwilling to cut to the bone  so they are maintaining some slack in capacity  
The earnings statement was released after the close of regular trading in New York  The shares  which have 35 buy ratings from analysts  5 holds and 3 sells  are down 13 percent in the past year through Thursday 
Schlumberger shares fell 14 cents to  80 13 at 10 44 a m  in New York Friday ",2016-04-24,MrTopStep,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-ceo-sees-`full-scale-cash-crisis’-in-oil-sector-200126109,200126109
37969,259484,SLB,Warren Buffett Is Tone Deaf On Diversity,opinion,"Warren Buffett  CEO of the legendary Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  NYSE BRKb   rightfully sits among the most respected and highly regarded business leaders in American history   his opinions can shape minds and drive business practices  Buffett s influence and potential for tremendous good turn Berkshire s annual shareholder meeting into a mega event 
This year s mass migration to Omaha  Nebraska was broadcast and streamed live for the first time by Yahoo Finance  Honestly  I was never interested in following this meeting or the commentary that came out of it until Yahoo advertised this momentous occasion  The video stream caught my attention  and I was riveted  The investor meeting was entertaining  educational  sobering  and inspirational all at the same time 
Yet  there was at least one moment that stirred me from my blissful admiration  That moment arrived around the 4 05 00 mark when Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answered a shareholder question on diversity  Their collective response was so disappointing  so rambling  so underwhelming  and so misdirected that Berkshire sounded completely tone deaf on the diversity issue  At one point  Buffett even sounded stubbornly insensitive 
The whole display seemed out of character within the context of Berkshire s desire to have a positive impact on the world  I had to conclude that Buffett and Munger are not quite clear on the  diversity issue  when applied in the corporate and organizational context 
I need to quote the full specifics of the discussion before proceeding with my critique 
Andrew Ross Sorkin from CNBC asked the question on behalf of Arits Galdoz  spelling    Sorkin indicated that several other shareholders had asked similar questions  I transcribed the conversation as accurately as possible  my disbelief motivated me to confirm exactly what I think I heard 
From Sorkin 

 About two dozen men and women work with you Warren at our corporate office  I see from last year the quality of the picture in the annual report has been improved so congratulations on that  However  looking at it  there is something that comes to anyone s attention  and it is the lack of diversity among the staff 
A 2015 analysis by Calvert Investments found that Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO  was one of the best companies for workplace diversity while Berkshire Hathaway was one of the worst  You ve explicitly stated that you do not consider diversity when hiring for leadership roles and board members 
Does that need to change  Are we missing any investment opportunities as a result  And do you consider diversity  however defined  of company leadership and staff in the value of a company that you may want to purchase  

Source  
For reference  here is a relevant quote from the summary of the 2015 Calvert Report titled    

 Based on the 10 diversity criteria in the Calvert report  the overall highest rated companies are  Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   Citigroup  NYSE C   Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   Merck  NYSE MRK   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Target  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC    ten companies tied for first place  
The four lowest rated companies are  Berkshire Hathaway  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   National Oilwell Varco Inc  NYSE NOV    and Twenty First Century Fox Inc  NASDAQ FOX   Companies that achieved the most improvement  Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   and Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   

Buffett s response to the diversity question 

 The answer to the last question is no  What was the one before it   audience laughs and Sorkin repeated the question  
We will select board members  and we lay it out  we ve done so for years  And I think we have been much more explicit than most companies  We are looking for people who are business savvy  shareholder oriented  and have a special interest in Berkshire  And we found people like that  As a result  I think  I think we ve got the best board that we could have  They re clearly not in it for the money 
I get called by consulting firms who ve been told to get candidates for directors for other companies  By the questions they ask it s clearly they ve got something other than the three questions we ask in terms of Directors in mind  They really want somebody whose name will reflect credit on the institution which means a big name  One organization recently   the one that did the blood samples with small pricks   they got some very big names on their board 
And Theranos  got verification from Munger on pronunciation   the names are great  but we are not interested in people that want to be on the board because they want to make 200 or 300 000 dollars a year for 10  of their time  And we re not interested in the ones for whom it s a prestige item and who want to go and check boxes and that sort of thing 
So I think we ve got we will continue to apply that test  business savvy  shareholder oriented  and with a strong personal interest in Berkshire 
And every share of Berkshire that our shareholders own is bought just like everybody else in this room  They haven t gotten them on option  I have been on boards where they ve given me stock  I get it for breathing  Maybe half a dozen places  maybe 3 or 4 places  where I was on the board of 
We want our shareholders to walk in the shoes  I mean Directors to walk in the shoes of the shareholders  We want them to care a lot about the business  And we want them to be smart enough so that they know enough about business  they know what they should get involved in and what they shouldn t get involved in 
The people in the office   I m hoping that when we take the Christmas picture again this year  they re exactly the same 25 that were there last year although we might have added 30 000 employees elsewhere  Maybe  10B of sales or something like that  It s a remarkable group of people 
And they  just take this meeting  virtually every one of the 25 they have been doing job after job connected with making this meeting a success and a pleasant outing for our shareholders  It s a cooperative effort  The idea that you would have some department called annual meeting department  You d have a person in charge of it and she or he would have an assistant that would go to various conferences about holding annual meetings and they hire consultants to come in and help them run the meeting 
We just don t operate that way  It s a place where everybody helps each other  audience applauds  
Part of what makes my job  well my job is extraordinarily easy  well the people around me really make it easy  And part of the reason it is easy is because we don t have any committees  Maybe we have some committee I don t know about  I ve never been invited to any committees   I ll put it that way   at Berkshire  We may have a Powerpoint someplace  I haven t seen it and I wouldn t know how to use it anyway  We just don t do  we don t have make work activities  We might go to a baseball game together or something like that  I ve seen the other kind of operation  and I like ours better  I ll put it that way  Charlie  

Munger s response 

 Well years ago I did some work for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles  And my Senior Partner pompously said you don t need to hire us to do this  There some plenty of good Catholic tax lawyers  And the Archbishop looked at him like he was an idiot and said  Mr  Peeler  last year I had some very serious surgery  And I did not look around for the leading Catholic surgeon    Audience laughs   That s the way I feel about board members   Audience applauds  Warren pops open a can of Coke   

If not for Munger s curt response  a listener could be excused for having forgotten Buffett just responded to a question about diversity  Buffett never uttered the word  diversity   Buffett barely even confirmed his lack of interest in policies of inclusion   like the mere mention of diversity and inclusion insult his business intelligence 
His response was defensive at times as if the question accused Buffett of favoritism  or even worse  some kind of bigotry  The unfortunate meandering missed a GREAT opportunity for Buffett to affirm his laudable intentions to establish principles of fairness and meritocracy  This miss was worsened by the misplaced laughter and applause of the audience that surely reinforced the trench Buffett dug with his heels 
The question on diversity did not ask or require Buffett to fire anyone to meet a diversity quota  The question did not ask Buffett to lower his standards  The question certainly did not ask Buffett to introduce self interested gold prospectors onto his board  The question simply asked Buffett to open his eyes wide and free his mind sufficiently enough to ask why his workforce does not reflect the diversity we should expect in an American company 
The diversity question tried to speak the language of business in pointing out that the company is likely forgoing valuable business opportunities by behaving in such an insular manner  We should no longer accept that fairness among friends  associates  and others who look and think like the leader equates to fairness in the absolute  Not in America 
In other words  the diversity question looks beyond active discrimination to ask corporate leaders to commit to ensuring their companies are proactively reaching out to a diverse pool of qualified candidates  This question has hung in America s atmosphere for DECADES now  Those of us looking forward to a truly inclusive country suffer from a dream deferred 
The diversity question seeks to break the self reinforcing dynamics of building a workforce out of personal familiarity  Berkshire seems locked into an entrenched workplace dynamic  I fully understand the benefits of retaining a core group of proven talent  No responsible manager would intentionally let such a team dissolve or contract 
However  Buffett s defense of his dedicated crew of superstars missed the core question  when it comes time to hire someone new  for whatever reason  is Buffett willing to look beyond the limited recommendations born out of personal familiarity  A simple  yes  could have put to rest a lot of concerns 
Buffett demonstrated a similar tone deafness when talking about the extended tenure of Berkshire s managers  In responding to an earlier question  Buffett proudly proclaimed that his managers have had very long tenures because they enjoy their jobs and do not work for the money  Buffett also quipped that he constantly reminds the board that the lack of a retirement age has contributed to this low turnover 
So why not in response to the diversity question simply assure the audience that the selection process for replacing the few departing managers includes the broadest practical pool of qualified candidates  Instead  Buffett insisted on demonstrating that he rewards this loyalty with a related commitment to managerial stasis  The lack of change at the top comes through loud and clear in the following quote from the end of the 2015 letter to shareholders in the annual report 

 Can you imagine another very large company   we employ 361 270 people worldwide   enjoying that kind of employment stability at headquarters  At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people   and they have stayed with us  Moreover  no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed  That s why you ve never read about  restructuring  charges at Berkshire  

Mr  Buffett  you need more diversity 
The diversity question recognizes that opportunity suffers when leaders lack the vision to understand the potential improvement from an expanded search for talent  This quest does not require consultants  but it does require a fundamental dissatisfaction with a status quo of benign neglect  This quest requires an expanded appreciation for what it means to exercise concern for the health and economic well being of the country  This quest requires tonal sensitivity 
Munger s response to the diversity question was particularly unfortunate  Munger refocused the audience back to the original question of diversity  but he blanketed the issue with a myopic  sub optimal viewpoint  His recount of the insulted Archbishop implied that seeking diversity requires lowering standards in order to benefit one s chosen group of identification or affinity  Munger s Senior Partner was not talking about diversity  A diversity question would have asked the Archbishop to give the legal firm a fair and equal opportunity at winning the business even though the leadership did not belong to the Roman Catholic Church  By twisting the story around  Munger proved himself to be as tone deaf as Buffett 
Perhaps the most unfortunate reference in the response appeared when Buffett struck a glancing blow at the now maligned Theranos  Theranos is a biotech firm founded and led by Elizabeth Holmes  Holmes dropped out of Stanford and rose to fame by pursuing her vision of democratizing medicine by making lab testing accessible to everyone  Over the past year or so  the company has faced increased scrutiny from the Wall Street Journal and regulators for its medical practices  The Department of Justice is even investigating Theranos for fraud  Regulators may ban Holmes  and her CEO  from owning or running a lab for two years   a move that would surely end her career in the medical field and completely destroy her credibility 
By choosing the big name   celebrity  board of Theranos as a presumed example where diversity does not work  Buffett implied to the discerning listener Theranos is also an example of what happens when a woman is allowed to run the show without proper supervision  Now  I am pretty sure Buffett did NOT intend that we make such an inference  I believe he was singly targeting the incompetence of a board that was not selected for the right reasons  However  a modicum of understanding of the question at hand with diversity would have helped Buffett steer clear of this unnecessary and questionable diversion 
I cannot say it enough  diversity is not about stuffing boards with self interested  unqualified egomaniacs or about removing people from their jobs and replacing them according to some prescribed formula  The diversity question is about understanding the necessary link between the health of American business with the health of the pipeline of opportunity for the broad spectrum of America s people  I fundamentally refuse to believe that comprehension of the true meaning and value of diversity is beyond the grasp of a man like Warren Buffett who has otherwise proven himself dedicated to doing the right thing  to promoting confidence and optimism in the strength of America  and to singing the praises of hard work and clarity of thought 
My heart felt claim for Warren Buffett  you are NOT out of options 

The performance of Berkshire Hathaway  BRKB  surely speaks for itself  Yet  should that success also seal the company from the diversity question

38007,259522,SLB,Possible Rare Bull Market Signal,opinion,"Market uncertainty is as thick as San Francisco fog 
You knew that August was going to be a trickier month than normal  but I doubt you were betting on a 1 000 point pullback in the Dow Industrials  The pillars of the market finally succumbed to the growing worries of China growth  falling oil prices and FOMC rate hike uncertainty  The weak internals of the stock market could no longer hold it up  and the break was swift and on massive selling volume  The markets did shave half of their recent losses in a bounce Thursday and Friday  but unfortunately  the buying volumes late in the week did not offset the strength of the selling earlier in the week  The uncertainties in the market will be difficult to clear this time around  China is a much bigger problem than Greece  and the Fed s playbook now looks as predictable as a Wes Andersen screenplay   V  bottoms in times as uncertain as these are rare  there is too much volatility and too many short  and mid term negative returns across the asset classes to not think we will retest the lows  Also adding to worries is September is seasonally the weakest month of returns on the equity calendar  so enjoy the safety of your extra cash  turn up the Green Day  and  Wake me up when September ends  
JPMorgan s Trading Desk weekly commentary sums up last week well  Markets take on a life of their own  The S P 500 swings and gyrations remain dramatically incongruous w changes in underlying fundamentals and while that statement provides cold comfort for the legions of investors sitting on steep losses it does help put the recent volatility into context  Subtle but dramatic shifts in market structure  stale reactionary playbooks  in particular the specious conflation of the SHCOMP w Chinese growth and the price of oil w  global economic activity   thin liquidity and attendance  and a vacuum of news have all contributed to the sharp swings of the last few weeks  To be sure  the fundamental landscape is undergoing some adjustment but the pace is much more evolutionary and gradual than one would think simply by observing the SPX in the latter part of August  The real damage inflicted on stocks can t be ignored   no matter how stale and unjustified the Chinese concerns may be they had a material effect on prices  However  despite deafening claims to the contrary and panicked behavior  a 2008 like crisis isn t in the offing  Stock bulls should be comforted by fundamentals much stronger than many appreciate and investor sentiment more negative than it s been in years
What was the damage   14 4  recent high to the lows on Monday  followed by a 9 7  bounce 

In the last two weeks the stock market put on quite a show  Many months of sideways boredom was finally ended with a dramatic breakdown and a scary drop of  14 4   intraday for  NYSE SPY   from the all time high in July  From that low  SPY then rebounded nearly  10   On the chart above we can see that volume contracted on every day of the rebound  and on Friday the advance stalled  Note that the 50 EMA is still above the 200 EMA  which by my definition means that this index is still in a bull market  but keep in mind that  as long as price remains below those EMAs  they will continue to converge and the downside crossover will take place  The 50 200 EMA separation for the S P 500 Equal Weight ETF  RSP  is only  0 09  so a downside crossover  Death Cross  is virtually guaranteed next week  unless  of course  the rally continues its furious ascent
A little data mining shows it is tough to make money when the Death Cross happens so close to the highs 

Sorting the August returns through Friday shows the month s damage has also taken most YTD returns negative  Even the top group  Biotech  swallowed a bitter pill this month 

But even with all the gloom and doom  a full out Bear Market seems difficult to achieve according to these stats from Citigroup 

But not a time to throw caution into the wind and BUY blindly according to Allianz s chief economic advisor  Mohamed El Erian 
 Low enough means a lot lower than here because they ve been inflated well beyond fundamentals by central bank policies  so in order to bring people back in you ve got to overshoot the fundamentals on the down side to induce people back in   he told CNBC s  Squawk Box  
 We are still well above what would be warranted by fundamentals  There has been this enormous faith in central banks  and that faith in central banks means we have borrowed returns and growth from the future  hoping that central banks will be able to hand off to higher growth  That has not happened  
What are the BIG risks Portfolio Managers are most focused on 

Worries about the Fed have increased as confusion surrounding the first rate hike have risen  But according to the Fed s  Fischer  comments over the weekend  the FOMC still plans on raising rates soon 
 Given the apparent stability of inflation expectations  there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding inflation down oil prices and import prices  particularly dissipate further   Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Saturday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City s annual economic symposium 
Ditto for the comments from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President  Loretta Mester   I want to take the time I have between now and the September meeting to evaluate all the economic information that s come in  including recent volatility in markets and the reasons behind that   Ms  Mester said   But it hasn t so far changed my basic outlook that the U S  economy is solid and it could support an increase in interest rates  
The Fed must still be focused on the U S  job situation  which continues to improve   Fullcarry   Jobs Hard to Get  less  Jobs Plentiful  hits new cycle lows  great news if it weren t August

Meanwhile  international finance ministers continue to bait the Federal Reserve   The U S  should move quickly to raise interest rates to reduce global uncertainty and speculation in financial markets world wide   Indonesia s finance minister said Wednesday   It s better for the U S  to make a decision   Bambang Brodjonegoro  finance minister of the world s fourth most populous country  said in an interview   Because what makes the financial markets volatile is the uncertainty  
Focusing more on Emerging Market equities  Mark Mobius also urges caution  Mark Mobius says investors should hold off from buying developing nation shares as a rebound from six year lows will be shortlived amid widening price swings   We have a little bit to go before we see stabilization  but volatility will remain   Mobius  chairman of the emerging markets group at Franklin Templeton Investments  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television   We are sitting on cash    Investors should wait for markets to stabilize instead of rushing to buy  Mobius said  Chinese policy makers could use monetary and fiscal policies  including easing banks  reserve requirements  to boost equities  he said 
The new news over the weekend out of China was that it would put its Plunge Protection Team in timeout  and will no longer try to support its stock markets  Instead it will focus on punishing those profiting from shorting the markets  China s government has decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market through large scale share purchases  and will instead intensify efforts to find and punish those suspected of  destabilizing the market   according to senior officials  For two months  a  national team  of state owned investment funds and institutions has collectively spent about  200bn trying to prop up a market that is still down 37 percent since its mid June peak 
Last week s equities collapse  which prompted a rout in global markets  was partly blamed on authorities  apparent decision to refrain from the share purchases they had been making since early July  After standing on the sidelines for more than a week  the government resumed large scale stock buying in the last hour of trade on Thursday  This helped to lift the Shanghai benchmark index from a small loss to end the day up more than 5 percent  The market rose by almost 5 per cent again on Friday  Traders and officials said the latest intervention was aimed at providing a  positive market environment  in preparation for a big military parade this week to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the  victory of the Chinese people s war of resistance against Japanese aggression   Senior financial regulatory officials insist that this was an anomaly  and that the government will refrain from further large scale buying of equities 
Instead  authorities are planning to sharpen their focus on investigating and punishing individuals and institutions they believe have taken advantage of the state bailout to make profits or have obstructed the government s attempts to shore up the market 
The Tianjin explosion highlighted the dangers of growing from an emerging to a developed economy too quickly  The catastrophe in Tianjin has stunned a nation inured to living with one of the worst industrial safety records in the world  By the government s own count  more than 68 000 people were killed in such accidents last year   nearly 200 every day  most of them poor  powerless and far from China s boom towns 
But the Aug  12 blasts at Rui Hai were different  because they occurred so close to middle class neighborhoods in one of China s most prosperous cities  a modern metropolis of 15 million just a half hour ride from Beijing on gleaming high speed trains  And they unfolded nearly in real time online  with dramatic video shared widely across social media before censors could stop it  Criticism of the party s management of the economy had already been on the rise  with growth at its slowest pace in a quarter century and the stock market reeling since early summer  Now the explosions have prompted broader questions about whether party officials who operate with few checks on their authority can pursue development without endangering public health and safety 
China may not be a big growth engine for the U S  economy  but it is for the World economy  As China s markets fall and drag down global equities  the underlying concern is undoubtedly how much a slowdown in the Chinese economy will affect the rest of the world  Since the 2008 global financial crisis  China has notably emerged as one of the twin engines of world growth  China has contributed as much to world GDP growth as the U S  in the past decade and a half  and even more than the world s biggest economy since the 2008 financial crisis  according to the IMF  Indeed  the IMF projects that China will generate around double what the U S  contributes to world output until the end of the decade  Together  the U S  and China are expected to generate as much world output as the rest of the world put together 
Prior to China integrating with the world economy  the U S  was the biggest and sole engine of global growth as it accounted for nearly a quarter of world GDP  based on market exchange rates  So  it s the rapid growth of China  which rose from accounting for a mere 2  of world GDP in 1995 to around 15  now  that helped the world economy grow so quickly in the 2000s  As China slows from the nearly 10  growth rate that it clocked in the first three decades of its reform period  which began in 1979  to what is thought to be a more sustainable 7  or so  the world economy is likely to slow with it  The main areas where the impact will be felt would include not only commodities  but also consumer goods  including luxury goods

38008,259523,SLB,Will Earnings Pessimism Work In The S P 500 s Favor This Season ,opinion,"In a word  or words    Yes  yes it does  and we can thank the weekly Bespoke Report for the background and analysis 
In this week s Bespoke Report  the Bespoke crew addressed the negative sentiment surrounding Q3  15 earnings season  and compared S P 500 returns to the negative sentiment 
Some conclusions 
 In the 19 prior quarters where analysts were more negative than positive  the S P 500 averaged a gain of 2 32    median  3 64   with positive returns 84  of the time  
 Finally  the worst S P 500 performance during earnings season comes when the net revisions spread was positive heading into earnings season  
 My comment  Bespoke s  net revisions spread  is an S P 1500 measure that tracks negative versus positive EPS revisions similar to what I have shared with readers here in this spreadsheet    over the years  Readers have seen this spreadsheet before  and it provides a good historical record of positive versus negative analyst revisions 
The blocks highlighted represent the peak earnings season  usually between Alcoa s  N AA  and Wal Mart s  N WMT  earnings reports  when the bulk of the S P 500 will report  and the comments on the right hand side  are simply my summary of the financial  crisis du jour   which captivate the financial news networks  It is always something  
Here is the rub  kids  by Bespoke s math   at a level of  24   the current earnings season revisions spread is one of the more negative levels of we have seen heading into an earnings season  during this bull market  Looking back  at prior earnings seasons where the revisions spread was below negative 20  heading into earnings season  the S P 500 rallied an average of 4 35  during earnings season with gains each time  
 Weakness in Energy and Basic Materials sectors has been and continues to be a big contributor to the overall negative tone in analyst sentiment    No surprise if you have been reading this blog for a while  
 Analysts are marginally less negative on the prospects of companies with more US exposure than companies with more international exposure  
  when analyst sentiment is negative heading into earnings season  the two best performing sectors have been Consumer Discretionary and Industrials  
Summary   conclusion  While this coming week could be bumpy given October s option expiration week  Bespoke provides some worthwhile quotes and juicy data demonstrating why institutional investors should remain fairly bullish  through calendar Q4  15  The earnings revision spreadsheet  data compliments of Thomson Reuters  goes back a long way 
While some Energy exposure has been purchased for client accounts the last few weeks  I m also preparing an earnings preview of Schlumberger  N SLB  and Halliburton  N HAL  for publication and the EPS  earnings per share  and revenue revisions for 2016 and 2017 are rather unsettling  Any earnings and revenue growth for both companies projected for 2016 is eroding rapidly  Both years  numbers continue to get taken lower  and pretty sharply at that  I ve been flip flopping on the Energy sector  trying to determine if stock prices have discounted all the bad news 
In my opinion  Bespoke perfectly captured the current angst between Q3  15 earnings which start this week  and historical S P 500 returns when faced with this level of earnings pessimism 
My favorite statistician  Ryan Detrick  notes that as of October 6th   in 77 years  Ryan is a fellow Xavier alum and someone the school s Finance Department should be proud of  Me  maybe not so much    Another friend  Jeff Miller  captures the earnings worry perfectly in his weekly post  here 
Statistically  and from a sentiment perspective  October and Q4  15 should turn out quite well ",2015-10-12,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-earnings-pessimism-portend-favorably-for-the-sp-500-heading-267761,267761

Last night  the S P 500 futures opened the globex session at 1991 50 down 3 ticks and traded sideways during much of the overnight session  making a high of 1998 50 at 7 30 CT after a low of 1989 25 early in the Euro session 
At the regular trading hours open  the S P futures opened at 1995 00 up 2 75 handles on the day and traveled higher early  making a high of 2001 75 in the first half hour of trade before sell programs took the morning over  driving price down to 1985 25 at 10 00 CT  At that point  more than 15 handles from the high of day  After rallying during the lunch hour up to 1998 50  the index futures failed once again in the afternoon trading down to 1982 50  nearly 20 handles from the highs on a flat MOC  market on close  imbalance  The ESZ5 closed just ticks off the lows 
Heard across the news today was the retail sales and CPI misses earlier in the day  which added to recent rhetoric concerning an impending interest rate hike  The Fed s Lacker did speak today  saying that he has not decided his position heading into the October meeting of the Federal Reserve Governors  however  he did suggest that recent volatility and disappointing jobs data shouldn t factor into the Fed s decision 
Heading into tomorrow are several economic releases  but with less impacting data  However  Goldman Sachs and other financials will continue reporting tomorrow  as the banking sphere has had mixed results thus far in announcing Q3 earnings  but with earnings coming in mostly in line with expectations  as fears of a Q3 massacre to the like of Deutsche Bank  N DB  s nearly 7 billion euro loss should be subsiding

World markets extended a rally that has added  4 1 trillion to global equities this month  following a slew of weak economic reports that have dashed expectations for a Fed rate hike in 2015  European stocks are up  and Asian stock markets added to the gains  which saw equities close at two month highs  the Shanghai Composite gained 6 5  for the week  After a rebound yesterday  Wall Street recorded its third straight winning week 
The Dow and S P were up just under 1  on the week  the Nasdaq was up 1 7   The rally over the past three weeks has been very narrow  as two thirds of the stocks on the S P 500 are still below the 200 day moving average  Historically  October may be one of the worst months for stocks  but not in recent years and not so far this month 
Industrial production fell 0 2  in September  in line with expectations  and capacity utilization declined  The only major market group to post a gain in September was consumer goods  Capacity utilization fell to 77 5  from an upwardly revised 77 8  in August  a bit above the 77 4  expected 
Consumer sentiment rose in October after three straight monthly declines  Sentiment rose to a preliminary October reading of 92 1 from a final September level of 87 2 
Job openings dropped in August after reaching a record in the previous month  the Labor Department s Job Openings and Labor Turnover report  also known as JOLT  showed job openings fell to 5 37 million from 5 67 million in July  The hiring rate stayed at 3 6   and the quits rate stayed at 1 9  
Arizona s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6 3  in September  The U S  seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5 1  in September  A year ago  the Arizona seasonally adjusted rate was 6 6  and the U S  rate was 5 9   Arizona gained 28 800 jobs in September  which is a bit better than the average of the last several years  but in a strange twist  28 300 of those jobs were government jobs  and only 500 private sector jobs were created last month 
Employment is taking a dive in industries that sell a lot of U S  made goods abroad  and things could get worse before they get better  A new report from JPMorgan  N JPM  shows export oriented industries have been losing about 50 000 jobs a month for most of this year  after adding 9 000 a month on average in 2014  Recent manufacturing surveys hint the impact could worsen  and the employment erosion may extend into the first half of 2016  In effect  that would mean private payrolls growth takes a step down to around 150 000 a month  from the booming 250 000 plus average of 2014 
Yesterday we reported that the number of Americans filing new jobless claims fell to 255 000 last week  the lowest figure since Richard Nixon was president  and the economy was much smaller 42 years ago  Fewer claims for unemployment should mean the labor market is heating up  but we still don t see people leaving their job to move to greener pastures  the quit rate remains stagnant  The economy is growing at about a 2  rate so far this year  that s sluggish  at best  Productivity has cratered 
Inflation  well there is no inflation  based on the latest CPI numbers through September  And Wall Street is reporting third quarter earnings  or the lack thereof  profits are likely down about 5   marking the second consecutive quarter of negative earnings  So for now at least  it appears we can put the whole idea of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike on hold 
The European Central Bank will be meeting next week  Investors are now speculating about when the central bank will make a further stimulus move  rather than if such a move could happen  That notion was hammered home this week when data confirmed the Eurozone has slipped back into negative inflation  which is bad news for both the ECB and the region s growth prospects 
Fitch has cut Brazil s credit rating to the brink of junk  warning the country could soon lose its coveted investment grade due to the  rising government debt burden  increased challenges to fiscal consolidation and a worsening economic growth backdrop   The rating agency left a negative outlook on the new rating  suggesting it eventually could follow Standard   Poor s recent downgrade to junk  A second move into the territory would trigger further losses for Brazil s economy  since it could force many investors to sell some of their assets 
A U S  appeals court ruled that Google s massive effort to scan millions of books for an online library does not violate copyright law  rejecting claims from a group of authors that the project illegally deprives them of revenue  Google  O GOOGL  had said it could face billions of dollars in potential damages if the authors prevailed  A judge had found Google s scanning of tens of millions of books and posting  snippets  online constituted  fair use  under U S  copyright law  The appellate court said the case  tests the boundaries of fair use   but found Google s practices were ultimately allowed under the law  So  scan on 
Illinois lottery officials said payouts for winnings over  600 will be delayed because the lottery s coffers are empty  Illinois had been handing out IOUs for jackpots of over  25 000 since July as the state s fiscal balance continued to deteriorate while politicians bickered over the budget  The state has been operating under a patchwork of consent decrees and court orders  in lieu of a budget  since midsummer  The new lottery slogan  You can t win  even if you do play  More important than lottery payouts   pensions are in trouble  The Illinois comptroller said Wednesday that the stalemate would prevent the state from making a  560 million pension payment due in November 
Nevada says daily fantasy sports is gambling and the companies operating those websites need licenses if they want to do business in Nevada  and the sites could not accept payment from customers in Nevada until they are licensed  This follows a report indicating the US Justice Department and FBI are looking into whether the daily fantasy sports sites are violating federal law 
Wynn Resorts  O WYNN  had a bad quarter  The casino giant announced earnings of  0 86 per share  which was in line with Wall Street estimates  But revenue dropped 27  year over year to just under  1 billion  missing estimates  Revenue from Las Vegas was down 3 9   The casino suffered through an abysmal quarter in Macau as revenue there crashed 37 9   and this is where the story gets interesting  Macau is the world s biggest gambling center  if you re not counting Wall Street  And suddenly the Chinese government has started cracking down on gambling as part of an anti corruption drive 
The government is monitoring debit card transactions and they placed cameras in the VIP rooms  and the effect has scared off the high rollers  Wynn is planning to open a multi billion dollar casino in Macau next year  but they don t know how many gaming tables the government will allow them to have  This appears to be part of a broader crackdown on corporate corruption  following last month s cutbacks in the Chinese state owned energy company Sinopec Group  I m not sure what this tells us about the Chinese economy  but it looks like the fast growth free wheeling days are coming to an end 
General Electric  N GE  reported net earnings fell 29  from a year earlier to  2 51 billion  or 25 cents per share  Excluding items   also known as the cost of being in business  earnings of 29 cents a share beat estimates by 3 cents  GE reported more jet engine sales  but they were hurt by their oil and gas related businesses  GE is in the process of spinning off Synchrony Financial as a stand alone  which will help retire as much as 7  of its floated shares 
Schlumberger  N SLB   the world s No 1 oilfield services provider  said it would cut more jobs and consolidate its manufacturing and distribution network as it did not expect a recovery in demand before 2017  The company  which has already cut 20 000 jobs  or about 15 percent of its workforce  did not say how many jobs it planned to cut in the next round  But don t look for a quick rebound  Exploration and production spending is expected to fall for a second consecutive year in 2016  Schlumberger said it did not expect a recovery in demand before 2017 
Ten of the world s big oil companies came together today to say jointly that their industry must help address global climate change and said that they agreed with the United Nations  goals of limiting global warming  The public declaration by a group called the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative was an effort to convince an increasingly skeptical world that energy companies  whose fossil fuels are a big source of greenhouse gases  are serious about delivering cleaner energy and combating climate change 
The companies in the oil group said they would support the climate conference s effort to reach a global climate change agreement at the Paris conference later this year  even though meeting that target would require leaving much of the world s existing oil  gas and coal reserves unburned and would require the companies to make major changes in the way they do business 
Now before you think I m making this up   in this latest show of unity from the oil and gas industry  US oil giants like Chevron  N CVX  and ExxonMobil  N XOM  are nowhere to be found  no US oil companies signed the pledge  And that s the other thing  A pledge is not the same as action ",2015-10-18,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-wagering-268412,268412
38011,259526,SLB,Market Lifts As Questions About Future Growth Linger,opinion,"We should all be concerned about the future because we will have to spend the rest of our lives there   Charles F  Kettering

In Las Vegas  there are hundreds of businesses who advertise their ability to  predict the future   They come in various shapes and sizes with palm reading and fortune telling the most commonly available  Without question  you can only ponder why their services might be considered  For example  I am sure you have heard that in Sin City  wagering is allowed  You can certainly imagine someone paying one of these prognosticators for advice on where to gamble in the hope of getting lucky  An extension of this idea might be to even ask the fortune teller what team to wager on during a baseball playoff contest or football weekend  As thinking about what lies ahead is also a part of investing  maybe we can expect to see large pension and hedge funds consulting with Elvira the Palm Impresario in an effort to outperform a designated benchmark  In thinking about the possibilities  you have to believe this is destined to be a growth industry for my enterprising state  right  Maybe not 
With the avalanche of earnings reports streaming in from the corporate world this week  some results began the process of considering which companies were best positioned for the future  and those which may struggle  Important stuff  I d say  especially when billions and trillions of bucks are on the line  With most of the investment world pretty firm in the belief we won t be seeing any problems on the interest rate front for quite some time  the focus is now on results  As it should be 
In the financial sector  Bank of America  N BAC   Wells Fargo  N WFC   JP Morgan Chase  N JPM   and Goldman Sachs  N GS  all reported this week  There was strength in capital markets  weakness in trading because of fixed income and currency volatility  and legal costs are subsiding  In general  pretty solid  though when interest rates rise  this group will probably be in very good shape  Next  in the technology area  Netflix  O NFLX  posted a weak subscriber number but was not punished too hard  I guess 65 million subscribers is still a whole lot of paying customers  thank you  Intel  O INTC  posted a better than expected  64 cents   59 estimate  and the chip giant is looking forward to continued gains in data centers and focusing on  the internet of things  for future growth  Notice the key term  future  eh 
Twitter  N TWTR  announced job cuts and ex CEO of Microsoft  O MSFT  Steve Ballmer  also LA Clippers owner  revealed he now owns 4  of the company  I think we are going to see Steve s famous gorilla dance relatively soon  so make sure you look for it  In the IPO market  Square told us they are going to go public relatively soon  raising almost  300 million  Square s CEO is also Twitter s CEO  Jack Dorsey  I am sure Mr  Dorsey is quite capable  but from an investment standpoint  with the competitive nature of both the internet and payment processing industry  it is hard for me to believe either company is something to consider allocating capital to  Public markets are unforgiving and require one hundred percent focus  not 50  
The main event of the week was Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  reporting and warning of a shortfall for next year  Upon hearing the news  investors took the Bentonville behemoth down by 15  for the day  and 30  for the year  The world s largest retailer  by a long way I might add  also announced it will buy back  20 billion of stock over the next two years  In case you had forgotten  the fellows in Arkansas do a cool  500 billion in sales per year  over five times the number of big competitors Target Corporation  N TGT    75 billion  and Amazon  O AMZN    95 billion   For those of us who pay attention to this sort of thing  Amazon is now worth nearly 1 5 times what Wal Mart is  The thinking person might consider why this would be  The answer  my friends  lies in positioning for  you guessed it  the future  Amazon  with it s web services business and no retail presence  is considered to be perfectly positioned for the millennial era  Wal Mart  Based on this week s market reaction  just another low end retailer with no future growth prospects  Maybe  maybe not  but I would bet the c suite in Arkansas is pretty motivated to take on all competitors  Stay tuned 
In the energy area  Schlumberger  N SLB   known affectionately as slob  showed the pain in the oil patch continues to affect the oil services sector  with revenues down 33  to  8 5 billion  The company also predicted the tough operating environment should continue for the foreseeable future  They did expect a gradual improvement in oil prices over the next year  Where have we heard that before

38013,259528,SLB,Expected Energy Sector Earnings Growth In 2016 Just 3 ,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuters data this week  with 172 companies having reported Q3  15 earnings  the EPS beat rate is strong at 70   while the revenue beat rate remains tepid at 41  
The stat that jumped out this week  despite all the positive earnings news from large cap Technology and Consumer Discretionary  was the continued deceleration in Energy sector estimates for 2016 
Utilizing the full year 2016 earnings table provided by Thomson Reuters as of Friday  October 23rd  2015  the Energy sector is expected to grow earnings just 2 7  for full year 2016  and down from the expected growth rate of 9 8  as of October 1  2015 
Factset is estimating 2016 s Energy sector earnings growth at a slightly higher rate of 4 1  as of October 23rd  down from an expected 9  as of September 30  2015 
Moving through Q4  15  I would like to see the Energy sector growth rate for 2016 start to stabilize 
Crude oil remains above its Summer  15 low of  38  although WTI and Brent were both weak this past week  and Energy as a sector was down 1  this past five days 
Exxon Mobil  N XOM  and Chevron  N CVX  both report on Friday morning  October 30  2015  Both of the integrated  international oil giants comprise the lion s share of the Energy ETFs  Energy Select Sector SPDR  N XLE  at 36   and iShares US Energy  N IYE   at 40  
By the numbers  
The  forward 4 quarter  estimate this week was  124 39  down from  125 14 last week 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate as of Friday  October 23rd s close was 16 7 x  
The PEG ratio remains negative 
The  S P 500 earnings yield  fell this week to 5 99   down from last week s 6 16 
The year over year growth rate on the forward estimate was  1 88   versus last week s  2 68    I do think this y y growth rate starts to improve over the next 3 4 weeks  and will eventually turn positive  
Conclusion  Our blog post of mid October  2015  found here  which was mainly a rehash of Bespoke s weekly Bespoke Report  at least the section relating to S P 500 earnings  was pretty accurate in terms of highlighting the market s response to earnings pessimism  As long as the Street continues to be pessimistic heading into each earnings season  that should portend favorably for the market as a whole 
The goal of this site is not to reinvent the wheel every week  but rather aggregate earnings related commentary and pick out the most relevant and salient each week  Bespoke s piece on  earnings pessimism  the week of October 11th  was perfectly timed in my opinion 
Our top 2 sector overweight s remain Financials  and Technology  Amazon  O AMZN  is thought to be  high tech  and for good reason given the continued disclosure around Amazon Web Services  AWS   but Amazon  the stock  is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector  General Motors Company  N GM  and Ford  N F  hurt client performance the last two years  but we continued to lower the cost basis in both names  and GM reported a fantastic quarter this past week  also a component of the Consumer Discretionary sector    Long AMZN  GM  F   Ford reports this coming week 
The reason today s post began with Energy sector comments and math  was that there is not ONE bullish individual around the Energy sector that I have heard on CNBC or Bloomie the past few weeks  When Schlumberger NV  N SLB  reported their 3rd quarter on Friday  October 16th  the 2016 EPS estimate was reduced from  3 86 in mid July 2015 to last week s post Q3  15 earnings report  estimate of  3 10  and 2017 EPS was cut just as harshly  More importantly  SLB generated  1 7 billion in free cash flow in each of the first two quarters in 2015  not too shabby given the decline in the business  More importantly the stock rose 5  this past week  even after EPS and revenue estimates were cut sharply   Long  SLB  HAL  XOM  XLE  IYE 
Every client account now has an Energy ETF and an Emerging Markets ETF as part of their portfolio  There is simply too much negative sentiment around the sectors  but I would like to see the 2016 Energy sector earnings growth estimate start to stabilize

Golar LNG is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company has finally come to an agreement with Schlumberger NV  N SLB   Today  we ll discuss the details of the agreement  what it means for GLNG  how the stock reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from the stock moving forward 
GLNG Signs A Memorandum Of Understanding With SLB
As mentioned above  GLNG is having a great day in the market today after announcing that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Schlumberger  Under the new agreement  the two companies will cooperate with regard to the development of greenfield  brownfield  and stranded gas reserves  According to the agreement  the two companies will work together with regard to investors  governments  and market gas monetization solutions to owners  The companies seem to be working relatively quickly as well  They expect to announce the first project under the agreement within the next two months 
How The Market Reacted To The News
Any time we see positive news with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock  That s exactly what we re seeing as a result of the news of the agreement  Currently  11 31   GLNG is trading at  16 79 per share after a gain of  4 85 per share or 40 62  
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a bit of a mixed opinion with regard to what we can expect to see  Ultimately  there s good and bad surrounding GLNG  Here are the factors I m watching   
The Good   The good news is the agreement  After all  the agreement between GLNG and SLB will likely lead to revenue  Under the agreement  the companies will be working together on several natural gas projects that were previously halted  This is great news as there is quite a bit of product to be extracted through these projects  This should drive some revenue and excite investors  Naturally  this would lead to gains 
The Bad   While the agreement  is a great thing  there are a couple of bad things that we have to think about  First and foremost  global market conditions are in shambles  Sure  we re seeing gains at the moment  but that doesn t mean that the positive movement is going to continue  With resistance on the market  we can t expect to see exponential growth from the stock over a long term period of time  Also  it s important to take a look at the energy sector  After all  the entire deal is associated with energy  When we look at the energy sector  we see more bad news for GLNG  Unfortunately  the price of oil has been at crisis levels for quite some time  driving down prices throughout the entire energy sector  This is likely to weigh heavy on any gains GLNG and SLB are expecting to see out of the new projects that are upcoming 
The bottom line here is that while the agreement is a great thing  current market conditions simply don t support strong long run gains  So  I m expecting to see relatively flat movement and the occasional downtrend while the world market attempts to recover

The European Central Bank announced today that they will hold interest rates at record lows of 0 3   Mario Draghi said the European Central Bank may need to provide more stimulus programs as soon as March to address concerns about the euro area recovery  Draghi said   Downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainties about emerging market growth prospects  It would therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting   Now remember that the markets just love free money  and that was essentially what Draghi promised 
China s central bank cranked up cash injections in its money market operations for the third week in a row  trying to counter capital outflows  The PBOC added  60 billion to the financial system using reverse repurchase agreements  the most in three years  The Shanghai composite dropped 3 2  
Brazil s central bank kept policy on hold  The Central Bank of Brazil held its benchmark rate at 14 25   surprising the consensus  which was calling for a 50 basis point hike to 14 75   The bank has been under pressure from politicians and local businesses to raise rates in an effort to combat inflation that is running at a 12 year high  above 10  
Oil prices moved higher today  Yesterday the API report showed a U S  crude inventory build of 4 5 million barrels last week   about double trade expectations  Today the U S  Energy Information Administration reported crude inventories rose by 4 million barrels for the week ended Jan  15  Now normally  you might expect prices to drop on news that inventories are growing  but the best explanation I can offer is that oil was a little oversold  even with today s gain  prices are still under  30 a barrel 
Russia s ruble fell more than 5  overnight  to hit a new record low of 85 97 per dollar  The country is suffering from the slump in oil prices  which has sparked widespread predictions of a second straight year of recession  Russia s central bank has indicated it will not intervene to support the currency 
The number of applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week to a six month high  Initial jobless claims climbed by 10 000 to 293 000 in the week ended Jan  16  The four week moving average increased to 285 000  the highest since mid April 
The Philadelphia Fed s manufacturing index was in negative territory in January for the fifth month in a row  The index rose to negative 3 5 from negative 10 2
The first Friday of each month brings the report on non farm payrolls  or the shorthand is the Jobs Report  a couple of weeks later we get a state by state breakdown  Today  the Arizona Department of Labor Stats reported Arizona s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped two tenths of a percentage point from 6 0  in November to 5 8  in December 
The US seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5 0  in December  A year ago  the Arizona seasonally adjusted rate was 6 6  and the U S  rate was 5 6   The biggest job gains were found in trade  transportation  and utilities  the biggest job losses were in government and construction  Arizona employment grew by 2 5   65 700 jobs  over the year ending in December 
January 21  1970 marks the day of the first commercial flight of a Boeing  N BA  747  Today  Boeing announced plans to report a  569 million after tax accounting loss as it cuts production of the iconic 747 jumbo jet in half  Boeing announced that it would lower its production rate on 747 8 jets to match demand in the cargo market 
In other words  it does not want to overproduce for a market that s not demanding a lot right now  But demand for flight from the consumer economy are running above their recent trend  And this is really the whole economic story in a nutshell  In short  the outlook for consumers is solid while things are falling apart for manufacturers 
United Continental Holdings   N UAL  fourth quarter profit missed analysts  estimates as a strong dollar and weak economies in energy dependent markets hurt demand from travelers  Adjusted earnings were  2 54 a share  missing estimates by 2 cents  Revenue dropped 3  
Southwest Airlines  N LUV  reported it nearly tripled its profit in the final quarter of the year  The No  4 U S  airline by traffic said its fuel and oil expense dropped 37  in the latest quarter  Overall  the company posted a profit of  536 million  or 82 cents a share  up from  190 million or 28 cents a share a year earlier  Revenue was up 7 5 
Verizon Communications  N VZ  added 1 5 million new subscribers and exceeded analysts  profit estimates even as rivals pushed price cuts and promotions to lure customers away  Fourth quarter earnings excluding some items were 89 cents a share  a penny better than estimates 
Schlumberger  N SLB  reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings and quarterly sales in line with Wall Street consensus  The company said it earned an adjusted 65 cents a share in the quarter  down from  1 50 a share in the year ago period  Revenue hit  7 7 billion  down from  12 6 billion in the year ago period  The company faced a continued decline in rig activity  project delays and cancellations and other problems stemming from lower oil prices  The good news is that it wasn t worse news 
American Express  N AXP  reported its fourth quarter earnings fell to  899 million  or 89 cents a share  from  1 45 billion  or  1 39 a share  a year earlier  AmEx beat earnings estimates  Revenue dropped to  8 3 billion from  9 billion a year ago 
Union Pacific Corp  N UNP   reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts  estimates for the third time this year as a freight slump accelerated  Net income fell to  1 31 a share  11 cents less than the average of estimates  Revenue decreased 15 percent to  5 21 billion compared with a forecast of  5 44 billion  It was the biggest miss in at least 10 years  The weakness in rail cargo probably will last this year as coal demand continues to drop and U S  production lags 
General Motors  N GM  said it sold 9 8 million vehicles in 2015  The results represent a third consecutive year of record global sales for GM  North American deliveries rose 6  to 3 6 million cars  trucks and crossovers  and it also delivered 3 6 million vehicles in China  an increase of 5  from 2014 
Sharp  OTC SHCAY  is leaning toward accepting a rescue by government backed Innovation Network of Japan over a potentially larger offer from Foxconn Technology  TW 2354   A deal with INCJ would allow the firm to keep its technology within Japan and cooperate more closely with domestic companies  Sharp s stock climbed as much as 25  in Tokyo after Foxconn offered  5 3 billion to take it over 
The next installment of the Star Wars franchise  originally slated to debut on May 26  2017  is now scheduled to be released seven months later on Dec  15  2017  Disney  N DIS  did not cite specific reasons for the push  but did note the success of Star Wars  The Force Awakens  The film has garnered more than  861 million domestically and  1 9 billion internationally   the third largest global release ever 
If you believe in math and gravity and other such  theories  there appears to be precise evidence of a big  fat planet spinning far beyond the planetoid Pluto  The clues started piling up when astronomers discovered a mini Pluto  aka  rocky Kuiper Belt object far out in the nether regions of the solar system  with an interesting orbital twist  literally  Astronomers then noticed other objects floating around in distance and in the angle of the orbit relative to the horizon of the solar system  So it was more than coincidence 
Using very sharp pencils two Caltech astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin  not only have validated the existence of this mystery planet they ve referred to as  Planet 9   they have determined both its mass and exact orbit  Planet 9 from Outer Space is apparently about 10 times the mass of Earth with an orbit 20 times farther out from the sun than Neptune  The only thing really missing from  9  is a fuzzy picture and a real name 
A blizzard watch has been posted from Virginia to New York  for a storm that threatens to bring high winds and heavy snow starting Friday and lasting through the weekend  The snow should begin falling in Washington before sundown Friday  with heavier amounts arriving overnight  In New York  the heaviest accumulations will come on Saturday  which is when Boston may get some snow as well 
Last year shattered 2014 s record to become the hottest year since reliable record keeping began  according to separate sets of records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  2015 s sharp spike in temperatures was aided by a strong El Ni o weather pattern late in the year that caused ocean waters in the central Pacific to heat up  But the unusual warming started early and steadily gained strength in a year in which 10 of 12 months set records 
NASA reported that 2015 was officially 0 23 degrees Fahrenheit  0 13 degrees Celsius  hotter than 2014  the prior record year  NOAA s figures showed slightly greater warming  of about 0 29 degrees Fahrenheit  0 16 degrees C  hotter than 2014  A quarter of a degree may not sound like much  but on a planetary scale it s a huge leap  Most previous records were measured by hundredths of a degree 
The El Ni o weather pattern of 2015 produced some of the hottest temperatures ever witnessed across swaths of the equatorial Pacific  Across the globe  El Ni o triggered powerful typhoons  spoiled cocoa harvests in Africa  and contributed to vast fires in Indonesia  California is getting pummeled with floods  and residents on the U S  East Coast are bracing for an El Ni o fueled snow dump this weekend  Because a strong El Ni o still is in place  2016 is expected to be an exceptionally warm year  and perhaps even another record ",2016-01-24,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-hot-one---24-jan-2016-381358,381358
38054,259569,SLB,Bonus Trade Idea  Week Of June 15th  2015,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  provides technology  project management and information solutions to the oil and gas exploration and production industry worldwide  The company is based in Paris  France but we cannot hold that against them  the stock market is about making money  Their stock was hit hard along with the shock to oil prices making a low in January 2105 
The price of the stock consolidated after the fall in a  10 range from 77 5 to 87 50 for 4 months  before starting higher in late March  It reached a peak at 95 in late April and has been pulling back in a falling wedge  very close to a bull flag  Should it break over this to the upside  it would target 103 50 on a Measured Move higher 
The momentum indicators are mixed with the RSI holding in the bullish zone  But the MACD has been falling  and is level now  almost ready for a bullish cross  A close look inside the wedge sees that there is a Golden Cross  with the 50 day SMA crossing up through the 200 day SMA  that happened Wednesday last week 
Resistance higher sits at 91 65 and 92 85  followed by 95 and 99 33  Support lower may come at 89 20 and then 87 60  followed by 86 15 and 83 40  Short interest is low at 1 2   The company is expected to report earnings next on July 16th after the market closes 
Moving to the options chains  nearby open interest this week is biased to the upside with sizable numbers of contracts at 90 through 97 5 strikes  while the put side sees big open interest at 85  87 5 and 90 strikes  Out in July  large open interest stands at the 85 Put Strike and then from 92 5 to 97 5 on the Call side 
Schlumberger
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 91 65 with a stop at 89  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock with a long July 90 85 Put Spread   1 58  short August 95 Call   1 33 credit  collar  Same as  1 but with options protection through earnings 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the July 90 Calls  offered at  2 50 late Friday  on the same trigger  A defined risk way to participate in upside 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the July 90 95 Call Spread   1 87  and sell the July 87 5 Put   1 29 credit   A levered trade with downside risk at 87 5 and capped upside  but still a 8 1 reward to risk ratio on a move higher 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into June Options Expiration week  sees the Equity markets looking weak in general short term 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue lower while crude oil consolidates in the uptrend  The US dollar index is also in broad consolidation  but with a downward bias  while US Treasuries are trending lower  but might be ready for a bounce  The Shanghai Composite remains strong and rising  while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside short term in the downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts suggest that it will take some work for the SPY and QQQ  which look weak in the short term and flat intermediate  while the IWM trends higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

38055,259570,SLB,Schlumberger Vs  Halliburton  Which Is Better Buy ,opinion,"The two oilfield service giants  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  have now both released earnings for the second quarter of 2015 and both have reported a handy beat of the analysts  consensus Earnings per Share  EPS   Results aside  though  the two companies  different reactions to the oil price collapse gives investors who are looking to increase exposure to energy now that the sector is cheap a hint that  over time  one will prove to be a much better investment than the other 
When companies are faced with cyclical downturns in their business  the initial reaction is somewhat predictable  Almost all batten down the hatches and start to identify areas where costs can be saved in order to minimize the damage  Both Schlumberger and Halliburton have done just that  That move is not just predictable  it is also healthy  It is one of the mechanisms by which capitalism achieves the kind of efficiency that is its hallmark  and usually leads to fitter  stronger corporations when things rebound  The reaction following that initial response  however  is not always the same  A company can continue to cut costs in a conservative manner  or use the downturn to initiate a program of growth through acquisition  Which path they choose can tell investors a lot about the culture of a company and the long term value of its stock 

This pattern isn t just confined to businesses such as oil  where revenue is affected by the price of a commoditized product  In the tech sector  for example  IBM  NYSE IBM  reacted in one way to the recession of 2008 9  while  NASDAQ AMZN  took the opposite path  While IBM was busy continuing to rein in costs and returning that saved cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks  Amazon embarked on an acquisition spree designed to spur growth  The charts for both stocks since the beginning of 2011 show the long term effects of those policies 


 BREAKING   Trader who  Broke the Bank of England  grants first interview
Since 1992 his secrets were locked away in his brain  but just recently he agreed to a private interview  It was all caught on camera  and what he has to say will change everything you think you know about trading  But you need to see it now  before it s removed from the Internet again  

Of course  this is not a pure comparison  as other factors were at play during that period  but the principle holds  the company that sees a downturn as an opportunity to grow is the better long term investment 
In the case of Schlumberger and Halliburton  the difference is clear  Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in their earnings call that they believed that the North American rig count may be touching bottom  but outlined no plans to expand based on that assessment  Halliburton  CEO  by contrast  said in their call that    we will manage costs through the downturn  while looking beyond the cycle to ensure that we will be positioned for growth when the industry recovers  

In fact Halliburton  in announcing their intent to merge with rival Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   had already made that clear  That merger may be bogged down by regulators right now  and may even prove to be a short term drag if it is completed  but faced with one company taking the IBM approach and passively waiting for a recovery and another that  like Amazon  is looking for deals through which to grow  I know where I would rather have my money ",2015-07-22,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger-vs.-halliburton:-which-is-the-better-buy-right-now-259087,259087
38056,259571,SLB,Energy Sector  Bottoming Or Simply Lower For Longer ,opinion,"Since September   14  the Energy sector has gotten crushed and basic commodities have followed 
When this post was written in May  15  the promise to readers was that you would be kept updated on the trend in Energy sector estimates 
Here are two spreadsheets that   thanks to Greg Harrison at Thomson Reuters   can be shared 
1 This spreadsheet    shows the Energy sector by market cap weight last fall   This s sheet needs to be updated  but materially  I doubt if the relative weights have changed all that much  
Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  are the lion s share of the Energy sector  representing approximately 40  of the Energy sector s total earnings weight  and likely an equivalent market cap 
2   This spreadsheet    shows how the Energy sector s expected earnings growth  or earnings decline  has trended over the last 6 months  when looking at forward quarters 
The key quarters I m focused on are the Q4  15  Q1  16 and Q2  16 quarters right now  since those quarters are lapping the collapse of the price of crude oil  and thus you would think if there was some hope for stabilization of crude oil  the forward estimates would start to reflect that expected growth 
Alas  that seems not to be the case  On the Energy estimate trends spreadsheet  Q4  15 and Q1  16 expected growth estimates are still declining about 3  per week  while Q2   16 is still deteriorating at a rate of 5  per week 
To see some erosion in forward quarters and forward estimates is not unusual  but to see it when readers should expect much easier comparisons thanks to the price collapse of crude oil in Q4  14 leaves me uneasy 
Energy and commodities  given their incredible collapse over the last few months  could bounce hard at any time  i e  your proverbial violent  bear market rally 
However  the way I read the numbers and tea leaves  given the continued deterioration at a rapid clip in the forward estimates  for Q4  15 and into 1H  16  crude still looks  lower for longer   Some technicians now see a bottom for crude in the low  30s 
What is interesting  looking at the stocks  is that Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   had a good quarter for Q2  15  and the stock is really trying to hang on to the upward sloping trend line  in the low  80s off the March  2009 low  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  too  Exxon reports its Q2  15 quarter on Friday  July 31   15  Looking at the  Energy Sector  link above  if readers would simply own Exxon Mobil  Chevron  Schlumberger and Halliburton  readers would own 51  of the market cap of the Energy sector in just those 4 stocks   Long SLB  HAL 
If crude oil would break the December  14   January  15 lows in the low  40s  I might start to nibble into a few more of these names 
If I were to rank each of the above stocks for either a positive prospective return over the next 18   24 months  or out performance within the Energy sector 
1   Exxon Mobil
2   Schlumberger
3   Halliburton
4   Chevron

38057,259572,SLB,This Is The Only China Based Trade I Still Like,opinion,"The Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC  plunged 8 5  yesterday  to start trading for the week  The ripple effects were wide and far reaching even as arguments continue floating that the collapse in China s stock market matters little outside of China and does not truly reflect on economic conditions in the country 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  CEO Tim Cook summed up a lot of the soothing words to date during last week s earnings conference call  source    

  we remain extremely bullish on China and we re continuing to invest  Nothing that s happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple s largest market at some point in the future  It s true  as you point out  that the equity markets have recently been volatile  This could create some speed bumps in the near term  But to put it in context  which I think is important  despite that volatility in the Chinese market  they re still up 90  over the last year  and they re up 20  year to date  and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love 
Also  the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow  And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might  And so I think generally this has been  at least as we see it  maybe it s not true for other businesses  that this worry is probably overstated  And so we re not changing anything  We have the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year  As we had talked about before  we re continuing to expand the indirect channel as well  

Cook went on to quote a McKinsey study that estimates China s middle class will grow from 14  to 54  of households from 2012 to 2022  I now put such estimates right up there with the iron ore miners who continue to lean on very bullish assumptions about China s steel consumption over the next 10  20  years  They are using these forecasts to help them look past the current acceleration in the 4 year long collapse in commodities 
Regardless  I think no one should take any comfort in a massive short term loss just because the gain over a year or so is still tremendous  Such a set up only tells me that the market still has plenty of room to fall and reverse course  One must wonder why the Shanghai Composite Index exploded as it did just as China s economic growth rate was finally slowing down 

The Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC  exploded to the upside exactly a year ago  Even yesterday s 8  plunge has not set a new low for the current sell off 

This monthly chart shows that since 2000  the Shanghai Composite Index has actually spent most of its time in decline  For all its explosiveness  the latest short lived frenzy stopped well short of pre crisis highs    Source  
We have heard the  do not worry  calls in the financial news  Take July 27th s Marketplace where various analysts weighed in on the insignificance of China  the world s  2 economy 
China s financial markets are mostly closed off to those outside of the country   foreigners own less than 2  of Chinese shares 
China is just 7  of U S  exports 
A lot of the growth in China was bad growth  credit fueled  over investment  So  a slowdown in China will have a healthy cooling effect and transition China into more of a consumer than producer 
The last point was of course a masterful way of turning an alarming negative into a positive 
The stock market churn has been so unimportant that the Chinese government has panicked and executed extreme measures to manipulate market behavior  We outsiders received a swift reminder of the true nature of Chinese capitalism and likely the expectation in China s financial markets that the government SHOULD  do something  to take control of the situation  Of course  China s manipulation is probably just an overt and more heavy handed version of the government intervention in Western economies to bring order out of the chaos of the financial crisis 

Yet  the extreme nature of the Chinese government s interference makes its stock market extremely unattractive  No true rule of law seems to exist  and the government is free to do anything  including jail people who  illegally  sell their stocks  to accomplish its objectives  Own stock one day under one set of rules and wake up the next day with a different set  Under these circumstances  I am trying hard to avoid Chinese related stocks  even my favorite Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  which got crushed in after hours about 8  after reporting its earnings  Normally  I would be licking my chops to jump on cheaper shares and take advantage of BIDU s tendency to bounce sharply off oversold levels 
However  there is one China related trade that still looks as good as ever  iShares iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  

The latest breakdown in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  has taken the ETF to lows from 2013   Source  
Chinese stocks are just a part of EEM  but I find EEM to be a good theme based play on what is happening in the emerging markets that are greatly influenced by what is really happening in China  Most importantly  the options for EEM seem chronically under priced  They rarely seem to take into account what I think are high odds for EEM to break sharply upward or downward  The 7  decline in 10 trading days has taken EEM past its lower Bollinger  Band  BB   Selling volume is picking up  A sharp bounce seems in the cards sooner rather than later 
I like to play EEM by going long  strangles   the simultaneous purchase of out of the money call and put options  The past several strangles I have executed on EEM have all made enough money on the put side so quickly that I was compelled to take profits  I keep hoping the call side of the trade will add to the profits but to no avail  This time around  I am expecting the profits to come from the upside  But the beauty of these strangles is that I am able to stay relatively agnostic about direction  I care a lot more about the speed of the move 
Here is an example of a trade I might initiate  all options expire on August 21  a little over three weeks from now  the  37 call options sell for  0 52 0 57 bid ask  the  35 put options sell for  0 37 0 40  If EEM just challenges resistance from its recent high  the call options deliver at least a triple and deliver plenty of profit to pay for the put options along the way  If EEM continues a plunge from here  I would expect increasing options premium to help make the puts at least valuable enough to pay for the call options  Either scenario can easily happen in three weeks  Previous experience tells me that one of them should play out within the next week 
There are of course other trades I have referenced that have direct dependence on China  like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and the Australian dollar  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA    However  China is not my  1 consideration for these trades 
Be careful out there

After a brief period of respite   and muted acceptance of the  new normal    to start the year  Putin and company again face a colossal economic mess  From worst to first and back again  the Russian ruble continues its volatile post Crimea journey  Its surprise run as the world s number one performing major currency is long gone and the ruble has  nearly 25 percent since the end of May  and 11 percent alone in August  For optimists and pessimists alike  speculation on the ruble s future is an exercise in futility  To be sure   on its current path   it s not a very fun activity either 
On a micro level  the ripple effects have hit hard  Real wages  or purchasing power  fell 4 8 percent in July and  9 2 percent compared with the same period a year ago  Disposable income is also down 2 9 percent on the year  Unemployment remained steady  but an increasing number of workers are not getting paid  the amount of salary in arrears climbed 6 2 percent in July  Further  there is talk of  pension hikes from inflation  a move that would condemn a growing number of the population to abject poverty should the economic trends continue 
More broadly  the recession is in full swing  Russia s gross domestic product  4 6 percent year on year in the second quarter   a fall that makes it the worst performing mid sized economy in the world  ahead of Iraq and Venezuela  Negative growth in 2016 is looking more and more possible and Bank of Russia economists estimate that western sanctions have lowered the GDP ceiling by as much as 0 6 percent this year 
Energy export revenues have obviously tanked  but longer term sources of growth are also proving elusive in the current climate  Capital expenditures in industrial production and infrastructure are down and continue to fall  Conversely  capital flight may   90 billion by year s end 
It s quite apparent that a business as usual approach spells trouble for Russia  minus some budgetary magic  or a swift oil price turnaround  the reserve fund may  within a year  The solutions are not abundantly clear  but  for the first time in a long time  the costs of changing an inefficient status quo      may finally outweigh the benefits of its existence 
Grumblings of discontent at the top have been quick to surface  President of the struggling Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin is out   apparently of his own volition   and other CEOs  Rosneft s Sechin and Gazprom s Miller included  may see their tenures  in the name of greater efficiency 
Bailout legislation currently in the works  to reduce the strain on nationally significant companies  but the list of suitors far exceeds the available capital  It is unclear whether or not Gazprom  MCX GAZP  and Rosneft  MCX ROSN  are among the early applicants for aid  but Putin has  that current and future supply projects  and foreign contracts  will not be threatened 
Toward this end  a push for technological and operational independence has been prioritized  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  has  into a partnership with Novosibirsk State University on the modeling of oil fields  GazpromNeft is  its own forecasting software  and the government is  to provide import substituting producers with the appropriate financial levers for success  Still  both cost  and time intensive  this is a long term contingency plan that few can count on 
For its part  foreign experience will continue to play a major role  Halliburton s  NYSE HAL  Sperry Drilling  C A T  Oil AG  XETRA O2C   and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  are just some of the companies taking advantage of the increased  for horizontal drilling in conventional plays  Rosneft will look for its newest acquisition  Trican Well Service Ltd   OTC TOLWF   to provide similar  production enhancing  services 
Further  a draft bill  to open up large deposits of oil and gas for exploration   a tacit admission that the old  and oft changing  mineral regime did little to spur greenfield development  However  interest in the blocks  previously off limits to foreign producers  is hardly encouraging 
Maintaining output and market share amid low demand and low prices remains the goal du jour  And  to be sure  the oil and gas will keep flowing   there s no other option  But  for the people at the top  and the people on the ground  it s going to be a long winter ",2015-08-26,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-winter-of-discontent-for-russia-262944,262944

At the end of the day it is all about the end of the day  While oil prices trade below  40 a barrel in crisis market price levels  its taking its cue from the beleaguered stock market that can t hang onto a rally  The world was looking to the U S  markets to lead the globe away from stock market gloom and when it failed other markets could not hold on to early gains  Oil traders are now being dominated by macroeconomic fears  but are still getting some support after a monster 7 3 million barrel drawdown in U S crude supply 
China s interest rate cut was viewed as too little to offset the impact of currency devaluation  The Shanghai Composite swung wildly  sort of like my golf swing  falling nearly 4 percent  then jumped up and rallied to 4  higher only to close down 1 3  and down for the 5th straight day 
Yet  perhaps merger mania could signal that we may be near a bottom  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB  on Wednesday said it agreed to buy Cameron International Corp   NYSE CAM  for about  12 74 billion in cash and stock  This is the latest move by the world s biggest oil field services company as the industry struggles with lower prices and rising supply  The price tag values Houston based Cameron at  66 36 a share  a 56 3  premium to Tuesday s closing price  Amid the downturn in the energy sector  Cameron shares had fallen 42  over the past 12 months  but they surged 39  to  58 50 in premarket trading Wednesday  Cameron shareholders will receive  14 44 in cash and 0 716 Schlumberger shares for each share of Cameron  After completion  Cameron holders will own about 10  of the combined company according to the Wall Street Journal 
In the meantime  the energy complex is going to see if the American Petroleum Institute supply report is a fluke or not  The Energy Information Administration releases its version of our nations supply  Expectations were for crude supply to increase by 1 45 million barrels  Refinery utilization should fall  0 5 to 94 6   Gas supply should fall by 950k and distillate supply is looking to increase  We still like looking at long dated calls  Usually when prices crash like this cap cuts and mergers bring prices back  Assuming that the global economy does not fall apart  I mean  it hasn t  has it ",2015-08-26,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-263049,263049
38060,259575,SLB,More Volatility Ahead And Energy Sector Earnings Estimates,opinion,"A lot is being packed into this one post  Hope readers enjoy the stats 
Two fascinating stats from Bespoke this past week 

 Amidst all of the chaos  the 3 day sum of S P prices  distance from its 50 DMA  i e  50 day moving average   at each close reached  14 07 standard deviations an astounding reading bested only by May 15th  1940  when the Blitzkreig pointed itself at France  

My comment  I ve never heard of the  3 day sum at each close  type statistic  and it feels like a little  statistical massaging  but the conclusion is eye popping  Long term investors take heed  Even though the degree of the correction was about the same   comparing October  14 to the past two weeks   the VIX s spike high was 31 in October  14 and 53 29 this past week 

 While performance over the next week has been positive more than it has been negative  the S P 500 has run into trouble in the month following the  Death Cross   The index s average 1 month return has been  1 38   while  over the next 3 and 6 months  the index has been up significantly  

My comment  At least one day this past week  the S P 500 s 50 day moving average fell below the 200 day moving average  thus triggering this comment from Bespoke  Looking at the daily chart of the S P 500 on the technical software  the 50 DMA is sitting right on top of the 200 DMA as of Friday s August 28  2015 close  Given the rapidity of the steep correction this past week  and the extreme nature of Monday s drop and Tuesday s bounce  it wouldn t surprise me to see more volatility through September  15 as angst over S P 500 earnings surface  like it did last year at this time  
Looking at Forward Energy Sector Estimates
Here  click on link below  is an Excel spreadsheet prepared this weekend  using forward and historical Energy sector earnings data from Thomson Reuters  
1   The top part of the data shows the  rate of change  the last five weeks for the Energy sector for both full year 2016  and for the forward individual quarters  i e  Q3  15 through Q2  16 
There are two data points of note for readers  A   Q2  16 Energy sector earnings estimates continue to plummet  That is a steep drop for that quarter  and even Q1  16  which is a very easy comp to compare against  Q1  15  in terms of crude oil pricing  looks like it could still go negative  B   The full year 2016 growth estimate  while still falling  is expecting pretty good growth  The Thomson Reuters data through September 30th  only goes out as far as Q2  16  Once October 1  15 arrives  we will get a look at Q3  16 expected growth by sector 
The point is that in terms of expected 2016 Energy sector growth   as the data falls now   consensus is expecting a very back end loaded year for Energy sector earnings growth 
2   The bottom section of the spreadsheet shows actual Energy sector earnings growth  If we look at the 12 quarters from Q4  11 through Q3  14  the Energy sector  averaged  roughly 6  earnings growth  with some huge disparities in between 
Energy sector analysis and conclusion  My own opinion is that the Energy and Basic Materials sectors  vicious rallies late last week smacked of  bear market  reversals  That being said  I am doing a lot of fundamental homework on the Energy sector to initiate longer term positions  I thought maybe buying Energy for client accounts at the end of Q1  15 might work  but after taking a 5  Energy position in some longer term client accounts  our earnings work  like the kind attached  took me out of the stocks 
Jeff Miller  the excellent blogger and a friend from Chicago  noted in this week s   The Week Ahead   Jeff s weekly blog update  that investors need to take a longer view of Energy in order to invest in the sector successfully  Jeff makes a good point on Energy  Energy Back in Focus   which is found about 50   75  through the post 
 SeeitMarket also has an  this weekend on how crude oil might have formed a bottom 
My two favorite Energy names presently are Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  
Conclusion  Expect more market volatility through September  as evidenced by the  death cross  returns cited by Bespoke above  However  historical data like this can be wrong too  Bespoke wrote an article about 6 weeks ago noting the S P 500 consolidation that had formed all year  with the narrow trading band  and how when this pattern  broke  it was usually to the upside  Well  that wasn t the case  as the last 2 weeks have shown 
Earnings growth for the Energy sector will be better in 2016 than it was in 2015  but maybe not as healthy as a lot of folks think  If we see 10    15  Energy sector earnings growth for 2016 as its stands now  that might be  huge   as Mr  Trump would say  
The fact is that the Energy and Basic Materials stocks will bottom and turn higher long before the forward estimates do  so watch and see if we get a re test of last week s  37    38 crude oil prices ",2015-08-31,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-interesting-stats,-more-volatility-ahead,-and-a-look-at-forward-ener-263438",263438

38096,259611,SLB,Sclumberger s Perspective ,opinion,"Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  provides services worldwide in support of gas and oil exploration and production companies  They are at the sharp end of shifts in production  and as such have an interesting perspective on the upheaval in the crude oil market  A recent investor presentation highlighted that increased global demand of around 1 MMBD  million barrels per day  annually has been fully met by higher North American output  Global supply capacity away from North America has remained flat  Increased production from North America  from just under 12 MMBD in 2011 to 16 mmbd last year  is of course not news  but I thought the fact that this has fully accounted for increased global demand and not just a portion of it highlighted the importance of unconventional drilling 

OPEC has consequently been losing market share  and OPEC s desire to push back against this loss in behind price drop  Historically  OPE SBI Global Capacity 2 C spare capacity has tracked the price of Brent crude oil fairly closely  as can be seen in the chart on the left  This was in effect OPEC  mainly Saudi Arabia  acting to smooth oil price swings by countering moves up  down  in price by reducing  increasing  their spare capacity  Over the past couple of years OPEC s spare capacity has been falling both as MMBD but also as a percentage of demand as they lost market share to new North American production  Their maintenance of relatively low spare capacity in the face of the fall in price  as opposed to past practice whereby they would increase spare capacity  or reduce production somewhat  is of course what we ve seen The real question is what does it mean for prices in the future  North America is now the swing producer  Break even costs vary widely and it s not meaningful to talk about a shale break even price  The sharp drop in the rig count in recent months illustrates how responsive new activity is to prices  unconventional drilling results in wells with faster decline rates  so new wells are always being drilled  EIA forecasts are for a flattening of U S  oil production this year and a modest drop in 2016  Much will depend on the ability of domestic producers to continue to reduce their costs  which is where Schlumberger and its competitors play a key role Meanwhile  U S  oil stocks are approaching 500 million barrels  almost 20  above the top of the five year range  which makes it a good time to be an MLP with storage assets  The worst environment for energy infrastructure is one of demand destruction  usually caused by excessively high prices  That is clearly not today s world  YTD our mutual fund is  8 5   3 5  ahead of the second placed fund in its Morningstar category and 7  ahead of the category average ",2015-04-20,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sclumberger’s-perspective-248924,248924
38097,259612,SLB,I m Counting On Chaos In The Energy Sector And You Should  Too,opinion,"CNBC s Kate Kelly asked me last January if I was worried about smaller players in the   just plain going out of business  
I replied that not only was I not afraid of the weaker players being swept away  I was counting on it 
As you might imagine  that raised more than a few eyebrows  considering oil had fallen by 51  from last summer s highs to only  52 barrel at the time  and investors couldn t hit the sell button fast enough 
But I had studied my history carefully and knew something everybody else didn t   the strong always survive 
That sounds clich   but I m bringing this up for a reason because this tiny nugget of information   this perspective  really   has helped turn ordinary people into millionaires for years  And it will again 
I want you to be among them 
Here s what everybody else is missing 
Setting the Record Straight on the Global Energy Outlook
Many investors are traumatized by lower  and understandably so  For years they ve been fed a constant diet related to Peak Oil  higher prices  and fear at the pumps  I can t say I blame them  I read the headlines  too 
But here s the thing 
The energy crisis is reaching critical mass  As hard as it is to imagine  the low prices giving everybody else fits are a magnificent opportunity 
It s been six months since the Saudis fired the first shot in the current  oil pricing war  by unleashing 30 million barrels of oil a day on the markets  The glut caused traders worldwide to slash prices and made plenty of OPEC members unhappy 
Yet the Saudis continue to pump oil onto global markets anyway because their real target has always been the U S  shale revolution and the threat it represents to their way of life 
You and I can debate the merits of what they re doing all day long  I think the Saudi government made an unbelievably stupid decision and completely miscalculated the outcome  You may think it s brilliant  I respect your view  Either way though  it s a moot point 
What matters is that the Saudis have deliberately created a short term pricing disruption and  in doing so  have inadvertently created the best possible investment scenario for us 
Instead of sending U S  oil producers packing like they planned  the Saudis have actually created an environment where the best managed  best capitalized energy companies are hunkering down  flushing out the weaker players  and emerging stronger than they were before 
Take Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   for example 
When the Going Gets Tough  the Tough Get More Profitable
For months now  expectations have been that the massive oil and gas equipment maker would get trashed by virtue of lower Crude Oil  Instead  the opposite happened 
SLB smashed earnings expectations  turning in  1 06 per share versus the  0 91 analysts expected  despite a drop in Q1 revenue of 9  to  only   10 2 billion  Not surprisingly  the stock jumped more than 2 3  in pre market trading and is still trading higher as I write 
It s a graphic example of what I m talking about here   the strongest will survive  and profit 
Facing lower prices  Schlumberger s management took aggressive cost cutting measures and actually improved profit margins during the quarter to 24 1   versus the 22 5  expected  At the same time  the company repurchased 8 7 million shares of common stock at an average price of  82 98 per share  for a total of approximately  719 million 
My point is that here you have a perfect example of a company that is doing better in an industry for which expectations are absolutely terrible  The short term price dislocation that everybody is so worried about is nothing more than a speed bump in the longer term scheme of things 
More importantly  Schlumberger will not be the only company in this position  In fact  there are going to be plenty of energy companies that grow despite seemingly overwhelming headwinds plaguing the industry 
I ve already recommended two of them  in fact  Williams Companies Inc  NYSE WMB  and Marlin Midstream Partners LP  NASDAQ FISH   They re up 21 56  and 15 29  to date  respectively  not too shabby compared with the 0 5  return of the S P 500 since I recommended FISH in December 
I have no doubt they ll pull even farther ahead over time for two reasons 
Not a single energy company on the planet is actually worried about being able to sell all of the oil it has 
According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   surging world energy demand will trigger an estimated  48 trillion in investment by 2035  Analysts forecast that approximately 59  of this will be simply to maintain production at current levels  while the remaining 41  will be to meet rising 
I believe that figure is about half of what it should be  though 
When you take into account the amount of capital needed to compensate for aging infrastructure  warfare  and regional security  I think the necessary capital is going to be more like  80 trillion 
The best part of this is that most investors don t yet realize the potential  But they will  More than 80  of all future upstream oil and gas investment will be made simply to offset declines in today s fields 
Meanwhile new fuel and energy supply investment has more than doubled in real terms since 2000  while investments in renewable energy have quadrupled over the same time frame and are projected to double again by 2020 
Some  1 3 trillion was invested in 2013 alone  The IEA is forecasting that figure will rise to  2 trillion by 2035  while annual spending on improvements to energy efficiency will grow to  550 billion 
Factor in the instability in the Middle East   which can cramp supply and bring prices roaring back without a moment s notice   and the case for preparing your portfolio for oil s resurgence is stronger than ever  despite the low prices giving many people pause 
In closing  I ll be back with yet more specific recommendations to play this Trend in the near future  In the meantime  I d love to hear from you if you re following along with FISH  WMB  or our Halliburton  NYSE HAL  lowball orders 
Chances are you ve got plenty to celebrate ",2015-04-22,Keith Fitz-Gerald,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/i'm-counting-on-chaos-in-the-energy-sector-and-you-should,-too-249233",249233
38098,259613,SLB,Energy ETF Resurgence Defies Naysayers,opinion,"Maybe you don t know who Rex Tillerson is  Maybe you didn t realize that Tillerson  a dinosaur in the energy sector  is the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM    one of the largest corporations on the planet  The company that he runs had been the largest in the world by market capitalization up until mid 2011   when smartphone madness effectively handed the crown to Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Strangely enough  Exxon briefly reclaimed the title in January 2013 before once again relinquishing it in August of that year 
When oil prices started collapsing in late 2014  I began to pay more attention to oil bigwigs as opposed to media analysts  The reason was simple  leaders know more about what it takes to generate profits in their respective industries than those who are paid to write reports  In particular  Tillerson expressed something back on December 3rd that has stuck with me to this day  Specifically  he explained that Exxon Mobil could withstand  40 per barrel 
The quote   What you do is ensure that you can invest and be successful at the bottom of the cycle   he said   We test across a range that s all the way down to  40 and up to  120   The implications of such a statement are threefold  First  a number of seen and unforeseen forces   commodity price speculation  changes in global supply  changes in global demand  geopolitical conflict  radical shifts in currencies and so forth   create a wide range of pricing possibilities for the non renewable resource  Second  the strongest and most well run U S  companies in the traditional energy space would be able to take advantage of oil prices at the lowest end of the range  Third  and perhaps most importantly   75  80 per barrel for crude was a far more likely future scenario than  25  30 
Now  let s consider how prescient Rex Tillerson may have been back in early December  He had implicitly discussed the possibility that oil would overshoot to the lowest end of its range at a time when it had become increasingly clear that oil was free falling  At the same time  he had explicitly stated that oil at  40 was still profitable for one of the world s premier energy providers  In other words  could weakening economic demand  unusual levels of oversupply  temporary cessation of conflict in the Middle East and Eastern Europe  a crowded U S  dollar bandwagon and rampant short selling of the commodity trump the will and firepower of  Big Oil  

As if by magic  oil appears to have bottomed out at  42 5 per barrel in March  Moreover  it is roughly 8  higher than when 2015 started  Similarly  the slope of the 50 day trendline has turned positive and the spot price is well above the key moving average 
Admittedly  I had a tough time seeing oil moving any lower than  60 per barrel when the doom n gloomers first whistled the  30 tune  My thinking  Russia s dependency on revenue from the exporting of oil might cause the country to move heaven and earth to prop up prices  Then again  I am not Rex Tillerson  His December 3rd conversation on CNBC gave me reason to suspect that  40 could be the definitive low point  and that strong corporations in the energy space would do well from that point forward 
And how  We can see that a variety of popular oil ETFs   exploration production  services  integrated   share similar characteristics to the spot price in the chart above  Off of approximate 2015 low points  SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  NYSE XOP   Market Vectors Oil Services  ARCA OIH  and Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight Energy  NYSE RYE  have rallied 23   17 5  and 17 8  respectively 



From an ownership standpoint  I prefer RYE to the ones that I mentioned above or other popular index trackers  Traditional market cap weighted ETFs allocate too much to Exxon Mobil  Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   In contrast  RYE incorporates non speculative energy companies from the S P 500  yet weights them equally to provide greater diversification across the space  Don t get me wrong  I love quality dividend payers like XOM and CVX  I admire just how well Schlumberger has always run its business  Nevertheless  when it comes to an ETF that spans the entire sector and offers greater diversification across the names in that sector  RYE is my preference ",2015-04-22,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-etf-resurgence-defies-naysayers-249339,249339
38099,259614,SLB,Oil Barons Say Prices Will Stay Low,opinion,"Oil prices moved sharply higher over the past three weeks  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude has jumped from the mid  40s to the mid  50s  A sense of euphoria is permeating the sector as investors breathe a sigh of relief  The consensus is that all is well again in the oil patch 
But nothing could be further from the truth 
The stars indicate we re in a trader s market  Both of my recent picks  EOG Resources  NYSE EOG  and Synergy Resources Corporation  AMEX SYRG   have rallied sharply with the rest of the sector 

Reality will set in soon  though  Many won t see it coming  but oil shares are going to start trading lower soon 

Seeing the Signs

If   like so many market commentators are saying these days   the recent oil crash was just a flash in the pan and recovery is right around the corner  then many veteran oilmen are going to be eating a lot of crow 

You see  these captains of the industry own the companies at the top of the oil food chain  They re the ones most affected by and most aware of longevity and profitability  Their actions speak louder than any words  and right now  they re preparing for a very long period of lower prices 

The CEOs of oil majors like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and British Petroleum  BP  LONDON BP   both said publicly that they expect lower prices for some time 

Exxon s CEO  Rex Tillerson  has a much more bearish take on oil prices  Speaking at IHS  CERAWeek conference in Houston  Texas  Tillerson predicted that oil prices would remain subdued for the next several years 

The CEO of ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  stated that he s worried there are too many wells awaiting completion  Once they come online  as a result of higher prices   he thinks the pressure will send prices lower  once again 

It s really a classic prediction of the boom and bust cycle 

Now  if only one or two CEOs were just musing about oil prices  I would be skeptical  But they re putting their money where their collective mouths are and cutting back spending by double digit percentages 

And they re not the only ones 

Major drilling and oil service companies   like Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  Halliburton  NYSE HAL   and Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI    are laying off tens of thousands of employees as a result of lower spending by oil companies  They re also working to reduce their margins in order to remain competitive bidders 

Before you panic  lower prices do not mean we re going back to  20 per barrel  Prices could very well stay at the lower prices they re at now  trading between  40 and  60  for some time to come 

Conditions Just Aren t Right

On the flip side  you might be wondering if all of this reduced spending  drilling  and completion activity could lead to supply constraints  which could trigger higher prices 

But  there are three factors that need to fall in line before that s a real possibility 

First  the amount of oil in inventory has to be worked through  The supplies are at all time highs   500 million barrels are just sitting in tanks  pipelines  and other storage facilities  And more is being added daily 

Second  the Saudis need to stop producing at record high levels and flooding the world with excess crude 

Third  the wells that are slated for completion won t be forgotten  There are thousands of them sitting idle  just waiting for higher prices  And  you can bet the producers will lock in higher prices through hedges as fast as they can in order to secure future cash flow 

Until these three  issues  are worked through  oil prices will continue to have a downside bias  despite any short term rallies 

That s the reality that the insiders in the industry are betting on 

Their actions are worth paying heed to before you decide that a bull market in energy is back in the cards again

38101,259616,SLB,S P 500 Forward Growth Rate And The Energy Metric I Am Watching,opinion,"U  Karlewitz  a blogger who does some great chart work and analysis   on S P 500 earnings last night  noting the exact same thing I did on last night s blog  i e  S P 500 earnings growth ex Energy is 7 5   We ve been writing on the S P 500 ex Energy for several weeks 
Karlewitz gives his own reason why he excludes Energy from the S P 500  but my rationale is different  by market cap weight  the Energy sector is roughly 8  of the S P 500  It isn t like Technology in 2000  which I ve also written about here 
In other words  despite the horrific drop in Energy earnings in terms of y y growth   54 5  in Q1  15  Energy s impact on the S P 500 is reduced given its market cap weighting in the S P 500  And its market cap weight when the plunge started last fall  wasnt all that great either  Energy was roughly 12  of the S P 500 by market cap when the drop in crude oil commenced 
Here is the progression in the year over year growth rate of the S P 500 s  forward 4 quarter  estimate  which has me a little worried 
5 1 15   0 51 
4 2 15   2 25 
3 6 15   1 07 
2 6 15   2 0 
1 9 15   5 02 
The normal pattern off the March  2009 market low has been just the opposite in terms of when there are worries over a quarter as there was in late 2012  and the forward estimate growth rate shrinks  Usually with the start of the new quarter  we see the forward estimate start to rise again  This could be more to do with the US dollar strength  since the strong dollar seems to have impacted S P 500 revenue more than EPS in Q1  15   and that is strictly a guess on my part   if you ve been following the  S P 500 EPS beat rates  versus the  S P 500 revenue beat rates  
We mentioned a few weeks ago the Energy metric we are watching  here is an update 
5 1 15   41 1 
4 23 15   41 4 
4 17 15   38 5 
4 10 15   38 3 
4 2 15   37 1 
Q4  15 will be the quarter where the Energy sector will start to lap the sharp drop in crude oil prices  It is clear that the rate of decline in the Q4  15 growth estimates is slowing 
Most of the Energy sector is now overbought according to Bespoke  My intent is to wait until the next pullback in market prices to add to the sector s weighting in client accounts  Current long exposure is Exxon  NYSE XOM   Conoco Phillips  NYSE COP   Hallibuton  NYSE HAL   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Chesapeake  NYSE CHK   More Energy is owned for clients today than at any time in the past 3 years 
To conclude   is a great chart by Bespoke  from their 5 1 15  Morning Lineup  
If we get the downside break  I think it will likely be due to Fed policy changing  and given the way the Treasury market is acting  there has been a change of character to Treasuries and bunds 
If the S P 500 breaks out of the wedge to the upside  I think we ll need to see the S P 500 growth rate of the forward estimate start to move higher as well ",2015-05-03,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-sp-500-forward-growth-rate-and-the-energy-metric-i-am-watching-250365,250365

38138,259653,SLB,Battle Of The Oil Services Titans,opinion,"Energy services companies fulfill every imaginable need for energy producers 
They provide services that range from equipment sales and maintenance  to drilling  transport  logistics  and reservoir mapping 
Basically  these companies represent the  operations and technology  side of the business 
The great thing about this industry is that it s relatively resilient to price swings  After all  energy services are needed whether Oil is at  100 or  40 
These firms will get bruised by a drop in production caused by low prices  But since exploration  drilling  and maintenance will continue globally  there won t be any lasting scars 
Now  there are three major companies that dominate the energy services space  But which one is the ultimate champion 
Starting With the Biggest
The biggest player in the energy services space is Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   a company founded by the scions of two brothers who had a keen interest in finding out what was underground and how to get to it 
Today  the publicly traded company produces over  48 billion in revenue  employs more than 120 000 people  and has operations in every oil producing region in the world 
A few weeks ago  Schlumberger reported earnings and revenue that topped expectations  Margins and global operations were strong  too  The company also announced a whopping increase of 25  in its quarterly dividend  something that caught investors and analysts off guard   In this environment  most would expect cuts  
Schlumberger has a lot of faith in itself  too  It bought back more than 12 million shares in the last quarter  spending over  1 billion to buy them at an average price of  90 per share   10  higher than where they trade today 
Plus  the company is looking to expand  Last week  it made an offer of  1 7 billion for a Russian drilling company  trying to buy assets on the cheap 
Overall  Schlumberger is showing tremendous strength  Even though many would argue that the firm is making all the wrong moves at the wrong time 
A Powerful Combination
Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  also reported stronger than expected earnings last year  And now  the two are joining forces 
Halliburton  the second largest energy services company  is in the process of buying Baker Hughes in a  35 billion deal 
The combined entity will become the No  1 player in the space  at least for a while 
You see  Halliburton will have to divest several businesses that will bring revenue in just below Schlumberger once everything is said and done  But the two companies will be equal in size 
These two companies will soon be on an even playing field  That is  until you look at their market caps 
Betting on the Favorite
Schlumberger s market cap is one third more than the other two companies  market caps combined  Its share price  while lower  has fallen much less than Halliburton s  which has dropped almost 45  since hitting a 52 week high of  74 33 
The energy services leader has also seen its share price fall around 30   but it sports a higher market cap because it makes more money than the other two combined  And it does so with lower revenue  Schlumberger made more than  7 billion in 2014  compared to just over  4 billion made by both Halliburton and Baker Hughes 
Now  neither Schlumberger nor Halliburton Baker Hughes will make more in 2015 than they did in 2014  But Schlumberger may emerge in better shape than the Halliburton Baker Hughes combo 
For several reasons 
First  it s much stronger financially  I don t necessarily agree with Schlumberger s decision to raise dividends in the face of headwinds  but it does have the cash to do so  It also has a stronger balance sheet  less debt  and more cash  These are all good things in a period of uncertain growth 
The Halliburton Baker Hughes combination will be a significant competitor in the field  But the new company will be weighted down with debt  and will have to deal with integration issues for a couple of years 
And while Halliburton is looking fit at current prices  the timing of the deal was not in its favor  The deal was announced when the price of oil was much higher  around  80 per barrel  With prices where they are now  it looks like Halliburton overpaid  And they re also on the hook for  3 5 billion if the deal doesn t go through 
Oil prices may head lower still  but if you re looking for a strong company in the services and technology sector  then your best bet is Schlumberger  A good entry point for buyers would be in the low  70s  A great entry point would be in the  60s

38139,259654,SLB,3 ETF Themes For A Wobbly U S  Bull,opinion,"Presumably  the Great Recession ended in June of 2009  Three months earlier on March 9  the stock market anticipated the modest recovery that is still intact  In essence  stocks began to rally well in advance of the actual turnaround in the U S  economy 
Similarly  the 10 09 2002 10 09 2007 bull market ended roughly three months before the start of the mammoth economic collapse  12 2007   In a sense  stock barometers were  and are  leading indicators of things to come 
For those who wish to believe that stocks will avoid a 20  plus bearish setback on a combination of monetary policy gamesmanship and perceived economic strength  they might want to consider the history of recessions as well as the history of central bank stimulus  With some 50 odd contractions over the last 225 years  one should expect expansions to falter  on average  every four and a half years  The current recovery  Five and a half and counting  It is also worth noting that past recessions required the U S  Federal Reserve to lower overnight lending rates by 3  4  to combat recessionary forces  Even if the Fed manages to get the Fed Funds rate up to 0 5  in 2015   even if policymakers succeed in pushing it up to a  whopping  1  in 2016   wouldn t they have to return to 0  and more quantitative easing  QE  when the inevitable economic contraction returns 
Central bank QE as well as zero percent interest rates  ZIRP  have lowered the costs to service higher household and government debts  they have increased the rewards for risk taking in real estate as well as as market based securities  Yet these policies have not done a great deal to assure prosperity  as median household income is lower than it was in the heart of the Great Recession  Equally troubling  survey stand out Gallup determined that business closings have exceeded the number of new businesses created each year since 2008  According to some analysts  the opening closing business data may even be responsible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  overstating job growth by as much as 600 000 jobs annually 
Nevertheless  the Fed explains that it is serious about raising interest rates in 2015  Stock bulls used to relish this type of optimism  particularly with respect to jobs   You might want to ask the workers at  NYSE SLB    NYSE IBM   Haliburton   NYSE AXP  and U S  Steel if they share the sentiment   And then there is the reality that inflation has remained below its 2  target for 30 plus months  Janet Yellen s Fed expressed confidence that in spite of the failure of QE3 and ZIRP to influence rising prices  those rising prices should gradually reach the target of 2  in a tightening cycle  Really  Do investors even recognize that the Fed projected far greater economic growth than has actually occurred in every single year since 2008  Knowing that  why would anyone have confidence in a Fed expectation of 2  inflation 
There are perhaps three investment themes that make sense at this point in the late stage U S  bull market  First  the entire globe is in the process of stimulating economic growth through conventional and or unconventional measures  Why fight their central banks  As bond yields around the world continue moving lower  the activity only makes longer term  dollar denominated debt more attractive  If you want to buy the proverbial dips  you should probably be buying the bond dips on relative value  Consider iShares Lehman 10 20 Yr  Tr  Bond  NYSE TLH   Vanguard Long Term Bond  ARCA BLV  and closed end muni fund like Nuveen Muni Opportunity  NIO  
The second theme involves buying stimulus driven stock ETFs  WisdomTree India  NYSE EPI  has been a tremendous beneficiary of its own country s unexpected rate cut activity  while iShares Currency Hedged Germany  HEWG  should benefit from the markedly lower euro and the negligible German bund yields that push investors into German equities 

Third  investors should continue to hold prominent U S  equity ETFs for as long as they are still working for them  I still maintain an allegiance to SPDR   Health Care  ARCA XLV   iShares USA Minimum Volatility  NYSE USMV  as well as Vanguard High Dividend Yield  NYSE VYM   If any of these positions break below a 200 day moving average  however  I would insure against further depreciation by selling the position or increasing exposure to the index that my colleague and I created  the FTSE Custom Mutli Asset Stock Hedge Index  One can already see the benefits of multi asset stock hedging over 1 months  3 months  6 months and 1 year  where the combination of certain currencies  commodities  foreign sovereign debt and U S  bonds are achieving desirable results ",2015-01-29,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-etf-themes-for-a-wobbly-u.s.-bull-240203,240203
38140,259655,SLB,Are Energy Stocks Finally A Buy ,opinion,"Is this the time to buy a basket of energy stocks 
Yes  Though I should start by stating the obvious  We are awash in oil  and this market looks to be oversupplied for quite some time  On Thursday  the Energy Information Administration rattled energy stocks by reporting that  
Still  this is not the first time we ve seen a bust in the oil patch  We will almost certainly see business failures as high cost and highly indebted shale producers go belly up  But the beauty of an ETF like  ARCA XLE  is that it is dominated by mega cap super majors and pipeline operators the kinds of companies with the balance sheet strength to buy productive assets on the cheap if we do see forced selling 
Let s take a look at the energy stocks that dominate XLE s portfolio 

At the top of the list is  of course  that juggernaut of all oil supermajors  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Exxon accounts for 16 63  of XLE s portfolio 
Exxon will take its licks when it reports earnings  Consensus estimates have Exxon s earnings  when it reports  Yet Exxon s dividend is more than adequately covered  and it s worth noting that Exxon has raised its dividend for 32 consecutive years  Yes  even during the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s  when crude oil traded at generational lows  Exxon managed to keep growing its dividend  Furthermore  at 3 0   Exxon is a relative high yielder in a world in which the 10 Year Treasury yields just 1 9  
Moving on  Chevron  NYSE CVX  makes up another 13 63  of XLE s portfolio  Chevron has raised its dividend for 27 consecutive years and currently yields 3 9   Like Exxon  Chevron s dividend is more than adequately covered  The dividend payout ratios for Exxon and Chevron are 33  and 38   respectively  There is a lot of room for crude oil prices to go lower before either of these stocks see their dividends at risk 
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  takes the third spot  at 7 22   As an oil services company rather than a super major  Schlumberger is riskier than Exxon or Chevron  As oil companies slash exploration  the service providers stand to absorb more of the loss in revenue  That s okay  Schlumberger has lived through its share of both energy bull markets and bear markets  and it s still here to tell the story  I wouldn t aggressively buy Schlumberger as a stand alone stock right now  but its 7 22  weighting here is more than acceptable 
I really wish that Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  has a larger weighting than its current 4 51   Kinder Morgan is one of the biggest and best capitalized pipeline operators in the business  and I fully expect Kinder to go on a buying spree if some of its weaker competitors go bust  It s worth noting that company founder Richard Kinder started the company by buying unwanted pipeline assets from Enron for a song  Long after Enron bit the dust and became a byword for all that is wrong with corporate American  Mr  Kinder s creation is going stronger than ever 
Has the price of crude oil finally hit bottom  Probably not  But I m okay with that  Energy stocks remain one of the few cheap sectors in an otherwise expensive market  and XLE provides a fine way to get exposure to the biggest and best ",2015-01-30,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-energy-stocks-finally-a-buy-240217,240217
38141,259656,SLB,S P 500 Q4  14 Earnings Were Strong  2015 Will Be Just Fine,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuters  with 391 of the S P 500 having reported Q4  14 earnings so far  The year over year growth in Q4  14 S P earnings is  6 6   thus with the 20  y y drag from the energy sector  Q4  14 ex Energy is roughly 8 5   maybe even a little better given the charges to some of the big banks when they reported Q4  14 
Last September  October  November  the financial media was warning about S P 500 earnings given the collapse in Energy  Basic Materials  and the strong dollar 
The fact is  these dire warnings have rarely come true over the past five years  whether it was the Fiscal Cliff  Ukraine  Venezuela  Pick your excuse  I feel like I m endlessly repeating myself on this blog  but it bears reiterating  S P 500 earnings are  growing on an operating basis  about 6 5    9 5  per year  the last few years  and I expect that to continue through calendar 2015 
Q1  15 earnings growth is currently expected to be  2   including Energy s drag of a whopping  62   so excluding that drag  the S P 500 earnings growth on an operating basis is expected at  4 4   Full year 2015 earnings growth is expected at  2 4   so excluding Energy s drag of 53   growth on an Ex Energy basis is roughly  7 5  
Either Energy Stocks or Energy Sector Earnings estimates have it wrong  
Part of the rationale for my working through the numbers every Friday and Saturday and then blogging about it on   is to instill the discipline of reviewing the data each week  and then forcing myself to draw conclusions around the data  which then helps with the investment process 
To be frank  there seems to be a giant disconnect right now between the trading action in Energy stocks   most still above their mid December  14 lows  and the Energy sector earnings estimates which continue to get taken to the woodshed 
As I told readers a few weeks ago  here  I would be particularly interested in the Q4  15 Energy sector estimates since crude oil peaked on August 31  14  roughly  and traded straight down from almost the first day of September forward 
Here is the trend in the Q4  15 Energy sector estimates since the first week of 2015 

2 13 15   31 7 
2 6 15   32 1 
1 30 15   28 2 
1 23 15   18 
1 16 15   13 1 
1 9 15   4 5 
1 1 15   1 8 

To be blunt  the continued downward drift in the Q4  15 estimates against easier comps from Q4  14 leads me to be in the camp that the a basket of Energy stocks likely has more downside ahead  I am waiting to add to Energy for clients for at least a test of the mid December  14 lows for a number of names  although the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   SPDR S P Oil  Gas Exploration   Production  NYSE XOP  and a number of other names and ETFs came pretty close to the mid December lows in mid January  15   Long HAL  SLB  XOM  but still a small portfolio weight  
Energy stocks have had a nice pop since mid January  15  but the revisions are still ugly 
Here are the S P 500 earnings metrics   numbers for the week 

Forward 4 quarter estimate   120 83
Forward p e ratio  17 35 x 
Forward PEG  12 86 x 
S P 500 earnings yield  5 76 
Y Y growth of forward estimate   1 35 

While the 2015 tax bill negotiation and potential repatriation of foreign cash makes the earnings estimate game this year  absent any significant change in the cash repatriation for the S P 500  I do think the S P 500 grows operating earnings this year again  in the high single digits  maybe as much as 10   which is decent growth for a market with an  energy influenced  17 x  multiple 
Our two largest sector overweights for clients are Technology and Financials  I still like Financials as a top pick for 2015  despite its rough January  15 start   The Financial overweight needs to be defended more on this site for readers  ",2015-02-14,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-weekly-earnings-update:-q4′-14-earnings-were-strong,-think-2015-241913",241913
38142,259657,SLB,Is An Energy Sector Dividend Cut Imminent ,opinion,"The fourth quarter numbers are rolling in  and things are looking great for oil and gas companies  considering the crash in oil prices 
But we must be careful 
The numbers are based on fourth quarter production  and oil prices only began to crash hard in early December 
In other words  the current quarter s numbers are going to be much  much lower  And in order to survive  companies are severely cutting spending 
That s fine for now  But if prices stay low  major energy firms won t have any qualms about taking the next step   sacrificing investors by cutting energy sector dividends to save their own skin 
Cutting to Save
We re in the midst of what s likely to be the most interesting earnings season in a decade for the oil and gas industry 
So far  earnings reports from the likes of Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   BP  NYSE BP   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and even smaller producers like Comstock Resources  NYSE CRK  have been higher than expected 
But in anticipation of low numbers for the next few quarters  many companies are already tightening their belts 
You see  if we experience a low price environment for over a year  energy sector dividends will definitely start getting cut 
Fortunately  I do think prices will start to rise before the year is done  But before that happens  companies will adjust their spending to keep their earnings up in the meantime 
It s a tried and tested strategy  Many companies can cut costs quickly and put off future spending by delaying projects that were on the table  Layoffs and rig cancellations are also picking up 
But there s an upside for investors here 
Oil Austerity s Silver Lining
Some companies   like BP and Chevron  NYSE CVX   for example   are already curtailing spending by billions of dollars  which is more than enough to cover dividends in the short term 
Now  while these tactics may be bad for employees and oil services companies  they are good for investors 
And although it may not seem like it  cost cutting  project delays or cancellations  rig cancellations  and cuts in research and development are good news for the industry in the long term  too  Why 
Because they all point to the same thing  steady  or less  future production 
This is important  because production is the key to a price recovery  If production is cut or maintained  it gives time for demand to catch up  It s really the only way out  and that also spells opportunity for those willing to take risks early in an uncertain environment 
Prices for these energy companies  shares will rise well before actual demand and supply are again at equilibrium 
Ready for a Price Rollercoaster 
Once companies announce that production growth is slowing or falling in the second and third quarters  prices will pick up again 
Indeed  the market is already showing signs of recovery  but the current volatile geopolitical state of affairs means prices are in for a bumpy ride in the meantime  For example 
Prices spiked when Russia announced a ceasefire with Ukraine  although firing hasn t ceased much at all   But this actually may result in more oil on the global market  not less  as the threat of sanctions is reduced 
Iraq is exporting a million barrels per day more this year than last year 
The Saudis  who started this price spiral  won t be happy with a quick recovery in prices  as it will keep their competition   namely  U S  shale producers   alive  However  while Saudi Arabia has the capacity to increase production and wipe out U S  shale  I doubt it will actually pull the trigger since it needs the revenue as much as other OPEC countries in order to maintain social stability 
Ultimately  the energy sector isn t at harried as it was  but we still need to pay close attention 
Price pullbacks   especially to the  40 per barrel level or lower   should be viewed as buying opportunities 
In the meantime  cutbacks are coming   and the price of oil and oil company shares will react well in advance of equilibrium being achieved 
I m off to San Francisco this week  where I ll be getting up close and personal with many energy sector executives at the EnerCom Conference  It will be interesting to say the least  Look out for my real time findings from the scene 
And the chase continues

38143,259658,SLB,U S  Rig Count Crashes Further  Oil Drilling Down By 33,opinion,"In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  Incorporated  NYSE BHI  reported another massive fall in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country   This is the twelfth weekly rig count decline in a row 
This can be primarily attributed to steep cutbacks in the tally of oil directed rigs  which saw another huge crash  Talking numbers  oil rig count dropped to the lowest level since Jun 2011  as crude prices revolved around the  50 a barrel level on plentiful supplies and lackluster demand expectations 
Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 1 267 for the week ended Feb 27  2015  This was down by 43 from the previous week s rig count and indicates the lowest level in 5 years 
Following the latest decline  the current nationwide rig count is now well below the prior year level of 1 769  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12 
Rigs engaged in land operations   which fell by 42 to 1 208   were primarily responsible for the weekly rig count plunge  Meanwhile  offshore drilling was down by 3 to 51 rigs  while inland waters activity increased by 2 to 8 units 
Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count decreased to 280  a drop of 9 rigs from the previous week   As per the most recent report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is at the lowest level since 1993 and is down 63  from its recent peak of 811  achieved in 2012 
In fact  the current natural gas rig count remains 81  below its all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 335 active natural gas rigs 
Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count that rocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014  the highest since Baker Hughes started breaking up oil and natural gas rig counts in 1987  nosedived further  by 33  to 986  As a result of this drop  the current tally is now the lowest in 3  years and well below the previous year s rig count of 1 430 
Miscellaneous Rig Count  The miscellaneous rig count  primarily drilling for geothermal energy  fell by one to one from the previous week 
Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by 9 to 194  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down by 34 to 1 073  In particular  horizontal rig units decreased by 33 from last week s level to 946 
Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was down by 3 to 49 
Conclusion

38145,259660,SLB,Looking At Select Energy Estimates Pre Q1  15 Reports,opinion,"Everyone knows Energy is going to be a mess when the q1  15 earnings reports start in two weeks  first with Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   then Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   and then the rest of the E P space reporting later in the month 

Here is a spreadsheet I prepared tonight just to compare 2015 estimates with 2016 estimates for a few of the sectors  

A couple things should jump out to a discerning reader 

1   2015 EPS and revenue estimates for the Energy sectors looks quite ugly  i  e expectations by now have been reduced substantially   while 2016 estimates are looking for a speedy recovery 

2   Halliburton and Schlumberger actually are showing less deterioration in their 2015 and 2016 estimates than Exxon and Chevron  despite the conventional wisdom that being integrated oil companies  their earnings and revenue streams are less volatile 

3   The mid water drillers like Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG  and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc  NYSE DO  are thought to be in secular decline  but that hasn t stopped Mr  Icahn from holding them for a while 

After avoiding the sector completely in 2014  I have started buying some positions in longer term accounts  i e  right now Exxon  Halliburton and Schlumberger 

Although I haven t put up the charts  Halliburton and Schlumberger  still remain above their upward sloping trend line off the March  2009 low  That to me is telling  given that in 2012  Hallibuton traded down to  30 and Schlumberger down to  60 on erosion in North American margins  I would be prepared to buy more of both names at those technical levels  should the stocks trade there 

Of the two  I probably favor Halliburton given the Baker Hughes acquisition gives HAL some wiggle room on additional expense i e  synergy savings 

Will 2016 see a sharp rebound   I think we ll no more after mid May  15  The revisions should be interesting

38182,259697,SLB,Energy Sector Earnings Update  Expected 35  Decline In 2015,opinion,"The change in expected earnings growth for the Energy sector has been brutal    Readers can quickly see how the Q4  15 compare gets much easier given the drop in crude didn t start until September  14 
For the full year 2015  as of Friday  January 16th  2015  Energy sector earnings growth is expected to decline 35   thus if we assume Energy is roughly 10  of the S P 500  either earnings weight or market cap  take your pick   we can thus guesstimate that the drag on the S P 500 full year estimated earnings growth by the Energy sector is roughly 3 5  
Here is how the individual names rank by earnings weight in the Energy sector  per Thomson Reuters  
Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM    25 
Chevron  NYSE CVX    17 
Schlumberger  NYSE SLB    7 
Conoco Phillips  NYSE COP    5 49 
Occidental  NYSE OXY    4 5 
The point is  the top 5 names account for over half the sector s earnings weight of the roughly 21   22 names in the S P 500 Energy sector  Of that  Exxon and Chevron are over 40  
If readers don t want to try and pick the bottom for the Energy sector   and I suggest you don t   you might want to stick with these names in terms of a longer term buy and hold strategy 
We have no Energy positions as of yet for clients  but the action in Schlumberger  SLB  on Friday was promising  The stock regained its uptrend line off the  09 market low  after Thursday night s earnings release  and on heavier volume too 
As of Friday  January 16th  2015  the full year 2015 expected earnings growth for the S P 500 was forecast at  6 6    Ex Energy  expect 10  for 2015 S P 500 earnings growth  for now

38183,259698,SLB,Waiting For The ECB,opinion,"It seems a good idea about now to recall the stock market of January 2014  a market also characterized by a bumpy start and a sudden drop that puzzled market followers spoiled by the easy  Fed fueled returns of 2013  The prior year s disproportionate gains led to quite a bout of portfolio rebalancing as institutions adjusted equity exposure driven into the red zones by rising prices 

2014 wasn t quite half as good as 2013  but it was nonetheless enough to set off another wave of portfolio rebalancing  Mix in some legitimate fears about slowing economic growth with the fears that falling prices usually awaken  and we again have a fright about what the year will bring  Similar to last year  the stock market failed the  first five days test   thought of as a harbinger for the year s performance  and is also headed for a negative month  though neither of those omens proved accurate in 2014 

Not every year s rally is brought up short by calendar rebalancing  but the current market is missing some of the high octane fuel that keeps markets going around the annual turns  Valuations aren t cheap  despite the perennial equity fund manager protestation that they re  reasonable   Most of all  the fall of 2014 lacked the spark of boundless optimism that new programs of quantitative easing have set off in previous years  Nor did it have another surprise about face from the Fed  like the one in September 2013 that launched the market back on its way to half of that year s gains 

In fact  this January lacked any momentum at all  as even the perennial Santa Claus rally faded at the finish and left the S P 500 index with a rare  though minimal  December decline  Small wonder that smaller gains could still lead to rebalancing and help fuel modest losses at the outset of the year 

Other factors are at work of course  not least of which is the confidence damaging plunge in oil prices  Lower energy costs are generally an economic good  but like a falling currency the benefits can take time to work their way into the economy  The current 45 degree plunge  another example of a one way trade run amuck  has had its initial effects by fanning fears about fading economic growth and failed bond principal payments  Waves of job and budget cuts in the energy sector are following  such as Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  decision last week to axe 9 000 workers  The energy sector and energy related activity has been one of the few sources of decent new jobs in the current U S  recovery  particularly in manufacturing 

The supply demand picture in oil isn t as out of balance as the recent momentum would have it  nor was it in 2008  when surging prices hit  150 a barrel  At that time every story of a refinery fire or unplanned shutdown   both common occurrences in a dirty  dangerous industry   would immediately set prices on another spike higher  Now every story of increased supply or pause in demand that might have been welcome a year ago is another fright for traders 

Put Wednesday s release of December retail sales   a big decline with a miss of consensus   into this volatile environment and you have an easy to understand story about anxiety selling  even if the logic is a bit confused  the month s sales were much better than the headline number would have you think  as you can see in The Economic Beat below   Friday s rally didn t have much logic either  being based primarily on the less than fundamental reasons of 1  breaking up a 5 day losing streak  and 2  fresh hopes for central bank liquidity  namely the promise hope that President Mario Draghi will finally emerge from another European Central Bank  ECB  meeting with a new QE program this coming Thursday 

Certainly the fourth quarter earnings season isn t helping much  The current  blended  earnings rate for the quarter  according to   is a very meager 0 6   The blended rate  a mix of estimated and actual results  is at this early stage almost entirely based on estimates  Earnings aren t really expected to be quite that low  of course  as the necessary  positive surprise  factor requires a cushion of 300 400 basis points  But it s the lowest expectation since the results for last year s weather scarred first quarter  one not helped by last week s string of disappointing results from the big banks  2014 could end up with less than 6  earnings growth overall  the current FactSet estimate is for 5 1    The estimate for the first quarter of 2015 is for only 1 8  growth with three months still to go  strongly implying the Street is actually expecting it to be negative 

Weak earnings growth isn t a wonderful foundation for rising stock prices  yet the next two weeks could see some rally attempts notwithstanding  To begin with  the market is technically oversold   not as much as it before Friday s rebound  not so much that it makes further declines improbable  but enough that traders will still be looking for a reversal opportunity  In the second place  there are two important central bank meetings before the month is over   the aforementioned ECB event  and the Federal Reserve s get together the last week of the month  It s mad to bet on policy decisions  as the maladroit surprise move by the Swiss central bank showed   we changed our mind about the currency  Sorry     I freely admit that I don t know what the ECB will do  though it s pretty obvious that the Draghi camp wants to do one thing and the German group doesn t 

The Federal Reserve of Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen has grown steadily more solicitous of the financial markets  and its policy committee  the FOMC  seems to have fallen into the trap notion that it really can steer the markets and the economy  Hence any further selling that might get set off by another ECB admission that it s still stuck on the can t agree on anything but further thinking stage  weak earnings and or falling oil prices might provoke the FOMC into issuing another ultra dovish communiqu  designed to soothe the troubled waters  Our central bank can t get away with this kind of thing forever  but like most traders  it seems inclined to keep pushing the button until it doesn t work anymore 

It s a good time for caution  I don t think the equity bull has been killed quite yet  though these things are admittedly difficult to discern in real time  and the stock market and the business cycles aren t getting old  they are old  Such creatures may not die of pure old age  but they certainly don t get new life from it either  Yet bear markets almost never take hold in the spring  and a couple of benign central meetings could be all that it takes to have the S P at 2100 and people talking about Fortress America again 

The Economic Beat

The report of the week was surely the retail sales report  coming as it did with a result of   0 9   that was far short of the consensus for a mild decline of   0 1   overall and a gain of 0 6  excluding autos and gas   the latter result also coming up far short with a loss of 0 3   Revisions to November were downward 

The December report was actually much better than it looked  The seasonally adjusted numbers were not good and shouldn t be ignored  but the December and quarterly year on year comparisons for unadjusted numbers were both fine  if not awe inspiring  The November December total was in line with previous years  Sales growth should be approximately 4  in 2014  compared to 4 1  in 2013  There hasn t been any change in the trend 

As I said at the time  November retail sales weren t as good as they looked  but the release of a provisional  0 7  versus an estimated  0 4  set stocks on fire  Now that number has been revised back to 0 4  and though December sales weren t as bad as they looked  the report sent the market plunging  The tape giveth and the tape taketh away  The S P closed at 2026 the day before the November report  and a month later is now at 2019 

December industrial production was reported out with a slight decline of 0 1   pulled down by utilities   7 3   but also consumer goods   1 1    while construction put in an improbable gain of  1 4   A balmy December was clearly at work  and the seasonally adjusted results might be taken with a grain of salt   look for a typically big rebound from the utility sector in January  Manufacturing was up a reasonable 0 3  on the month  finishing the year with a respectable 4 9  gain  the same as the total index 

Results were also mixed on the industrial survey side  Philadelphia reported a weaker than expected result of 6 3  zero is neutral and the consensus was for 20 0  If the survey follows its historical pattern  it won t reverse its weakening trend until it dips below zero again  New York reported a similar result of 9 5  the main difference being that the expectation was for a result of 5 0  As these surveys are rough measures  one shouldn t make too much of the odd point or two 

There doesn t seem to be any inflation pressure  going by the producer  PPI  and consumer  CPI  price indices for December   Disinflation   the middle ground between inflation and deflation  is now the operative word  The PPI reported 2014 at  1 1  overall   2 1  excluding food and energy but with goods having a reading of   1 1    CPI showed the year s reading at only  0 7   with the  core  rate  excluding food and energy  at  1 6   The numbers are subject to some revision  and the plunge in oil prices put downward pressure on them that may reverse later in 2015  That said  there certainly isn t any impetus from that nook of the data for rate increases from the central bank 

That fall in energy prices led to boffo sentiment numbers  with the University of Michigan consumer measure at an eleven year high of 98 4 and the small business optimism number at an eight plus year high of 100 4  All of these sentiment measure are a better measure of the path we ve been on than the one we re on  So long as energy prices remain low  in particular gasoline  we should keep seeing good sentiment results 

The labor turnover survey showed that job openings rose to a new high   prominently reported in the media   but that the rate fell  almost completely unreported  Weekly claims showed a little bit of lift  both results probably being influenced by weakness in the energy sector  It s too early to draw any conclusions 

Next week stars the ECB meeting and announcement on Thursday as the week s highlight  It may seem odd for that to be the pivotal U S  event  but central bank liquidity has after all been the defining credo of the cycle  and it might also make better reading than U S  profit growth  The rest of the week should be dominated by earnings  with housing news leading the way on the economic data  The latter should get a boost   probably an exaggerated one  given the frigidity of December 2014   from the warmer than usual weather last month  The homebuilder sentiment index is Tuesday  followed by housing starts on Wednesday and existing home sales on Friday ",2015-01-20,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waiting-for-the-ecb-238995,238995

Besides crude oil  the biggest loser was natural gas  A particularly brutal winter in late 2013 helped make it the top performer for that year  But even though the polar vortex remember that  dragged frigid temperatures into the beginning of the new year  natural gas couldn t quite manage to ignite the flame in 2014  which turned out to be one of the warmest years on record  Natural gas remains the worst performing commodity for the 10 year period  down 3 73 percent  All three energy related commodities coal  natural gas and crude oil showed up in the bottom five  their first time to do so since 2006  Weighed down by crude oil  which tanked 46 percent in 2014  the energy component of the S P Goldman Sachs Commodities Index  GSCI  lost 44 percent for the year  By all accounts  crude oil s collapse was both unexpected and swift and it looks as if the bottom has not yet been reached  Goldman Sachs recently reduced its six  and 12 month West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude forecasts to  39 per barrel  It s disconcerting to recall that as recently as July  Brent oil set a record for trading between  107 and  112 per barrel for 12 consecutive months  It now trades for less than half that  at approximately  50 per barrel  The sell off is so extended now that crude s weekly relative strength index  RSI  is at 8 5  which is even lower than its RSI during the 2008 2009 crisis  
Where s the Global Demand 
In response to unraveling crude prices  several companies  from the small caps to the majors  announced they would be laying off workers in huge numbers  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   the world s largest oilfield services company  will reportedly be letting go of 9 000 of its workers  or 7 percent of its workforce  Suncor Energy  NYSE SU   Canada s largest  will cut 1 000 members of its staff and slash  1 billion in capital spending  Many more companies have had little choice but to cut costs by halting exploration and production  The U S  oil rig count saw its largest one week drop in six years  losing 74 last week alone  As disconcerting as all this might sound especially the job losses these decisions are necessary to rebalance supply and demand and stabilize prices  After peaking at  10 per 1 000 cubic feet in 2008  prices for natural gas remember  it s the worst performing commodity of the last 10 years plummeted and never fully recovered  which is why you see a gradually diminishing number of gas rigs in the chart below  When the shale oil revolution began in 2009  the number of rigs steeply ramped up  adding approximately 200 new rigs each year  And not just any rigs  but much more efficient  technologically advanced pieces of machinery  capable of extracting crude from places that until now were inaccessible  That s what American ingenuity has given the world  cheap oil and cheap fuel  Speaking on CNBC last week  Nobel Prize winning economist  praised the U S  s drive and innovative spirit   This country is proud of our oil technology and it s been boosting our spirit  our animal spirits   But just as the U S  has provided the world with plentiful oil  the rest of the global economy has cooled  especially Europe  choking demand   The global economy today is much larger than what it used to be   World Bank Chief Economist  recently stated   so it s a case of a larger train being pulled by a single engine  the American one   
Tough Times Don t Last Forever
Speaking to Fox Business last Monday  PSPFX portfolio manager Brian Hicks explained where we continue to see opportunity and value in this low price environment 

Certainly the  oil  selloff is getting long in the tooth and we re actually becoming more and more constructive as  it  continues  

These prices are not sustainable  and  not high enough to replace production going down a few years from now  We think the stocks look very attractive here  and if you look at their performance to crude oil  they ve actually been outperforming since mid December  Michael Waring  CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Toronto based  visited our office last week and reminded our team of the cyclical nature of the energy sector  We ve been through similar downturns in crude oil  Michael noted in 1986 and 2008 2009  most recently 
 I ve seen this movie so many times  I already know the ending   Michael said  suggesting that oil has tended to move back to its mean eventually  The chart below shows the inverse relationship between crude and the dollar  going back to 1984  The current standard deviation spread between the two is clearly widening to 1985 and 2008 2009 levels  But as strong as the dollar or as depressed as oil got  both eventually reverted back to their means  For the past 30 years  the 12 month rolling sigma or volatility for oil is  30 percent 70 percent of the time  the dollar s is  9 percent  Today the odds are high that the dollar will correct and oil will rise  In 30 years  this is the third widest gap between oil falling and dollar rising  But if you look over the same amount of time  you ll see that oil has historically bottomed in February and subsequently rallied  I cannot stress enough how greatly low gasoline prices have benefited consumers  They might also contribute to non oil services employment  According to BCA Research In the U S   the decline in gasoline prices should boost household disposable incomes by around  150 billion this year  with an additional  30 billion coming from lower heating bills  and  decreased airline fares  The money spent  in turn  will generate additional demand for goods and services  This will lead to faster employment growth  translating into more income and spending Disclosure and Disclaimer  Please consider carefully a fund s investment objectives  risks  charges and expenses  For this and other important information  obtain a fund prospectus by visiting  or by calling 1 800 US FUNDS  1 800 873 8637   Read it carefully before investing  Distributed by U S  Global Brokerage  Inc  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries  the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries  The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is a composite index of commodity sector returns  representing an unleveraged  long only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the Global Resources Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 9 30 2014  Alcoa  Inc  1 40   Chevron Corp  1 90   Devon Energy Corp  1 82   EOG Resources  Inc  2 13   Ford Motor Co  0 00   Schlumberger Ltd  0 00   Suncor Energy  Inc  2 13   Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean  The more spread apart the data  the higher the deviation  Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2015-01-21,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2014's-top-(and-bottom)-performing-commodities-239130,239130
38186,259701,SLB,The Fed  Rig Counts And The ECB ,opinion,"The Fed Might Not Raise Rates This Year
Yesterday  I wrote a fairly lengthy discussion on the biggest fear of the Fed is deflation  As I stated 

 The biggest worry of the Federal Reserve  and frankly every Central Banker on the planet  is deflation  The reason is that deflation  as an economic pressure  is dangerous and once entrenched becomes difficult to break  

Another point can be seen more clearly in the chart below of 5  and 10 year breakeven inflation rates versus GDP  While the consensus of economists expect GDP to accelerate in the months ahead  there are many data points  oil  copper  lumber  shipping rates  etc   that suggest real economic activity is actually slowing down  The current trend and level of interest rates confirm the same as money continues to seek safety over risk 

This potentially puts the Federal Reserve in a box given that they are laying the verbal groundwork that they will begin raising interest rates in 2015  However  the inflationary data is suggesting that this will likely not be the case  As I wrote previously 

 During the past 25 years  there has never been a period when the Fed has initiated a tightening cycle with inflation below its 2  target as it is currently  Furthermore  the decline in the breakeven inflation rates suggests that inflation will decline further in the months ahead which puts the Fed at risk of exacerbating economic weakness if they move forward with interest rate hikes  

This is the risk to investors the in domestic markets  The news and data flows have been deteriorating post the  rebound  from the first quarter slump  With the Fed leaving the  party  the realization that a world without liquidity driven support could turn  bad news  into  bad news   This is particularly the case when economic growth is running on razor thin margins and an exogenous event  such as plunging oil prices  leaves a very low margin of error 
As shown in the chart below  the markets have historically had a fairly tight correlation to breakeven inflation rates  This makes perfect sense as inflation should be related to economic growth and better profitability  However  since the onset of the Fed s massive monetary intervention at the end of 2012  the markets deviated far away from that correlation  The risk now is a reversion back to historical trends as deflationary pressures continue to build in the months ahead 

The real concern for investors and individuals is the actual economy  There is clearly something amiss within the economic landscape  and the ongoing decline of inflationary pressures longer term is likely telling us just that  The big question for the Fed is how to get themselves out of the potential trap they have gotten themselves into without cratering the economy  and the financial markets  in the process 
It is my expectation  unless these deflationary trends reverse course in very short order  the Fed will likely post pone raising interest rates until at least the end of the year if not potentially longer  However  the Fed understands clearly that we are closer to the next economic recession than not and that they can not be caught with rates at the  zero bound  when that occurs 
Effects Of Oil Price Plunge Showing Up In Jobless Claims
Economists were taken by surprise last week when jobless claims shot above 300 000  However  the recent plunge in oil prices is the culprit and is now taking its toll on energy based employment with Haliburton  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   Suncor  NYSE SU  and many other companies now shutting in wells and reducing employment 
Unfortunately  we are only in the very early innings of what is shaping up to be a long game  The longer that oil prices remain suppressed  the lower that rig counts are likely to go reducing employment along with it  As I discussed earlier this month 

 This is a very important point as oil prices continue to fall towards the  40 bbl range  As oil prices rise and fall so does the number of rigs being utilized to drill for oil which ultimately also impacts employment  This is shown in the two charts below  The first is oil prices versus rig count  and the second is rig count versus employment in the oil and gas sector of the economy  



Not surprisingly  with rig counts being rapidly  shut in  the rise in jobless claims are likely to continue in the near term  However  more importantly will be to watch the ancillary effects to employment elsewhere in the economy  As discussed previously  given the high wage paying status of energy related jobs there has been a  multiplier effect  throughout the economy of 2 8 jobs elsewhere  Of course  this multiplier effect also runs in reverse 
As I stated  we are very early in this process  and the plunge in oil prices is already being readily dismissed  This could be a mistake given the importance of the energy sector across the broad economy from employment to capital expenditures 
 ECB Attempts QE
Today  the ECB announced that they will engage in a  QE  type program buying  60 Billion  euros  not dollars  a month of investment grade sovereign bonds 
While the markets may welcome another source of liquidity to replace the vacancy left by the Federal Reserve  the are several problems that the ECB will still have to hurdle  The first  and arguably the most important  was identified by Axel Merk in his recent newsletter 

 It should be clear  though  that the negative deposit rate at the ECB makes comparing today s balance sheet to that of 2012 akin to comparing apples to oranges 
Let s keep in mind that anyone selling bonds to the ECB must do something with the cash  QE programs in other countries allowed banks to earn some interest on their excess cash  At the ECB  sellers will have to pay the ECB to in order to hold excess cash  As a result  sellers will think twice before selling  Having said that  at the right price  there will be sellers  However  we are now moving from apples and oranges to bananas   pardon the pun  any amount of buying by the ECB will be more potent with negative interest rates on cash deposits at the ECB  casting serious doubts over whether it is appropriate to state that the 2012 size of the balance sheet is the appropriate size  

This is crucially important  With the ECB leaving interest rates unchanged  the negative interest rate carry makes this QE program much less attractive to sellers 
Secondly  given the fact that  QE  programs have failed to spark  inflation  anywhere else on the planet  the question really becomes  what is the point   The deflationary pressures in Europe are Draghi s real concern  and since QE suppresses interest rates and inflation  the whole process seems to contradict the stated goals 
Lastly  the issue of  risk sharing  has yet to be fully addressed  It appears that the ECB has bowed to Germany s demands that taxpayers are not liable for any losses incurred on other countries  debt  Such restrictions may reduce the overall scale of the program over time and render it less effective 
The problem for the Eurozone remains quite simple  Economic strength is not achieved by  rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic  but by instituting policies that allow countries to reverse course and begin to create employment and prosperity for its citizens  Only then can the wheels of economic growth begin to turn 
Of course  only time will tell ",2015-01-22,Lance Roberts,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed,-rig-counts-and-the-ecb-239413",239413
38187,259702,SLB,4 Eye Opening Energy Charts,opinion,"There was a boom in oil and gas capex during the past couple of years  particularly in the shale oil drilling space 

With the recent crash in the oil price this boom has turned into a bust and there is likely to be further fallout among the weaker  less well capitalized players  Included below  Parker Drilling  NYSE PKD   Transocean NYSE RIG   Noble Energy  NYSE NBL   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  

Rig counts have a lag effect due to the time and capital outlay required to shut down and move a rig  However  the trajectory of the drop in rigs during the past couple of months tells us that there is definitely more to come  In fact  the steepness of the recent decline can only be compared to the 2008 drop off 

As one might expect  oil and gas debt is considered to be the riskiest sector out there currently 

Judging from experience  we are in the 3rd or 4th inning of a major correction in the oil and gas space  One which will clearly separate the stronger players from the weaker  leveraged players who will almost surely be extinct by the end of 2015 ",2015-01-25,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-eye-opening-energy-charts-239540,239540
38188,259703,SLB,Market Week Ahead  18 Things To Watch,opinion,Reasonable people can debate some of the details  but there was little doubt that last week s big event  the ECB s asset purchases  was widely anticipated  Nevertheless  what is striking is the repeated surprises by officials over the past several months  Perhaps it began at the end of last October with the Bank of Japan s 5 4 vote to double down on what was already an unprecedented pace of expanding its balance sheet  Then in November was OPEC s decision  not to reduce production to make room for increased US production and other non OPEC producers  Also in November  the People s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its 1 year deposit rate  spurring an advance of nearly 40  in the Shanghai Composite in the following six weeks  A few hours before the Swiss National Bank s stunning decision to lift its cap on the franc  the Bank of India announced a rate cut in between policy meetings  catching the market off guard  There have been other surprises by emerging market central banks in recent weeks  and all in the direction of easing policy  There are no fewer than eight central bank meeting in the emerging markets in the week ahead  Thailand  Israel  Russia  Hungary  South Africa  Mexico  Colombia  and Malaysia   While the risk is the greatest that Thailand cuts rates  there is scope for surprise rate cuts  We suspect it is a question of time before Russia  South Africa  Malaysia  and Colombia cut rates  The Bank of Canada had its own surprise for investors last week when it unexpected cuts its overnight cash rate to 75 bp from 1 0   It was the first change in rates since the mini tightening cycle in 2010  These stand in stark contrast to the Federal Reserve  The Fed gave investors months to prepare for tapering of its asset purchases  and even waited a bit longer than many had expected  It then proceeded to taper  It did not let an unexpected contraction in Q1  14 GDP distract it  It did not let an acceleration of the pace of job growth distract it  Nor were some bouts of market volatility sufficient  It said what it was going to do  It then did it  This is one form of credibility  The Federal Reserve concludes its two day meeting on January 28  The statement is unlikely to change substantively since the last one in mid December  Whatever negative impact is thought to be spurred by the dollar s appreciation  restrictive   it is more than offset by the decline in oil prices and interest rates  The FOMC s forward guidance is evolving  It has shifted from a  considerable period  to being  patient  before raising rates  There is no need to change that now  The March meeting is a horse of a different color  If the forward guidance is not shifted in March  ideas which we share of lift off taking place around mid year will have to be reconsidered  There have been two data points that seemed to work against the optimistic view that gets one to a Fed hike in several months  Average hourly earnings fell  and retail sales  even when autos  gasoline  and building materials are excluded  were disappointing  Investors may have made too much of these reports  and the data at the end of next week could help to correct the impression  First  within the first official look at Q4 GDP  which is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of above 3  annualized growth   will be an estimate for consumption  of which retail sales account for about 40   Consumption is expected to have posted its strongest quarterly growth in four years  rising by 4  after a 3 2  annualized increased in Q3  Second  Q4 Employment Cost Index  ECI  will be reported  As the name implies  this index is a broader view of the costs incurred to secure a labor force  It includes direct costs  like wages  but also indirect costs  like benefits and taxes  Employment costs rose by about 0 44  at a quarterly average rate in the 2009 2013 period  The pace has increased  In Q2 and Q3 it rose  employment costs rose 0 7   The ECI is expected to have risen by 0 6  in Q4  When the ECI runs higher than CPI  it implies profit margins are declining  With the ECB new bond buying program not being implemented until March  investors  attention will return to politics and economic data  Three notable data points will be provided  Spain s Q4 GDP  flash eurozone January CPI and money supply figures  Many observers highlight the improvement in Spain  and Q4 GDP is likely to match Q3 s 0 5  pace  However  it has been insufficient to slow the meteoric rise of Pademos  which are kindred spirits of Greece s Syriza  While political uncertainty will likely remain elevated in Greece for most of the week ahead  Italy s political drama unfolds  A new president must be picked  Beginning Thursday  and limited to two rounds a day  in some kind of bizarre reminder of the Italy s poor economic performance  a new president will be picked  The first three rounds require a 2 3 majority  Starting with the fourth round a simple majority is sufficient  The first three rounds are about posturing  The real drama lies in the backroom deals between allies and rivals The January flash CPI report will give a taste of the challenge of the ECB s efforts to put prices back on track to reach its target of near  but below 2  on the headline rate  By simply deciding that its target is really the core rate  some pressure would be alleviated  Egos and inertia more than economic rationality lies behind the reluctance  Deflation is likely to have intensified  January CPU is expected to have fallen to  0 5  from  0 2  in December  The core rate is expected to be unchanged at 0 7   low but not deflation  The ECB model projects its asset purchases will push CPI up by 0 4  this year and 0 3  next  Meanwhile  the financial conditions in the euro are were improving before the new asset purchase program was announced  The recent bank lending survey showed an increased in demand from businesses and households  The M3 growth is expected to have accelerated to a 3 5  year over year pace in December  It has risen steadily since bottoming in April 2014 below 1   Credit extension also likely improved  On the margins  this may encourage participation in the TLTRO  The UK reports its first estimate of Q4 GDP  It is expected to have slowed from 0 7  to 0 6   The average quarterly growth over the last seven quarters has been 0 6   Although the two dissenting hawks on the MPC capitulated  Governor Carney has indicated that the central bank will look past the one effect of the decline in oil prices on inflation  Sterling s weakness against the US dollar  where it fell below  1 50 last week for the first time since July 2013  is being offset on a trade weighted basis by sterling s rise against the euro  where it is at seven year highs  Japan reports a slew of data  Even though  the yen seems more sensitive to the equity markets than the data there are three points to consider  First  despite the unprecedented pace of the expansion of the BOJ s balance sheet  price pressures continue to ease  When the sales tax increase drops out of the base  it will be even more evident that there is a poor correlation between a central bank s balance sheet and consumer prices  Second  despite a tight labor market  3 5  unemployment rate and 1 12 job to applicant ratio   wage growth is poor  and household consumption is weak  Overall household consumption likely finished last year 2 3  lower than December 2013  Third  the combination of a weaker yen  the drop in oil prices and US economic growth above trend will improve Japan s trade balance  The December deficit is expected to narrow to JPY735 bln form JPY893 bln in November  The seasonally adjusted figures show similar improvement  Merchandise exports are expected to have risen by 11 2  year over year  which would be the strongest in 2014  Foreign demand may also have helped spur the expected 1 2  increase in December industrial output  Last week s MOF data showed Japanese investors bought a record amount of foreign shares  There was a spike up in JGB bond yields  The combination of the two may reflect the ongoing diversification of Japanese pension funds and the reform of GPIF  For their part  foreign investors have sold Japanese bonds for four consecutive weeks  a streak not seen in a year  Foreign investors have also pared their holdings of Japanese shares for the fourth week in the past five  Monetary policy in Australia and New Zealand is set to change  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets  It will likely signal that its mini tightening cycle has ended  It is too early to reasonable anticipate a rate hike  but we suspect that is the direction of the next move  For its part  Australia reports Q4 CPI figures  The year over year pace is expected to fall to 1 8  from 2 3   This would be the lowest since the middle of 2012  Some observers have played up the correlation between New Zealand s CPI  which was reported on January 20 at  0 2  on the quarter and 0 8  year over year  Our correlation work on level and change over the past five years points to a 0 4 0 5 correlation  In any event  a soft inflation report in Australia will likely encourage speculation of an RBA rate cut as early as next month  Lastly  we note that the message coming from the earnings reports of the world s three largest international energy service companies  Schlumberger  Haliburton  and Baker Hughes was nearly identical  Contracts are falling faster in North America than in other regions  Schlumberger  NYSE

Compared to the same quarter last year  Baker Hughes  change in revenue trailed its earnings performance  which  at  663 million  was more than double the earnings from the same quarter last year  The company s performance this period suggests a focus on boosting bottom line earnings  While the revenue performance could be better  it is important to note that the quarterly change in revenue was second only to Halliburton among its peers thus far  Also  for comparison purposes  revenue changed by 6 2 percent and earnings by 76 8 percent compared to the immediate last quarter 


Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s earnings growth was influenced by year on year improvement in gross margins from 20 9 percent to 29 1 percent  as well as better cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  rose from 15 2 percent to 22 4 percent compared to Q4 of 2013  For comparison  gross margins were 26 1 percent and EBITDA margins were 19 0 percent in Q3 of 2014 

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors  CapitalCube asseses such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop up using the balance sheet 


Baker Hughes  improvement in gross margin has been accompanied by an improvement in its balance sheet as well  This suggests that gross margin improvements are likely from operating decisions and not accounting gimmicks  Its working capital days have declined to 97 8 days from 105 0 days for the same period last year 
Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 
Baker Hughes  year on year change in operating cash flow of 19 6 percent trailed its change in earnings  This leads CapitalCube to question whether the earnings number might have been achieved from some unlocking of accruals  In addition  the increase in operating cash flow was less than the average announced thus far by its peer group 


Margins
The company s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors   1  Improvements in operating  EBIT  margins from 7 7 percent to 15 3 percent and  2  One time items  The company s pretax margins are now 14 4 percent compared to 7 2 percent for the same quarter last year 


EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth
Baker Hughes change in Earnings per Share  EPS  of 171 4 percent year over year is better than its change in earnings of 167 3 percent  However  the change in earnings is better than the peer average among the results announced to date  suggesting that the company is gaining ground in generating profits from its competitors

38191,259706,SLB,Schlumberger  Oil Services Revenues Up Not Earnings,opinion,"Schlumberger NV reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31  2014 

This earnings report  which was released on Friday January 16th  follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Schlumberger NV      and     

Like its peers Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  reported an increase of revenue in Q4 of 2014  up 6 2 percent to a total of  12 64 B  mostly due to its North American operations  However  its net income fell sharply  by 82 percent  to  302 million year over year  Despite some improvement at the operating income level in its international operations  the decline was largely from an impairment charge and one time accounting items related to the fall in the price of oil 

The price of oil  which has declined almost 60 percent since last June  has a huge impact on the operations and results of Schlumberger  the largest oil service provider  Schlumberger  joined its oil service peers in announcing a workforce reduction  planning a layoff of 9 000 workers  See our analysis of     and     

Highlights

Summary numbers  Revenues of  12 64 B  Net Earnings of  302 million  and Earnings per Share  EPS  of  0 23 
Gross margins expanded from 29 4 percent to 31 8 percent compared to the same quarter last year  operating  EBITDA  margins now 28 2 percent from 25 9 percent 
Ability to declare a higher earnings number  Change in operating cash flow of 1 6 percent compared to same quarter last year better than change in earnings 
Earnings declined although operating margins improved from 18 1 percent to 19 8 percent 

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 

Market Share Versus Profits
Sometimes a focus on market share can be accompanied by a reduction in focus on profits or earnings growth 





Compared to the same period last year  Schlumberger s change in revenue exceeded its change in earnings  which was  81 9 percent  This suggests perhaps that the company s focus is on market share at the expense of profitability  But more important  this revenue performance is among the lowest thus far in its sector inviting the potential for current and future loss of market share  Also  for comparison purposes  revenues changed by  0 1 percent and earnings by  84 5 percent compared to the quarter ending September 30  2014 



Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s year on year earnings decline did not come as a result of a contraction in gross margins or because of any cost control issues  Both gross margins and operating margins  EBITDA  margins actually improved over this time frame  Gross margins widened from 29 4 percent to 31 8 percent  while operating margins improved from 25 9 percent to 28 2 percent this quarter  For comparison  gross margins were 32 2 percent and EBITDA margins 28 8 percent in Q3 of 2014 



Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors at the expense of improvements in revenues and margins  Capital Cube judges this by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting gimmick using the balance sheet 



Schlumberger s improvement in gross margin has been accompanied by an improvement in its balance sheet as well  This suggests that gross margin improvements are likely from operating decisions and not accounting props  Its working capital days have declined to 85 0 days from 95 7 days for Q4 of 2013 
Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 
The company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number as its year on year change in operating cash flow of 1 6 percent is better than its change in earnings  The change in operating cash flow also beat the average of the results announced to date by its peer group 



Margins
There was an overall improvement in operating  EBIT  margins  from 18 1 percent to 19 8 percent  However  the company s earnings fell  The decline in earnings appears to be largely because of one time items  Pretax margins declined from 18 2 percent to 5 7 percent 



EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth
The  81 9 percent year on year change in earnings is lower than the peer average among the results announced to date  suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits from its competitors ",2015-01-28,CapitalCube,https://www.investing.com/analysis/schlumberger:-oil-services-revenues-up-not-earnings-239995,239995
38229,259744,SLB,The One Sector You Must Own Now  Part 2  Drillers And Service Firms,opinion,"Summary
 The market  has done well this year  The S P 500  the best of the bunch  is up just a smidgen over 10  
The sector that has the greatest history of  reversion to the mean  is the Energy sector 
We discussed the Equipment Manufacturers and the Storage and Transport Firms in Part I 
Now let s review Supply   Demand Factors in Oil   Gas  and the Drillers and other Service Providers 
For Part I  go here 
Supply and Demand in the Oil and Gas Sector
I m not saying the recent headline on Marketwatch is the new reverse indicator a la the cover of Business Week  but I am delighted to see the banner headline titled  Oil  other commodities will be in the dumps for another decade   The conclusions of the article rest upon two determining factors  global growth is slowing  thus demand is declining  while supply is increasing due to technology 
The Laws of Supply and Demand have not been rescinded  But for the prognostication above to be accurate  we must amend it to  Global growth is going through one of its regular contractions before it leaps ahead yet again  temporarily reducing demand   At the same time  the technology exists to increase supply  but the biggest world producers have neither the money nor the ability to use it 
For the Demand argument  I need point only to the projection that no one seems to dispute  there are going to be more people on this earth next year than this year  And the next  and the next  etc  It takes energy to grow food  it takes energy to transport it to market  it takes energy to keep those people clothed and sheltered and safe from the weather  Not only that  most people want to actually improve their lot in life  This involves mobility  if it s upward mobility it involves greater transportation options and so on  The world is going to need more oil and gas 
It is also going to need more renewables  but the industrialized nations of most of the Northern Hemisphere do not have enough consistent sun in winter  means of storage of the winds that blow at the wrong time for consumption  and have already created about as much hydro as they can  There will be breakthroughs  of course  in the storage of renewable energy  but those changes will most likely be incremental and expensive 
Moving now to the Supply side  I read everywhere that because the US has chosen neighbors wealthy in natural resources and is itself roaring ahead to extract oil and gas from what I call Nature s Giant Batteries so conveniently dispersed around the country  that we must be in a supply glut forever 
That is at best myopic and more likely just plain silly  Pundits are all over the board noting how Brazil is  going to  produce massive amounts of energy from its offshore fields and Libya is  getting back  to normal production and the Saudis  could  watch the price of oil fall to gain market share  Here s the other side of this equation to consider 
I ve spent some time in Saudi Arabia and I can assure you the Saudis have two resources  sand and oil  You can only sell so much sand to the condo owners in Miami  so they better be smart stewards of the one thing they have that buys them desalinized water  food  and everything else they need to survive  I can also assure you they are smart  Why pump out more and more of a finite asset at lower and lower prices  All this talk of the Saudis trying to undercut US shale production is just talk  More likely they are posturing  very short term  for the upcoming OPEC meeting  where a crumbling cartel will squabble among themselves for more production and the Saudis will show that they need to keep a lid on it and keep prices higher rather than lower 
Russia is the largest producer of oil and gas  soon to be overtaken by the US   Putin thinks he s living the dream  but he s really living in a fantasy world  Without Western technology  Russia s 2nd generation E P technology and thus production will only decline  Until Russians stop electing autocratic father figure czars  their production will continue to slide  Putin brags that Russia has  450 billion in reserves  True  but he fails to mention they re losing about  40 billion a month with prices at these levels  Even Russians  used to graft  corruption and hard times  have a breaking point 
After the US  Russia and Saudi Arabia  the next biggest producer is Iran  If there is a nuclear deal  likely a blow to the Iranian mullahs self image and global prestige  Iran s oil could re enter all the world s markets and be competitive  But if they drag their feet or claim to comply and don t  Iran will be a smuggler of oil  or sell only to the Chinese and their neighbors  placing them in direct competition with Russia for the money to prop up their regime  Geopolitically  we could do worse 
China is next and uses pretty much all the oil it produces 
The 6th biggest producer is Canada  a democratic nation with far more resources than their population needs for domestic use  Fortunately for both sides  their neighbor to the south is the most industrialized and developed and thus the biggest consumer of energy 
Next is Iraq  Now there s a steady Eddie nation that can be depended upon for steady supply  At least oil from what  by all rights  should be but is not the independent nation of Kurdistan looks to be secure and growing  We ll see what happens when the Islamic State is just a bad memory and Iraq s central government can re enter the Middle East game of Torment the Kurds 
Looking at the next 7 biggest which  along with the first 7  account for much more than half of all global production  Kuwait and UAE look like secure sources of supply for now  as long as they keep buying off terrorists to attach The West rather than their own regimes  Venezuela is a basket case  which might come apart at the seams any day now  They need  120 oil to stay afloat and  according to the IMF  they lose  700 mm with every  1 decline in the price of oil  Venezuela hasn t invested in infrastructure since Hugo Chavez decided to buy votes rather than invest in the future  I see their production falling  not rising  Mexico has a similar problem  Unlike Venezuela  they are doing something about it but they are still declining in production until they let those 109 tracts this March to international firms  and begin in late 2015 or 2016 to see increased production  Brazil  Dilma Rousseff s re election pretty much ensures more graft  more delays  and less production  Nigeria can t even control Boko Haram and protect their most important asset  their schoolchildren  I doubt they can protect their oil supply 
Finally there is at least one piece of good news I see beyond North America in the supply equation  Barring major accidents  Norway just keeps leapfrogging others in their E P technology and producing apace around the world 
Summing up  I don t see the supply side as being as strong and secure as most other analysts  As a student of realpolitik  while North America looks better and better  I see a future in which Canada  the US and Mexico  form a triumvirate of low cost of transmission  secure lines of supply  nations   the rest of the world looks like it always has    volatile  with demand constantly rising but supply ever in question 
That said  let s move along to the Drillers and Service firms 
Oil   Gas Drilling Firms
I am a big fan of the oil service firms and drillers because they can do well whether it s the majors or the independents who find success in the oil patch   and  indeed  whether or not any of them find success  If you are a drilling rig provider and I m Exxon  I pay you upfront whether or not I ever find a drop of oil  And if I go bankrupt because I never find a thing  Too bad  so sad  someone else rents your rigs 
The drillers probably provide the most diverse offerings of all  whether they be land drillers or offshore drillers  These are the firms that provide equipment and crew to the major integrated oil firms as well as to independent explorers and producers  Why is there this specialization  Why don t the huge integrated firms like Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   BP  NYSE BP   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa   NYSE RDSb   Total  NYSE TOT   Statoil  NYSE STO  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  just buy them up and keep them in house 
There are lots of reasons  Insurance  geopolitics  risk and liability and simply the common sense reason that it s cheaper to hire specialists to do specific jobs and be able to pick and choose among the best offerings at any point in time rather than being stuck propping up your own subsidiary in something as specialized as this field has become 
Among our top choices for offshore drillers are Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Oceaneering Intl  NYSE OII   Seadrill  NYSE SDRL   Atwood Oceanics Inc  NYSE ATW  and Transocean  NYSE RIG   Our emphasis is on US companies and those international firms with at least 50  of their operations in the US or US waters  After all  the US is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and our oil and gas exports hit a new high last month 
Whether oil prices are up or down  there are many new opportunities around the world  especially in the offshore and offshore deep arenas  Mexico in particular is moving much faster than most observers predicted in opening up their exploration prospects to foreign firms  Pemex is keeping about 90  of the nation s proved and probable reserves  In my opinion  that s not where the value lies  They  should  be seeking to joint venture with better positioned  deeper pocketed  more hi tech firms in the vast areas as yet unexplored  It looks as if  Round One  of the bidding will include 109 exploration tracts  and 60 producing tracts  by mid 2015  The drillers  currently suffering from the lowest day rates for their rigs in recent memory  stand to see a serious uptick in utilization as Mexico and Brazil add to their demand for rigs 
While the demand is likely to remain weak for the rest of 2014 and possibly into the first quarter of 2015  I consider this an opportunity to buy cheaply into what I believe will be a boom by summertime  Which drillers will benefit most  I believe the biggest  with the deepest pockets  and the best reputations will weather the under utilization storm and emerge stronger than ever when day rates once again accelerate  Don t be fooled by charts like this one 

This chart comes from Pacific Drilling  NYSE PACD   a great little company we have owned in our Aggressive Growth portfolio  They can be forgiven for being a bit self serving  The chart purports to show that the  old fleet  of rigs held by the likes of Transocean  Noble  NYSE NE   Rowan  NYSE RDC   Diamond Offshore  NYSE DO  and Ensco  NYSE ESV  make them uncompetitive against those with the newest high specification drillers  What the company doesn t mention is that they own just 7 rigs  and their peer competitor  Ocean Rig  NASDAQ ORIG   has just 10  For comparison  Diamond Offshore has 49 and Transocean has 79  Who do you think Pemex and Petrobras  NYSE PBR   Brazil s national oil company  are going to be most comfortable partnering with   huge firms with decades of experience and reputation or the younger firms planning to expand their fleet by 14  next year  with the addition of  1  more rig  
That s not to disparage PACD  I see it as a very possible takeover choice for a firm like RIG or DO  Both need to increase their share of newer rigs and it s a heck of a lot easier to buy a company  even at a slight premium  and gain shiny new rigs immediately than to place orders with shipyards at unknown today cost for something that will take another two years to build and deliver 
Of all the companies in this space  I like Transocean best  RIG has the most potential based on its available equipment  its worldwide presence  and its new build schedule into 2017  Their management has been hampered by the Icahn raid but is still doing a good job of running their business  79 rigs  many stacked right now  still counts for a lot when an oil major wants to drill tomorrow  not 6 months from now 
I like Seadrill a lot  as well  Part of that is because they gave us a whopping capital gain during the last exploration explosion  part of it is their 19   yes  19   yield  which is only a 45  dividend payout ratio  However  SDRL is highly leveraged  with way too much of an addiction to debt  and in this business trailing earnings are not a valid harbinger of current earnings  That dividend may not be sustainable  especially since the company predicts no uptick in rig usage until the summer of 2015  Of course  they could slash the dividend by 50  and still be paying a 9 5  yield  But  caveat emptor  much of their debt is floating rate which  if interest rates rise rapidly  would force them to retrench  Among the positives  however  are a large high specification fleet and high insider ownership  At these prices  SDRL as a speculative play makes sense   As does little PACD  for an equally speculative  if different  reason   its size  
Let me at least briefly touch upon Noble  Rowan  Ensco and Diamond Offshore  Noble has a well diversified fleet  but has to date only been able to obtain below average day rates and has multiple stacked rigs  It is likely a fine long term holding  but I think we ll do better with others 
Rowan is one of the better mid cap drillers and has handled this downturn very well   better than most of its peers  It has a preponderance of jackup rigs  which is seen as a negative by many analysts  I don t agree with them  When a client needs rigs  they don t always need the latest and greatest for the mundane effort of dealing with not as deep drilling as the new rigs are designed for  Rowan has a fine job of staggering contracts 
Ensco is a solid company   but I need to see better asset utilization before I buy them  I think they over stacked too early in the game and lost opportunity to other firms  We ll see if they play it a little smarter going forward 
Diamond Offshore  maligned by most analysts  was the surprise of my research these past few months  Its fleet is old and the company doesn t seem that aggressive  But under the current depressed conditions for the industry  DO has a higher credit rating  better interest coverage  and more assets than any of those I surveyed except  by some parameters  RIG  The rigs they have stacked are nearly fully depreciated  so they have negligible revenue impact  They are a proven entity which has been through similar downturns many times in the past and know how to weather these downturns  And they have a history of using such downturns as an opportunity to buy more highly leveraged firms in their space  Finally  they are well regarded internationally so it s likely they will be at or near the top of the shopping list for firms and governments around the globe 
We own RIG  SDRL and have already traded DO once this past month  At 32  we d be longer term buyers 
Among land drillers  there are many contenders but few players of serious size  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  it costs about  31 to produce a barrel of oil equivalent  BOE  on land versus about  51 offshore  However  while the odds of finding more BOEs of energy on land is higher than for offshore  that one offshore success will eclipse the lower price on land  The deep oceans and the Arctic north are the relatively unexplored parts of the planet  I m convinced that s where the elephant finds will be made  But they re going to run through a lot more tubing  chemicals  drilling mud  fracking proppants and everything else on the onshore side of the business  That s why  in this  I like almost all the bigs like BHI that also have a decent number of land rigs as well as purer plays Nabors  NYSE NBR   Patterson UTI Energy Inc  NASDAQ PTEN   and our old favorite  of 35 years   Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   We are buying PTEN  NBR and nibbling at high priced  high class  still hasn t declined HP 
Oilfield and Offshore Services
There is inevitably some overlap in all these sub sectors  Some equipment makers offer oilfield services  some drillers offer their own proprietary equipment  as do some of these service firms  But I have grouped them in the manner I have because this is where their  primary  revenues come from  And in the land and sea energy services business  nobody compares with giant Schlumberger  Whether in offshore exploration and production  land based conventional  or land based unconventional  SLB has an integrated package that goes from soup to nuts  and also provides a la carte offerings all along the way  The company has active operations in 85 countries  In many of these they ve been serving customers since before WWII 
SLB is not alone in this area  of course  Others vie for the seismic survey  logging  drilling technologies  well completion  reservoir evaluation and optimization and project management space  Chief among them are Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   FMC  NYSE FTI  and Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   already discussed  Another is General Electric  NYSE GE   While a serious competitor  for investors it doesn t represent a pure play   oil   gas comprise just 13  of GE s total revenue  But if you add in GE s  Energy Infrastructure  and other  Energy  areas  which include nuclear  wind  solar  etc   at 41    energy  is more than half of GE s sales and climbing  If you also like their health care  water and power  aviation and financial services units  GE  down 2  over the past 12 months  is worth a look 
This is an amazingly concentrated sub sector  Between them  the 5 companies above control 79  of the market for oilfield and marine services  Add the only other sizable competitor  Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR  and that market share jumps to 86 5   leaving just 13 5  for the other 25 or so companies in this space to squabble over  FLR  down 12  over the TTM  trailing 12 months   is a strong contender  and one that is more diverse than the others listed here in that it also serves the chemicals  transportation  mining  manufacturing and life sciences industries  It is basically an engineering and construction firm  with half of its revenues coming from government and industry and the other half from oil and gas  It is the smallest of these half dozen giants in enterprise value  has the highest PE but the lowest P S ratio  and an ROA  ROE  and net margin lower than the others  There s no getting around it  in this area  SLB shines above all others 
We re buying SLB  HAL and FTI

One of the reasons why Baker Hughes might give Halliburton a touch of heartburn is the steep premium  At 56 percent  the premium is the largest of any U S  merger in the past 20 years worth more than  20 billion  Halliburton has also agreed to pay Baker Hughes a fee of  3 5 billion if it fails to obtain antitrust and regulatory approvals  But the long term rewards of taking over Baker Hughes appear to outweigh the short term risks  The combined company will control 53 percent of the Williston Basin market in North Dakota  which includes the lucrative Bakken shale play  It will also control 36 percent of the fracking business in the Williston Basin  According to Chairman and CEO Dave Lessar  Halliburton stands to save  2 billion annually from personnel reshuffling  research and development  real estate  operational improvements and other costs  All of this will help the company better compete with the global industry leader  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   By all accounts  Halliburton s timing was on the money  Crude oil prices have declined to  75 per barrel  driving down oil industry shares and making Baker Hughes much more of a bargain  If the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  agrees to a production cut when it meets tomorrow  oil prices might rise sooner rather than later  which could nudge up Baker Hughes s asking price  Depressed oil prices have already put a strain on companies  bottom line and forced them to temporarily discontinue costlier projects  Bloomberg reports that 19 shale regions here in the U S  are  including parts of the Eaglebine and Eagle Ford shale plays in Texas  In such a climate  Halliburton s purchase of Baker Hughes could be described as a defensive move  The same could be said for Osisko s takeover  as gold prices still hover close to  1 200  The company already owns a royalty in the Canadian Malartic mine  Canada s largest gold mine  Acquiring Virginia Mines means that it will also gain a substantial interest in Quebec s  l onore mine  Disclosure  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries  the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries  Gold  precious metals  and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic  political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme  The prices of gold  precious metals  and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies  We suggest investing no more than 5  to 10  of your portfolio in these sectors  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the funds mentioned as a percentage of net assets as of 9 30 2014  Apache Corp  0 00   Baker Hughes  Inc  0 00   Continental Resources  Inc  0 00   Goldman Sachs 0 00   Goodrich Petroleum Corp  0 00   Halliburton Co  2 19  in Global Resources Fund  Osisko Gold Royalties 0 00   Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp  1 16  in Global Resources Fund  Petrominerales  Ltd  0 00   SandRidge Energy  Inc  0 00   Schlumberger  Ltd  0 00   Virginia Mines  Inc  7 13  in World Precious Minerals Fund  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2014-11-26,Frank Holmes,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/depressed-oil-and-gold-prices-force-halliburton,-osisko-to-play-defense-233865",233865

Analysis of the Data
Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 1 917 for the holiday shortened week ended Nov 26  2014  This was down by 12 from the previous week s rig count and indicates the first decrease in 3 weeks  Despite this  the current nationwide rig count is more than double the lowest level reached in recent years  876 in the week ended Jun 12  2009  and is well above the prior year level of 1 763  It rose to a 22 year high in 2008  peaking at 2 031 in the weeks ending Aug 29 and Sep 12  Rigs engaged in land operations fell by 13 to 1 851  offshore drilling was up by 1 to 54 rigs  while inland waters stayed flat at 12 units Natural Gas Rig Count  The natural gas rig count   which in November reached a ten month high   decreased for the second time in 3 weeks to 344  a drop of 11 rigs from the previous week   As per the latest report  the number of natural gas directed rigs is down 58  from its recent peak of 811  achieved in 2012  In fact  the current natural gas rig count remains 79  below its all time high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 367 active natural gas rigs Oil Rig Count  The oil rig count   that rocketed to 1 609 in Oct  the highest since Baker Hughes started breaking up oil and natural gas rig counts in 1987   fell by 2 to 1 572  Nevertheless  the current tally is way above the previous year s rig count of 1 391 and has recovered strongly from a low of 179 in June 2009  rising almost 9 times Miscellaneous Rig Count  The miscellaneous rig count  primarily drilling for geothermal energy  at 1 was up from the previous week s count of 0 Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs remained flat at 352  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was down 12 to 1 565  In particular  horizontal rig units decreased by 1 from last week s all time high level to 1 371

38233,259748,SLB,Here s Why OPEC Doesn t Stand A Chance  But You Can Profit ,opinion,"OIL   GAS  USA 1  OPEC 0
OPEC doesn t stand a chance 
Since most OPEC nations can pump all the oil and gas they need using first  or second generation technology  they fail to understand the role of technology in bringing down oil prices  The point  when investing in energy companies  is not to ask merely   Is the price of oil up or down   When investing  we are seeking firms that can grow their revenues and their earnings  thus increasing their intrinsic value  through good times and bad  So the more important question to answer is  At what point can company A or country X make a reasonable return so that its earnings grow at whatever the current price of oil is  
Answering that question for individual companies like those in America  Canada  Australia and much of Europe and the rest of the world involves determining the price the company receives for its efforts  and beyond that  what its costs are to service its debt  pay its employees  upgrade equipment  etc  For these independent companies  once they have satisfied their creditors and employees  the rest is effectively divided among its shareholders via dividends  buybacks or an increasing stock price 
For perspective on this flexibility  I recently saw a report from the state of North Dakota  now the biggest top oil producing state  that said the average cost to produce a barrel of oil there is about  38 50  So companies there  on average  can make 10  return at just  42 a barrel 
But for OPEC nations  which typically have no private companies in the energy business but rather just one state owned monolith  the answer is very different  These behemoths exist to provide revenue for the massive welfare states the rulers of these nations have created  most often as a way to keep their grip on power  pay the military and police to enforce their rules  lavish largess upon their cronies  and provide food  fuel and other subsidies to their restive subjects in order to keep them in line 
What this means is that OPEC nations might be able to  pump  oil at a lower price but the price they need to stay in power far exceeds what independent oil and gas companies need to pay their bills and keep their shareholders happy  Add to this OPEC   Saudi burden the fact that every year U S  technology improves and lowers our cost of finding and producing oil and gas and adds substantially to our reserve position  This is a tsunami OPEC cannot hold back 
As investors  we need to stop obsessing over the price of crude and determine instead the price at which our independent oil companies can produce oil  make a profit for their shareholders  and still cost less than the  total  cost OPEC nations need in order to hold their anachronistic cartel  and often their anachronistic regimes  together 
From a USA centric geopolitical standpoint  cheap oil and gas is a Very Good Thing  America doesn t have a national oil company on which the government depends for massive welfare programs or make work jobs to keep people from rioting in the streets 
If oil and gas decline to the point where some of our companies can t make money  they shut down their operations  sell their leases at fire sale prices and  worst case  declare bankruptcy  This will not make their shareholders or their workers happy  but the worst macro effect is that many good workers will become unemployed  In terms of production  however  the remaining hundreds of oil and gas companies will simply pick up the slack  That isn t the case with OPEC producers 
In the depths of the real estate bubble cheap credit Wall Street banks induced recession of 2008  I wrote that American workers manufacture more than 20  of all factory goods sold worldwide  America is still the world leader in  making things   Which nation on earth produces more food and farm equipment than any other  Which produces the most chemicals and pharmaceuticals  How are we doing in shipbuilding  skyscrapers  and big ticket items like airplanes and power generation equipment  How about mining and energy extraction equipment  Or telecommunications equipment  semiconductors  metals  or plastics 
The US is the world s biggest manufacturer for good reason  we reward entrepreneurs and offer the greatest likelihood of a stable nation with the least likelihood of asset confiscation  Companies pay more for American labor but what they get are people who are more productive than most anywhere else in the world 
Remember  too  it costs big bucks to ship big products over long distances  Why produce wind turbine blades in China if you re going to use them in Texas  Whatever you may have saved in labor  you ll pay in transportation costs  The heavier the item  or the more perishable  the smarter you are to manufacture it where 300 million people who need actually live 
In addition to U S  manufacturers benefiting from cheaper energy  U S  service firms and U S  consumers benefit  too  Is there a more mobile nation anywhere on earth  Service firms like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  ship roughly 1 7 gazillion items per day  United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS  and FedEx  NYSE FDX  aren t the only beneficiaries  Cheap gasoline lets Americans travel freely hither and yon and keeps salespeople on the road and families not thinking twice about driving to the mall or to McDonald s  NYSE MCD  On the other hand 
The very nations that have proven to be our most consistent and intractable adversaries depend hugely on oil and gas revenue 
I will be the first to say that I did not expect to see the flash crash we endured in energy on Black  for oil  November 28  But I believe that knee jerk reaction was overdone and certainly not worth selling into at this point  It isn t as if OPEC said   We re going to open the spigots to drive the U S  shale operators into bankruptcy   All they said was   We re going to maintain current production  
Well  guess what  At the status quo  current production  levels  the world is slightly out of balance with demand about 3  less than supply  This means oil   gas companies will have to tighten their belts and become more efficient  All will review their current exploration schedule and likely cut back in the short term  It may not be a fun time for the drillers that depend upon new exploration or the service firms that service these new rigs and platforms  But drive U S  firms to their knees  Not going to happen  Oil and gas would have to fall below  40 and stay there for that to happen 
Natural gas already plunged to the bottom and U S  natural gas producers are still standing  What makes anyone believe it will be any different for the oil companies 
As this chart makes abundantly clear  however  the same cannot be said for the aforementioned adversaries 


Source  Matthew Hulbert  European Energy Review  as of 2012 
This single chart tells the geopolitical story in a nutshell  I believe it is the single most important chart we need to refer to in order to answer the questions   How low can oil go   and  Who will blink first   I conclude that OPEC has played their hand very poorly and made inaccurate assumptions regarding all in costs  national interests  and the role of technology in lowering extraction costs 
Too many investment analysts look solely at the  economic  side of the oil business  This leads them to conclude that Saudi Arabia and its Mideast neighbors enjoy a compelling cost advantage over U S  and European producers  They note that Saudi crude is the cheapest to extract in the world  Including CapEx  Saudi Arabia can get oil out of the ground at somewhere between  5 and  7 a barrel  Iraq can do it for a couple of dollars more and the UAE can produce for around  10 a barrel  All true as far as it goes 
But geopolitics will always trump economics  OPEC nations must get x dollars over the cost of production  They have massive imbedded programs of subsidized energy  free higher education  without providing the jobs which those graduates expected   no taxes and lots of free goodies  They dare not now dismantle these for fear of rioting in the streets  massive recruitment by terrorist groups  and losing their thrones  Qatar and Kuwait can break even or make a profit at current prices  but the rest cannot   Mexico  Norway and many U S  and European multinationals are profitable here as well  with Canadian firms all over the board   light crude producers with no CapEx to pay off are fine at  40  oil sands producers need about  80 over a full year  
To maintain their tenuous grip on power once they run through their reserve dollars  with 90  of the Saudi budget reliant on oil sales  the rulers of Saudi Arabia actually need more than  90 per barrel of oil  not the  5    7 it costs to pump the oil itself  Venezuela  Libya  Iraq  Algeria  Nigeria  and Ecuador all need between  100 and  120 a barrel  as does Russia  while Iran needs oil at  120 
OPEC is whistling past their own graveyard  Their level of na vet  dooms them  Here is Venezuela s foreign minister Rafael Ramirez at the conclusion of the OPEC meeting 

 Shale oil is a disaster as a method of production  the fracking  But also it is too expensive  And there we are going to see what will happen with production  

Believe your own propaganda if you like  Mr  Ramirez  but the cost of shale energy declines every quarter  The political cost of not facing reality for you rises every day 
What to Buy and What to Keep
We bought energy stocks as they were declining  With the silly certainty of hindsight  we clearly bought too soon  So what to do now  The discipline we have imposed upon ourselves is to never allow any one sector to comprise more than 15  of any client s portfolio  This forces us to select the best sectors  to diversify by geography and capitalization  and to select mutual funds and ETFs that invest broadly across all sectors 
This self imposed discipline means that we cannot now buy additional shares  salivate as I might at what I consider delightful entry points  unless we sell something else  Rather than panic at today s cyclical lows  we will hold virtually everything we own and have suggested for your research and due diligence 
The only thing we are doing today is exchanging a minority percentage of the firms that are more vulnerable in the short term to declining or stagnant earnings  like some drillers and service firms  for the big integrated oil companies  The big integrated oils don t have to drill new wells like Seadrill  NYSE SDRL  or Transocean  NYSE RIG   or sell servicing equipment and supplies  like Carbo Ceramics  NYSE CRR  does  There s a reason the big guys consistently choose to outsource these functions  if push comes to shove  they simply maintain the equipment they have in place and pump whatever amount of oil and gas they are willing to sell at current prices until the clouds have passed  There is no existential threat to their existence  only a period of depressed earnings 
If you are well under your own threshold of energy sector ownership  you may not want to make any changes at all  Given that we are bumping against the 15  limit for our family portfolios and some clients  we will be doing some selective exchanges  taking tax losses on some issues while positioning in the bigger  more flexible firms at much lower prices than we could buy them for last month or last week 
The reason we are making only incremental change is we aren t talking about dot com bomb type stocks a la 2000  Even the drillers and niche product providers that may take a quarter or two ding to their earnings are still companies that will survive and sustain roughly their current pricing in a constrained oil price market  And they will once again thrive in a more normal oil price market  Plus  to panic sell today means that we would miss the result of any geopolitical event that moves oil up rapidly 
Will Iraq self devolve into civil war  Will Venezuela have to stop exporting to subsidize the home market to prevent a collapse of the government  Will Iran see more sanctions on its oil export capability  Will OPEC blink  Or will investors simply deem 5  yields and PEs of 6 and 7 to represent likely future value  No one knows  But it is the nature of supply and demand to seek homeostasis  The price of oil has fluctuated between  20 and  120 since 2000  Yet  through it all  while a few wildcatters failed  the best of the oil companies hung in there and emerged stronger from every pullback 
We will be judicious in our exchanges  By owning energy firms  we own the companies that literally lubricate the global economy    and most are under 10 x earnings  We have to stay within our 10 15  allocation  which means  we   but not necessarily you  will have to sell a little RIG  SDRL and CRR to buy some of the 4 below that are now in our buy range 
We will keep our iShares U S  Energy ETF  NYSE IYE  and Energy Select Sector ETF  ARCA XLE   As market cap weighted ETFs  their top holdings  Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Conoco  NYSE COP  and Occidental Pete NYSE OXY  comprise roughly half the portfolios  We ll keep our Market Vectors Oil Services  ARCA OIH   2 of the 3 largest components of which are SLB and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV   With prices this low  SLB  NOV and others of their size and quality may well be looking to upgrade their offerings by buying firms that can t go on as independents 
Of the firms now in our buy range to exchange into  we include Ecopetrol  NYSE EC  and top quality Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   In addition  we can buy Suncor  NYSE SU   Canada s biggest energy company and BP  NYSE BP   Of the big integrated oils  BP looks best to me right now  Here s a brief vignette on what most attracts me to the above companies 

EC has no debt  None  We don t have to worry about them not being able to service their debt  At its current price  it s off 50  for the year  sells at a PE of 7 6  a PB of 1 2  and a Graham   of 0 64  Like many foreign firms  it only pays annually  but its last dividend provided a yield of 11   The only negative is one I believe is way overblown  The FARC as well as an indigenous tribe have objected to EC s pipelines crossing  their  territory  They have expressed their indignation by blowing up the pipeline  EC just rebuilds it  with government help   I was in Colombia last year and  even then  the FARC s antics were wearing thin  If the government stops playing pat a cake with them and sends in the troops  I think EC will soar 
As Tina Turner might sing  HP is  Simply the Best   When contract drillers grow up  they want to be HP  It sells at a PE of 10 6  a PB of 1 5  and has a Graham   of 0 85   As a reminder  the Graham   is  in homage to Ben Graham  a measure of intrinsic valuation  A number less than 1 gets my attention   HP pays just under 4   but has a history of increasing the dividend regularly  like other dividend aristocrats  I hate that we bought too early on some bargain prices that became even bigger bargains  but I appreciate that we can now switch to companies we can truly put away for years 
SU is getting dinged because it has a large position in the expensive to process Canadian oil sands  True  but it also has refining  midstream and downstream operations that are still humming just fine  What many investors don t realize is that lots of oil companies are also in the chemicals business and cheaper feedstocks are better for that business  SU sells for a PE of 17 and a PB of 1 25  higher than my other quality firms  And its Graham number is a skosh higher  too  at 1 02  It is Canada s Big Oil  though  followed closely by another favorite of ours  Imperial Oil IMO   As such  I believe it will rebound more quickly than most others 

BP  XOM  CVX  Total SA  NYSE TOT   Royal Dutch Shell A  MX RDSA   OXY and COP  These have historically been the companies that have resisted oil price declines best  as will the capitalization weighted ETFs like IYE and XLE that are heavy with these Big Oils  
There s a reason  Drillers have to rent their rigs and platforms to make money  Equipment manufacturers have to sell equipment to make money  But the biggest firms are diversified enough to make their profits on chemicals  plastics  retail gas stations  propane  etc  when they need to tide themselves over a rough patch  It doesn t make them immune  it does make them more resilient 
Of this group  I select BP as our Big Oil of choice  It has lots of cash  roughly double what it would pay out if every real and spurious   fraudulent claim was paid for as with the Deepwater Horizon accident   It sells at a PE of 16  a PB of 0 99  and a Graham   of 0 97 
T Boone Pickens  who has made a dime or two in the oil business consistently for the past half century  just predicted oil will be at  100 within 12 18 months  I don t predicate any of our holds or buys on the return of  100 oil    but neither would I mind if Mr  Pickens is right once again

38236,259751,SLB,Energy Sector s Decline Distorting S P 500 Earnings Metrics ,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuter s  This Week in Earnings   the forward 4 quarter earnings estimate for the S P 500 fell by  1 00 this past week to  122 48 from last week s  123 48  The P E ratio on the forward estimate is 17 0 x   The PEG ratio is just over 3 x   which looks like it is quite stretched from a historical perspective 
The earnings yield on the S P 500 is 5 88  and is the lowest in about 10 years  per my spreadsheet which tracks the data back to early 2001  The year over year  y y  growth of the forward estimate has fallen to 5 59  from last week s 5 71  
Analysis   commentary  While a lot of the above relative valuation metrics for the S P 500 are indicating the S P 500 is looking pretty extended from a valuation perspective  the decline in the Energy sector estimates are distorting the S P 500 s earnings picture  particularly the forward estimate  What worries me is that with the absolute shellacking the Energy sector s forward estimates have taken since October 1  is it masking weakness elsewhere in the S P 500  Right now  that is hard to tell  given the numbers 
Without getting too wonky or  mathy  for readers  I did want to show the rate of change for Energy sector estimates for the last 3 weeks  for each forward quarter starting with Q4  14 and through Q3  15  The numbers are startling  The rate of downward revisions to the Energy sector is actually accelerating  and is moving out further and further into 2015  Since I won t be able to see Q4  15 numbers until next week  nor will readers  it will be interesting to see the change in estimates for Q4  15 given that crude oil will be lapping the easier compares from Q4  14 
Here is the spreadsheet    This week s revisions are not as ugly as last week s rather sizable downside revisions  i e  race to the bottom 
What puzzles me is that the damage to some large cap Energy stocks like Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  is not as bad as the sector revisions would suggest  In other words  there seems to be a disconnect between stock price performance and the change in Energy sector estimates  A name like Schlumberger  as a large cap oil service name  is  levered  to crude oil prices  I would have thought the stock would be trading far closer to the 2012 low of  60 per share  than its current close on Friday of  87 13  after a 40  drop in the price of crude oil in the last 6 months  I hate to extrapolate from casual market observations  but either the decline in the price of crude oil is temporary as some are suggesting  or SLB has some significant downside ahead in the price of the stock  
Basically I haven t seen this kind of downward flush in sector earnings growth since Technology in 2001   2002  when the Tech sector bottomed at  80  or the collapse in Financial stocks in 2008   2009 ",2014-12-27,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-sector’s-decline-distorting-s-p-500-earnings-metrics-236856,236856
38237,259752,SLB,The Week Ahead  Economic Message From Fourth Quarter Earnings ,opinion,"Investors have another holiday shortened week ahead and a light calendar of economic data  Last week included the  official  start of earnings season  but things are really heating up now 
I expect market participants to be watching closely for The Message from Corporate Earnings 
Prior Theme Recap
In last week s WTWA I predicted that there would be a focus on the message from the bond market  That was very accurate  even more so if extended to commodity prices which traded in tandem  Some  copper prices  Brett Steenbarger had the  on multiple markets  Sober Look inferred   It was a consistent theme on CNBC   thinks the commodity markets are right  but that stocks have not incorporated that viewpoint  Interesting 
The stock market I was following seems pretty much in knee jerk reaction to the commodity news   has a more balanced conclusion  with an interesting angle on the commodity trading from Chinese hedge funds  Whatever viewpoint you choose  it was a good guess for last week s theme 
Bond yields moved lower still  but the explanations remained varied   at Barron s Current Yield captures all of the factors 

New reasons for yields to fall keep coming from all directions on a seemingly daily basis  Early last week the World Bank cut its forecast for global growth  and Treasury yields fell  On Wednesday  the Commerce Department reported that U S  retail sales fell by 0 9  in December  the sharpest drop in a year  and Treasury yields fell  On Thursday  Switzerland s central bank ended a longstanding exchange rate cap  causing the Swiss franc to soar versus the euro  boosting safe haven investments and causing Treasury yields to fall 

Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
There is much less economic news in the holiday shortened week ahead  The State of the Union Address will attract some attention on Tuesday evening  but there is a lot of advance information  The ECB will announce QE plans on Thursday  but that is also widely anticipated 
I expect the real focus for the week to be corporate earnings   always important  but now even more so  Analyst expectations are dropping rapidly     
Outlook  Will corporations express greater worries about Europe and China or some confidence in future prospects   that 84  of companies have beaten expectations so far  Guidance is 4 2 positive  yes  only six cases   It does not feel like it was very good  Market standards seem demanding 
Energy companies  Are the earnings for this sector  and by implication the overall market  overstated  This could prompt some revised thinking  Earnings expert Brian Gilmartin  about earnings growth ex energy  looking for a year over year gain of 6 7   He is more cautious about energy 
Energy cap ex and employment  There has already been a move to attribute the bulk of employment gains to growth in the U S  energy business   direct and indirect  Any job cuts will get highlighted as evidence  as was the case in the Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   
As always  I have some additional ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasions something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was a normal news week  with a negative tilt 
A government shutdown is  off the table  according to Senate Republicans  This removes one significant market worry     
An advisory European Court gave a preliminary OK to the ECB s quantitative easing plan      Normally I would not even mention this  but Art Cashin said that people would be checking the news at 4 AM  The positive story did not seem to help that day s trading  Many remain skeptical on the plan because of expected limitations     
CPI increases remain low  Brian Wesbury has a  showing that the results would be even lower without items like imputed rent 
Industrial production registered a slight beat 
Job openings reached another multi year high  The market is treating this as a positive  so I ll call it  good   but the number of quits declined again  Most would be surprised to learn that 2 6 million people voluntarily left jobs last month     
Michigan sentiment hit an 11 year high with a reading of 98 1  This has been a good coincident indicator for employment and consumption  so perhaps the lower gas prices are having an effect   of this is still the best  drawing together all of the key factors and providing a good historical perspective 

The Bad
The bad news included some significant economic reports 
State of the Union   early leaks  I may be jumping the gun a bit here  but the prospects for Tuesday s SOTU address do not seem market friendly  I have been hoping for a spell of coalition building requiring a bit of bipartisan cooperation  The early hints about the speech suggest a more aggressive theme  Sometimes these are trial balloons  so we shall see     
Initial jobless claims rose to 316K  a recent high  as did the four week moving average  We all watch this closely   has the story as well as a helpful chart 


Retail sales declined by 0 9   much worse than expectations   the impact of reduced gasoline sales and cites the ex gasoline number as a decline of 0 3   Doug Short adjusts for both population and inflation  producing a much  

The Ugly 
The Swiss revaluation fallout   why the actual economic impacts are modest  Not so the  who got buried on highly leveraged bets on the currency relationships  This is what happens when you are trying to make big returns on a very slight edge  Some immediately looked for falling dominoes of the Lehman variety  The FT has an  of motivations  We would do better to look for other crowded hedge fund trades that could easily go wrong   four trends that have a wide trader following  calling them  blackjack trades  because they are  double down  double up   Which of the four stands on its own merits 
Noteworthy 
My email forwarding service sent out an old item last week  for no apparent reason  The service was originally Feedburner  but it has been purchased by Google  Our only explanation is that it was a warning shot because of last week s little joke    into the auto insurance business  Isn t the company also pushing a driverless car  Coincidence no doubt   It s not nice to poke fun at Google 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  but nominations are welcome 
Fans of the Silver Bullet can check out our   just in case you missed one  Most investors have been bamboozled by one or more of these stories  so an annual review can be helpful 
Quant Corner

  a source we cite frequently  has a story about a potential inversion of the yield curve  which is supposedly  rapidly approaching  a recession signal  I am including the chart for consideration  I wish that Myles would give equal time to the first rate recession sources I have been featuring for almost four years  A balanced account would include those who have been accurate  Each of them considers the yield curve as part of the modeling  All do a better job than Udland s source 

The Week Ahead
It is a light week for economic data  but there are some important releases 
The  A List  includes the following 
Initial jobless claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends  with emphasis on job losses 
Housing starts and building permits  W   Follow permits for a leading indicator on this important sector 
Leading indicators  F   Somewhat controversial but widely followed 
Crude oil inventories  Th   Attracting a lot more attention these days 
The  B List  includes the following 
Existing home sales  F  
Chinese economic data  T   Q4 GDP  industrial production  and retail sales 
One wild card might be the State of the Union speech on Tuesday night  The market would welcome credible ideas about tax reform  for example 
Mostly  attention will focus on earnings reports 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Felix held a bullish stance throughout the week  despite the continuing turbulence  There is still plenty of uncertainty reflected by the extremely high percentage of sectors in the penalty box  There has also been some rapid changes in the top sectors  Our current position is still fully invested in three leading sectors  but Felix s overall market rating has slipped a bit  We ll downgrade it to neutral in our regular  month ahead  forecast  but it is a close call  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
As I have noted for two weeks  Felix continues to feature selected energy holdings 
 for biotech traders  and it is quite good   start with ETFs and the larger names until you have done more research  His comments  especially about position size  have a much wider application  Many traders blow out by getting too big  The go by what they want to earn  not by what they can risk  The also under estimate risk 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  We have recently updated our  
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Sectors and ETFs

Stock Ideas 

Goldman s  

CNBC had a  with leading fund manager Noah Blackstein  While the topic is listed as opportunities in Canadian stocks  Noah explained an interesting trade he has noted  Funds are going long debt in energy companies and short the stocks  This is working for the moment  but could shift quickly  This is an interesting observation from a savvy observer 
Eddy Elfenbein provides some  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   including the chart below  As is often the case  I agree with his Google analysis  It is a good time for the company to show what P E multiple is justified   We do not yet own it for most clients  but it is on our watch list   More importantly  Eddy s clear headed analysis and great graphic representation show how value investors pick stocks

Answer in the conclusion 
Final Thought
I do not know how earnings season will play out this week  My list of things to watch is good  but the market seems to be demanding a parlay of positive indications 
Beating the whisper number for earnings 
Beating the revenue expectations 
Business growth  organic  not from mergers or purchases 
Solid  quality of earnings  with no gimmicks or accounting moves 
A credible  positive outlook 
These are always factors  but the early returns suggest the bar is high this quarter  Markets are looking to earnings reports for any sign that the economy has weakened  
Puzzle solution  Most think that the information is not enough to reach a conclusion  They answer is actually  Yes   Try considering both cases   Anne married and not married ",2015-01-18,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-economic-message-from-fourth-quarter-earnings-238832,238832
38274,259789,SLB,Here s What To Watch For This Earnings Season,opinion,"The heart of earnings season will start to get underway this week   This will be an interesting quarter as it comes against the background of a stock market that s suddenly a little shakier than it has been in the recent past   Volatility has really picked up towards the end of the quarter and early October  which wont be captured by the numbers  so forward looking commentary takes on added significance in the next few weeks 
Here are a few of the questions that I ll be looking for answers to as I read through earnings calls 
Macro
Has the US economy been slowing 
On this question I ll be focusing especially on signs that the consumer may be hitting a wall   The reason I ll be focused on the consumer is that the consumer sector is typically the first to show signs of weakness heading into a recession   I m not as interested in later cycle sectors like construction and other industrials as those will tend to be lagging indicators   I expect those sectors to show signs of strength  but they aren t as significant data points in answering this specific question 
How much has the global economy been slowing 
Specifically  I m interested in hearing more about Europe and China   In regards to Europe  I ll be looking for indications of whether or not the market s pervasive pessimism is warranted   Often in an economic recovery there is a growth scare a couple of years after the initial rebound  think 2011 in the US    Along those lines  there is a chance that Europe s current weakness is just a growth scare and that the region isn t slipping back into recession   In China  any commentary that doesn t suggest that the wheels are coming off the economy is a win 
Will movements in foreign exchange affect earnings 
Early indications are that a strong dollar could impact earnings but only if the dollar stays here for a long time   I don t expect to see much impact in 3Q  but I ll be keeping an eye on this 
Financials
How is credit quality 
With US banks  my focus will shift from loan growth back to credit quality for the first time in a long time   I ll be interested to see if credit quality remains strong or if there are early indications of delinquencies   In line with the consumer question above  I ll be paying particularly close attention to credit card portfolios   I m also interested to see if other analysts  questions start to take on a credit focus as well 
Consumer
What is the state of the consumer 
As mentioned above  I ll be particularly focused on the consumer this quarter   I d like to hear what management teams have to say about how business performed in late September and early indications of October   Signs that consumers are trading down or that traffic is slowing are particularly salient data points at this point in the cycle   It will be important to pay attention to commentary on how the upper middle class upper class is reacting to a mild increase in stock market volatility 
Are growth companies still growth companies 
This question bridges consumer and technology to some extent   Are the Facebooks  NASDAQ FB   Netflixes  NASDAQ NFLX  and Teslas  NASDAQ TSLA  of the world able to deliver on growth expectations   For advertising based and social media models how are advertisers feeling about their ROI on these platforms 
Energy
How is the change in the price of oil affecting the industry 
This is probably one of the most interesting industries to watch this earnings season   The price of oil has fallen to where some companies have said in the past that shale oil plays become less economic   It will be interesting to hear how companies are reacting to the change in price   I d pay attention to what EOG  NYSE EOG   Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Core Laboratories  NYSE CLB  have to say as thought leaders in the sector

38275,259790,SLB,Forward Growth Rate Nears 2014 High  Despite Energy Drag On Earnings ,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuter s  This Week in Earnings   the forward 4 quarter estimate for the S P 500 slipped to  129 34 this week  from last week s  130 02 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate 14 5 x   as of Friday s market close  The PEG ratio is now 1 54 x   the lowest PEG ratio of 2014  and below the August 1  14 PEG of 1 58 x  
The  earnings yield  on the S P 500 after this past week s  1 02  drop in the S P 500 is 6 86   higher than the yield rate on August 1 of 6 60  and the highest yield since exactly 52 weeks ago or mid October  13  6 81  
More important  the year over year  y y  growth rate of the forward estimate rose for the 2nd week in a row to 9 49   from last week s 9 32  and the highest since the early August  14 peak of 9 58  
I think there is a real chance we get to a  y y growth rate  of the forward estimate that hits a new multi year high in the next few weeks  particularly as Industrial and Technology sectors report their third quarters 
Analysis   Commentary  The bottom callers were out in force this past week  which is a pastime I prefer not to practice  but this past week s relative valuation metrics for the S P 500 as denoted by the P E ratio  the PEG  the earnings yield  and more importantly the resumption of the forward estimate growth rate to close to 2014 highs  tells me that Wednesday s low could be the end of this somewhat different correction  Since 2011  S P 500 corrections have typically lasted 4   5 weeks  and have been less than 5  in terms of intensity  while this correction is longer in both duration and severity  There was real  tangible fear in the US stock and Treasury markets Wednesday morning  for the first time in many moons 
We really don t know though until the S P 500 makes a new high  or exceeds the September  14 high at the Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd  NYSE BABA  IPO of 2 109 26 
A separate post is being prepared on the Energy sector to be published tonight or tomorrow  which I think readers will enjoy  but here is the change in the Energy sector estimates by forward quarter  over the last three weeks   First column is the week ended October 17th  the 2nd column is the week ended October 10th  and the 3rd column is as of October 1

What readers should draw from this is the absolute level of the estimate relative to the S P 500  and the rate of change up or down  This is the first time I ve marked out the data so I am looking at this along with readers  and Q1  15 has had a 500 basis point  bp  negative swing in its growth rate  and I m guess the downward revisions will continue through the calendar 4th quarter  particularly as we hear from management s on Q3  14 earnings 
We ve been underweight Energy for two years  but now is the time to do the fundamental homework and prepare for the sector s outperformance  As John Wooden used to say   Be Quick  but Don t Hurry  
Here is one company example  Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI   reported Q3  14 earnings on Thursday  missing on both the consensus revenue and EPS estimates for Q3  14 materially  for the first time since the 3rd quarter  2012  BHI s full year 2015 consensus EPS estimate as of the July  14 earnings report was  5 55  after Thursday s report the full year 2015 consensus EPS estimate was reduced to  5 10  or a 10  reduction in just the last 3 months 
I actually like BHI as well as Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   but the oil service companies are  leveraged  plays on crude  We ll have more on a separate post on Energy coming tonight or tomorrow 
To conclude this Weekly Earnings Update  while the mainstream financial media loves to talk Ebola  the bigger issue could be Europe  John Butters of Factset  published a very interesting table this week  with Factset s weekly earnings analysis  of the 68 S P 500 companies that reported Q3  14 earnings this week  44 of the 68 cited  Europe  as an issue during the quarterly conference calls  38 of the 68 cited  forex  or likely US dollar  strength  while 25 companies cited  China  as an issue this quarter  just 7 were specifically negative  and only 6 companies cited Ebola 
The point for Fundamentalis readers is that despite what is in the headlines  it is  attribution  that is more important  I would also add that what managements say in terms of  color  on the conference calls isn t necessarily what the analysts  attribute  upside and misses to  when gauging how individual companies performed relative to their models  E g  an individual company misses on consensus revenues but beats on consensus EPS  and the analyst reports that are published post conference call  note that  currency  drove the 2  revenue miss  but a lower than expected tax rate  or a higher than expected operating margin thanks to SG A reductions drove the EPS upside 
Greg Harrison of Thomson Reuters and John Butters of Factset  John used to do Greg s job at Thomson Reuters  and now does the same work at Factset  do great work in providing readers with earnings commentary  These reports are free too by the way  All readers have to do is sign up  The work that I do is to model the data over long periods of time that T R and Factset provide and try to provide additional color and analysis  Doing this work keeps me focused on earnings for clients and ultimately has an impact on investing decisions  You have to roll up your sleeves and do the work  though 
125   130 more companies report Q3  14 earnings this coming week  I am staying with our original forecast that outside of Energy  I think the S P 500 earnings will come in at a high single digit  possibly 10  growth rate on an operating basis  and be a positive catalyst for the stock market 
Q4  14 expected earnings growth for the S P 500 is 10  as of Friday  10 17  There is always downward pressure on the current quarter s estimate  but this week will give us a better feel for non Energy sector guidance

38276,259791,SLB,The Week Ahead  Is the Correction Over ,opinion,"Was that the bottom  Nearly everyone is trying to time the market  so the financial media will focus on remaining risk versus signals of a bottom 
We have a little economic news next week  but plenty of earnings reports  Despite the news flow  the market reaction itself will be the main theme 
I expect the question of the week to be  Is the stock market correction over  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that we would be asking whether corporate earnings strength could reverse the stock market decline  That was definitely the right question  but the answer is still in doubt  For most of the week it seemed like a resounding  No   but buy Friday s close losses had been trimmed  The issue remains in doubt 
Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
Financial news is basically reactive   and usually not helpful for investors  For the first part of last week it was all about the reasons for the biggest market decline in three years  I was keeping a collection of links  but they are all very similar  Even some of the finest journalists were tasked with  reporting on the correction   This produced disappointing stories with a laundry list of well known problems from around the world   For an explanation  see Josh Brown below  
There is never a discussion about which of these facts might already be reflected in market prices  nor the suggestion about the need for investors to look forward  Even the best sources cater to losing market timing 
The news flow this week will include plenty of corporate earnings reports  Once again these will be more important than the official economic data  In this context I anticipate more attention to the market rather than to the data  In particular  expect constant repetition of these questions 
Was that the bottom  Is the correction really over  
Here are some key takes on the potential for a market bottom 
Doug Short s charts are worth more than 1000 words  Here is the story of the week   for longer term data  context and analysis of past drawdowns over the last few years 

Some attribute the Wednesday rebound to comments from St  Louis Fed President Bullard that the last cut in QE3 perhaps should be delayed because of continuing low inflation expectations  Here is a  twenty something that explains this viewpoint  which is implied in some mainstream sources as well 
Jim Cramer shifted positions during the week  He began by unveiling a list of ten tests for finding the bottom  By Friday  that there had been enough progress on each to create an  investable bottom  

The  that global growth is weakening and that they made this prediction in July in one of their proprietary reports 
 does not typically engage in bottom calling  but he does note the increase in forward earnings estimates  suggesting that  Wednesday s low could be the end of this correction   Brian s work is always interesting  but especially so during earnings season  He covers many specific companies  and he does it well 
 the volume spike in inverse ETFs  but warns that it might be part of a  bottoming process  

Josh Brown covers all of the bases with his post on     I especially like his point  4  with the laundry list of correction causes 
Before turning to my own conclusions  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was not much news  The US economic picture remains solid  while China is a bit weaker and Europe at near recession levels 
Jobless claims remain strong  The 264 000 report was the lowest in 14 years     
European car sales up 6 4    Geoffrey Smith at  
The early earnings reports have been good  68  have beaten on earnings and 63  on sales  FactSet s   
Putin sees problems for the global economy if oil is  80 barrel      Why is this good news  Unwinding the reciprocal Ukraine sanctions is the single largest current market factor  My guess is at least 10   The first step is recognition by the participants 
Rail traffic remains close to all time highs  Todd Sullivan   He also provides charts and analysis of other economic indicators  Good stuff 
Plunging oil prices create stimulus  We often hear that the cure for high energy prices is high prices  The process works both ways   a  1 1 trillion stimulus impact 
Housing starts and building permits moved higher   it as an  OK  report  Much of the gain is still coming from multi family construction  Here is the chart showing that comparison 

Industrial production beat expectations  See  for charts and analysis of the acceleration in this series 
The Bad Most of the bad news was not about the economy  It was about the stock market reaction 
Oil geopolitics  The story has many cross currents  but the path to progress is challenging  Startfor    has a great report 
Forward earnings guidance has been weaker   the conference calls to see what factors have been cited 


Builder confidence decreased to 54  missing expectations of 59  Still positive  but disappointing  Calculated Risk has  
The Beige Book showed little increase in economic growth  I always enjoy the  
Retail sales declined even more than expected  0 3   the worst economic news of the week  So far there did not seem to be a pickup from lower fuel prices   including the core and year over year data  Here is the long term chart 

The Ugly 
This week s ugly news is the continuing Ebola story  The need for treatment in West Africa and international issues are now both commanding attention  It is a sad commentary that the story got traction only when there were cases in the US  I have been writing about this for months  noting that the economic effects are still relatively modest overall  but include concentrated effects in some sectors  Some astute observers  including Jim Cramer  have attributed plenty of selling to Ebola fears  One morning there was a nine handle decline in the pre market SPU s  S P futures  based on the announcement of one additional US case  I track this story closely  so I am just hitting the highlights here 
  sending 460 doctors to West Africa 
It has become the biggest story on the campaign trail  with arguments rapidly falling to the lowest common denominator 
Inside the beltway politics also looms   on how much spending commitments have affected progress toward the best treatments 
 on the market effects  Hint  More modest than most think  including a provocative comparison 
Did bureaucracy at the WHO contribute to the crisis   Jason Gale and John Lauerman at   
Ebola is even scarier than you think  according to these   The  airborne  point is especially worrisome 
Your  in driving home from the airport than flying on a plane with one of the Ebola nurses 
 remain under pressure  Perception is more important than reality 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts   Think of The Lone Ranger 
No award this week  although I see plenty of good candidates deserving sharp analysis and refutation

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Felix has continued the bearish call initiated three weeks ago  Most sectors have a negative rating and the broad market ETFs are all negative  The Felix trading accounts were completely invested inverse ETFs and some Latin American ETFs  Since Felix uses a three week time horizon  the recent move has been timely  Felix does not anticipate tops and bottoms  but waits for evidence of a change 
90  of British  lost money  This is in line with most results I see  despite the advertisements that make it all seem so busy  You really need to have a well tested system if you intend to do short term trading

Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  The recent  actionable investment advice  is  
Whenever there is a market decline  we are bombarded with  explanations  and predictions of disaster  To keep perspective I wrote a section last week covering these three points 
What is not happening 
Factors most often linked to major market moves  and
The best strategy for the current market 
If you missed this section last week  I urge you to check out the Investor Section of  
I also wrote a section about value investing last week 

If you are a value investor  it is up to you to determine what your investments are worth  If your methods are sound and the market disagrees  then you can use volatility to add more to your most attractive holdings  If you have made a mistake in your choices  you need to re evaluate and move on  Price is what you pay  value is what you get 

I decided that I could make this point better and with a little humor in Why Investors Must Understand Value  with an apology to Mr  Buffett  
We continue to use market volatility to pick up stocks on our shopping list  We do this because we also sell positions when they reach our  constantly updated  price targets  Being a long term investor does not require you to  buy and hold   Taking advantage of what the market is giving you is always a good strategy 
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Please read and enjoy the piece from  on 16 meaningless phrases that will make you seem smart on CNBC  This is one of the reasons that we use TIVO and mute while watching  If you are a regular viewer of financial TV  you will recognize all of these  The  easy money has been made  is a good example  Henry says that it implies  wise  prudent caution and that you bought or recommended the stock a long time ago   You can waffle between further upside and the potential for risk  The other fifteen are nearly as good 
Ignoring the commentary noise is also a theme from   See the great sketch  He quotes one of our favorites  Art Cashin  who accurately reflects the pulse of the market 

Of course  it s led to some entertaining headlines and predictions  I think my favorite might be from the   who told CNBC last week that  the S P 500 index needs to stay above the 1 950 level to avoid further declines  


After hearing that comment  a friend sent me his own explanation  Unless the market doesn t go down  it will go down  If it stays up  it will not have gone down  Unless it goes down later  which will only happen if it doesn t stay up 


Such precise predictions are a part of the noisy industry of forecasters and gurus that s grown up around investing  Sometimes  they get it right  at least temporarily  The S P 500 did indeed fall below 1 950 and is around 1 900 as of this writing  But it would only need a 3 percent gain to be back above that level again  which could happen in just a couple of days 

David Rosenberg    has earned respect through willingness to change his opinions along with the evidence  His Tuesday note described a problem in market timing  an excessive focus on the trees rather than the forest 
Prof  Robert Shiller s CAPE ratio is the foundation of many bearish arguments   the usual media approach of trying to coax him to predict a crash  Instead  he produces a balanced explanation of how Shiller uses his own method  For his own portfolio he is still 50  in stocks  something I have frequently reported before  He does not find current readings to be extreme  and even muses about whether something might have changed  He likes health care and industrials 
25iq covers a  from Guy Spier  It is a great read with good sources  Here is one example 

1  The entire pursuit of value investing requires you to see where the crowd is wrong so that you can profit from their misperceptions    A value investor seeks to find a significant gap between the expectations of the market  price  and what is likely to occur  value   To find that gap the value investor must find instances where the crowd is wrong     the ability to properly read market expectations and anticipate expectations revisions is the springboard for superior returns   long term returns above an appropriate benchmark  Stock prices express the collective expectations of investors  and changes in these expectations determine your investment success  


Value investing is buying assets for substantially less than they are worth and  says Seth Klarman  holding them until more of their value is realized   Klarman describes the value investing process as  buy at a bargain and wait    It is critical that the value investor not try to time the market but rather make the market their servant  The market will inevitably give the gift of profit to the value investor  but the specific timing is unknowable in advance  If there is a single reason people do not  get  value investing it is this point  The idea of giving up on trying to time the market is just too hard for some people to conceive  For these people  timing markets is a hammer and everything looks like a nail  That you can determine an asset is mispriced now relative to intrinsic value does not mean you can time when the asset will rise to a price that is at or above its intrinsic value  So value investors wait  rather than try to time markets 

Here are the fifteen most hated stocks based upon short interest   Philip Van Doorn at   I am not recommending short selling  but you might want to do some extra research if you own any of these 
And here are some stock ideas from   who notes that the selling has been indiscriminate 
If you are stuck in gold  you might consult us about our gold bug methadone treatment  If you are out of the market completely  you might want to reconsider your approach  The current economic cycle is in the fifth inning  This is one of the problems where we can help  It is possible to get reasonable returns while controlling risk  You can get our report package with a simple email request to main at newarc dot com  Also check out our recent recommendations in our    a starting point for the long term investor    Comments and suggestions welcome   I am trying to be helpful and I love and use feedback  
Final Thought
I do not have a short term market call  For the longer term  the headline risk is well known and the potential for solutions are not newsworthy  This provides opportunity 
In WTWA I often share conclusions in an effort to be timely  Some of these eventually get a separate article and other spark a useful discussion in the comments  In that spirit  here are a few thoughts from last week 
I am amazed by Cramer s list of problems  When he first produced it  Monday   I suggested to our team that these things were far from solution  By Friday it had all changed  I also dislike the combination of market data and fundamentals  People need to decide whether to trade or to invest 
Early week selling did not relate to data  despite the popular stories  No one cares about the Empire Index and a lower PPI is basically good  If you just looked at the retail sales data  the worst news of the week  you would find it disappointing  but not a disaster  It would be amusing to tell a group of  experts  in advance what the data will be for the day or the week and then let them guess the market result 
The Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  conference call  transcript helpfully   a great resource for those watching earnings  provided helpful fresh information on global energy supply and demand providing an upbeat forecast  The selling in energy stocks has been indiscriminate  even though some    may benefit from lower prices 
General Electric s  NYSE GE  report also showed strength in several relevant sectors  These are not  one off  companies  so I am paying some attention 
And finally  it is a continuing mistake to interpret every market move in terms of the Fed  The remaining QE is small  The exact timing of the end is of little consequence  Do not expect any more QE  The key Fed policy is the pace of interest rate increases and forward guidance  Whether the market likes it or not  that will remain  data dependent  ",2014-10-19,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-is-the-correction-over-229489,229489
38277,259792,SLB,Energy Sector Drilldown  And Why Now Might Be A Good Entry Point ,opinion,"Thanks to Greg Harrison  of ThomsonReuters  this is how the Energy Sector earnings are distributed amongst and between the various companies 
Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   25 
Chevron  NYSE CVX   17 
Occidental  NYSE OXY   4 5 
Hess  NYSE HES   1 
Total Integrated Oil   Gas  47 5

Total Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  13 5 
Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  15 5 
Oil   Gas Refining   Marketing  10 
 Remainder  14 5 
Here is the Excel spreadsheet created from the Thomson Reuters  data    courtesy of Greg Harrison 
When we have invested in Energy for clients  it has typically been the international  integrated oils  such as Exxon Mobil  XOM  and Chevron  CVX   or the so called  oil services  companies like Schlumberger  SLB   Halliburton  HAL  and Baker Hughes  BHI  
Currently  we have no Energy positions for client accounts  and haven t had for some time  However  here are some thoughts we ll leave you with as we do more fundamental homework on the sub sectors in the next few months 
Exxon  XOM  and Chevron  CVX   are 42  of the Energy sector by earnings weight  If you want a low risk way to play the sector and don t want to try and time the sector too finely  you can buy either stock or the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   of which XOM and CVX are 39  by market cap  Both these names should be less volatile than the rest of the Energy sector 
Chevron is currently testing its 200 week moving average on our charts  It s well off its  135 high from late July  14  We often use the 200 week moving average as a low risk entry point for stocks or sectors for which we have been waiting to build positions  XOM s 200 week moving average is  87 per share 
Our preferred oil services names like Schlumberger  SLB   Halliburton  HAL  and Baker Hughes  BHI  are more levered to crude oil prices  and have fallen with the price  SLB and BHI reported earnings last week  and both stabilized with the reports  but I suspect that Q4  14 and Q1  15 earnings estimates for the group will continue to drop  If you look at our Weekly Earnings Update from yesterday  based on the change in the forward estimates  I m guessing that the Energy sector estimates will not bottom until Q1  15 results start to get reported in mid April  15  Given the levered nature of this sector to crude oil and nat gas  I will wait to re purchase these names 
In the last correction for this group in 2012  BHI bottomed around  40  HAL around  30 and SLB between  60    70  North American margins have been driving the recovery in these stocks since then  but I don t see how they remain unscathed from the 20  drop in crude oil in the last 3 months  particularly if OPEC is serious about curbing new supply  I thought I read on a Twitter post this past week that Chevron has already curtailed one project announced recently  given the drop in crude 
No question the Energy sector is a  return to global growth play  which has been a theme of ours for some time  However  given what is happening in Developed Europe and South America  synchronized global growth seems to get delayed more and more 
Sector earnings estimates are not a timing tool  the forecasts I ve seen for crude oil prices have been  75 per barrel   80 per barrel   63 per barrel and I even heard one forecast for  35  What I will be looking for over the next few months is for crude oil to stabilize for a period of time  and then I ll be periodically updating readers on the Energy sector estimates  I ve start to do more homework on the Exploration and Production names  which is one Energy sub sector for which we have no coverage 
This is strictly my own opinion  but I think this drop in crude and Energy stocks will take some time to play out  Earnings estimates are NOT a timing tool  but there is no question we will be alert for stabilization in sub sectors and individual companies  Look for divergences in sectors and sub sectors and companies  sector estimates declining  company estimates improving  to drive fundamental homework ",2014-10-20,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-sector-drilldown-(and-why-now-might-be-a-good-entry-point)-229546,229546
38278,259793,SLB,A Bad Omen For Oil Stocks ,opinion,"U S  oil and natural gas rig counts just dropped for the second time since August 
Why is that significant 
A drop in the number of rigs is usually an indication that the companies doing the drilling and exploring are less sanguine about future prospects 
But the two biggest oil companies  CEOs are putting on a happy face  saying their production is actually going to increase 
Are these CEOs lying about their prospects  or is something else going on 
Digging Deeper Into Data
Rig counts are a measure of the number of active rigs that are developing or drilling for oil or gas 
Between February 2012 and this past September  rig counts for the oil industry increased by more than 33   This reflects the boom period for oil production in the United States 
On the other hand  natural gas rigs fell from almost 2 000 a few years ago to around 300 today 

Yet in spite of these telltale signs of slowing production  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   are reporting rather chipper futures 
Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar recently implied that his company s activity and the boom in shale drilling aren t ebbing  In fact  they re continuing to grow 
 Service intensity levels surged to unprecedented levels  as completion volumes per well were up more than 50  compared to the third quarter of last year   said Lesar 
Schlumberger  the No  1 company in the industry  echoed these sentiments 
So what gives  Are the rig counts lying  or are the two biggest companies relying on backlog rather than looking forward 
Reading the Signs
Digging deeper into the numbers reveals that  actually  only a certain type of rig is shutting down 
More traditional vertical rigs are going offline  while the number of horizontal rigs has stayed the same 
This makes sense when you consider that horizontal drilling is much more cost effective and efficient than vertical drilling 
You see  numerous wells can be drilled from a single location  rather than one well at a time  which is the hallmark of vertical drilling 
This is an important distinction  and one of the reasons that companies like Halliburton  which has fallen more than 20  from its highs  are less vulnerable to the downside in prices than the oil companies 
Many of the drilling and exploration companies have seen their fortunes plunge by twice that of Halliburton  as measured by share price performance 
This is also an indication that plays like the Permian Basin are definitely the next hot thing  and that the lure of cheap horizontal drilling is the driving force 
Thus  Lesar s sunny outlook isn t some plan to deceive the shareholders  but rather a measure of the oil services it provides to the industry  And that s a reflection of the boom in drilling in the United States and other parts of the world 
Stars Align
This is not to say that the company is immune from a protracted slump in prices 
But as long as oil and gas are being produced  rigs and wells have to be serviced  even if the companies that are producing are making less off each barrel  or thousand cubic feet 
The recent plunge in prices looks to have abated  and oilfield service companies like Halliburton may present a much better opportunity today than they did just a few months ago 
Rig counts are likely to stay at current levels  or even dip a little   but the boom in U S  oil and gas shows no signs of abating right now 
In fact  the opposite is true  Oil and gas production is set to increase year over year 
And  the chase  continues

38279,259794,SLB,Goldman Sachs Says  75 Is The New Normal For Crude Oil,opinion,"A compelling piece of research from Goldman Sachs is being passed around the street this morning  It makes the case for  75 crude oil for the next 12  months   Here are the key points 
The 2015 global oil market will be significantly oversupplied unless US shale production growth slows  which will only happen if prices are around  75 bbl
Even if there is a slowdown in shale production it would take six months to impact the market  leaving 1H15 oversupplied
Oil service companies  Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   etc   will be particularly hard hit by a lower oil price which will surely lead to large cuts in Cap Ex   so avoid leveraged oil services companies
Dividend payments from the large integrateds are likely to come under pressure
The key charts 

 





In summary  the story is pretty clear  the boom in North American shale oil combined with technological improvements which are driving cost deflation in oil production pose serious headwinds for the price of oil to buck for the foreseeable future  Weak global economic growth might serve as the final nail in the coffin for oil prices ",2014-10-28,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman-sachs-says-$75-is-the-new-normal-for-crude-oil-230492,230492
38280,259795,SLB,Basic Nears Sweet Investment Spot,opinion,"The holiday season is almost upon us  and our thoughts are turning to planning trips  buying presents  and dealing with the dreaded in laws 
But before you get swept up in the frenzy  there s one investment move you should make to ease the Yuletide strain on your wallet 
You see  despite the current slump  energy prices are still going to rise this winter 
In fact  one stock is already dropping down to Black Friday prices  but it s sure to climb again 
The time to buy is now 
The Company to Watch
More than a year and a half ago   of Basic Energy Services  NYSE BAS  at around  13 per share 
In the subsequent months  the shares more than doubled 
Then  in March of this year   that the shares were trading higher than they should be  and that natural gas wouldn t be able to hold at the over  6 per thousand cubic feet  mcf  level reached last winter 
Basic has since corrected along with the rest of the energy sector 
The company lost more than 50  of its value and is trading back down in the  13 to  14 level  Accordingly  natural gas is back around  3 per mcf 
But the opportunity to profit off of Basic is far from over 
At current levels  Basic presents a very interesting speculation  It has overcorrected  and business is much better today than it was a year ago 
A Gift Everyone Wants
In its latest release  Basic echoed what Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  have been saying recently  Oil and oil related businesses aren t retreating in the face of lower prices   not yet anyway 
Basic hasn t seen a drop in bookings for its oil and gas services through the first quarter of 2015 
Couple that with the recent acquisitions in the energy space by Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA  and the sale of major assets by Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE CHK  and you might just have a very interesting scenario developing 
Crude Oil prices are continuing to trend downwards and might hit  70 per barrel  But  energy shares have stopped their correction for now and are falling less  Some are even rising in the face of the most recent decline last week 
This might indicate that both energy and energy shares are nearing a bottom 
With cold weather approaching and continued global stimulus  energy prices should rebound this winter 
Get the Best Deal
If the rebound sticks   assuming China begins to increase imports  the eurozone stimulus takes hold  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries comes to its senses   then we could see a rally in energy prices in the first half of 2015 
Most energy shares are down  and the majors are down less than smaller companies  but their upside is probably 20  to 40  from current levels 
Basic  on the other hand  has a much bigger upside due to its leverage in the industry and its much smaller market capitalization and share float 
In other words  if the sector moves higher  Basic should outperform 
Oil and Natural Gas prices over the next few months are anyone s guess  But if you want to get in during this decline  then you should definitely consider stocks that are about to hit a sweet low spot  like Basic  to boost your returns 
Ideally  the  10 to  12 level would be a great entry point  It s around this level that insiders were buying shares before the rally to the mid to upper  20s 
And  the chase  continues

38281,259796,SLB,Where Does The Stock Market Go From Here  Sector Weightings Can Help,opinion,"The ever elusive  64 000 question of  Where does the stock market go from here   is as popular a question today as it was a century ago  All you have to do is turn on CNBC to find an endless number of analysts  strategists  journalists  economists  and other talking heads guessing on the direction of stock prices  So many people are looking to make a quick buck or get a hot tip  but unfortunately investing is like dieting it takes hard work and there are no simple solutions  As much as the pundits would like to make this investment game sound like a scientific certainty  in reality there is a lot of subjective art  experience  and luck that goes into successful investment outcomes  Consistent followers of Investing Caffeine understand there are a number of tools I use to guide me on the direction and level of stock prices  and three of my toolbox gizmos include the following 
Earnings  Stock prices positively correlated 
Interest Rates  Stock prices inversely correlated 
Sentiment  Stock prices inversely correlated 
While these and other devices  see   are great for guesstimating the direction of longer term stock prices  sector weightings are also great tools for identifying both overheated and unloved segments of the market  Take an extreme example  such as the S P 500 Technology historical sector weighting in the year 2000  As you can see from the Bespoke Investment charts  the Technology sector went from about a 5  weighting of the overall market in the early 1990s to around 36  at the 2000 peak before dropping back down to 15  after the Tech Bubble burst  If you fast forward to the 2008 2009 Financial Crisis  we saw a similar  bubblicious  phenomenon rupture in the Financial sector  During 1980 the Financial segment accounted for approximately 5  of the total S P 500 Index market capitalization in 1980 and skyrocketed to a peak of 23  in 2007  thanks in large part to a three decade bull run in declining interest rates coupled with financial regulators asleep at the oversight switch 


Source  Bespoke Investment
While some segment weightings are currently above and below historical averages  the chart shows there is a tendency for mean reversion to occur over time  As I ve written in the past  while I believe the broader market can be objectively be interpreted as reasonably priced in light of record earnings  record low interest rates  and a broader skeptical investing public   see Markets Soar and Investors Snore   I m still finding expensive  frothy sub sectors in areas like money losing biotech and social media companies  The reverse can be said if you examined the 2000 period   the overall stock market was overpriced at its 3 24 00 peak  P E ratio of about  31x   but within the S P 500 stocks there were bargains of a lifetime if you looked outside the Tech sector  Consider many of the unloved  Old Economy  stocks that got left behind in the 1990s  Had you invested in these forgotten stocks at the peak of the 2000 market  March 24  2000   you would have earned an equal weighted average return of  430   and significantly higher than that if you included dividends

38321,259836,SLB,Ready to Capitalize On Emerging World Growth And US Oil Independence ,opinion,"With 400 million more people set to get on the grid in India alone  smart investors will profit from new demand for all kinds of energy  In this interview with The Energy Report  Frank Holmes and Brian Hicks of U S  Global Investors share some of their favorite ways to build a diversified portfolio that takes advantage of opportunities large and small  domestic and international 
The Energy Report  India s new prime minister  Narendra Modi  has pledged to bring electricity to the 400 million  400M  Indians currently without power  How is he going to do this  and how can investors get exposure to this massive infrastructure investment 
Brian Hicks  One of our investing tenets is to follow government policy  because that is a precursor to change  Infrastructure investment in India is a long term theme  and is going to require a lot of raw materials and fuel sources  The power could come from coal and nuclear  It s one thing to generate power  it s another thing to actually distribute that power and get it out to the rural areas  That means a lot of copper to build out the infrastructure grid 
In the end  this will be a massive investment  and there will be a number of ways to play it  I would consider investing in the engineering and construction firms like Fluor Corp   NYSE FLR   which could win infrastructure contracts 
TER  China is in the midst of a similar infrastructure build out  Is that a coal and nuclear approach as well 
BH  Absolutely  and the Chinese are further along than India  China has invested heavily in the power grid  That has resulted in a tremendous ramp up in production of steel  cement and iron ore  as well as an upswing in copper usage  All go into generating power  Obviously  coal has been fueling much of China s power generation  and will probably continue to do so  The government is trying to pull back on the margin because of pollution concerns  but it will probably be part of the equation for many years to come 
Frank Holmes  The global real gross domestic product  GDP  annual growth rate has declined from a peak 5 4  in 2010 to 3  last year  With the U S  economy turning up  constructive news out of China and new leadership in India  the global GDP could rise to 3 5   This is very positive for commodities from energy to copper to gold  Modi s goal of 400 million people having access to electricity would mean a lot of copper demand and energy consumption 
TER  Aside from China and India  what energy resource areas are poised to do better in the second half of 2014 
BH  We are very constructive across the spectrum for energy  Oil prices are moving above  100 barrel   100 bbl   whether it s West Texas Intermediate  WTI  or Brent crude  and that s going to be very positive for North American energy companies  We are seeing more signs of instability in key producing areas in the Middle East  including Libya and Iraq  That is going to weigh on global supply and keep oil prices well supported  Companies with production in geopolitically safe areas should do quite well in this environment 
We are very positive on natural gas  There has been some complacency about refilling storage after the extremely cold winter  and that should support natural gas prices for the near future  As we get into the summer months  cooling demand could strengthen gas prices again 
TER  We recently published an interview with T  Boone Pickens  and he is very optimistic about the shale oil space and the possibility of oil independence for America  Do you share his optimism 
BH  We sure do  I m not quite sure about energy independence  but we are certainly making inroads in that direction  Within our portfolio  we are investing heavily in the shales through upstream oil and gas companies  oil services companies and equipment companies  Shale is transformational  it is really changing the energy landscape  Almost overnight  companies are developing resources that are long lived and repeatable  Remember  only five years ago we were talking about peak oil  Now  we re producing roughly 8 4 million barrels per day  8 4 MMbbl d   That s the highest we ve seen since the mid  80s  It is a trend that is going to continue 
At present  the Permian Basin is developing just as the Bakken and the Eagle Ford did a few years ago  The Delaware Basin  in particular  could be larger than what we ve seen in the Bakken and Eagle Ford combined  It looks like we will be able to unlock millions of barrels of reserves  and increase production from that historic base  The Delaware is a very exciting example of how technology  innovation and investment have changed the conversation over the last five or six years 
TER  With all that oil and gas coming out of the shales  do you see an opportunity for money to be made in refiners 
BH  We have already had success investing in refiners  San Antonio is home to two of the largest independent refining companies in the country  so we follow that area closely  We also see opportunities for Gulf Coast refiners  such as Valero Energy Corp   NYSE VLO   If inventory levels continue to rise  you re going to see a discount between Louisiana light sweet oil  WTI and Brent  With that spread  refiners with Gulf Coast exposure are able to source lower feedstock costs for crude oil  refine it into gasoline and diesel  then sell it at competitive global prices  That is very good for margins  And it could be sustainable 
TER  What about the majors versus the junior explorers and producers  Which has better upside 
BH  I think there are opportunities in all of the above  Some majors have tremendous resources  Suncor Energy Inc   NYSE SU   in the Canadian oil sands  is going to be producing for the next 40 years or so  The company has put a lot of money into infrastructure to grow production  And it pays a nice dividend yield  It looks attractive on just about any metric 
Juniors are investing in shales domestically and internationally  There are opportunities throughout the market cap spectrum  That is why we take a diversified approach  and look to invest within all those areas 
FH  I love many of the royalty companies  such as San Juan Basin Royalty Trust  SJT NYSE  and BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust  BPT NYSE   which offer attractive high yields  growth and rising oil and gas prices 
TER  What companies in the junior oil and gas exploration and production space are poised to take advantage of these trends 
BH  We have some junior companies that have grown so much they aren t very junior anymore  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp   TO PRE  is now more of a small  to mid cap company trading in the  6  7 billion   6 7B  range  But we still see it as extremely cheap 
Other operators in Columbia  such as Gran Tierra Energy Inc   AMEX GTE   look attractive to us as well  In Europe  Petromanas Energy Inc   TO PMI  looks very attractive to us  Frank recently returned from a Petromanas site visit  where he checked out a well being drilled in Albania that looks like it has a lot of potential 
PetroAmerica Oil Corp   TO PTA  also looks very inexpensive  with a lot of potential upside via further exploratory drilling and joint venture development 
FH  PetroAmerica is going through an acquisition  and when the dust settles  it will be an attractive company on all key metrics  with growth in reserves  production and cash flow on a per share basis 
BH  Other areas  such as Kurdistan  have more oil and more proven reserves than Mexico  It s a huge resource space  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd   LONDON GKP  is drilling for oil in an area with huge reserves  It has the potential to eventually produce as much as 100 000 barrels per day  We think there s tremendous opportunity there 
TER  Are you worried about the conflict in Iraq 
BH  That is something we factor in  but Gulf Keystone is working in the north  where it is safer  At some point the dust will settle  and we will get production out of Iraq and Kurdistan  Therein lies the opportunity  If you take a long term view and buy assets when nobody else wants them  they are cheap  That is how you can create alpha by investing within the context of a portfolio so you re not buying a large chunk  You only need to buy a small amount of a stock like Gulf Keystone for it to make an impact 
TER  Any names closer to home that you like 
BH  We used to own Raging River Exploration Inc   TO RRX   We almost doubled our money  so we took profits as we entered the second quarter  which seasonally can be a little slow for the juniors  We will look to reload on that name as we get into the fall  and in other names as well 
TER  The Raging River stock price really went up in the last six months  What was pushing that 
BH  We have seen a resurgence in the junior space in Canada  which has been neglected for the last two or three years as development in the U S  shale plays have taken hold  Now we are seeing a bit of a handoff back to Canada  Horizontal drilling is developing in the Montney and Duvernay formations  and we re seeing companies operating there rise to the top  They are starting to do very well with their own unconventional drilling  We have seen value unlocked  and it s very exciting  A number of companies in the sub  1B or  500 million market cap range are starting to grab hold 
TER  What other contrarian opportunities do you see out there 
BH  Large oil equipment and services companies are an opportunity  Companies like Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB   Halliburton Co   Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE BHI  are bundling up smaller companies to provide a one stop shop  That is attractive 
Pressure pumping prices are starting to move up  On the drilling side  more rigs are being contracted into the Permian Basin  A company like Patterson Energy Inc   NASDAQ PTEN  should benefit from that  A smaller operator  such as the Canadian drilling company CanElson Drilling Inc   TO CDI   also has exposure to the Canadian sands and the Permian Basin  It is benefiting from those two growth areas 
Moving down the market cap spectrum  Xtreme Coil Drilling Corp   TO XDC  is doing quite a bit in the Eagle Ford  Higher spec coil tube drilling is starting to catch on down in that area  I recently returned from a site visit with Xtreme Coil in the Eagle Ford  and it looks like the company is doing quite well  Xtreme recently announced it is going to expand its XSR coil tubing fleet in the U S  by six additional units  costing  54M 
TER  The Global Resources Fund  PSPFX  was up almost a percent for the first three months of 2014  after a couple of negative years  It s tilted strongly toward oil and gas  Is that part of a strategy to move toward energy stocks 
BH  We are overweight in oil and gas  We have some conviction in that area  and we feel like there s more running room  We ve shifted at the margin  but we re holding steady  We re in an environment where we might see more volatility in the summer months due to instability overseas  so we are keeping a little bit of dry powder 
TER  Do you have any advice for readers looking to adjust their energy portfolios going into the rest of 2014 
BH  I would focus on the shale plays  the companies in the core regions within these plays  There are opportunities in the juniors in the small  and mid cap spaces in North America that should continue to do well  There are probably attractive opportunities overseas as well  so keep an eye out for those  Overall  it s going to be a very constructive environment for energy investing 
TER  Thanks to you both

38322,259837,SLB,Oil And Gas Stock Roundup  Crude Falls  Chesapeake Completes Spin Off,opinion,"Oil prices suffered another weekly loss as geopolitical forces played their part in dampening sentiments  While tensions over Iraq subsided to ease supply concerns in the Middle East  expectations of increased output from Libya also pressured crude 
However  some of the negative sentiment was counterbalanced by a strong jobs report and larger than expected drop in oil stockpiles  By end of trading on Friday in New York  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures were down 1 9  during the week to close at  103 77 per barrel 
Natural gas also slumped to a three month low over the course of the week on a larger than average supply gain  This was partially offset by expectations of an uptick in electric power demand with forecasts of hotter than normal weather conditions across most parts of the U S  Natural gas prices ended Friday at  4 37 per million Btu  MMBtu   down 1 0  over the week  
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1     Oklahoma City based predominantly gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK  has spun off its oilfield services business into a stand alone  publicly traded company called Seventy Seven Energy Inc    The new entity was earlier held under Chesapeake Oilfield Operating  L L C  
2     U S  energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp s  NYSE XOM  affiliate Esso Belgium   a division of ExxonMobil Petroleum   Chemical B V B A   announced further investments at its Antwerp refinery

4     Independent energy company Warren Resources Inc   NASDAQ WRES  announced that it has acquired certain assets in Pennsylvania s Marcellus Shale from Colorado based oil and natural gas producer  Citrus Energy Corporation and two other parties that owned working interest in the region  The transaction  which marks Warren Resources  entry into the prolific natural gas basin  was for a purchase price of  352 5 million  
5     Leading contract drilling company Noble Corp   NYSE NE  intends to sell  1 185 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2022 and 2024 in a private offering to prepare for its previously announced Paragon Offshore spin off  The proceeds from the issue would be used as partial consideration for the transfer of Noble s standard specification drilling business to Paragon in connection with the spin off  which is expected to be completed in the ongoing quarter 
Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months 

Refiner Tesoro Corp   NYSE TSO  was the week s best performer among the market heavyweights  adding 2 5  to its stock price after recouping some of its losses that followed the oil export ban relaxation 
On the other end of the spectrum  the biggest loser was also a refiner   Valero Energy Corp   NYSE VLO   The downstream operator fell 1 5  during the week  extending the bearish sentiment from the previous week 
Over the last 6 months  oilfield services giant Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE SLB  was the leader of the pack with the company s shares advancing 35 0   However  offshore driller Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG  witnessed a 9 4  price decline over the same time frame

38323,259838,SLB, 3 High Yield Stocks In The Outperforming Energy Sector,opinion,"The Energy sector continues to lead all other sectors in 2014  As of 7 16 14  this sector  as measured by the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE  ETF  was up 12 73  year to date  vs  7 16  for the S P 500  and only 3 3  for the Dow 30  The XLE ETF is dominated by large cap dividend stocks  such as ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   which is its 4th largest holding  after Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  
When looking at performance  however  the majors  such as Exxon and Chevron  have greatly underperformed independent Conoco  which is up over 22  so far in 2014  vs  gains of only 5 2  for Chevron and 2 6  for Exxon 
COP also has the second highest dividend yield in the group  at 3 39   having just raised its quarterly dividend from   69 to   73  We screened for other dividend paying independent oil and gas stocks  to see if there are some other worthwhile outperformers in that sub industry  We came up with Delek Logistics LP   NYSE  DKL   a relatively new   November 2012 IPO   small cap high dividend stock  which we recently added to our  
Dividends Distributions  After spinning off its refining division in 2012  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   COP has gone from paying   66 to   69  and now   73 a quarter  DKL has raised its quarterly distribution 5 straight times since its IPO 
Options  Although COP just went ex dividend  you can still earn an attractive options yield on it  via selling November 2014 covered calls  which will also allow you to either capture the next quarterly dividend  in October  or get paid even more   if your shares get assigned  DKL has a much higher option yield  but its shares are much closer to its strike price  Our free   which is updated daily  offers more info for this and over 30 other call trades  Here are the 3 major scenarios for the DKL call trade 
With COP up over 22  in 2014  a more cautious strategy is to sell cash secured puts  at a strike price below its share price  This Nov  2014  85 put option trade offers an 11  plus annualized yield  and a breakeven of  81 70  The  3 30 put premium you d receive is over 4 times COP s next   73 quarterly dividend 
You can see more info for this and over 30 other put trades  in our  
Earnings  DKL looks undervalued on a PEG 2014 basis  but not on a 2015 PEG basis  COP has a higher 2014 PEG  but it is still below 1  and indicates some undervaluation  However  analysts are forecasting slight EPS contraction of   15  in 2015  Valuations  DKL currently has a negative book value  but this is due to non cash depreciation charges  Financials

Recap of Yesterday s Economic Events 

The Markets
Stocks ended higher on Wednesday as investors continue to react positively to second quarter earnings reports  The Dow Jones Industrial Average once again charted a new all time closing high while the S P 500 ended just below the all time peak  Earnings season picks up today with 79 companies reporting  including Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM   UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Baxter International Inc  NYSE BAX   Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI   Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   and Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK   providing a broad glimpse of the strength of corporate income statements across a variety of sectors  With a wide variety of earnings reports to be released today  we ve reached the point where investors should have obtained enough information to make equity allocation decisions for the rest of the quarter  and perhaps the rest of the year  For this reason  broad equity markets reach an inflection point on July 17th  on average  following which gains and losses are equally common through to the next earnings season in October  Despite the equal tendency for gains and losses over the next three months  losses have historically overwhelmed the gains  resulting in an average loss for US equity benchmarks  such as the S P 500 Index  The days and weeks ahead will be critical for the trend of the equity market through the remainder of the third quarter 
Equity benchmarks in the US have recorded healthy gains since mid May  fuelled by broad participation across a number of sectors as economic data has strengthened following the winter  Since May 16th  the S P 500 Index is up 5 92   the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 4 20   and the NASDAQ Composite is up 8 77   With broad market participation from mid May through to the start of July  the S P 500 Equally Weighted Index outperformed the Capitalization Weighted Index  breaking a declining relative trend for the equally weighted benchmark that spanned from February through to May  The equally weighted benchmark has started to show signs of underperformance  yet again  providing some concern as to the strength of the broad market  This can be a sign of waning equity market strength  typically a leading indication of weakness ahead 

Looking forward to the back half of the year  one of the sectors that tends to perform well is the Telecommunications sector  The sector has averaged gains from the start of September through to the end of December  outperforming the S P 500 Index over the period  Average gain for the sector over the four months is 7 5  during a period when volatility often peaks  Although the broad sector kicks off its period of seasonal strength beginning in approximately six weeks  on average  there are individual stocks that begin this seasonal run early  One of these stocks is Telus  which has averaged seasonal gains between the end of July and the end of December  Average return for the telecommunications company over the period exceeds 14   outperforming the S P 500 Index by over 10   Telus is presently testing a critical level of support around  38  representing horizontal support  as well as the 200 day moving average  Momentum indicators are showing early signs of curling higher following the recent selloff  suggesting a possible low ahead of the period of seasonal strength  Telecommunication stocks typically offer appealing dividend yields  allowing the sector to outperform during periods of volatility  as is typical during August and September

38325,259840,SLB,Factset  Revenue Upside Surprises  Haven t Seen This In A While  ,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuters    This Week in Earnings  the forward 4 quarter S P 500 estimate rose to  127 07 last week  from the prior week s  126 75 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate is now 15 5 x  and the PEG ratio  P E to Growth ratio  of the S P 500 has fallen to 1 76 x  the lowest since July 6th  2012 s PEG of 1 48 x  
On July 6th  2012  the forward 4 quarter estimate for the S P 500 was  110 94  and the P E ratio was 12 2 x    I d love to tell readers that the PEG has some predictive value regarding forward returns for the S P 500  but through late 2012 and all of 2013 the PEG was within the high 2s  low 3s range   What the PEG ratio might speak to is the unending cacophony by CNBC guests about the  record P E  ratio on the S P 500 and S P 500 valuation  The fact is  in my opinion  using S P 500 earnings data  the S P 500 trading at 15 5 x  forward earnings earnings  with expected growth of 7    9  this year  just doesn t seem that expensive 
The earnings yield on the S P 500 for our Fed model fans  as of July 18th  2014  is 6 42   The earnings yield on the S P 500 has steadily fallen as the appreciation in the S P 500 has been faster than the annual earnings growth 
Most importantly  the year over year  y y  forward 4 quarter growth rate on the S P 500 jumped to 8 85   the highest y y growth rate since Jan 13  2012 s 9 40  
As we wrote on this blog last week   the y y growth rate of the S P 500 s forward estimate is something that needs to be monitored 
Analysis   commentary  Bespoke had some good graphs and commentary on the low volatility we are seeing across many markets  not just the S P 500  but at some point we should have a healthy 5    7  correction in the S P 500  as we have had since the summer meltdown of 2011  Healthy markets correct  and the S P 500 still needs a good flush  If memory serves  it has been over 360   370 trading days since the S P 500 has touched its 200 day moving average 
Financial earnings this past week  including JP Morgan  NYSE JPM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Bank of America  NYSE BAC  and even General Electric  NYSE GE   yes you can think of GE as a financial  had decent earnings reports  in my opinion  Year over year earnings growth for Financials has fallen from  3  last week to  8  as of Friday  July 18th  but we now think this will be the bottom for the sector  According to Thomson Reuters  the Citigroup  NYSE C  charge cost the S P 500 1 7  in expected Q2  14 total S P 500 earnings growth 
Per Facstset  and despite JPM s warning in mid quarter about the fixed income market trading slowdown  Capital Markets within Financials are reporting the highest y y growth at 22  
The S P 500 is now expecting 5  Q2  14 y y earnings growth  but if we ex Citigroup  C  from the S P 500  expected earnings growth increases to 6 7    Thomson Reuters did not provide C s impact on just the Financial sector s expected growth  Assume it is quite material  
Factset notes that with 82 of the S P 500 companies having reported  the  revenue beat rate  of 70  quarter to date is at a record high  That would be a significant change to the quarterly patterns if its holds up through the end of July and mid August  2014 
Per Factset s John Butters  Energy  Financials and Healthcare are the sectors with the greatest upside surprises   Energy s revenue upside surprise is unexpected I would imagine  Bodes well for the sector  but was it a function of Iraq driven bump in crude oil prices in Q2  14   
Although less than 20  of the S P 500 has reported  the big takeaway this past week was that the Financials are in good shape  expectations may have gotten too low  and the Capital Markets may not be dead  even with low volatility  We sold Goldman  NYSE GS  last January  14 in all accounts and will remain out of the name until the stock trades into the mid  140s  If you want to play capital market activity  JPM  and BAC and even Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  will work  and could be nice trades through year end 2014   Long JPM  BAC  
Energy s numbers are looking better too  We ve never been good investors in the group  and while Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  are thought to be the low beta names  and thus thought to be safer  we will avoid for now  I think the oil services like Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  are too extended technically  long only HAL in the Energy sector  and Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU   which could be Energy or Basic Materials  
Conclusion  Q2  14 earnings are off to a decent start  2014 full year S P 500 earnings growth is still expected at 8 7  per Thomson Reuters  The revenue upside noted by Factset is a pleasant surprise  Let s see if it holds up through the bulk of earnings this coming week  It is a positive that the dollar estimate rose week over week in the first heavy week of earnings reporting by S P 500 companies  The improvement in the y y forward growth rate for the S P 500 continues  Remember though  in 1994  the S P 500 grew earnings 19  and the S P 500 rose 1  in that calendar year  as the Greenspan lifted interest rates 6 x  in that remarkable year  S P 500 earnings are a fundamental positive for this market  but the S P 500 is also overdue for a decent correction

Commentary
On July 30th  I pointed out a  quiet  divergence between a plunging T2108 and a relatively calm S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY    The next day  the S P 500 took the plunge to the tune of a 2  loss  On Friday  September 12 another quiet divergence occurred 
Just like the last quiet diverge  T2108 has been steadily dropping while the S P 500 has managed to trade relatively flat  This time around the divergence is particularly wide and thus even more concerning  T2108 dropped from 49  on Thursday to 38   Another big drop on Monday  and the market will hit quasi oversold conditions  Under 40  with this kind of speed also has me wondering about an imminent visit toward true oversold conditions  below 20   
T2108 plunges

While T2108 demonstrates that a good number of stocks are losing altitude again  the S P 500 has barely responded  On Friday  it only lost 0 60  
The S P 500 has lost its primary upward momentum  but it has done well to hover above its 50DMA

So if history repeats  we should brace for a notable pullback on Monday  Note well that the Federal Reserve announces another policy decision on Wednesday the 17th  I would normally say this meeting should provide more Novocaine for any of the market s pains  However  there is some nagging fear that the Fed is going to come out the next meeting with guns blazing with hawkishness  It is amazing how quickly the market narrative can change  Just three months ago the  media hyped up  fear was that the Fed was falling behind the inflation curve   at the time and rightfully so 
While we wait for the resolution of the quiet divergence and then the Fed meeting  here are some interesting stock charts to study 
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  was my great trade of the week  I mentioned the setup in   I almost got a double on the put options  I sold because I did not see any follow through after the first 30 minutes of selling  With expiration coming up next Friday  September 19th   I thought it made sense to lock in the profits now before time  and perhaps the Fed  erode the value of the puts  These profits easily paid for the calls I bought for a hedge as well as leave me with a tidy net profit  So  if EEM retains its uptrend  I have some time to make money on both sides of the trade while letting the house pay for the bullish side  However  I think EEM s slide   led by its Brazilian component   confirmed the flag is waving a bright red color 
Despite the small breakdown  EEM is still in an uptrend defined by the 50DMA

Schlumberger Limited  The oil complex is falling fast  Oil related plays were the darling of 2014  They are quickly turning into goats  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  has gone from about a 28  gain for the first half of 2014 to a complete reversal of the large surge on June 25th  to a failed retest of its 50DMA as resistance  to what now seems a near certain retest of 200DMA as support  I have this one on my active radar now 
Schlumberger Limited looks set to retest its 200DMA support

Crocs Crocs  NASDAQ CROX  has quickly gone from bullish promise to bearish disappointment  The essential confirmation came last Thursday when a single analyst downgrade to neutral seemed sufficient to send the stock gapping down below 200DMA support  This move confirms a complete wipe out of July s large earnings surge  to unload my last CROX  position  and the likely continuation of the downtrend in place since the large gap up on December 30th  Given THAT move failed to erase an earnings gap down from July  2013  CROX should likely be treated like a broken stock 
The analyst driven gap down confirms a bearish reversal of the 1 day post earnings excitement in July

38328,259843,SLB,Will Lightening Strike Twice For The Energy Sector ,opinion,"In The Age of Too Much Information  more and more investors are falling behind the actual benchmark returns  We see this in the returns as measured by extremely large representative samplings  The reason for this under performance is emotion  And the triggers that make us more emotional are the access to minute to minute data that make us either  1  fear we will lose money just because the market is down 250 points on one unusual day or  2  greed  when we see that it is up 250 points on one outlier day 
Thousands of Internet sites scream  Buy  Sell  Don t just sit there and get passed by   DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW   And therein lies the problem  Any buy sell hold discipline has gone out the window 
We will not  beat the market  every year  But we will hew to a discipline that is both rational and repeatable  This trend is eternal 
Semper Paratus
 Always Ready   This is the motto of the Coast Guard  I ve had the privilege of working with the  Coasties  over many years of counter drug   counter terrorism work  I have great respect for this fine group of men and women  In fact  I think they do more with less than just about any other national organization 
We strive to remain  always ready  in our investing too  We aren t initiating any new long positions right now  but you may be certain that when we do it will be in the sectors we find most attractive at the time  the selections will be tops in their field  and the prices will be right  This typically means that we buy during market corrections  though sometimes there can be declines in one sector that get overdone  even as the market they are in is itself continuing to climb  
The next thing we do is try to identify the sectors most likely to benefit  This usually means finding a sector that is cheap relative to its historic P E  Price Sales  Price Book  etc  and has a catalyst working in its favor to change investor perception  And finally  we want to own the most highly regarded firms within that sector or specific industry  By  highly regarded  I do not mean the shills for hire at Wall Street brokerage firms  I mean most highly regarded by their peers  by their customers  and by potential new customers 
First comes the most important decision  whether to invest in emerging markets or US equities or US bonds or some other asset  Then comes the analysis of which sector makes the most sense  And then and only then comes the decision of which closed end fund  ETF or individual company to buy  In each case  but especially for individual stocks  we seek to buy one of the top quality outfits that are most respected by peers and customers 
This analysis leads me right now to prepare for a market decline and subsequent opportunity in energy firms  most of which are now down on the false belief that  since America is quickly becoming  once again  energy self sufficient  oil and gas prices must fall and therefore energy exploration and production will prove less profitable 
Will Lightning Strike Twice for the Energy Sector 
Yes  Twice  Three times  Ten times  While we of course need food to survive  we need energy to irrigate fields  to power tractors  to truck the food to us  Energy is essential for any post stone age society  The price of various energy sources is supply demand dependent  When prices retreat  energy companies  stocks retreat  Semper Paratus  We stand ready to buy when this happens 
I noted last month that the stocks that allowed us to so out pace the markets from 2000 2002 was buying integrated energy firms  pipeline companies  oilfield service firms and so on  with the drillers that supply the rigs to the energy industry providing the very best returns 
Right now  sufficient energy supplies exist so the price of oil has dropped below  90 a barrel  West Texas Intermediate price   Sounds about right   the driving  construction  air conditioning and growing harvesting seasons are drawing to a close and the winter need for energy to heat our homes and workplaces hasn t yet begun  Buy your straw hats in the fall  We want to be ready to buy quality energy firms in the coming couple months  even if we only nibble now 
Last month I mentioned that among our top choices would be Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   Oceaneering International  NYSE OII   Seadrill  NYSE SDRL   Atwood Oceanics  NYSE ATW  and Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG   Our emphasis is on US companies and those international firms with at least 50  of their operations in the US or US waters  After all  the US is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and our oil and gas exports hit a new high last month 
For me the Energy Services sub sector is the best way to profit going forward  I then break this sub sector into four key industries for our consideration 
Machinery providers  This would include great companies like National Oilwell  NYSE NOV   Dresser Rand  NYSE DRC  currently subject to a possible takeover by German giant Siemens  OTC SIEGY  and BOLT Technology  NASDAQ BOLT  
Field  and Marine  Services  Schlumberger Ltd  NYSE SLB   Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Spectra Energy  NYSE SE  and Oceaneering International  NYSE OII  are companies in this side of the business 
Transport and Storage  This includes companies that provide pipelines  MLPs and storage facilities  companies like Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Enbridge Energy Partners LP  NYSE EEP  and Williams Companies  NYSE WMB  
Drillers  The aforementioned Seadrill  NYSE SDRL   Atwood Oceanics  NYSE ATW  and Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG  are among the most interesting in this group 
Whether oil prices are up or down there are many new opportunities around the world  especially in the offshore and offshore deep arenas  Brazil is com mitted to spending billions to prove its oil reserves offshore and Mexico is moving much faster than most observers predicted in opening up their exploration prospects to foreign firms 
Pemex  Mexico s oil company  is keeping about 90  of the nation s proved and probable reserves  In my opinion  that s not where the value lies  They  should  be seeking to joint venture with better positioned  deeper pocketed  more hi tech firms in the vast areas as yet unexplored  It looks as if  Round One  of the bidding will include 109 exploration tracts  and 60 producing tracts  in mid 2015 
The drillers  currently suffering from the lowest day rates for their rigs in recent memory  stand to see a serious uptick in utilization as Mexico and Brazil add to their demand for rigs  While the demand is likely to remain weak for the rest of 2014 and possibly into the first quarter of 2015  I consider this an opportunity buy cheaply into what I believe will be a boom by summertime 
Which drillers will benefit most  I believe the biggest  with the deepest pockets  and the best reputations will weather the under utilization storm and emerge stronger than ever when day rates once again accelerate  Don t be fooled by charts like this one 

The chart above comes from Pacific Drilling  NYSE PACD   a great little company we have owned in our Aggressive Growth portfolio in the past  They can be forgiven for being a bit self serving  The chart purports to show that the  old fleet  of rigs held by the likes of Transocean  Noble  NYSE NE   Rowan  NYSE RDC   Diamond Offshore Drilling NYSE DO  and ENSCO  NYSE ESV  make them uncompetitive against those with the newest high specification drillers 
What the company doesn t mention is that they own just 7 rigs  and their peer competitor  Ocean Rig  has just 10  For comparison  Diamond Offshore has 49 and Transocean has 79  Who do you think Pemex and Petrobras  Brazil s national oil company  are going to be most comfortable partnering with   huge firms with decades of experience and reputation or the younger firms hoping to expand their fleet by 14  next year   with the addition of  1  more rig 
That s not to disparage PACD  I uncovered it a couple of years back and still see it as the  1 takeover choice for a firm like RIG or DO  Both need to increase their share of newer rigs and it s a heck of a lot easier to buy a company  even at a premium  and gain shiny new rigs immediately than to place orders with shipyards at unknown today costs for something that will take another two years to build and deliver   Speaking of self serving  Carl Icahn s attempt to bleed RIG dry by insisting on huge cash dividend payouts could hurt RIG s ability to acquire another firm  Investors interested only in dividends may applaud his latest raid  It does nothing for the future of the company  
Of all the companies in this space  I like Transocean best  RIG has the most potential based on its available equipment  its worldwide presence  and its new build schedule into 2017  Their management has been hampered by the Icahn raid but  given his board representation  is doing a good job of running their business  79 rigs  many stacked right now  still counts for a lot when an oil major wants to drill tomorrow  not 6 months from now 
I said last month I liked Seadrill a lot  as well  Part of that is because they gave us a whopping capital gain during the last exploration explosion  part of it is their 16   yes  16   yield  which is only a 45  dividend payout ratio  However  SDRL is highly leveraged  and in this business trailing earnings are not a valid harbinger of current earnings  That dividend may not be sustainable  especially since the company predicts no uptick in rig usage until the summer of 2015 
Of course  they could slash the dividend by 50  and still be paying an 8  yield  They have a lot of floating rate debt which  if interest rates rise rapidly  would force them to retrench  Among the positives  however  are a large high specification fleet and high insider ownership  We might nibble a little now  On a dividend cut that drives the stock down to the high teens and low 20s  our last entry point  and assuming stable interest rate projections  we d buy with both hands 
The other driller I mentioned last month  Atwood Oceanics  NYSE ATW   I ll discuss in another post  To complete our discussion of the Bigs here  however  let me at least briefly touch upon Noble  Rowan  Ensco and Diamond Offshore 
Noble has a well diversified fleet  but has to date only been able to obtain below average day rates and has multiple stacked rigs  It is likely a fine long term holding  but I think we ll do better with others 
Rowan is one of the best of the mid cap drillers and has handled this downturn very well   better than most of its peers  It has a preponderance of jackup rigs  which is seen as a negative by many analysts  I don t agree with them  When a client needs rigs  they don t always need the latest and greatest for the mundane effort of dealing with not as deep drilling as the new rigs are designed for  Rowan has done a fine job of staggering contracts  Management is on the ball 
Ensco is a solid company  but I need to see better asset  rig  utilization before I buy them  I think they over stacked too early in the game and lost opportunity to other firms  We ll see if they play it a little smarter going forward 
Diamond Offshore  maligned by most analysts  was the surprise of my research this past month  Its fleet is relatively old and the company doesn t seem that aggressive  But under the current depressed conditions for the industry  DO has a higher credit rating  better interest coverage  and more assets than any of those I surveyed except  by some parameters  RIG 
The rigs they have stacked are nearly fully depreciated  so there is negligible revenue impact  They are a proven entity which has been through similar downturns many times in the past and know how to weather these downturns  And they have a history of using such downturns as an opportunity to buy more highly leveraged firms in their space  Finally  they are well regarded internationally so it s likely they will be at or near the top of the shopping list for firms and governments around the globe 
Next month I ll move on to the other industries that comprise the energy services sub sector ",2014-10-13,Joseph L. Shaefer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-lightening-strike-twice-for-the-energy-sector-228738,228738
38363,259878,SLB,Trading The Pullback,opinion,"At the close of trading on March 21  our rule based market timing model shifted from  neutral  to  sell  mode  after previously slipping from  buy  to  neutral  mode on March 12 
When the timing system first enters into a new  sell  mode  it primarily acts as a  no nonsense   objective way to keep us out of trouble by reminding that new buy entries do not carry positive odds of working in our favor 
In such a newly triggered  sell  mode  we seek to increase our cash position  while also selectively shifting our focus towards trading ETFs with a low correlation to the direction of the broad market  commodity  currency  fixed income  etc  
As a  sell  signal matures and becomes more confirmed by time and price  short selling of weak stocks also becomes part of  the trading plan  but for now it is still too early to enter new short positions for momentum swing trading 
Static Cling Of The 50 Day Moving Average
Despite weakening performance in leading stocks and recent broad market distribution  higher volume selling  that sparked the new  sell  signal  it s important to note that both the S P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials Average are still trading firmly above key  intermediate term support of their 50 day moving averages 
On the other hand  the Nasdaq has clearly begun showing relative weakness to the S P and Dow  but has yet to breakdown below support of its 50 day moving average 

On both March 24 and 25  circled in pink   the NASDAQ  undercut  support of its 50 day moving average on an intraday basis  but still managed to close each trading session above it 
It s a similar technical picture in the Nasdaq 100  the large cap brother of the NASDAQ Composite  
Below is the chart of PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   a popular ETF proxy for the NASDAQ 100 Index 

Since banks  mutual funds  hedge funds  and other institutions frequently utilize program trading to buy pullbacks to the 50 day moving averages  it was not surprising to see buyers stepping in each time the NASDAQ brothers neared that pivotal price level in recent days 
Biotech Blues
One of the biggest anchors holding the NASDAQ down over the past week has been heavy selling pressure in the market leading biotechnology index 
Between just two recent trading days  March 21 and 24   iShares NASDAQ Biotech Index Fund  IBB  plunged 10  
More concerning is that IBB sliced through its 50 day moving average with ease  as volume surged higher as well 

Because biotech has been one of the strongest industry sectors for many months of the current bull run  it will be important to see how IBB reacts in the coming weeks 
While IBB may be able to manage a short term bounce from its current level  the technical damage has already been done and IBB will need at least a few weeks  possibly months  to clean itself up 
Sector Rotation Keeping The Fire Burning
While leading stocks in the NASDAQ have broken down  energy and financial related stocks have held ground  allowing the S P 500 to outperform the NASDAQ lately 
Large cap  blue chip  stocks have recently begun leading the stock market  as evidenced by recent breakout action in energy and financial stocks 
Energy stock Haliburton  NYSE HAL  set a new all time high within the past two weeks  while Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  is attacking its highs of 2011 
Even the International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  dinosaur woke up a few days ago by ripping through major price resistance at  190 on big volume 
Base On Base Ain t Bad
A base on base chart pattern occurs when the price action of a recent breakout is unable to extend much beyond the highs of the prior base  former resistance   but also doesn t give up much ground 
The lows of the new base that forms should hold at or above the highs of the prior base  giving that  base on top of a base  look 
One example of a possible base on base in the works can be found in the following chart of Bank of America Corporation  NYSE BAC  
At the beginning of the month  BAC was close to breaking down below its 50 day MA  but has since broken out to a fresh 52 week high 
Although the breakout hasn t been explosive in terms of extending much beyond the highs of the prior base  BAC may simply chop around for several weeks  forming a base on base type pattern while the broad market consolidates 

Like BAC  the Financial SPDR ETF  ARCA XLF  also broke out to new highs and stalled out 

With XLF  last Friday s false breakout  above the prior swing high suggests the price could be headed for several weeks of chop  which could potentially form another base on base pattern if the ETF holds above its 50 day moving average 
While it is encouraging that select blue chips are valiantly fighting to push higher with base on base patterns  you still must not forget that the recent pullback in the NASDAQ has forced the top leadership stocks to pull back to support of their 50 day moving averages  
Leading stocks like Tesla Motors Inc   NASDAQ TSLA   which we re still holding with an unrealized gain of 48    Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB     we recently sold for a 49  gain    and Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS  must hold on to their rising 50 day moving averages 10 week moving averages to keep the dominant stock market rally alive 
Most tech leadership stocks of the NASDAQ have been hit hard over the past several sessions and will need at least a few weeks of basing action in order to produce  low risk  reliable buy entry points 
Here s The Plan  Man 
With our market timing system in  sell  mode  our near term trading plan is to lay low and see how the market responds to recent selling in the coming days 
If new buy setups develop down the road  we can certainly add some long exposure to our stock and ETF portfolios 
If  for example  the NASDAQ continues holding above its 50 day moving average over the next one to two weeks  our timing model could easily return to  buy  mode  especially if leading NASDAQ stocks rip higher after testing their 50 day moving averages  
But for now  there still isn t much to do on the long side without pushing it 
Conversely   if market conditions continue deteriorating  we will eventually visit the short side of the market 
Yet  there is no need to rush into short selling right now 
Patience and discipline is the key to preserving profits in markets that are indecisive and or in transition 
Without much effort  anyone can be a rock star in a parabolic bull market 
But what separates the professionals from amateurs is knowing when to take your foot off the gas pedal 
Clearly  right now is one of those moments ",2014-03-26,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-the-pullback-207512,207512
38364,259879,SLB,Caution Flag Stays Out As Stocks Continue Consolidation,opinion,"As Q1 of 2014 comes to an end  we can see that January was extremely weak  February gained it all back  and March treaded water  At this point  as we head into what has been the strongest month of the year over the past 20 years  signals are mixed  with a steadily recovering economy and bullish fundamental indicators mixed with neutral technical and some bearish sentiment indicators 
Most of the ETF inflows in Q1 have been into bond funds rather than rotating out of bonds and into equities  as has been expected given a recovering economy and Fed tapering  So  rather than seeing rising interesting rates  Treasury yields have come down  with the U S  10 Year yield closing Friday at 2 72   versus a 52 week high of 3 06  and 52 week low of 1 62    Also  Gold has made something of a comeback this year  up over  7  YTD  With the Fed Funds rate due to increase no sooner than six months after tapering is complete  we should see short term rates remain low until around mid 2015 
There has been a notable selloff recently in many of the momentum stocks  This has been expected for some time  as the high equity correlations and  all boats lifted on a rising tide  mentality of 2013 transitions into a more thoughtful stock picking environment  which should lead more investment capital into the higher quality companies and less into the speculative darlings  Also  the Russell 2000 small caps took a  3 5  hit last week  On the other hand  stocks in China and emerging markets have been trying to bounce after a miserable stretch  The iShares FTSE Xinhua China 25 Index  ARCA FXI   recently broke above its 50 day moving average  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  is back above both its 50  and 200 day moving averages 
Among the ten U S  business sectors  Energy was the big winner last week  up more than  2   Utilities is still the leader year to date   7 5    followed by Healthcare   4    This is similar to what happened during Q1 of 2013 
When long term rates finally begin to rise and the yield curve steepens  the Financial sector should prove to be a beneficiary  Notably  the securities industry paid  26 7 billion in bonuses during 2013  which was the highest since 2008  However  904 hedge funds closed their doors during 2013  many of them long short equity or global macro strategies  which proved particularly difficult in the prevailing market environment 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   has been staying right around 15 during the period of consolidation  which is slightly elevated from the low levels below 12 that it was hitting during the periods of market strength  Most market observers are expecting higher volatilities going forward 
SPY chart review
The SPDR S P 500 Trust ETF  ARCA SPY   closed Friday at 185 49  which is still within spittin  distance of its all time highs  After a pullback from overbought conditions at the top of the long standing rising channel  SPY continues to find support from prior resistance turned support at 185  and it sits smack dab in the middle of the rising channel  It also tested its 50 day simple moving average on Thursday  The sideways consolidation pattern has morphed into what might be a descending triangle pattern  which could be foretelling a reversal signal  bearish   On the other hand  it might be just some more of the same sideways action that could break either direction  and oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have all worked off their overbought conditions and now are either in a neutral or oversold position  bullish  

However  if SPY declines further  there are plenty of support levels to cushion the fall  starting with the 50 day SMA  near 184   the 100 day SMA  near 183   round number support at 180  and the bottom of the rising channel  currently near 178  
Latest sector rankings
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The  Outlook Score  employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting score   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes our Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well   safe havens   when the market is weak 
Outlook Score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  Technology  Industrial  Healthcare  Consumer Goods  Consumer Services  Energy  Basic Materials  Telecom  and Utilities  Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology  iShares DJSU Technology  IYW   is once again in the top spot with a strong Outlook score of 88  Utilities  iShares DJSU Utilities  IDU   has fallen back to fourth place as Wall Street s sell side analysts are still upgrading earnings estimates  but not in quite the same magnitude  Instead  Financial  iShares DJSU Financial Sector  IYF   is solidly in second place as it scores 73 for the third week in a row  Technology has consistently displayed solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a relatively low forward P E  the highest return ratios  and fine sentiment among sell side analysts  net positive revisions to forward earnings estimates   Financial displays one of the lowest forward P Es and decent sentiment among both sell side analysts and company insiders  open market buying   Healthcare  iShares DJSU Healthcare Index  IYH   is third at 65  followed by Utilities  IDU  and Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  IYE    Notably  from a valuation standpoint  Energy displays the lowest forward P E 
2   Consumer Services  iShares DJSU Consumer  IYC   stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 5  as the retail sector continues to see cuts to forward guidance and negative earnings revisions by Wall Street  Consumer Services  a k a   consumer cyclicals or consumer discretionary  displays a high forward P E and weak sentiment among both Wall Street analysts and company insiders  Nevertheless  the sector still boasts the highest forward long term growth rate  Telecommunications  IYZ  is again in the second worst spot  scoring 11 this week  as it continues to display among the lowest scores on most of the factors in the model  including the highest forward P E  valuation   low return ratios  and a low projected long term growth rate 
3   Overall  this week s fundamentals based sector rankings have returned to a slightly bullish bias after a couple of neutral weeks with the caution flag up  This is my subjective interpretation given that Tech and Financial are the solid leaders  with Energy and Industrial scoring pretty well  too  Among the defensive sectors  the high score for Utilities is still somewhat cautionary  but Consumer Goods has fallen back a bit  As I think about it  I would say a caution flag is still present in these rankings 
4   Looking at the Bull scores  four sectors    Tech  Energy  Industrial  and Basic Materials  iShares DJSU Basic Materials Index  IYM      all score 55  with Telecom right behind at 54  while Utilities  IDU  is by far the laggard with a score of 43  In fact  Utilities is the only sector scoring below 50  The top bottom spread is 12 points  reflecting moderately high sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally preferable in a healthy market to see the top bottom spread approach 20 points 
5   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities scores a 63  giving a clear indication that stocks within this defensive sector are the preferred  safe havens  on recent weak market days  Technology scores the lowest with a 46  The top bottom spread is 17 points  reflecting relatively low sector correlations on weak market days  which is a good sign for a healthy market  But it is generally preferable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of 20 points 
6   Overall  Technology easily displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Consumer Services is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy and Telecom share the lead  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  Consumer Services scores the lowest  indicating investor avoidance  relatively speaking  during extreme conditions 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Financial sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas
Our Sector Rotation Model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  IYW   Financial  IYF   and Energy  IYE  in the current bullish climate   We consider the bias to be bullish because the SPY is still above its 50 and 200 day simple moving averages  Note  If you are more comfortable moving to a neutral bias  the model suggests replacing Energy with Healthcare    
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Financial  Energy  and Healthcare sectors include iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF   SOXX O   PowerShares DWA Financial Momentum Portfolio  PFI   iShares Global Energy ETF  ARCA IXC   and SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals ETF  SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals  XPH   
For an  enhanced  sector portfolio that employs top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Tech  Financial  and Energy  some long ideas include SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK   QUALCOMM  NASDAQ QCOM   Capital One Financial  NYSE COF   Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   Helmerich   Payne Inc  NYSE HP   and Schlumberger  NYSE SLB   All are ranked highly in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles of our   which is a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  our Sector Rotation Model would suggest holding Utilities  IDU   Energy  IYE   and Consumer Goods  IYK

With the S P 500 s 1 7  gain this past week  the P E ratio on the forward estimate rose to 15 x   The PEG ratio jumped to 2 25 x  
The  earnings yield  on the S P 500 is now 6 359   still very elevated relative to the 10 year Treasury yield at 2 72   For those Fed model followers  stocks remain pretty attractive in terms of relative value to the bond market

As the reader can quickly see  forward estimates are looking for the first year over year growth for the sector in two years  as we move through 2014  Q2  14 is looking especially strong  although we don t start seeing those earnings reports until mid July  2014  Again these are  forward estimates  and still subject to revision 
Our sole energy holding today is Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and if Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  and Schlumberger s   NYSE SLB  earnings were any indication  HAL should have a good quarter

38367,259882,SLB,Why Energy Is Once Again Catching The Market s Eye,opinion,"Over the last month the energy sector has outperformed the market  and as you can see in the chart below  has done so by 6 5 percent  Year to date the sector is beating the S P 500 Index by over 3 percent  In a spectacularly performing market during 2013  energy lacked some of the incredible performance seen throughout the other sectors  but recently it has turned up  catching the attention of the market yet again  What s causing this sudden shift in relative strength  As our Director of Research John Derrick describes  on the Periodic Table of Sector Returns  it is not unusual to see sectors move from top to bottom from one year to the next  For example  energy ranked as one of the top performing sectors from 2004 through 2007  but quickly lost momentum in 2008 when it was hit the hardest after the financial crisis  In 2012 and 2013 energy turned in some solid numbers  but lagged in comparison to the other sectors  In looking at an overview of market performance  it s important to recognize what caused the moves  For example  one reason the energy sector is climbing back up  could be due to the broader market rotation that we ve noticed recently  from growth stocks to value stocks  Growth stocks are generally successful companies that are expected to continue growing their earnings  usually at a rate that outpaces the market  causing investors to pay more for them  Value stocks rarely outpace the market as much as growth stocks do  Investors see potential in buying these cheaper names  ones that trade at lower price to earnings  P E  ratios than the S P average  because they still have the potential to significantly outperform over time  As I mentioned  in the past few weeks high growth names have pulled back  while value names are steadily gaining momentum  One of the main reasons for this rotation is that some investors view the valuations of growth names as too high  especially in comparison to the value companies  What s significant is that many of these value names happen to be in the energy sector  We ve taken advantage of this shift to value in our Global Resources Fund through names like Pacific Rubiales Energy  PEGFF PK  and Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO   Although this rotation is important to the recent moves in energy  it is not the only factor driving the sector up  Take a look at the price of Crude Oil and Natural Gas  Currently  natural gas prices are starting to stabilize while the price of West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil is up by 4 percent year to date  reaching  104 a barrel just last week  This price increase in WTI is linked to concerns over future supply  but nevertheless higher oil prices bode well for stocks within the energy sector  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   short term projections for the price of WTI remain relatively high  Additionally  the group commented that 

Aside from seasonal issues  the EIA expects strong crude oil production growth  primarily concentrated in the Bakken  Eagle Ford  and Permian regions  continuing through 2015  Forecast production increases from an estimated 7 4 million barrels per day in 2013 to 8 4 million barrels per day in 2014 and 9 1 million barrels per day in 2015 

This projection is good for North American producers and service companies  So how can you gain entry into this energy opportunity  I continue to stay focused on companies that show robust fundamentals and are located in sectors showing strength  Currently  we are capturing the latest takeoff in the energy sector through our exposure to companies that are reasonably valued  In addition to the two I mentioned previously  if you look at the fund s top 10 holdings you will also see our investments in large cap names like Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG  and Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   Are you ready to energize your portfolio Disclosure  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry  the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries

38368,259883,SLB,Business Conditions Soft  Not For Baker Hughes  Haliburton,opinion,"If business conditions are good for a public company  then it s highly likely that its share price has already been doing well in this great monetary expansion 
With the stock market at a high  it s tricky being a new buyer speculator  As we ve seen with biotechnology stocks  the price momentum can quite suddenly come to a halt 
One sector where there is more price momentum to be had is in oil  Not so much in the large  integrated oil companies but in domestic mid tier producers as well as services  In the large cap space  Baker Hughes Incorporated  NYSE BHI  is now experiencing renewed momentum  both operationally and on the stock market  This oil and gas equipment and services company is seeing solid sales growth in North American operations as well as the Middle East 
In spite of unusually cold weather accounting for a drop in North America s well count  the company was able to grow domestic first quarter sales by 6 7  to  2 78 billion  Total sales for the first quarter grew 10  to  5 7 billion  while earnings grew 23  to  328 million 
Baker Hughes has been buying back a lot of its own shares  3 4 million in the first quarter   and the stock recently began a new uptrend  The company s two year stock chart is featured below 

Halliburton Co   NYSE HAL  is also experiencing renewed operational and price momentum on the stock market 
The largest oil and gas services company by revenue is Schlumberger Limited  NYSE SLB   Its first quarter sales grew to  11 2 billion  up from  10 6 billion comparatively 
Diluted earnings per share rose to  1 21 from  0 94 in the same quarter last year  The company bought back almost 10 million of its shares during the first quarter  spending approximately  900 million 
Schlumberger is expected to grow its revenues in the high single digits this year and next  Earnings should improve some 20  this year compared to 2013  and the Street estimates another 15  in 2015 
So there s definitely operational momentum in oil and gas services  and according to the financial statements  margins are improving 
Share prices have already gone up  but this is a market that favors existing winners  With oil and gas prices holding firm  there s no reason why Schlumberger and Baker Hughes won t keep ticking higher throughout the year 
The one advantage that the big players have in oil and gas services is operational and geographical diversification  The well count is down in North America due to adverse weather conditions  but the effect is being mitigated by stronger activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Middle East  New product and software technology is also padding sales and helping with margins 
Schlumberger s management expects oil prices to hold firm this year  with natural gas pulling back into consolidation  Spending growth rates on oil and gas services are expected to be evenly split between international and North American markets 
In January  Schlumberger announced a substantial 28  increase to its quarterly dividend  This is the third year in a row that the company has effected a double digit dividend increase 
Looking at the numbers and company forecasts  there is operational momentum with oil and gas services  I suspect the price momentum will remain with this group of stocks near term

38369,259884,SLB,3 Safe Energy Stocks About To Explode,opinion,"Exactly one year ago  I predicted that three companies were about to blast higher as the global  picked up steam  I hope you listened 
Each company has trounced the market by a wide margin in that timeframe  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  has jumped from  74 to  104   a 40  move  This year  revenue is going to reach more than  45 billion 
Baker Hughes  NYSE BHI  is up by 48   charging from  47 to  70  It s expected to pull in more than  22 billion in sales this year  Then there s Halliburton  NYSE HAL   which has rocketed 54   from  42 to  65  And revenue will clock in at around  29 billion in 2014 
I expect more gains to come  too  as all three companies are set for continued growth  Especially considering this new revenue stream that has yet to be priced into shares 
Billions in New Revenue About to Hit
The three companies above are all about to receive a ton of additional business from some unlikely new sources  I m talking about foreign governments  Countries like Brazil  Venezuela  Iraq and many locations in North Africa are looking to extract as much profit from their natural resources as possible 
To do this  they re looking to modernize equipment  make their operations more efficient and  of course  drill for more oil and gas  And they ll need pick and shovel companies like HAL  BHI and SLB to meet their goals  These firms won t just be signing million dollar contracts  either 
Once these countries start ramping up operations  we ll see billions hit the marketplace over the next decade  Once this news starts pouring in  I expect share prices to ramp up accordingly 
No End in Sight
It should come as no surprise that these companies are outperforming both the general market and most of their competitors in the oil and gas sector  Natural gas and shale oil discoveries are increasing  production is off the charts  and both onshore and offshore activity is at levels not seen before 
During times like these  pick and shovel companies claim the biggest rewards  Simple as that  No sector is more immune to new competition  either  The barrier to entry in the oil services business is huge  since capital expenses  for drilling and transportation equipment  maritime logistics and information technology  are in the billions  So when it comes to  safe  exposure to the biggest energy boom that the world has ever seen  nothing beats this killer trio 
Now  while these companies are reasonably priced right now  they re not exactly cheap  Heck  even when oil and gas prices were lower  their businesses were thriving  since their services are used in the daily management of various assets 
The only way these energy stocks are going to get cheap is if the market corrects  Fortunately  the market has a habit of doing just that 
Be prepared to take action when the time comes  Rest assured  I ll continue to keep my eye on these three stocks moving forward ",2014-06-11,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-safe-energy-stocks-about-to-explode-215720,215720
38404,259919,SLB,Global Malaise Not Effecting These Countries  Or Companies ,opinion,Yes  there has been a global malaise that began in 2008   Much earlier  actually  but 2008 is when someone noticed that the drinks were being paid for with Monopoly money   The US Federal Reserve had been spiking the punch bowl and refreshing it every time the drunksstarted to sober up  When the nation responsible for more world trade and consumption than any other gets a really bad hangover  it s tough for the rest of the crowd not to be affected Yet some were more responsible during this time than others  No Norwegian  Swedish or Finnish banks were deemed  too big to fail  and lavished with massive tax payer bailouts  Canadian banks are still among the safest in the world and behaved during all this like   well  like  bankers  used to behave in the USA  Australia  New Zealand  Hong Kong  Israel  The Netherlands  Singapore  and others are certainly affected by the hangover here  but they were not felled by it  Others  once felled  seem to be rising  like the UK  It s the old ham and eggs analogy highlighting the difference between being involved andbeing committed  the chicken is  involved  in your break fast  the pig is committed  Some nations are merely  involved  with the US errors in judgment  As a result  we are more confident about corporate governance  accountability  and responsible regulation in these countries That s why so many of the great holdings we re consistently interested in are domiciled in nations like these  Of course  no matter how fine the company and what we project as its future earnings and dividend stream  or how responsible the nation which reviews its operations for compliance with the highest standards  we still insist upon buying when the geographic region  the sector in which the company operates  or the company itself is fairly priced  Here are some firms that discipline leads us to right now  Norway s Statoil  STO   which may be purchased today for 13  less than it sold for one year ago fits this bill  So do Canada s Imperial Oil  IMO  and Cenovus Energy  CVE   down 12  and 17  in the same period  The Netherlands  Royal Dutch Shell  RDS A and RDS B   down 7   and Israel s Teva  TEVA  down 16   Jardine Matheson  JMHLY   nominally headquartered in Bermuda but in fact a Hong Kong Southeast Asia China proxy  is up during this period but represents exceptional value   in my opinion  even more than it did a year ago   as does Singapore s Keppel Corp  KPELY   The UK sBP  BP  is down 16  and a bet with my friend Jim Rickards  a month after their Gulf spill disaster  has already earned me a free dinner  now I m on to bigger profits  And AstraZeneca  AZN   also UK based  is flat on the year and its future earnings stream looks bright  You ll notice that we haven t held but a smidgen of oil and gas stocks this past couple years  That s because we didn t see a bright future for them  You ll notice that 5 of the 8 we currently like best are in the oil patch Buying at the right price counts  STO operates in 46 countries  including the USA and Canada  but it earned its spurs on the wild Norwegian continental shelf  one of the stormiest  coldest and most dangerous marine environments on earth  Statoil takes the rigors and challenges of their operating environment seriously  They know that their countrymen live in one of the most beautiful places on earth and a disaster there would be a true catastrophe  STO s 30 000 employees hew to rigorous standards for health  safety and the environment  HSE   I think their experience in harsh environments and their commitment to safe exploration and production is going to win them huge new business in the future   Who ya gonna call  if you are seeking a partner with a flawless safety record and experience in the most extreme marine environments like  say  the Arctic  I m guessing Statoil is on everyone major s short list to seek out as a joint venture partner  This time last year the stock was 28 50  the lowest it got in the June swoon was22 15  At 24 80 the stock sells for 6 1 2 times earnings and yields 3 7  Royal Dutch Shell  RDS A  is a well managed company with an attractive long term growth strategy that is currently out of favor as a result of their abandonment  for this season  of drilling in the difficult waters off shore Alaska  The question I ask is not   Did they succeed on their first try   but  Do they have the deep pockets to succeed on the next one  Do they have the right technology in place  Are they using the combined intellect and experience of other partners   In all cases  I answer   Most likely  yes  They have a beautiful balance sheet and good  steadyearnings advances  Slow and steady but  then  slow andsteady wins the race  The only problem I saw in their most recent earnings release was that they are not replacing their reserves as quickly as they are selling their current production  But then I never expect an oil company to do so every quarter  that s Wall Street thinking  As long as they do so over time  I still believe they are well worth owning  Others disparage Shell for focusing on Alaska s Arctic waters when cheaper oil is available elsewhere  I say it only takes one elephant find to make the skeptics suddenly tout Shell as if it were their favorite all along  RDS A is a savvy company that generated cash flow from operations of  46 billion in 2012  an increase of  10 billion from 2011  Shell has 30 new projects under construction  which it says should result in 7 billion bar rels of resources  They don t expect all of them to work out  Neither do I  But enough will do so to keep Shell very much alive in the  super major  category  It may even help them improve their gross margins  which cur rently trail the industry over the past 5 years  17 5  to 27   You are paid to be patient with a company selling at 7 8 times earnings and yielding 4 7  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited  TEVA  is a pharmaceutical titan which manufactures and sells both branded medications as well as generic drugs  With aging populations in the developed world  and not so developed  look at China and Russia  the future is good for the US and non US pharmaceutical industry and particularly good for those firms scrappy enough to compete in the generic drug marketplace  Many drugs are coming off patent in the next couple of years and I think no firm is better prepared to profit from this than Teva  That s not to say the company s earnings stream is assured  execution counts  Given that Teva sells 80  of its generics through wholesalers or big drugstore chains  there is a constant struggle to maintain margins as these mid  andend sellers flex their muscle  Also  Teva s branded drug business is itself subject to patent expiration  But neither of these are new issues  Teva has successfully navigatedbetween Scylla and Charybdis for years  I believe they will continue to do so  One of the reasons the stock is down is because they have taken on more long term debt to make serious acquisitions of big competitors  However  they still carry an A  credit rating and  as such  were able to borrow very cheaply  Their timing may have been propitious  I see much economy of scale resulting from their most recent purchases  I like the new management team a lot  and I believe their earnings will grow as will the dividend  At 16 times earnings with a 2 8  yield  and a pay out ratio of just 32   I see TEVA as a great company to own on any pullback There are also some well managed American companies that offer good value at today s prices  National Oilwell Varco  NOV  is down and Schlumberger  SLB  is flat after a full year of good markets   Yes  I knowSLB was headquartered in the Netherlands Antilles and was incorporated in France but its real operations are now HQ d in Houston  so it s as American as any other multinational with operations in 100 countries  Its CEO is Norwegian and its other senior execs are from around the world  but  Texan  is the common language spoken at the corporate offices  Both of the above selections are from within the oil and gas sector  as well  I seek out of favor sectors that look to me to have an assured earnings stream with good growth in top line and bottom line revenue and a history of increasing their payout to shareholders  Right now  oil  gas and energy services firms fill all those requirements  NOV and SLB are  in my mind  the two cr me de la cr me oil and gas service companies on the planet  We are fortunate they are both in America  let s hope the currentAdministration s hatred of fossil fuels doesn t drive companies like this somewhere else Schlumberger  SLB  is the industry leader in developing innovative productivity solutions for the oil and natural gas industry  There is no question in my mind that the biggest growth in the world of drilling for oil and gas will be offshore   offshore and deep  Nobody has more experience  data  products or experienced personnel than SLB when it comes to deep offshore drilling  I think SLB is in a win win situation  If global production of oil and gas increase  SLB will be called upon to assist on the exploration and discovery side of the business  If oil and gas production decline  SLB is likely to benefit from declining production by offering services  equipment and expertise to maximize the yields from pre existing oil fields  Either way  SLB grows its revenues and earnings For 40 years in this business I ve been hearing that this is the year we are at  Peak Oil   Those who do not understand that this term came about to describe a particular well or region continue to bandy it about as if it were some immutable gospel  And yet  every year  we either discover more oil and gas in places we hadn t been able to look before or we discover new ways of secondary and tertiary recovery from wells and regions we previously thought were played out  Both dynamics play to Schlumberger s strengths  The final reason I like SLB versus its competitors is its international span  North America accounts for just a third of SLB s revenue  whereas for Halliburton andBaker Hughes it is more than half  The company bought back a half billion dollars of its shares over the past year at an average price of  66 30  Smart  We ll be happy buying anywhere below  70 for what I imagine will be close to a triple over the next 5 years  Slow and steady National Oilwell Varco  NOV  is a direct competitor of SLB  While not as well known as Halliburton  HAL  and Baker Hughes  BHI    outside the oil patch  anyway   a series of brilliant acquisitions has leapfrogged NOV to the  2 spot  just behind SLB  Over the past year and a half NOV acquired Wilson International   800 million   CE Franklin   239 million   and  most recently  Robbins   Myers for  2 5 billion  As a result  NOV is second only to Schlumberger in market cap  Its PE is lower than any of the big 4 It has the most desirable PEG ratio and is second only to SLB in its profit margins and cash on hand  Its total debt is the lowest of the big 4 and its current ratio the strongest of them all  My problem in trying to buy National Oilwell Varco is that I m competing with some pretty savvy players who are quietly accumulating it at these prices  Warren Buffett just added to his hoard  taking him to a little over 5million shares  I like the fundamentals  I like the valuation  and I like the company we re keeping when buying the stock  I also like that 94  of NOV s rig backlog is destined for international markets where the opportunities for big discoveries are great and the shale boom is just beginning to be realized  At less than 12 times earnings  it s a buy today Some Quick Notes Both Penn Virginia  PVR  and Natural Resource Partners  NRP  have suffered devastating pullbacks in the last few weeks and months  After all  they re in the dirty old coal business and nobody s using coal  right  Wrong  wrong and wrong  First of all  there s thermal coal  for heating and electricity generation  and there s metallurgical coal  for making steel   Guess which the land they lease contains  Second  they are not coal companies but energycompanies  owning nat gas pipelines  fracking sand operations  and much more  Third  while we may be enjoying a respite from coal usage thanks to fracking in the US  the rest of the world still depends on coal  We will start re accumulating on pullbacks ,2013-03-07,Joseph L.

38407,259922,SLB,Trend Following Strategy  What To Buy  What To Hold Now,opinion,To improve diversification and prevent single company or single industry blow ups  like gold miners  from which we are still recovering  I m always looking for mutual funds  closed end funds  or ETPs  exchange traded products  that provide much of the upside of the well  or luckily selected leaders in a sector or national market and which mirror our own strategies  One of the strategies we like to use when we believe the market is looking toppy are trailing stops  I ve never found a fund that does this for us   until now  We still need to watch these mutual funds and ETFs every day to decide when it s best to use them and when it s best to select individualequities but at least they reallocate like we like to do There are a number of these ETNs offered by the Royal Bank of Scotland  whose preferreds we own in the Growth   Value Portfolio  but some have too little volume to consider  On the other hand  there are two that I be lieve merit your attention  Even these are thinly traded compared to more established ETNs and ETFs  they are only a couple years old  so  for heaven s sake  buy in multiple tranches and use limit orders The RBS US Large Cap Trendpilot ETN  TRND  fits my goal to  automatically  add exposure  when the fish are running  and reduce it when they are not  Here s how they do it  they use a trend following strategy to provide exposure to buy the S P 500 Total Return Indexwhen the indicator they use says to be invested  and when the indicator says  Danger  Will Robinson  Danger   to invest in an index that instead mirrors 3 month U S  Treasury bills  If the level of the S P Index is at or above its historical 200 Index business day simple moving average for five consecutive business days  a  positive trend    TRND will faithfully track the return of the S P  Conversely  if the level of the S P 500 is below the 200 day moving average for five consecutive Index days  a  negative trend    then TRND will effectively switch to cash instead of the S P  Two things to be concerned about with such a strategy and two to like This is trend following  TRND will always be a couple to a few days late in buying in and getting out from the actual bottom or top  I don t see that as a huge disadvantage  Nobody catches the exact tops and bottoms  that s a fool s errand  Second  you might be whipsawed occasionally  although the 5 day rule tends to mitigate that somewhat  So what s to like  Risk mitigation  The grayer my hair gets  the less I like to see large losses  Just one blow up from one company or industry  did I mention gold miners   can destroy all our your hard work  By building a foundation of ETNs like TRND  we can be sure we capture most  but never all  of a series of  perfect  calls by the alleged smartest guys in the room  In a previous article  I showed how we  even with ourblow ups  as well as others with a buy and rebalance 60  equity 40  bond portfolio absolutely trounced the self proclaimed smartest guys in the room  the hedge funds  Buying TRND will increase our edge even more  Through the end of the 1st quarter  the benchmark S P was up 10 6   TRND was up 10   Since inception  the benchmark S P was up 24 6   TRND was up 21 8   John Paulson s gold hedge fund during this quarter  Down massively  Which would you rather own TRND is currently trending well above its 200 day moving average so it may come down a good bit before the  go to cash  signal is given  though that will change as the 200 day MA catches up  But lately we ve been buying more of the RBS NASDAQ 100 ETN  TNDQ  than TRND  TNDQ  the younger brother of TRND  is even more thinly traded  I have been slowly buying it for clients but  in order not to move the market  in 250  and 500 share lots  Because of the NASDAQ 100 s recent un derperformance  TNDQ is much closer to the 200 day MA  so if there is a decline  it will go to cash much more quickly  preserving more of our capital Like TRND  TNDQ invests in either the NASDAQ 100 Total Return Index or the yield on a notional investment in three month U S  Treasury bills  The difference is  since this index tends to be more volatile  RBS buysthe NASDAQ 100 Index when it is at or above its 100 day simple moving average for 5 days and goes to cash when the index closes below its 100 day simple moving average for 5 consecutive sessions  We now own both Bond TradersWhen we  buy bonds  we buy mostly bond mutual funds  closed end funds and ETFs for our clients and ourselves  not individual bond offerings  There are exceptions  our Molycorp 6s of 2017 are an example  These are a special situation that combine convertibility  a short maturity and significant upside potential  They also offer higher risk and demand a boatload of patience  I believe that selecting a  bond fund  that has the ability to do more than buy an index of bonds and hold them  as most ETFs do  is the way to go  I have also identified an ETF that provides similar opportunity for capital gains as well as risk off income  Well  as risk off as high yield ever is  When you buy a junk bond  you always run a risk  however remote  of de fault  That s true of any bond  but clearly more likely with a company with a  C  financial rating than one with a  AA  rating  But when you buy a huge package of diversified junk bonds  the gains you make typically compensate you very well  even after including the occasional default  I think this will be the case in spades for the Peritus High Yield ETF  HYLD   HYLD is an active ETF that focuses on the junk segment of the bond market  Its managers look to take a value based approach  using their judgment and long experience to pick and choose carefully rather than simply track an index of come what may They also do something else I think is much smarter than their peers  they invest mostly in the secondary market  where news driven anomalies occur all the time  The well prepared take advantage of those discrepancies  The real benefit of buying in the after market is that they can buy bonds that are trading at well below what they believe their real worth is  removing a great deal of interest rate risk  particularly for the short end of their maturity holdings  Skill doesn t come cheap  The ex penses for this fund are currently 1 35   However  I d rather pay 1 35  and make 8 5  than pay some sluggards who merely buy and hold whatever is in an index 0 5  but return only 4  Three quarters of the fund is in bonds rated no less than B  by S P and no single bond accounts for more than 2 5  of assets  While the managers insist upon good diversification across sectors  there is currently a slight bias in favor of health care  in my opinion a great bet tomake  HYLD offers low duration and a fine yield  while providing the opportunity for capital gains as well We never try to  time  the market going whole hog in one week and then selling everything the next  But our gradual approach  stair stepping in and stair stepping out means that  as our trailing stocks are triggered on the long side  we look to assets that provide downside protection but still afford the opportunity to earn a good return  I think HYLD fits the bill  It s a thin trader  so use limits   What to HoldAt times like this  when the market may be approaching a top  we still don t go overboard and sell everything  After all  the bias of the market is to drift upwards in the absence of bad news  It goes up roughly 2 3 of the time and down only 1 3 of the time   The past 13 years being a no table exception  of course  So here s what we are sticking with and a brief reason why  We re sticking with our long short mutual funds because  while they may be roughed up in a general decline  their charter allows them to get knocked down along with the market but to get back up and fight again another day  The best most mutual funds can do is go to cash  Most of the time they aren t that smart so they fall back on the crutch that  longterm  the market always comes back  We re also keeping most of our balanced funds  Their track record in the bad times is a good one and we want to keep some of that long side positioning  We ll keep Lynas  LYSDY  because we are so far underwater they wouldn t bring us much  anyway  and because China s days ofmanipulating the REE market are coming to a close  When the world s economies pick up  these economy sensitive issues have the potential to blow the doors off We ll keep our boring telecoms because they provide great income and  relative  stability and we ll keep our First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank  QABA   and likely add specific smaller banks  because they arebastions of safety  Finally  we ll keep and add to our more stodgy  big energy  firms such as Schlumberger  SLB   Royal Dutch Shell  RDS A  and Statoil  STO   Whenever they decline  we buy  It s worked for us for 40 years

38409,259924,SLB,Byron King  Forget OPEC  North American Energy Plays Bring Profits Home,opinion,Looking for profits in the oil and natural gas space  Look no further than shale plays  energy service companies and offshore drilling opportunities in the U S   says Byron King of Agora Financial LLC  In this interview  King discusses how dwindling exports to the U S  from Latin America  Africa and the Middle East are shifting the supply and demand equation across the world  King also names companies in the service space with solid prospects for investors  The Energy Report  Byron  welcome  You recently attended the Platts Conference in London  which addressed shifting energy trade patterns in light of growing U S  export prospects  and dwindling exports from South America and Africa  Has OPEC s role diminished  Byron King  The short answer is yes  OPEC is struggling right now  The Middle East  the West Africa and Venezuela are struggling  The West African players and Venezuela have seen exports to the U S  decline dramatically  In countries like Algeria  oil exports to the U S  are essentially zero  while Nigeria s exports to the U S  are way down  The oil these countries export tends to be the lighter  sweeter crude  which happens to be the product that is increasing in production in the U S  through fracking  The east to west trade pattern for oil imports to the U S  has essentially gone away  This does not mean that the oil goes away  It means these countries have to find new markets for their oil which they are doing  in India and the Far East  But that disrupts trade patterns as well  Imports from the Middle East to the U S  are falling as well  These barrels tend to be the heavier  sourer crude that U S  refineries are geared to process  As the U S  imports less oil  our balance of trade gets better  The recent strengthening of the dollar has a lot to do with importing less oil  Strengthening the dollar decreases gold and silver prices  so there is some monetary blowback from the good news out of the oil patch  Strengthening the dollar increases the broad stock market for the non resource  non commodity and non energy plays  There s an astonishing dynamic at work  TER  When it comes to countries like Venezuela  part of the reason for the decrease in exports is because it has not invested its profits in infrastructure  BK  Good point  In Venezuela  the government has taken so much money out of the oil industry to use for social spending  military spending and government overhead that the sustaining capital is not there  Even with Hugo Chavez s death and new leadership  it will require years of sustained and increased investment to get Venezuela s output up  After 10 years of dramatically bad underinvestment  the infrastructure is worn out  It will take a lot of time  money and some seriously hard political decisions to redeploy capital inside a country like Venezuela  TER  If OPEC can no longer control the price of oil through supply because it does not have as much control of supply  what is keeping it from flooding the market with oil to get more revenue  BK  That would work both ways  If OPEC floods the market with more oil  it will drive the price of oil down  Then OPEC nations would get fewer dollars for each barrel  All of that extra output  if sold at a lower price  might still yield less money  which is not a good thing if you are an oil exporter and need the funds  The big swing producer is still Saudi Arabia  Saudi has spare capacity  but I suspect not as much as it wants people to believe  It gets back to that idea of peak oil  We ve discussed it before  and yes  I know fracking is changing the game to some extent  But you still need to keep all the books about peak oil on your shelf  Fracking is what happens on the back side of the peak oil curve  when you need barrels  are willing to pay high prices and throw lots of capital and labor at the problem  A country like Saudi Arabia could increase its output  but not for long and not in a heavily sustainable way  It would damage its oil fields  Beyond that  the trick for OPEC is going to be getting several countries to agree to cut output to make up for the extra output from North America  in the hope of keeping prices where they are right now  Brent crude which is what the posting is for much of the OPEC contracts is about  103 barrel   103 bbl   If OPEC wants to keep that number or not let it fall too much further it has to cut output  not increase output  That is a very difficult and politically charged issue within OPEC  The Middle Eastern countries can afford a minor amount of financial turmoil right now  The other OPEC countries absolutely cannot afford financial problems stemming from low oil prices  TER  Is there informal price control going on in the shale oil fields  As the price of natural gas has dropped  the oil rig count has dropped and once the price goes up  those oil rigs could start up again  Could there be an OPEC of North America  BK  I do not see an organized North American OPEC because there are too many companies in the mix  Too many people have a bite at the apple for anybody to control things  It is more like a tangle of accidental circumstances driving production levels  We are seeing a slight drop in the oil rig count in the U S  right now  Part of that has to do with the natural gas cutback  but part also has to do with the efficiency of the fracking model  Fracking can be energy inefficient  but also can be industrially efficient  Five years ago and earlier  the idea of drilling wells was to look for oil fields  You were drilling into specific regions enriched with hydrocarbons that could flow into a well under reservoir energy or with just modest amounts of pumping or pressurization  Today  with fracking  you are not really looking at oil fields  You are drilling into an entire formation  You are drilling into a large scale resource and introducing energy into a formation to break up the rock and get the oil or natural gas out  To do that successfully is much more a manufacturing model than the traditional oil drilling model  This is why you see drilling pads that have room for 10 or 12 wells  You drill the wells directionally outward  In western Pennsylvania I have seen some of the drilling maps for companies like Range Resources Corp   RRC NYSE   These companies have very efficient ways of corkscrewing pipe into the sweet spots of the formations with multistage fracks  They are draining the formations very efficiently  You see fewer rigs because each rig is being used in a manufacturing type of process  as opposed to the olden days when drilling was similar to craftwork  Modern drilling and fracking  at least in North America  is much more of an assembly line process  Companies are using the same drill pits over and over again  They are using the same drilling mud and the same fracking water  Much of the same equipment gets used multiple times on several different wells  In the olden days  each well was its own special unique construction  Of course  every oil or gas well is different  and the results depend on how you drill it  TER  Which companies are doing this the best and are they actually making money  BK  Five years ago  people would talk about how this well made money or how that well does not make money anymore  That s harder to do today  The economics of the current fracking world are still up in the air  The jury is out on many of these fracking plays  Companies are drilling a lot of wells and they are expensive  They are fracking the wells and that is very expensive  At a recent conference  a gentleman from Halliburton Co   HAL NYSE  said up to 50  of the different fracking stages on wells do not work  They either fail at the beginning or soon after they go into production due to many reasons geotechnical failure  equipment failure  blockages in the holes  in the pipe  in the perforations  things like that  Once a company has put the steel in the ground  done its fracking and inserted its equipment  it is very difficult to get down there and fix what is broken  Right now natural gas prices are so low that if a company is drilling for dry gas  it is almost a given that it is not making any money  If the company is drilling for wet gas and is producing  the gas helps pay for the investment  When you get into some of the oil plays in the Bakken formation in North Dakota  or the Eagle Ford down in Texas  you are starting to get a midcontinent price or even better for the gas plus associated oil or liquids  When I say midcontinent  I mean West Texas Intermediate  the WTI price as opposed to the Brent price  Regarding the pricing structure within North America  the oil sands coming out of Alberta are selling at the low end of the market scale  If West Texas Intermediate is about  90 bbl  the Canadian sand oil might be  60 bbl  That is a one third differential  Is that because the quality is so different  Not necessarily  The oil sand product quality is slightly lower than the WTI  but it is not a one third difference in terms of molecules or energy content or refinability  The difference is in stranded infrastructure  The cheaper oil is geographically stranded up in the frozen north of Canada  and you have to get it out through pipelines and railcars  You cannot get it over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast  There are only a few places for that oil to go  so it comes south  In its first stop across the U S  border  in North Dakota  it competes with the Bakken plays  The great mover of midcontinent oil today is the North American rail system the tanker cars  Back in the days of John D  Rockefeller  he could control oil markets with access to rails  rail shipping and tankers cars  Now you have to look at the cost of moving oil from midcontinent to another destination  If you are in North Dakota  you can move oil west to Washington or California  where there are refineries  Or you could move it to Chicago or farther east  to the refineries there  Or you could move it south  where you compete with imported oil at the Houston refineries  It is a very complex arrangement  And you must deal with the usual suspects BNSF Railway Company and Union Pacific the two biggies of hauling oil  We re seeing some truly astonishing developments here  Look at Delta Air Lines Inc   DAL NYSE   which spent  300 million buying the old Trainer refinery in Philadelphia  Actually  less than that when you take in the subsidy from the state of Pennsylvania  So now  Delta is importing oil from the Bakken to Trainer on railroad cars  Delta feeds its East Coast operations with jet fuel coming out of the Trainer refinery  including planes flying out of John F  Kennedy International Airport  which gives it a price advantage in the North Atlantic market  The price differential of just a few pennies a gallon on jet fuel is the difference between making or losing money on the North Atlantic routes  Then  Delta can go to other airports where it operates  and beat up on the fuel supplier by threatening to bring in its own fuel  So Delta is extracting price concessions from vendors  It s sort of an old fashioned  gas war   like when service stations used to see who could sell fuel the cheapest  Midcontinent oil  midcontinent economics and transport by rail have completely altered the economics of other industries  including the rail and airline industries  North American shale oil plays have had an extensive ripple effect through the U S  economy  TER  Could building more pipelines to export facilities in the U S  shrink those differentials  BK  More pipelines will shrink the differential  but pipelines take time  In the environmentalist political world we live in today  it takes years to do all the permitting  and pretty much nobody wants to have a pipeline running through the backyard  Existing pipelines are golden because they are already there  Maybe they can be expanded  the pumps improved  we can tweak them or put additives in the fluid to make the product move faster  There are all sorts of possibilities with existing pipelines  For the pipelines that are not built yet  you have the whole NIMBY  Not In My Backyard  issue  The railroad lobby and the lobbies of companies that build railroad cars also do not want to see new pipelines because these companies are more than happy to ship oil on railcars  even though in terms of energy efficiency safety and spillage  rail is less efficient overall  TER  Based on this reality  how are you investing in shale space or are you  BK  Right now  I am investing in the shale space at the very fundamentals  It is a pick and shovel approach to investing  I focus on what I call the big three of the services companies Halliburton  Schlumberger Ltd   SLB NYSE  and Baker Hughes Inc   BHI NYSE  because these companies have people are out there in the fields with the trucks and equipment  doing the work and getting paid for it  Another company that I really like is Tenaris  TS NYSE   one of the best makers of steel drill pipe  You could buy U S  Steel Corp   X NYSE   for example  which is doing very well in tubular goods  but it is a big  integrated steel company with iron mines and coal mines  It owns railroads  and sells steel to the auto industry  the appliance industry and the construction industry  Tubular and oilfield goods are just a part of U S  Steel  With a company like Tenaris  it is more of a pure play on the oilfield development  TER  Are you are a fan of oil services companies at this point in time  BK  Yes  In terms of a company that is actually out there doing the work  I have great admiration for Range Resources  Its share price seems bid up pretty high  In terms of the large caps  I am looking at global integrated players  BP Plc  BP NYSE  BP LSE   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   Statoil ASA  STO NYSE  STL OSE  and Total S A   TOT NYSE   the French company  They are big  global and pay nice dividends  Even BP  for all of its troubles  is still paying a respectable dividend  TER  Those are companies that also have exposure to the offshore oil area  Is that a growth area  BK  Offshore is booming  Some companies are very good at what they do  and when you look at the pick and shovel plays  that would be companies like Halliburton  Schlumberger and Baker Hughes  among others  Transocean Ltd   RIG NYSE  RIGN SIX   the big offshore drilling company  is making a nice comeback  as is Cameron International Corp   CAM NYSE   which is in wellhead machinery  blowout preventers and things like that  FMC Technologies  FTI NYSE  is a fabulous subsea equipment builder  and Oceaneering International  OII NYSE   which makes remote operating vehicles  ROVs   has done great the last couple of years and is still growing  A couple of points about offshore  In the U S  offshore space  in March and April 2010  right after the BP blowout  the U S  government basically shut it down  The offshore space was utter road kill  By the second half of 2010  it was dead  It went from being a  20 billion   20B  year industry to about a  3B year industry  Here we are  three years later  and the offshore industry in the U S  is recovering  There is still growth  If you look at the rest of the world s coastlines  you see an increasing amount of concessions  leasing and acreage whether it is in the Russian Arctic or the North Sea or off the coast of Africa  There are booming areas offshore of West Africa and East African plays  with companies like Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC NYSE  and its huge natural gas discovery off of Mozambique  In the Far East  off of Australia  there is a whole liquefied natural gas  LNG  boom  Much of the Australia hydrocarbon story is in offshore LNG  These are huge plays involving great big companies  a lot of money  steel in the ground and lots of equipment that either floats on the water or sits on the seafloor  It is all good for the offshore space  TER  Are there any particular projects that a BP or Shell is doing right now that you are excited about  BK  Shell has a big play onshore in the U S   part of the whole shale gale  Shell is a big global integrated explorer  but is backing away from the offshore East African plays because they are a little too expensive for the company s taste  Shell has made investments in West Africa  off of Gabon  and also in South Africa  in the Orange Basin  I think Shell envisions itself as a future key player in South Africa  which is good because South Africa is a big  industrially developed country with a large population and big markets  South Africa has ongoing social problems  but it needs energy  So if Shell is successful in offshore South Africa  there s a built in market  Shell doesn t have to tanker oil in or pipe it in or somehow move it halfway across the world  TER  In light of what happened with BP  are these offshore oil plays riskier  since one accident can shut everything down  Or are large companies like Shell diversified enough that it doesn t matter  BK  I will never say that accidents do not matter  As we learned from the Gulf of Mexico  an offshore accident can be a company killer  BP literally went through a near death experience  In the minds of some people  BP is still not out of the woods  The company has made settlement after settlement and it is still not done paying  It has divested itself of many attractive assets over the past couple of years to raise enough cash to pay settlements  fees and fines  The good news about the aftermath of the accident is that  globally  there is a heightened sense of safety awareness in the oil industry  Companies have watched the BP issues very closely and learned every lesson they possibly can  All of the solid operators are hypersensitive and hypercautious toward offshore operations  It all comes back to benefit some of the service players I mentioned earlier  The fact that many offshore drilling platforms had to upgrade blowout preventers to a much higher specification benefited the likes of Cameron and FMC Technologies  In the new environment  your subsea equipment must be built to a higher specification  So say thank you to FMC Technologies which will gladly build it to that higher spec and charge you a higher price  The numbers of inspections that companies must do when they work at the surface of the ocean are enormous  If a company has to inspect every 48 hours  it needs more ROVs  Who makes ROVs  That would be Oceaneering  There are other opportunities in other spaces  such as dealing with existing offshore platforms  existing offshore pipelines and existing offshore rig populations  One company that has done very well in our portfolio in the last couple of years is Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc   HLX NYSE   It deals with offshore repairs and servicing issues  and offers decommissioning services  Individuals who go into these kinds of investments want to become educated about them  We are in these investments with a long term  multiyear horizon because that is the investment cycle  From prospect to producing platform  these kinds of investments can take 10 15 years to play out  It s like an oil company annuity for the well run oil service guys  The good news is that there is long term reward  because large volumes of oil come from offshore  When looking at the shale gale  on the best day of the year in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken onshore  a really good well can produce 1 000 barrels per day  1 Mbbl d   Six months from now that well could produce 400  400 bbl d   and a year from now it might produce 200 bbl d  The decline rates are really steep  On some of the offshore wells  we are talking 15 20 Mbbl d  which can be sustained for several years  The economics of a good well and a good play offshore are for the long term  TER  It sounds like your advice is for people to do their homework and be in it for the long term  BK  Yes  My newsletter  Outstanding Investments  talks about oil and oil investments all the time  subscribers receive my views over the long term  As an investor  you want to educate yourself about different companies in the space  what equipment is used in the space and what the processes are  You do not have to be a geologist or an engineer to invest  but you need to be willing to learn  There is an entire offshore vocabulary that you need to understand to appreciate the investment opportunities  You also need to be able to keep your sanity during times of tumult  when the rest of the market might be losing its grip  And you need to understand why you went into a certain investment in the first place and when it is time to get out  TER  That is great advice  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today  BK  You are very welcome

38412,259927,SLB,James West  To Plot Your Energy Investments  Consult the Map,opinion,Understanding asset values is the name of the game for early stage resource plays that s how investors in the Bakken made huge returns  But with the first round of shale plays largely maturing  where are the next big opportunities for junior explorers  In many cases  abroad  says James West  publisher of The Midas Letter  In this interview with The Energy Report  West rolls out the map and shows us where juniors are headed  He also names some companies who are thriving on North American soil  If boots on the ground prospecting puts a glint in your eye  read on  The Energy Report  What are the key considerations investors should make in evaluating geographical location and political risk in junior exploration and development plays   James West  Outside of North America  there are a few obvious no go zones Russia  China and parts of war torn Africa  Then again  we did see a great junior success in Kenya with Africa Oil Corp   AOI TSX V   so certain regions in Africa are less risky  Presently in Kenya  I m watching the progress of Africa Hydrocarbons Inc   NFK TSX V  with interest as the company seeks to emulate Africa Oil s success  Africa Hydrocarbons commenced drilling on its 47 5  owned Bouhajla Block  located onshore in Tunisia within the productive Pelagian Basin   Australia carries little or no political risk of expropriation  Terra Nova Energy Ltd   TGC TSX V  TNVMF OTCPK  GLTN FSE  is drilling in the Cooper Basin in Australia  Initial production wells that Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE  drilled in that basin are pumping 2 000 barrels per day  Mbbl d   And investors will do well to concentrate on Canada and the United States there is just so much profitable activity going on in the shale space and in legacy wells and oil field redevelopment   It s actually Beach Energy Ltd   BPT ASX  that made the initial discoveries in the Cooper Basin  and is now flowing in excess of 10 000 barrels oil equivalent per day  boe d   Chevron has farmed into two exploration permits owned by Beach Energy  but is a minority holder and non operator   TER  Are there any places where the political risk outweighs any potential payoffs   JW  If a government is already inclined toward resource nationalization  then potential success does not really matter  A nationalized firm is going to lose it all  or see its assets tied up in international courts for years   TER  Which countries in South America are safe   JW  I am not too keen to invest in Argentina  even though there are Canada listed TSX juniors producing oil there and at this point it is safe  I am nervous about the long term political security of Argentina  But in Colombia  on the other hand  the trend is toward stability  Several companies doing business in Colombia are producing and exporting oil without incident  PetroAmerica Oil Corp   PTA TSX  is having great success  And Peru  Chile and  to a lesser extent  Brazil are very safe  Ecuador and Venezuela are at the opposite end of that spectrum  Those two countries are no go zones   TER  What type of challenge does a junior explorer need to overcome in a politically safe but geographically extreme region such as the Yukon   JW  Typically  the challenge for juniors in the far north is freezing temperatures  especially north of the Arctic Circle  But in the southwestern Yukon where  for example  companies like EFLO Energy Inc   EFLO OTCQB  operate  the weather is not so frigid  The challenge there is the snow pack  There are places where you cannot go with heavy equipment until the land is frozen over  That is the case in other Canadian regions  too  But those types of challenges to oil and gas exploration are not insurmountable  The oil sands in northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia are a testament to that  Regardless of the challenges posed by extreme weather  the oils sands support one of the largest oil and gas production infrastructures to be found anywhere   TER  Do drillers in difficult geographical locations tend to rely on service companies more heavily   JW  Generally  the service companies are deployed at the same ratio  Local service companies have expertise relevant to the local weather patterns and the associated terrestrial challenges  So companies gravitate toward local firms for early stage geophysics  but then when it comes to drilling deep  expensive wells  they gravitate toward the multinationals companies like Baker Hughes Inc   BHI NYSE   Schlumberger Ltd   SLB NYSE   etc   TER  You mentioned EFLO Energy  Could you give us a profile on that name   JW  EFLO Energy has an interest in the Kotaneelee gas field in the Yukon  which is where Apache Corp   APA NYSE  recently announced a discovery hole with astounding flow rates  The potential size of the reservoir is over 30 billion cubic feet  It is proximal to where Apache is working on a very large land position with gas processing infrastructure  EFLO is well situated to take advantage of working one of the largest  but as yet undeveloped  gas fields in the world  the Kotaneelee   TER  What is the situation with the share price of EFLO Energy   JW  EFLO has held up well   between  1 40 and  2 60 during the last year  It s at  1 50 right now  but that is a reflection of the fact that it has not been drilling much of late  The company is currently focused on building its executive team  Once it starts to drill and develop the oil and gas field  its share price will most likely improve  If it makes a decent size discovery  it will be a very attractive takeout candidate for a foreign national oil company  China s national oil companies are showing great interest in Canadian companies with large gas reserves   TER  What about the Peace River Arch region  How does that differ from the Yukon in terms of geographical challenges   JW  The Peace River Arch is a very mature  sedimentary basin  The geographical challenge is to find any available land left to prospect  The Alberta government has done such a good job of maintaining a database of all of the different pay zones that anybody can go online and effectively prospect for property  Where there is some success  the prices are driven up very quickly because the market instantly reflects demand  So it s very tough to get positions in the Peace River Arch region  There are great barriers to entry for new companies that want to get in  but there are a handful of juniors that are developing production nicely   TER  Such as   JW  Aroway Energy Inc   ARW TSX V  ARWJF OTCQX  is a very successful company that I have followed since 2011  Unfortunately  it is currently suffering from the deflationary effect  which afflicts the entire TSX Venture Exchange  TSX V   Due to the generally poor performance of mining stocks  its share price halved during the last year  That trend does not look as if it is going to change soon  On the other hand  the TSX V has been beaten up so badly that there are fantastic bargains available  Aroway is an excellent case in point  The company is producing over 1 Mbbl d  and it has a great land position  Its share price does not reflect the actual value of the company  and Aroway has substantial cash flow and is growing production on an almost daily basis   TER  What services companies operate in that region   JW  There is Enterprise Group Inc   E TSX V   which I started following in 2006  The company recently announced several acquisitions  It has acquired a specialized engineering firm  an underground infrastructure construction company that is generating  12 million   12M  per year in revenue  The acquisition will give Enterprise 40  of its earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  in 2013  Enterprise s business model is to consolidate the oil field services industry in Western Canada  The plan is starting to pay off   TER  From the investor point of view  what is the best type of corporate structure for a service firm vertical or horizontal   JW  Enterprise is integrating horizontally  It is in a position to capitalize on new trends in geophysics  It is able to offer everything to everyone  Companies that are more specialized tend to be boom and bust  When things are particularly good in their particular sector  then let the good times roll  But when the public appetite goes in a different direction  then those companies can flounder for years  Enterprise Group is acquiring companies across various subsectors in the oil field services and  thereby  insulating itself against future soft spots in the market   TER  How is the Enterprise stock price doing   JW  It is in the  0 70 range  The company has touched a 52 week high about 10 times this year  It has delivered a multiple of 7x  In July a year ago  it was trading at less than  0 20  Now  it s trading up near  0 70  and it is poised to go higher   TER  You mentioned that Alberta has an online prospecting database  Are there other jurisdictions in North America that maintain similar databases   JW  Alberta has always led the oil and gas jurisdictions in preserving data and allowing access to it  That is really smart because it creates maximum demand for a potential hydrocarbon asset  The province s tax base benefits every single Albertan  In contrast  look at Texas  which was ground zero for the development of the oil industry  The rights to oil and gas assets in Texas are controlled by a politicized railroad commission  which is more focused on real estate issues than developing energy assets  In Texas  it is almost impossible to figure out who owns what  If you are looking to acquire legacy data from previous hydrocarbon explorations on certain properties  it is like detective work  You have to chase information backward through courts and property deeds  That makes it almost impossible for a newcomer in Texas to buy properties without acquiring very specialized local expertise  At the end of the day  Texas is just not efficiently maximizing its hydrocarbon wealth on behalf of its tax base  That is not by design  it s just the way the system evolved there   TER  What about other high profile drilling jurisdictions  such as North Dakota  Wyoming and Nevada   JW  Each of those jurisdictions is regulated by the by the Bureau of Land Management  BLM   But the Bakken in North Dakota is now rather mature  With the declining price of natural gas and the increasing costs of exploration  there are fewer and fewer entrants knocking on the door  Geographically  there are few incumbents  and they are able to operate and finance continued exploration from production cash flows  The grassroots junior boom in land purchases that was characteristic of 2007 2008 is largely over now because the basins are better defined   TER  So what is a junior company without land to do  Go abroad   JW  For a junior company on the TSX V  that s a good question  I know of a couple of companies that are electing to go abroad  One of them that we hold in The Midas Letter Opportunity Fund is Rift Basin Resources Corp   RIF TSX V   Its projects in Tunisia are advancing in partnership with another British oil and gas company  It is exploring further in Tunisia and also planning exploration in Gabon  It is assessing an opportunity in Indonesia that could be huge  And  remember  I do not categorically dismiss Argentina Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE TSX V  is successfully drilling unconventional shale oil and gas wells there  The stock is down to  0 85 from a high in the last year of almost  3  But  again  that s largely a reflection of the ailing TSX V   TER  Are there junior opportunities in Brazil   JW  It is very hard for explorers to compete with the national oil company  Petrobras  PBR NYSE  PETR3 BOVESPA   which is majority owned by the government of Brazil  The country is really biased toward its own  Brazil is famous for that  Only rarely do outside companies acquire major Brazilian corporations  It is a type of covert resource nationalism  practiced not as a matter of public policy  but as a tacit demonstration of nationalistic attitude   That said  my biggest winner of 2012 operates in Brazil  Abakan Inc   ABKI OTCQB  is building a four line pipe cladding facility there  It will sell pipe to Petrobras  In fact  it has a joint development agreement with Petrobras  which holds a large percentage of its offshore wells at extremely high pressures  Petrobras pumps high end hydrogen sulfide  which is extremely corrosive  Therefore  to produce the hydrocarbons economically  Petrobras needs to keep improving its gathering and transmission infrastructure  Abakan is really integral to Petrobras  future going forward  and that is why Petrobras and the government of Brazil are assisting Abakan in acquiring the land and financing to build the pipe manufacturing plant  Abakan s stock price has tripled in the last two years  It is waiting for a full NASDAQ listing  After Brazil  it plans to build an eight line plant in Indonesia  Currently  its one plant throws off  60M annually in gross revenue  of which 40  is gross margin  It is a great cash maker  and there are a lot of projects in Indonesia and Brazil that will not move forward until the Abakan technologies can be deployed in the field   TER  Are there any other geographical regions or undervalued exploration or service oriented companies flying under the radar   JW  Given the state of equity markets in general in the resource sector  a lot of investors are looking for yield  Our fund is no different  We are planning to invest in Argent Energy Trust  AET UN TSX   which is a Toronto listed company that acquires producing oil and gas assets and distributes their revenue  minus the cost of administration  to the yield holders  Basically  it is averaging 10  annually in yield  and the unit holders are also exposed to a rising share price as the value of the portfolio increases and the company deploys capital to acquire more producers  For an energy focused yield play  I cannot think of a better one than Argent Energy Trust   TER  How does Argent manage to do that  Does it pick companies that are doing particularly well  or is it distributing risk over a bell curve   JW  The key to Argent Energy Trust s strategy is that it exploits foreign asset regulations  It is classified as a foreign asset investment trust  It distributes the income from foreign producing hydrocarbon assets on a tax optimized basis to unit holders  Brian Prokop  who is the co CEO and president  was formerly with Daylight Energy Ltd  He has experience in building and producing oil and gas assets  He s the perfect man in the perfect job  In terms of the tax benefits  approximately 60  return on capital is realized  The U S  corporate tax on it is under 2   It is a great way to play for yield in the energy sector   TER  Any other comers   JW  Surge Energy Inc   SGY TSX  bears watching  It was recently the subject of a bought deal financing for  300M  It is moving more toward becoming a dividend paying oil and gas company  That suggests great potential for the share price  as well as for the yield that the company will pay out  If it uses its treasury to acquire producing assets and distributes the proceeds to shareholders  that is far more attractive to me in the near term than a company that is raising capital to look for oil and gas assets when the return on that capital will be much lower   TER  Thank for your time today  James   JW  My pleasure  Peter   James West is publisher and editor of The Midas Letter  an independent capital markets entrepreneur and investor  He

38451,259966,SLB,Oil And Gas  2013 s Best Positioned Companies,opinion,The trading ranges for oil and gas haven t changed that much since we last touched base with Phil Weiss  senior analyst at Argus Research  but the entire landscape for both North American and international oil and gas exploration has shifted dramatically  In this interview with The Energy Report  Weiss summarizes the impacts of increased production both at home onshore and in international waters  sharing some names he finds best positioned to benefit in the coming year  he Energy Report  It s been over two years since your last  with us  At that time you told us you were using  85 barrel  bbl  oil in your modeling for 2011  Is this  d j  vu all over again   Phil Weiss  In finalizing my 2013 forecast  I came pretty close to that price  I m using  87 bbl for West Texas Intermediate  WTI   But back then  Brent and WTI traded relatively close to each other  with WTI at a slight pas premium  That s changed pretty dramatically  This year I expect an   18 bbl premium for Brent over WTI  I m modeling that premium at  14 in 2013  The surge in onshore U S  production has been a big factor  relatively low Brent supply has been another  Production from the Bakken and the Eagle Ford has created  stranded  oil in the U S  and significant inventory buildup at the Cushing  Oklahoma terminal  Producers that have oil that s not in the WTI category have been doing relatively better because they re getting more for their product  This trend has also made for some dramatic changes in the refining market  especially for those companies that are U S  based  TER  What other major industry shifts have you observed  PW  Some projections for next year indicate that U S  production could be at its highest levels since 1992  That s a pretty big deal  BP s Macondo disaster in the Gulf caused a big slowdown in offshore activity and now we re back near pre Macondo levels  A number of new discoveries  such as the natural gas finds offshore East Africa  have also been big  The deepwater opportunities are much bigger now  It s not just a Brazil or Gulf of Mexico story  We have East and West Africa  Australia and other areas in Asia  Some activity has also recently started in the Arctic  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A  got an opportunity to do a little bit of work in the past year  though not as much as it had hoped  Yesterday s incident involving the Kulluk floating drilling rig in Alaska is another indication of how difficult and expensive it is to work in the arctic  Fortunately  the rig is stable and it appears the inspection team is reporting that there is no leakage  Shell has great prospects in regions such as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Australia as well as unconventional shale positions in the U S  and Canada  Shell is currently the largest player in the LNG market among the integrated oil companies with more than 20 million tons per annum  Mtpa  of current capacity  This figure could increase to about 30 Mtpa by this decade s end  Shell currently has more than 60 new projects and options  At maturity  the company represents approximately 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent of new resource potential  including major projects in LNG  deepwater  tight gas  liquids rich shales and traditional plays  These projects underpin management s cash flow and production growth targets  There was also the deal between Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  and Rosneft Oil  ROSNS  to do work in the Arctic outside of Russia  TER  What s your view on peak oil  PW  To me  the issue is really more about cheap versus expensive oil  For the most part  the cheap oil has been found  The oil we re finding now is costing more to produce  The Energy Information Administration put out a report recently stating that they expected the U S  to be energy independent by 2020  Part of that is based on the growth in U S  onshore production  What we don t know for sure is if we re accelerating production going forward  because these wells have really high decline rates  We don t know if the estimated recoveries from these wells are really accurate  It s also unclear if we re really accelerating production from these wells through hydrofracturing techniques  People like Arthur Berman have said there s not as much gas or oil in these unconventional plays as people think  although a lot of companies have invested heavily in a belief that there is  I do know that the cost of getting these hydrocarbons out of the ground is increasing  It does seem to me that cheap oil has largely been found and it will likely cost a lot more to meet some of the production targets companies have when they re drilling wells that show fairly quick production declines  It costs a lot to keep drilling new wells in order to keep production up  TER  Let s talk about the broad picture and where you see the best investment opportunities in the year ahead  starting with oil  What s your view of the domestic potential versus all the global activity going on now  PW  Oil prices have been relatively steady    averaging about  94 bbl in 2012 and about  90 in H2 12  I m looking for WTI to average  87 bbl next year with probably a slight increase to  90 for 2014  We ve been in a trading range for the last six months and if we can kind of stay within that range  without a lot of geopolitical risk or the economy really blowing up  we should be fine  Oil services companies  while they ve struggled some in the past year  are generally in the best positions in this environment  Schlumberger Ltd   SLB  and Baker Hughes Inc   BHI  both preannounced that North America activity in the fourth quarter is weaker than expected  with contractual delays and seasonal slowdowns in their international locations  but I still think that oil services companies and rig companies are generally pretty confident that oil prices are high enough to support their activity  I also believe that some of the issues Baker is having are company specific  Barclays put out its semiannual spending survey earlier this month  They expect capex to grow about 7  next year  mostly in international locations  When planning for 2013  producers are thinking about an  85 bbl oil price and say that it would need to fall in the mid  to high sixties before it would have an impact on their budgets  An  85 bbl environment should be able to sustain spending  although service rates have been hurt due to overcapacity for pressure pumping equipment  in particular  Some other services are seeing pricing pressure as well  With growth in offshore and some of the other markets I think that service companies are really well positioned to benefit with oil prices at these levels  Their stock prices  however  have lagged their business performance because people are concerned about things like pressure pumping margins  On the natural gas side  prices hit 10 year lows back in April and then more than doubled  and have now pulled back about 10   There s a lot of associated gas that comes with all these new liquids rich U S  wells  which has helped to keep natural gas production pretty high  Some people expect that to start to fall off  I think the big thing that s driven gas prices up from their lows is expectations for a cold winter  As you get into December  you expect temperatures to get colder  but gas prices have pulled back a little because the weather has been warmer than expected  Without a cold winter  gas prices could go down again  So I remain a little hesitant on the gas heavy companies  I favor those that are more tilted toward oil  Among the majors  I think that Chevron Corp   CVX  is positioned as the best large  integrated player  It has a very strong balance sheet and a good path to production growth because of projects such as Gorgon and Wheatstone  In addition  about 70  of its production is liquids  which helps it deliver the best profitability per produced barrel of any company in my coverage universe  On the exploration and production  E P  side  I think that ConocoPhillips  COP  is well positioned and I like the fact that it pays a generous dividend  That s a big benefit because even if oil prices struggle and the market doesn t do that well  you get a nice healthy dividend and can  in essence  be paid while you wait  TER  Any other ones you think are worth mentioning  PW  Moving to the downstream part of the sector  I really like Phillips 66  PSX   It s a differentiated refiner because it also has a midstream chemicals business  It s throwing off a lot of cash flow  It recently raised its dividend by 25     meaning it has increased its dividend by 56  since paying its first dividend in July  The company is also buying back stock and plans to pay off  2 billion of debt next year  With the price differences between WTI and other oils  I think certain U S  refiners have become better positioned because of access to advantaged crudes  They also benefit from the ability to use cheap natural gas in their operations  In addition  they have greater ability to export refined products  so they are not materially impacted by weaker U S  fuels demand  Phillips is also differentiated from peers in that it has chemicals and midstream operations to generate additional income  Phillips also plans to contribute transportation assets and form a master limited partnership that should IPO in the second half of next year  providing additional opportunities for shareholders to benefit  I think the chemicals business is going to be pretty strong  It doesn t have a lot of capital requirements so I think Phillips is really well positioned  HollyFrontier Corp   HFC  is another refiner that s pretty well positioned in this environment  That stock did so well in 2012    up between 90  and 100  for the year    that it s hard to see it duplicating that performance again  But the structural changes in the U S  market with access to cheaper crudes and lower cost natural gas leave these companies well positioned  Coming back to the services side for a second  the names that I like the best within my coverage are Schlumberger and Halliburton Co   HAL   Halliburton looks cheaper based on traditional valuation metrics  but it is a bit more exposed to North American unconventional activity  Schlumberger is the industry leader  It has the biggest presence in international markets and is strong in deepwater  too  Its seismic business is also doing well  I prefer both of these companies to Baker Hughes  I have some concerns about Baker s working capital management and the company s inconsistent performance  It has to work through some accounts receivable and inventory issues  On the rig side  I think that Transocean Ltd   RIG  is a nice turnaround play for value investors  As I mentioned earlier  the oil price environment certainly looks favorable for offshore activity  There s a lot of improvement that can come for it as it benefits from growth in the deepwater market  It has a  30  billion revenue backlog and also recently closed on the sale of a large portion of its commodity jackup fleet  After a good first quarter  the shares have not performed as well the last three quarters  but I see signs the operations are improving  and as long as that continues  the company has the potential to provide solid returns  Earlier today  Transocean issued a press release indicating it has reached a settlement with the Department of Justice  DoJ  over its Macondo related liabilities  Under the agreement s terms  Transocean will pay  1 4 billion   1 4B  in Clean Water Act civil penalties over a period of three years  It will also pay  100 million   100M  within 60 days of the agreement receiving court approval   150M over three years to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and  150M over five years to the National Academy of Sciences  All payments are not deductible for tax purposes  Transocean had taken a  1 5B reserve for this aspect of Macondo and a total reserve of  2B for its role in Macondo  The shares have reacted positively to the announcement  they are currently up about 7 5  today  Macondo was likely an overhang on the shares of Transocean  Settling with the DoJ for a figure slightly below what the company had provided should be a positive for the shares  In recent quarters  the company s operations have shown signs of improvement and the operating environment is positive for offshore activity  particularly in the deepwater areas  The settlement removes one of the risks hampering share price performance and has the potential to get investors to focus on the performance of the company s business  TER  Do you see any good upside with the market and companies that are more oriented toward the gas end of the business  PW  I m going to model something like a  3 60 Mcf gas environment in 2013  which is an improvement from last year s  2 75 Mcf  A lot will depend on a couple of key factors  One is if we have a cold winter that ll drive a lot of gas out of inventory and put us into a different position as we exit the winter season than we were last year  The other is dependent on places like the Marcellus where there are a lot of wells that have been drilled but not yet connected  So  we don t know exactly how much gas they could bring on line and how that could impact inventory  We also have to get a better handle on how much impact associated gas is really having on production  Certainly the number of rigs that are reported as being dedicated to drilling for gas has fallen dramatically  It s at multi year lows  which would indicate that gas production is going to fall  However  even though all the time the rig count has been falling  production has been pretty healthy  There are some questions as to whether or not companies have some flexibility as to how they report those rigs to Baker  which reports the U S  rig count on a weekly basis  If any one of those things goes against us  natural gas companies with a good amount of production could do better  While I don t have a buy on it right now  I do like Devon Energy Corp   DVN   I think it s a well managed company  It did a couple of nice joint ventures in the past year with two Asian companies  Sumitomo Corp   STMNF OTCPK  being one and Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration   Production Corp  is the other where it s joint ventured some of its U S  acreage to benefit its cost structure  It has a healthy balance sheet  and I think that s one that if you re looking for a natural gas oriented play  has some potential  Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC  is another company you could look to if you think natural gas is going to get better  While I don t have a Buy rating on it  I do think about it a lot because it s had a lot of exploration success and a good pool of assets  It s pretty well positioned in East Africa with Mozambique and also has some good positions in the U S  TER  Do you have any thoughts on ETFs  exchange traded funds  in general  PW  I don t cover any ETFs but I think they are an interesting vehicle for investors interested in the space  who don t want to pick specific stocks but like a group or groups within it  So  if you re interested in the services  there are a couple ETFs that are oriented toward services  You could do the same thing with some of the other groups within the sector  I don t really like the ones that are directed toward the commodities themselves just because I think that there are a lot of unknowns that could affect them  The futures contracts expire and have to be replaced  There s a lot of decay in value that happens there  But if you re looking to play a specific area of the sector and you re not as well versed in terms of analyzing these companies  it can be a way to get a little bit more diversified play on the sector  TER  Do you have anything else you d like to mention at this point  PW  I might add that because gas prices are still somewhat depressed  we could see some more transactions in terms of assets  I don t expect to see a lot of companies swallowing other companies unless those companies are relatively small and focused in just one or two plays  The larger companies I talk to don t seem all that interested in acquiring smaller peers  An important factor in this thought process may be that  especially when it comes to unconventional plays  there tends to be a manufacturing model where there s an advantage to having size and scale in a particular area  The idea is that it s probably better to look to grow in areas where you already have a presence  such as when Chevron bought some Permian assets from Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  a few months ago  further expanding its presence in the area  Companies like Occidental Petroleum Corp   OXY  have also done a really good job of going out and buying assets to increase their position in plays where they already have acreage  It has added a lot of acreage in plays such as the Permian from small operators  We still may have some risk with companies that were too gas focused  If they weren t hedged and if gas prices aren t strong enough  they could still have some trouble due to lack of funding  TER  So  to summarize  what strategy would you suggest generally for investors to consider  in order to try to make some money in 2013 or minimize their downside  PW  I think that the services are definitely an interesting part of the market to think about  If you re a more conservative investor  I would look to those companies paying a nice dividend  I mentioned Conoco and Chevron  which both pay pretty good dividends  I don t think Exxon s dividend is enough to entice me at these levels  plus the company is a little more gas oriented than some of the others  Even though it s a Hold rated stock  you could probably even look to Shell  because of its nice dividend  I tend to be a stock picker as opposed to taking a basket approach  But if you see a certain sector of the market that you like and you re uncomfortable picking specific stocks and find an area that you like  I think an ETF can be a little bit more conservative way to play the sector  TER  That s a good overall view of the industry and some ideas for our readers to consider  Thanks for joining us

38452,259967,SLB,Oil Service Stocks Hit An Oil Slick ,opinion,Tuesday morning  many of the leading oil service stocks came under some selling pressure  This industry group has been very strong since mid November 2012  however  most of the leading stocks in the sector are now trading into important daily chart resistance  The Market Vectors Oil Services ETF  OIH  is trading lower by 0 46 cents to  40 08 a share  The daily chart of the OIH had very good resistance around the  40 50 level which is an important gap fill area from October 22  2012 Some leading oil service stocks that declined lower yesterday include Apache Corporation  APA   Halliburton Company  HAL   Schlumberger Limited  SLB   and Baker Hughes Incorporated  BHI   Traders can usually just follow the OIH when the leading stocks in the sector are trading in tandem with each other ,2013-01-08,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-service-stocks-hit-an-oil-slick-150084,150084
38453,259968,SLB,January Second Half Fade  Won t Be Long Now,opinion,A common event in January is the second half fade  Stocks often burst out of the gate on a wave of new money and fresh calendar optimism  Halfway through the month  they get too far out over their skis and end up taking a tumble or two to a more sedate pace  Given the lukewarm rise of the week just past  though  the fade is more uncertain  On the one hand  it s clear that the market is trying to go higher   were the highest they ve been in a decade  The y is at an 11 month high  The S P 500 hit a multi year high  with remarkably little fanfare   Yet there is clearly still worry in the market  A bear could claim with some justification that the market should have been stronger last week  given the previous week s momentum and inflows  A market with no news usually keeps going in the same direction  yet it fell the first two days of the week  Some of the decline might have been options related  as dealers sold off after the weekly expiration  Some of it might have been trading pros selling out to retail investors  Whatever the reason  a market that isn t overbought is more susceptible to good news  A bull could make the reasonable claim that last week represented necessary digestion of the rocket like previous week  which was really just the first day of the year  Much will depend on the dynamic of the earnings season that gets underway in earnest next week  Not the sharpest of insights  perhaps  but bear with me  This coming week s results are heavy on financial names  where quarterly earnings growth expectations are high  The sector is a bit overbought of late and may be under net margin pressure  as was the case with Wells Fargo  WFC    If prices struggle  the broad market is probably not going to make much upward progress   a so so start with the financials should lead to the second half fade syndrome  The S P 500 is already up 3 2  this month  versus the long term average of 1 1   The earnings bar seems low elsewhere  It s always set to the low side  of course  but anticipation of a challenging earnings season this time around seems well built in to me  That lays the groundwork for the market to hack its way higher the next two weeks  Intel  INTC   for example  is a high profile name that reports on Thursday  The stock has been under the cloud of declining PC use since the middle of the summer  The bar is set suitably low  consensus of  0 49 versus a year ago  0 68   leaving plenty of room for upside surprise  which Intel has a good track record of doing  I am not making any analytic prediction here about Intel s quarter  but I do note that the company didn t revise its previous guidance for the quarter  which seems to leave the door open for something good  A result of say   0 55  would set up a classic Wall Street rally on earnings that declined from the previous year  but rides estimate beats higher anyway  The reason I cite Intel is that it s one of the early reporters and like many other large industrials  has had a declining stock price in recent months  Ergo  it s ripe for a sentiment reversal  Positive  surprises  from this area could boost investor sentiment another notch on the earnings wall of worry  It hardly needs saying that disappointments will have the opposite effect  I for one am not expecting good earnings in an absolute sense for the quarter  Two things to keep in mind  however  One  management is rarely pessimistic with the outlook in January  An acceleration of second half earnings growth is one of corporate America s favorite mythical beasts  much talked about but rarely seen  Two  while earnings may not compare favorably with the previous year s quarter  they could compare favorably with expectations  and herd sentiment is what drives prices in the short run   Better than expected  has been the marching song of many a silly charge  Keep an eye also on the level of the S P 500  one of the most talked about themes on the floor  It managed to finish Friday at 1472  a semi magical level and a five year plus closing high  Only the post QE infinity intra day high of 1474 51 on September 14th remains to be taken out  At the same time  half the investor universe is expecting the index to top out at the 1500 level  including prominent technical strategist   The typical result for such high levels of expectation is that something else happens  Either we wouldn t get there at all  or not until much later   or blow right through it and top out 25 to 50 S P points higher  I have to admit that it s difficult for me to see the latter happening this time out in view of the impending budget battle  but irrational markets are nothing new  I still see the market headed for a good sized tumble when the budget battle is joined  as both sides are digging in  While corporate earnings may succeed in  surprising  to the upside  flat to down revenues aren t a solid base for later gains  Yet in one way the market managed the best of all technical moves this week  rising a small amount and keeping the overbought indicator lights turned off  Had we added another percent to 1485 or so  charts would be toppy and begging for a sharp reversal from the run at 1500  Now we could keep grinding higher   and suck the retail investor in just a little bit more  So far  most of the attention has been on the fact that we didn t go over the fiscal cliff  or at least not yet  The only permanent change  though  is that payroll taxes went back up and most people didn t start seeing the good news until Friday  Some won t until the end of the month  many will have gotten a raise that exactly offsets the tax hike  It isn t going to stimulate spending  in any case  The other change that s most likely to come this quarter is more fiscal tightening  be it in the form of taxes or spending  Like its fiscal cliff cousin  the tightening could get overlooked at first in the wave of relief over any deal being done  But it won t get overlooked for long  The Economic Beat It was the lightest of weeks on the U S  calendar last week  Small business optimism rose a fraction  though you could reasonably say it was unchanged  The ICSC Goldman report on weekly retail sales was at odds with the Redbook weekly report  as has often been the case for some months  in this case with the former sounding hopeful and the latter pessimistic  Guidance has been on the low side for some retailers of late  including Kohl s  KSS   Best Buy  BBY   Tiffany s  TIF  and Aeropostale  ARO    Weekly claims seem to be running normally again on a year over year basis  I had some concern in December that they might be heating up  but the calendar makes comparisons tricky at times and now it looks as if they ve settled back into a broad pattern of roughly 10  year year improvement  November trade data continued to show price weakness  along with a relative import surge that is going to weigh on fourth quarter GDP  A series I do follow closely is wholesale trade  There was little in the way of exceptional news in the release of November data  though  Sales fell on an unadjusted basis and rose on the adjusted one  The three month moving average of unadjusted sales fell for the fifth time in six months  though the decline was quite small   0 59   and arguably cliff related  The growth in trailing twelve month sales slowed for the fifteenth month in a row and is now down to 5 6   The adjusted inventory to sales ratio is still low  at about 1 2  unadjusted 1 19   and only slightly higher than a year ago  The European Central Bank  ECB  didn t cut rates  which sent the euro and European stocks soaring  Here in the U S   stocks rally when they cut rates  I guess it s a big world  In the European case  it seems to have been taken as a signal of confidence in the European economy  In addition  a higher euro is the last thing that the EU needs  so it was only natural to bid up its stocks  The student loan bubble  bulge  mountain or whatever you want to call it continues to rapidly expand  as evidenced in the latest   This is going to come back to haunt us  but as usual we will wait until it s past critical mass to react  French industrial production was a little better than expected in November  German a little worse  The former is down 3 6  year on year  the latter 2 9   A visitor from another planet might conclude that if only the declines would accelerate  European stocks could really take off  It just goes to show the value of sophistication  The EU will report its December production estimate Monday morning  China s trade balance was better than expected and so its market rose  global growth    but inflation was worse and then it fell  no stimulus    The country is scheduled to report industrial production  GDP and retail sales data  This coming week has both the economic and earnings calendar heating up  The highlight for the former should be the January retail sales report  scheduled to be released on Tuesday  The bar is low  consensus is for a gain of only 0 2   In manufacturing  we ll get the Industrial Production report for the same month on Wednesday  bracketed by the New York Fed survey on Tuesday and the Philadelphia Fed survey on Thursday  The Fed s Beige Book of regional reports is Wednesday afternoon  Housing  which has very much been on the market s mind  reports the homebuilder sentiment index on Wednesday and housing starts on Thursday  Inflation  which hasn t been at all  reports the Producer Price Index  PPI  on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index  CPI  on Thursday  Some of the bigger Dow companies start to report this week  which could set the tone for the latter half of the month  in particular for the financials  After Wells Fargo s report on Friday  featuring lower net interest margins  the other Gang of Four banks report on Wednesday  JP Morgan  JPM   and Thursday  Citigroup  C   Bank of America  BAC    The two big investment banks  Goldman Sachs  GS  and Morgan Stanley  MS  also report on Wednesday and Thursday respectively  On the industrial side  there s Intel after the close on Thursday  followed by GE  Johnson Controls  JCI  and Schlumberger  SLB  on Friday before the market open ,2013-01-13,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/january-second-half-fade:-won’t-be-long-now-150622,150622

38455,259970,SLB,Elliott Gue  What The Narrowing WTI Brent Price Gap Means For Investors,opinion,Increasing pipeline capacity in the U S  is expected to help close the troubling price differential between West Texas Intermediate and Brent prices  In this interview with The Energy Report  newsletter editor and international stock market strategist Elliott Gue discusses how this trend and other developments are affecting investment prospects  sharing some favorite names with upside potential   The Energy Report  U S  oil prices hit their third peak of 2012 soon after your last interview with us  then bottomed around  85 per barrel   85 bbl  in early November  Now they re back in the mid  90s  What s causing the recent strength   Elliott Gue  New pipeline capacity is alleviating some of the supply crude glut in places like Cushing  Oklahoma  As a result  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  has gained ground against Brent  which is now trading just under  114 bbl and has been in that same  107 115 bbl range since August  Over the next year or so  a number of other pipelines will open up to the Gulf Coast  which will help narrow the spread between Brent and WTI   TER  Will the increased oil supply at the Gulf refineries be good for gasoline prices   EG  Gasoline and diesel prices have historically tracked Brent prices more closely than WTI because not all refiners have access to WTI or the other inland crude oil benchmarks  Refiners don t really benefit from rising oil prices because they purchase crude oil as a raw material  But those U S  refiners that are able to access WTI and other inland crude oil benchmarks can buy that raw material very cheaply and sell gasoline and diesel at very high prices  earning a very high spread  or what we call a crack spread   But the boom in U S  energy production is benefiting the U S  economy in general  Natural gas prices in the U S  can be as much as one fifth of what they are in Europe  That is sparking a renaissance in manufacturing and other energy intensive businesses  One of the most obvious examples is the petrochemical processing business  The boom in gas production has seen a commensurate boom in production of ethane and propane  Now it s actually cheaper to produce base chemicals and many plastics in the U S  than it is even in the Middle East  which is a dramatic change from just five or 10 years ago   I wrote recently in High Yield International about LyondellBasell Industries NV  LYB   a multinational chemical company that produces a lot of ethylene and propylene  It s really benefiting because of its access to really cheap propane and ethane in the U S  That trend is going to continue   TER  Do you expect general improvement in the global economy to continue fueling higher oil prices   EG  The near term outlook appears much more bullish in Europe than the U S  Countries in southern Europe have made strides toward fiscal austerity  bringing their budgets somewhat under control  It appears that the worst of the European fiscal crisis is behind us   China  however  has been a drag on the global economy over the last couple of years  Its very strong growth rates caused the government to get concerned about inflation and hike bank reserve requirements to cool overheated areas of the market  like property  As a result  the Chinese economy slowed down throughout the latter half of 2011 and into 2012  I believe it s reached a bottom now  The government is now supporting growth by cutting interest and bank reserve requirements and doing additional fiscal spending  Over the last 10 years  more than 95  of global growth in oil demand has come from emerging markets  not the U S  and Europe  so Chinese growth is very important to global oil demand   In December  Japan  the world s third largest economy  elected Shinzo Abe on a platform of aggressive stimulus for the Japanese economy  He wants it to adopt an official inflation target and start pushing the Japanese economy into an inflationary position to get out of the stagnation and periodic bouts of deflation it has suffered from since its property bubble burst back in the early 1990s  That will probably be positive for commodity prices   TER  How do these projections affect your investment outlook   EG  I m really excited about international markets now because I think that s the best place to be  A company like Eni S p A   E   which was originally a state sponsored Italian oil company  is far cheaper than a Chevron Corp   CVX  or an Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   and has faster production growth  It yields almost 6  compared to 2 3  for the U S  majors  yet it s getting punished simply because it s an Italian company even though its main product  oil and natural gas  are internationally traded commodities that are priced in dollars  Moreover  it doesn t have that much exposure to Italy or even Europe  Many of its main oil  and gas producing facilities are located in regions like North Africa  the Middle East and Norway  Markets like Europe are much cheaper than the U S  As European economies emerge from recession  stocks should do very well   East Africa is one of the very interesting emerging offshore regions  and Eni is one of the main players in Mozambique  Eni is a company that has been a favorite of mine for a while  I actually think now is an even better time to get involved in it because Europe is really going to start pulling its weight   TER  What are you expecting for oil prices in the foreseeable future   EG  My oil outlook is pretty flat this year  I m calling for Brent prices to average around  110 bbl  and WTI to range between  90 100 bbl  Of course  there are risks  One of the biggest risks for Brent is the geopolitical climate  Recent events in Algeria have raised concerns over potential disruption to global oil supplies  Another factor is simply that the global supply of oil is actually very tight  All of the world s growth outside of OPEC has come from the U S  and Canada in recent years  as well as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico   The main risk to U S  oil prices is that if drilling activity remains very strong  we could see U S  oil production ramp up more quickly than expected  That would likely put downside pressure on WTI  But unless WTI prices remain relatively high  there will be a drop off in drilling activity and a consequent drop in supply   TER  What does that mean for energy stocks   EG  It s actually going to be a really good year for companies  particularly those leveraged to Brent  One of my favorite areas remains deepwater  due to the activity boom in different basins such as the U S  Gulf of Mexico  One of my favorite deepwater rig plays that I ve had for a while is Seadrill Ltd   SDRL   which has about an 8  yield  This company owns a fleet of deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs that are going to be in extremely high demand  The market is very tight and should remain so for at least three or four years  There are only one or two rigs available for all of 2013  Operators are willing to lock in those rigs at very high rates  Seadrill is a company that s well placed to benefit from a very modern fleet  Seadrill has been a good winner for us  It s pulled back a little bit from its highs lately  but has continued to benefit from the ability to purchase new rigs and put them out at very high contracted day rates  As a result  it has been able to continue to grow its dividends  which have supported the stock   TER  How have some of your favorites performed over the last year or so   Some of the companies that I ve talked about in the past  such as some of the U S  royalty trusts  like the SandRidge Permian Trust  PER  and SandRidge Mississippian Trust II  SDR   have been on a roller coaster ride  the main reason being that most of those trusts are producing WTI oil where prices are much lower  But new pipeline capacity coming into play is really going to help those stocks  In particular  the SandRidge Permian Trust remains an excellent buy at current prices   We also talked about liquefied natural gas  LNG  during my last interview  This is an area where I continue to see substantial upside potential  Natural gas prices in the U S  are ultra low  which is a major advantage for the U S  If you re a gas producer  it s not a good thing  In Europe and Asia  people are paying prices five times higher for natural gas  A lot of these countries are going to be importing larger and larger quantities of LNG  This market will continue to grow in coming years   One of the companies I like a lot is called Teekay LNG Partners L P   TGP   It s a master limited partnership  MLP  incorporated in Bermuda  It owns is a fleet of LNG tankers  Teekay LNG locks in day rates over multi year contracts  guaranteeing a steady cash flow and nice high  single digit distributions  We ll see continued growth as it adds new ships to its fleet to work under long term contracts at very favorable rates   TER  What s your outlook for the international majors   EG  In the integrated oil space  I would tend to favor the foreign over the U S  majors  The problem with the global majors is they really don t generate a lot of production growth  A company like Exxon Mobil has a huge production base  but if that base declines at a 5  annualized rate due to maturing fields  for example  it has to make up for that basic decline and then come up with enough new projects to produce growth  In this sense  majors are running on a treadmill   The investment case for Exxon Mobil rests more on the idea that it does pay a dividend and it generates tons of free cash flow  It has been high grading its portfolio  selling off lower quality and more mature assets and buying into faster growing  better quality or lower cost assets  Over the years  it has built one of the best portfolios of projects in the world   Overall  I still tend to prefer the European majors right now  I ve already discussed Eni  which has a number of very exciting exploration projects  Another company I would mention is the French oil company Total S A   TOT   It also has strong production growth prospects  particularly in the deepwater areas like the Gulf of Mexico  And it has a much higher dividend than what you re going to get out of a similar U S  company   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A  RDS B  is definitely an interesting company for the longer term  Shell is really excelling in the LNG area  which over the long term is going to provide considerable growth  In addition to that  it generates solid free cash flow  I see very little chance that its dividend would be threatened  In fact  I d expect to see continued dividend growth even in the event that oil prices were to dip more than I expect  It s certainly a solid company that s performed well over the years with some nice exposure to LNG   TER  Where do you see the best opportunities in energy stocks in the coming years   EG  It s definitely going to be a good time to invest in energy stocks  One of the key levers this year is going to be further strengthening in the Chinese economy  which is going to reignite demand  Oil prices within the U S  are going to have to remain high for producers to continue to generate the production growth we ve seen in recent years  That s really an amazing transition from a culture of energy scarcity to a culture of abundance   In terms of more speculative names  one growth area that I would look at within North America is among some of these smaller Canadian firms  many of which used to be Canadian royalty trusts  These were once extremely hot because they paid out very high dividends  and were extremely tax advantaged  In 2006  the Canadian government announced that it was going to change the tax structure for these trusts and eliminate a lot of their advantages  Although many of these companies don t pay out quite as much as they did before that tax change  many are still yielding 7  8 or 9   That s still pretty impressive  If I m right about the narrowing in the discount for WTI and other inland crudes to Brent crude oil prices  the market could see a lot of upside  One company in Canada I ve written about recently is Twin Butte Energy  TBE   which is primarily an oil producer in western Canada  I believe it s going to continue to see pretty strong production growth using horizontal drilling and fracturing type techniques  It has traded off since November on the idea that the oil that it sells tends to be indexed to Western Canadian Select  WCS   which is a benchmark crude that has been trading at a large discount to WTI and Brent  although that discount is also starting to narrow due to new pipeline capacity  This company could really see some upside over the next couple of years and while you wait  you re getting about a 7   dividend yield   Another Canadian that s a little bit less speculative  which I recently profiled in High Yield International  is Enbridge Income Fund Holdings  ENF   It owns  and is expanding  pipelines that transport oil out of western Canada and the Canadian portion of the Bakken shale  I like pipeline companies because they get paid a fixed rate for the volume of oil that they transport  regardless of the oil price  It s a very stable business and Enbridge pays around a 5  dividend  I do see some growth because as it adds capacity to these pipelines  it is signing up new producers to use that capacity  guaranteeing additional cash flow  While Twin Butte is definitely more of an aggressive play  Enbridge Income Fund provides a little bit more safety and is still going to benefit from this production growth   TER  Thanks for joining us today  We really appreciate your updates and ideas   EG

38456,259971,SLB,50 Best Dividend Growth Stocks In January 2013 ,opinion,Dividend growth can be a big wealth driver  But  if you buy a stock with a 2 percent yield you must know that this won t get you very far  When you have invest  1 000  your dividend income would only be  20  That s not much   Dividend growth helps you to grow your passive income  Normally  a solid stock should double its dividend payments over ten years  This means that your yield on cost would rise to 4 percent   I often had stocks in my portfolio that beat this growth rates  Sure they were more risky than stocks like Procter   Gamble  PG  or Coca Cola  KO  but they all had a margin of safety for me  My yield on cost was over 10 percent after 5 years   Today we ll look at the 50 best dividend growth stocks

38494,260009,SLB,Byron King   Falling Oil Prices Offer Great Stock Buying Opportunities  ,opinion,The  experts  had been talking about oil prices going to  130 per barrel  Now there s talk of  50 60 per barrel oil  Either end of that spectrum is not sustainable in the long run  says Byron King  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  he explains why he believes prices will settle in the  80 100 range  In the meantime  the recent pullback offers some interesting buying opportunities for investors ready to pounce when the market finds a bottom  as well as some names investors can nibble on right now    The Energy Report  Things have been pretty hectic on the global economic and financial fronts lately and the energy markets seem to be defying the expectations and predictions of many analysts  What s your take on where we are and where things are headed    Byron King  We re living with volatility  most of which is due to international currency and exchange rates  The dramatic decline in the euro has caused a capital flight to the U S  and a strengthening of the dollar  which results in lower oil prices  The other big macro type issues include the looming economic slowdown in China  More news stories are coming out about negative demand indicators in China  which will definitely be bad for Chinese consumption growth  The country may use less oil than people forecast  The Saudis are producing at least 1 million barrels per day  MMbbl d  in excess of what they normally would  So  between the rising dollar  slowing growth and excess production in Saudi Arabia  we re seeing these gyrating low prices    TER  One hundred and thirty dollar per barrel oil and  5 a gallon  gal  gasoline failed to materialize as predicted  and now there s talk of  60 bbl or even  50 bbl oil in the shorter term  Some oil analysts are now predicting  3 gal gasoline by early November  What s your expectation    BK  Extremely high or low prices aren t realistic for the long haul  The world economy will hardly function with  130 bbl oil  The airline industry shuts down right away and much of the rest of the world will suffer accordingly  A  5 gal gasoline price makes for an instant U S  recession  Whatever economic strength we saw in late winter and early spring got stuck in the mud when gasoline prices went over  4 gal on the East Coast and toward  5 gal in California  All of a sudden  the U S  economy lost traction  and we re sliding back into recession    And while the world economy can t deal with high oil prices  Credit Suisse s  50 bbl oil prediction  though it may happen  would not last long  For one thing  the seven sisters of oil exporting Saudi  Iran  Nigeria  Kuwait  United Arab Emirates  Russia and Venezuela simply cannot afford under  85 bbl oil because they have their own bills to pay  Those lowball prices could be reached because of events  but they won t remain because of supply and demand economics    TER  Is the  80 90 bbl range reasonable    BK  This morning  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil was trading in the  78 bbl range  That s rather low by recent standards  A WTI price of  80 bbl is enough to keep the North American oil industry working  A  90 bbl level for Brent  the international standard  will keep the international oil industry alive  It will tighten things up for the big oil exporting countries  but they ll be able to avoid bread lines and riots  The number that oil has to find is  80 85 in North America and between  90 100 internationally    TER  Have upside speculators been chased out of this market at this point    BK  This is still a trader s market  with rising prices and falling prices  For people with a really strong stomach and money to play the short term  have at it  boys  This is your market  The last thing the traders want is for oil to stay static at  85 bbl  though the rest of the world might like that for budgeting and projecting purposes  For traders  the last couple of months have been terrific  The people who understand the market and are successful over the long term know that you sell on the way up and buy on the way down  It s a question of understanding the market dynamics  As Mark Twain said   If you re going to throw your eggs in one basket  you have to watch that basket   When you re trading at the margins and a move one way or the other could wipe out your capital  you have to keep your eye on things  But the big oil thinkers don t worry about today s headlines  They need to think about the very long term    TER  Big companies are usually able to absorb oil price fluctuations  but what happens with the smaller companies during periods of low prices and volatility    BK  It s been a tough world out there for small companies without deep pockets  The energy business  in general  is for companies with money  A small gold miner versus a small oil company carries a difference of at least one or two orders of magnitude  The equivalent of a  20 million   20M  gold company would be a  200M oil company  With the small guys  the big concerns right now are geographic and economic    If you re in the natural gas business in North America  you have to be deeply concerned  Natural gas prices are at historical lows and the cash flow just isn t there to support much development  A small company may have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars tied up in leases  If you don t somehow drill or exploit these leases in one way or another  you re going to lose them  So not only would you not be drilling or extracting  but you d lose your leases  too  That s a terrible predicament    So what will we see in North America  There will be some cutbacks in drilling  It s already happening  but we re going to see more of it  It will affect the smaller drillers and service companies first  The big guys Halliburton  HAL NYSE   Schlumberger Ltd   SLB NYSE  and Baker Hughes Inc   BHI NYSE  will also feel it but  they have much deeper pockets and they re large and international  So we ll see some rigs get stacked  but I don t think we ll see as many as some of the gloom and doomers are forecasting  A lot of these smaller companies have to keep their geologists and engineers working and drilling or all of that money that they spent on leases in the last five to ten years goes down the drain    Overseas is another story  You almost have to take each country as you find it  Argentina is a disaster with what s going on with Repsol YPF SA  REP MAD   A couple of weeks ago  a company called Pan American Energy LLC saw its operations literally overrun by rioting workers one of the largest and oldest fields in Argentina was almost shut down because of political issues and labor unrest    Look at Poland  A lot of people were thinking Poland was going to have its own shale gas revolution  but a couple of weeks ago  Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE  decided to pull out of Poland after a couple of bad wells  Now  the cynics are saying that Exxon is getting better deals from Russia  Russia is the big fish that Exxon wants to land  so it s going to walk away from Poland    One more country I d throw in is Libya  which was a big oil producer  With the recent shale revolution  its exports almost ceased  Now  it has put a lot of things back into shape  but what I hear is that many of those repairs were jerry rigged and could start breaking down  Secondly  the security situation is not nearly as good as the operators would like to see    TER  Do you think that there will be enough cutbacks in domestic natural gas production to trigger a price rise in the foreseeable future    BK  Prices have to rise  and they probably will rise sooner than conventional wisdom suggests  I m sort of a contrarian by nature  but the fact is they re giving gas away as it is  so I don t see much downside from here  I do see upside potential  as well as more demand from more places  We re already seeing a complete upheaval in the electric generating industry with coal fired plants  There are no new ones being built and they re scaling back on upgrading the old ones because they may not operate long enough to pay back    That has impacts elsewhere in U S  industry  such as with companies that do the engineering and supply the parts  engineering and such for upgrading pollution controls on coal plants  They re about to enter their own mini recession because of lack of business  Natural gas is also playing havoc with the renewable energy space  Natural gas fired energy is so cheap that the windmill guys and the solar guys are losing the battle of economics on that alone  I expect to see slightly less gas supply and likely more demand than what people have anticipated    TER  What are some of the oil and gas majors that would be good shots to weather the ups and downs    BK  In the international realm  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  is in very good shape  It is a wonderful  technology based company that has deep pockets and a very aggressive plan to grow its resources and reserves over the coming years    Another one that I think is just a spectacularly well run company is Statoil ASA  STO NYSE  STL OSE   of Norway  It is truly one of the world leaders in offshore work and has made a major commitment in North America  People in North America should know there s a new kid on the block  I think we re going to see great things from Statoil    Further down in North American domestic plays  I m keeping my eye on a company called Denbury Resources Inc   DNR NYSE   Denbury is a very advanced independent as independents go and is making a lot of good moves in the tertiary recovery area using carbon dioxide to get the last drops of oil out of reservoirs  In Canada  I ve been following a company called Cenovus Energy Inc   CVE TO  CVE NYSE  for two years now  It is a very rapidly growing player within the Alberta oil sands play  It has lots of acreage and lots of investment to grow things with very good economics  The one major issue for Cenovus and for all of the Canadian oil sands operators is access to markets  The Keystone Pipeline debacle was not good for the oil sands players  At the same time  the Canadians are moving very firmly toward finding another way of doing it  We may or may not see that northern pipeline get built to the upper Pacific Coast  but there is certainly a plan in place to take some of that Alberta oil sands product down to Vancouver for export  which will be to the long term  strategic detriment of the U S  Regardless of who is president next January  we will see some sort of a Keystone Pipeline expansion to move more oil sands product out of Alberta and down into the U S    TER  Can you give us a little more detail on the revenues and market caps of Denbury and Cenovus and where you think they might be going    BK  Cenovus is a  32 billion   32B  market cap company  The price earnings  P E  is around 12  It is making money  and it pays a nice dividend 2 8   It s been a bit of a sleeper for many investors  but I think Cenovus is a great choice for investors looking for exposure to the Canadian oil sands plays  It is a good  strong idea with a lot of upside and a lot of growth potential  and it pays a nice dividend while you re waiting    Denbury has a  5B market cap  The P E is about seven  with no dividend  This is a stock where I m looking for internal growth to bring the capital gains back to investors over the long haul    TER  What other companies are interesting at these levels    BK  I m a big fan of the oil service sector  Right now  Schlumberger is trading down around  60  Schlumberger is one of those companies that almost never gets cheap because too many people know how good it is  When it trades in that low  50 60 range  I always consider it a buying opportunity  When oil prices recover  that  60 Schlumberger stock is going to be an  80 90 stock  If you can just bear with the market gyrations  it s almost a guaranteed 40 50  gain    Right now  with things as volatile as they are  investors want to be very careful about going too deep into these very turbulent waters  To the extent that you do go in  it would be with companies that have a really strong upside such as Cenovus or Schlumberger    TER  Do you have any thoughts on Encana Corp   ECA TO  ECA NYSE     BK  Encana is also a very strong Canadian firm  It has almost a  14B market cap and a relatively high P E of 27  But the dividend yield is a nice 4   If you re looking for yield  Encana would do it for you  but with a P E of 27  I think it s priced more like a growth stock than others  In this oil market  I don t know if management can really live up to those kinds of expectations  I m not negative on it  I m just saying  be careful    TER  To summarize  what do you think the average investor should be doing these days if they want to play the energy markets    BK  I would be very wary of most gas plays just because of the economics  I would also be wary of the oil service sector  with the exception of Schlumberger  which happens to be cheap but won t be cheap for long  In terms of the larger oil plays  I d suggest Statoil for international and technical competence with a good growth profile in front of it and  in the oil sands  Cenovus  I don t want to give too long of a list to the investors out there because this is not the time to be too bold    This market could confound people greatly  We re at the beginning of a presidential election cycle where government statistics and government announcements will become completely meaningless because everything will become politicized  There are many beaten down ideas out there  The market is filled with underpriced value  but you want to find the best of the best of those underpriced values  I think I ve given a few names in this discussion  I ll be able to sleep well at night if investors act on those    TER  Should we wait a little bit for the oil market to bottom out before it s an ideal time to get in or should people be averaging in    BK  I think people should view the market as trying to find a bottom  Right now  it s OK to nibble  but it s better to watch and wait    TER  You ve given us a good overview of where you think the market might be headed and some good names to look at  Thanks again for your time    BK  Thanks

38495,260010,SLB,Oil Service Stocks Keep On Pumping,opinion,Yesterday afternoon  most of the leading oil service stocks were trading higher on the session  The popular Market Vectors Oil Services ETF  NYSEARCA OIH  has been very strong since bottoming in late June 2012  As of yesterday  the OIH was trading higher by 0 67 cents to  41 60 a share  Traders and investors should watch for some daily chart resistance around the  43 50 level  Short term traders can watch for intra day resistance around the  41 70 and  42 00 levels Some of the leading oil service stocks that gained on the session included Halliburton Inc  NYSE HAL   Baker Hughes Inc  NYSE BHI   Schlumberger Ltd  NYSE SLB   and Apache Corp  NYSE APA   Oil service stocks will often do well when energy prices increase  That is currently the case at this time as oil prices are trading at four month highs ,2012-09-12,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-service-stocks-keep-on-pumping-136037,136037
38496,260011,SLB,John Stephenson  Why My Portfolio Gained 30  This Year ,opinion,Markets aren t great but they re not all that bad  says John Stephenson  vice president of First Asset Management Inc  They were strong enough to allow the fund manager and newsletter writer to increase his portfolio s worth by 30  year over year  His advice  Be nimble and buy and sell on your feet  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Stephenson highlights some small cap companies that may help you book gains repeatedly  The Energy Report  John  In your last   you were pretty optimistic about much higher oil prices  What can you attribute the oil market s recent weakness to  Did everyone just get spooked  John Stephenson  There was a rumor that the U S  was going to release strategic petroleum reserves  which would lower prices at the pump and also lower prices in the world market  It would be a temporary fix  because the actual total volume of the reserve is only about a month s worth of U S  consumption  Nonetheless  it would definitely lower prices  There s some waning of geopolitical risk  and some of that risk rhetoric was positive for oil prices  The European ban on importing Iranian oil has had a pretty dramatic impact on tightening supply  It s roughly equivalent to when Libya was offline because of its revolution  That same level of production  about 1 5 million barrels  MMbbl  is off the global market now  creating a fairly tight supply picture  Then there is the Israel Iran nuclear confrontation  which has also driven oil prices higher  Realistically  there s very strong support for oil prices in the  90 95 per barrel  bbl  range because one of the big sources of demand for oil has actually turned out to be the Middle East itself  where the producers are becoming their own best customers  They re like drug dealers getting hooked on their own supply  and their consumption growth rates are double those of China  TER  But  certainly their population isn t anywhere near that of China  JS  No  it s not  But  the reason why they are this way is because they subsidize fuel  With  0 56 a gallon gasoline in Saudi Arabia  you need  90 95 bbl oil to support the subsidies  In Venezuela and other parts of the world that are key producers  low gas prices are a way to keep their citizens happy  but that impacts their national budgets and necessitates a much higher global price for the commodity to make it all work  TER  What do you think the possibilities are for oil going back up significantly over  100 bbl  Or is it in sort of a trading range between  90 100 bbl  JS  I think it s in a trading range from  90 100  It could dip into the high eighties for a while if some of that geopolitical concern is resolved  From where I sit right now  I think it will probably weaken a dollar or two over the next few months  Through 2013  you re probably looking at the  95 105 bbl range  But it s going to be difficult to see it punch much above that  I may have suggested it would go to  125 bbl at one point  but  that s really dependent on global growth returning  Right now  industrial production numbers are very weak around the globe and demand is not that strong  The supply demand balances have kept prices where they are  with a floor at around  90 bbl  The equities have responded a little bit  but generally  they ve really lagged  So it s a good time to start thinking about some trades in the energy space  TER  The other side of the coin is the North American gas market  which has been pretty sick for the producers but certainly nice for the consumer  Do you see any hope there for higher prices  JS  Natural gas producers certainly have some things to worry about now  but ultimately  prices have to move higher  The solution is to export the product to other parts of the world  Right now  natural gas is trading at almost  2 90 Mcf  Considering that natural gas was  13 14 Mcf six or seven years ago  today s natural gas market doesn t look so good  Where the market is attractive is in Europe and Japan  where natural gas can often be  18 Mcf  I think the solution is to liquefy it and send it offshore  Clearly the Gulf of Mexico states have lots of oil and gas assets  I think it s a pretty logical place for investors to look for projects to be sited and developed  The question is  will they get it done  There s been a lot of  not in my backyard  resistance to these projects  That s true throughout the world  but more so in North America  I think that s a long dated solution  We re looking at a couple of years from now before gas prices lift meaningfully above  3 Mcf  and they could very easily remain in the  2 50 3 50 Mcf range for the foreseeable future  TER  Getting back to the market  a year ago  your portfolio was sitting with about 78  cash  Did you get more of that cash deployed since then  JS  Yes  I ve got most of it deployed  Our cash is more on the order of 18  now  So  why were we so high then and why are we so low now  It s really because of some moves that have come to fruition in the last two to three weeks  The European Central Bank  ECB  has shown a willingness to defend the currency and not have a disorderly exit  It s become clear that Angela Merkel  for example  has decided that she won t let Greece derail her re election plans for early next year  So  while it may not be a perfect solution  what the Europeans are implementing has removed the disaster scenario  Have they got a perfection solution  No  But  it s a better solution than they used to have and things have improved considerably  Given that  I think it s still a reasonable environment to start redeploying cash and investing because I don t believe we re going to have a major pullback and experience a 30 40  decline in equities  as we saw in 2008  You always hear   don t fight the Fed   Well  you could say  don t fight the ECB  I think the reality is that if it was really willing to do anything and be unconventional in its approach  it would be a losing battle to fight them  It s a good idea to go with the flow  And where the flow seems to be going is not a great market  but it s not all that bad either  That s a very bullish backdrop for many of these commodities or risk on type investments  TER  How has your energy portfolio performed since January  JS  It s been doing bang up  up 30  year to date  The reason for that is that we ve been fairly nimble  As you pointed out  we ve been in cash at various points in the cycle  But  when we thought things were firming  up we ve been able to quickly deploy and reinvest  I think we ve done things smartly  The era  for many investors  of buy and hold is over because these are different times where the big macro story is driving so much of these returns  TER  Quite bit of exploration and development activity is taking place in global locations which may not be that stable  Is this the trend for the future  JS  I think you have to divide the world into two categories  One includes the smaller domestic producers and service companies  Those that are particularly involved in shale oil or shale gas have a pretty bright future  assuming they have good lands  because the demand for oil in North America is pretty strong  I think that s a good thing  The other category includes the big caps  and they re going to have a little more difficulty  Look at what s happening with BP Plc   BP NYSE  BP LSE   for example  in Russia  Their partnership with TNK is really fractious  I think it s very hard for them to figure out a path forward  The basins around the world are getting smaller  harder to find and more expensive  Most of this is going offshore to places like Nigeria and Greenland  These are new frontiers that people haven t looked at before  but they re starting to  I think the bigger cap names like Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE   even Chevron Corp   CVX  NYSE  and ConocoPhillips Company  COP NYSE  will struggle more because  in order to keep production flat or grow it slightly  they will be forced to go to the far edges of the world  TER  Which production and development companies look good to you right now  JS  Let s start out by talking about the refining space  The really interesting thing is that the refining margin or  crack spread   as it s known  has really blown out  Right now it is just under  29 bbl  Historically  it has been around  10 bbl  As recently as two weeks ago  it got up to  34 bbl  This was a match made in heaven  particularly for refiners that were buying WTI  because it trades at a discount to Brent  The product market for diesel and gasoline has been very tight  By way of example  here is a tale of two companies two independent refiners in the U S  are Tesoro Corp   TSO NYSE   which we like  and Valero Energy Corp   VLO NYSE   which we don t so much  Why do we like Tesoro  It s in the mid continent  which is where a lot of the crudes get trapped and trade at a discount to the world price  which is now becoming Brent  Brent itself is trading at  18 bbl more than WTI  So  the oil price number we see on our screen just inflate that by roughly 20   That s what most of the world is paying for the raw material  Tesoro has a better focus in the key regions where the crude is cheap  So we like that name a lot  Valero not so much because it s exposed more to the Gulf Coast  where prices seem to be trading in line with the Brent prices  So we see its situation as more challenging  Another name that we like  because of the lack of political risk  is Suncor Energy Inc   SU TSX  SU NYSE   It s been a bit weak of late  which has a lot to do with the fact that the focus hasn t been on oil until the last three weeks or so  Suncor is a cash flow machine that s going to  2 billion dollars a year  with visible production growth  They ve had some problems with fires and other issues related to its upgraders  where it upgrades the bitumen into value added products  like synthetic crude  We see a very strong growth profile ahead of the company and view it as dirt cheap at this level  We think this is something that people should consider getting into  A more topical story related to the oil patch is a company called Nexen Inc   NXY TSX  NXY NYSE   This is an oil sands company  but it also has assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea  It looks  at this point in time  that it will be acquired by China National Offshore Oil Corporation  or CNOOC  It s waiting for the Canadian federal government to pass judgment on whether or not to permit this takeover  I think it s highly likely that it will be granted  Nexen shareholders just voted 90  in support of the transaction  It comes at a huge 60  premium to the share price  We re recommending that investors tender to this offer  We think it ll get approved because CNOOC will keep all of the staff and make Calgary the headquarters for North American operations  with the stock listed on the TSX  Nexen s asset base is pretty small in Canada  accounting for just about 1  of Canadian oil production  So it shouldn t be opposed by the government  This does show how the industry  overall  is really looking at non traditional sources of capital in order to build up many of its assets  The last group of names falls into the services camp  I mentioned earlier that the services industry is going progressively offshore as producers flock to new frontiers  A couple of names to highlight are Halliburton Co   HAL NYSE  and Schlumberger Ltd   SLB NYSE   They re both big cap names that have been a bit weak through most of the year  but they are starting to show a little bit of life again  Both are underpinned by very strong North American operations with strong growth in the global or offshore portions of their businesses  Lastly a small cap name in that space  Canyon Services Group Inc   FRC TSX   has been one of my best performers in the last year  It s a bit quirky it will go up and down  I would probably wait until it gets below  10 per share to buy again  It s certainly run from  9 14 per share a couple of times over the course of the last year and a half  But it has an excellent valuation  and it s one of the best small oil field services companies out there  This is another name I would recommend  It s a pressure pumper  which is what is used in the fracking process to unleash natural gas  It s acquired a brand new fleet of trucks  The management is well liked and it s paying a dividend as well  If you re worried about the downside  you re getting a current 6  dividend  which is one heck of a good yield for any company  You ve got the best of both worlds growth plus dividend support  As the seasonal pattern for energy evolves  you ll see a nice rally  It ll fade in the summer months and then start rallying again in the fall  I think this is a name that many investors could wade into  possibly at a few dollars cheaper than it is today  They should be well rewarded if they re willing to wait a few months  TER  That s a good one to keep an eye on  So  maybe you can summarize your current outlook for the energy markets and tell us what you think investors ought to be doing here as we move into next year  JS  I expect natural gas prices to remain weak  but look for the turn and for the approval of LNG facilities as your signal to start buying in the space  Gas will have an amazing run once we get some export capability out of North America  Companies like Apache Corp   APA NYSE  are very involved in projects right now  which will be the ultimate future for the gas industry  The oil industry has a floor under the global price of  90 bbl  The key things to keep in mind will be looking for producers who are good at managing the cost side of the business  and are in areas of relatively low geopolitical risk  Many oil companies  and the industry as a whole  is going towards offshore drilling  That benefits  in the longer term  when global growth resumes  Halliburton  Schlumberger  Transocean Ltd   RIG NYSE  RIGN SIX  and even Baker Hughes Inc   BHI NYSE  are the companies that supply the global behemoths with critical services  and will all benefit  These service companies are in demand by the national oil companies  whether they be Saudi Aramco or others  to help them develop  Lastly  North America is increasingly moving towards energy independence  Although we re energy independent on natural gas  we are a long way from being energy independent on oil  but we are moving in that direction  It s years away  but it s a visible trend now  TER  We ll leave it on that optimistic note  John  Until next time  JS  I look forward to that   is a senior vice

38500,260015,SLB,Weighing The Risks In International Oil Plays ,opinion,Explorers and producers need to go where the oil is  But how do you balance resource upside potential with jurisdictional risk  Amin Haque of Stonecap Securities argues that jurisdiction risk isn t a deal breaker if management knows how to mitigate it  In this interview with The Energy Report  Haque shares some companies that meet those criteria  favoring redevelopment plays that avoid exploration risk  Find out which teams are using new technologies to turn proven reserves into economic international projects   The Energy Report  Amin  you started your career in the consumer credit industry  where you were involved in risk management at a major bank  How does that translate to the securities industry   Amin Haque  The company I worked for was MasterCard International Inc   and as director of risk management  my focus was on macroeconomic risk management in international jurisdictions  That gave me a very good foundation for evaluating sovereign  political and currency risks  In my four year career with MasterCard  I focused on countries in Africa  the Middle East  South America  the Caribbean and the Asia Pacific  These are the same regions where many of the exploration and production  E P  companies I m interested in operate  My previous experience is proving quite useful as an oil and gas analyst   TER  When you look at a company  do you consider the jurisdictional risk first   AH  Jurisdictional risk differentiates a company focused in North America from one that operates internationally  For the latter  geology  exploration history and reserves matter as much as they do for a North American company  but equally important considerations are geopolitical or currency risks  These issues affect operations as well as profit repatriation   TER  Do you focus on the downside   AH  No  I try to look at the company as a whole  In the oil and gas business  one has to be an optimist  As an analyst  I try to be a rational optimist  I use risk as a tool to screen management  I make a list of all the jurisdictional risks as I understand them  If management addresses the risks I have identified and they have a program to meet and mitigate those risks  then I feel more confident about the quality of the management   But if the management paints too rosy a picture and glosses over the risks  which seems unrealistic for even a layman like me  then I try to steer away from that company and its team  But I don t always start with the downside   TER  You seem to be concentrating on a theme of oilfield redevelopment   AH  Yes  Of the six companies  four are focused on redevelopment   TER  Do redevelopment projects inherently carry less risk  because reserves in the ground are already established   AH  That would be a fair statement  I play to my strength  I do not have a background in geology or petroleum engineering  I m trained as an electrical engineer  I can relate to the basics of oil and gas science  but I am not an expert   But if you start with a proven reserve that has not been extracted for various reasons  then you have a head start on the companies with exploration risks  where the outcome could be binary  You either find oil or you drill a dry hole for up to  50 million   50M  per well   If you have a proven reserve  then the outcome is not binary  There are risks  There are challenges in extracting the resources  both operational and geopolitical  But if you have competent management in place  then you have the confidence that they ll find ways to meet those challenges  mitigate those risks  extract that oil and find a way to sell it   TER  Is this redevelopment theme dependent on technology that we didn t have a decade ago   AH  That s an absolutely fair statement  With most of these old fields  development success is predicated on applying new technologies and new ideas  We take new technology for granted in North America  but not so in these international jurisdictions   Let me start with examples  Two of my Nigeria focused companies  Oando Energy Resources Inc   OER TSX  and Mart Resources Inc   MMT TSX V   are working mostly on oilfields that were discovered some time ago but have not been fully exploited  Mart has been in West Africa for quite some time  but its latest success was due to its use of three dimensional  3 D  seismic data that was acquired some 15 years ago  It then used new technology to reinterpret it and the company found success  Oando is on the same path  and so are many other Nigeria focused independent E Ps   A company in another part of the world  Azerbaijan  is Greenfields Petroleum Corp   GNF TSX V   Azerbaijan has been producing oil and gas for at least 100 years  The field Greenfields focuses on has been producing at a very marginal level for the last 30 years because operators were still using Soviet era drilling rigs and completion technologies  Greenfields acquired new two  and 3 D seismic data and new ways to model the reservoir  It is also using new drilling technologies  That s how it hopes to find success   TER  Define  marginal field  for me   AH  Different countries have slightly different definitions  Generally  it is a field that has been discovered years ago and may have been producing for some time  But the initial leaseholder  which in most cases is an international oil company of substantial size  does not find it economic for continued development   Therefore  these fields get marginalized and do not receive any new capital expenditure  That s what s happening right now for many fields in Nigeria  for example  Fields are declared marginal under new laws and regulations  and the original discoverer farms it out to  in most cases  a smaller outfit  That smaller company puts in new resources to start producing from it  Marginal fields are economic for smaller E Ps because they operate with a shoestring budget and often introduce new technology  The government gets royalties and taxes  and the original operator gets some farm out royalties  So it s a win win for everyone   TER  It sounds like once the low hanging fruit is gone  it s necessarily going to cost more to drill these wells  Is that fair   AH  It could go both ways  There are many marginal field opportunities like that  If a marginal field is large enough  then from the first well drilled to the  say  fifth or 10th well  the development cost actually declines over time  But when people start hearing about these new  unexplored opportunities  new companies come in and bid up the price for assets   Even if not a marginal field story  let us think about Colombia  for example  About five years ago  Canadian energy companies went into Colombia and found success  More and more companies began flocking in  bidding up the price for new fields  That adds to the cost  That makes it more expensive for even established companies to expand and obtain access to new assets  So that s a challenge   TER  You follow junior E P companies  where investors can hopefully get a large return on their money  Can you give us some of your favorites   AH  Yes  Let me start with Mart Resources  Only recently  the institutional investors have been paying some attention to Mart  In June  the company declared a very generous dividend payment to its shareholders of  0 05 per quarter   TER  Even after the dividend was paid on July 19  the stock still behaved quite well  At times  after a one time dividend  shares fall  But investors have favorably viewed this stock   AH  You re correct  I d like to note that when management declared this dividend  it made a strong statement about its commitment to return of capital to the shareholders  Although it was a one time special dividend  management spoke of continuing special dividends in times of good cash flow   TER  Can the regular  0 05 quarter dividend be sustained   AH  I believe so  despite some of the risks the company faces  Since the end of October  Mart has not been able to produce and pump oil because of pipeline disruption as well as flooding in the Niger Delta area  Losing 15 20 days of production from its only producing field made for a challenging quarter  But Mart has a large stash of cash it can use to pay the dividend as well as continue its development program  In the future  it expects to increase oil sales with the help of a second pipeline  at which point a  0 05 quarterly dividend should not be a big challenge   TER  Does Mart have prospects for increasing its reserves and production   AH  Let me address the production issue first  The field is averaging about 12 500 barrels per day  bbl d   Depending on Mart s entitlement production  the production allocation to Mart goes between 50  and 82  but averages about 65   It has drilled 10 wells so far  but the problem is that the field cannot produce to its maximum capacity   The field has pipeline constraints  Five different producers in the area share the same pipeline  so there is a rationing of pipeline capacity  Unless that restraint is removed  Mart cannot produce to its maximum capacity  which I believe to be on the order of 15 000 barrels per day  15 Mbbl d    The company s management is working on two things to remove the constraints  First  it is negotiating with the pipeline company that it uses right now to expand the capacity  In addition  Mart and its partners  along with other E P companies in the area  are building a second pipeline that will connect to a Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  facility  A second pipeline should do two things provide the company with redundancy and excess capacity  as well as giving it access to a second export terminal  That should allow Mart to significantly increase its production  which I expect to be achieved gradually between the beginning of 2013 through the end of the year   TER  What is it about Mart s management team that impresses you   AH  First  they have done a good job of building relationships in Nigeria  Mart s two partners for the Umusadege field proved to be sound partners  In Nigeria  many joint ventures by international junior and intermediate E Ps have failed because of partnership issues  Secondly  the Umusadege field is one of the few marginal fields that have succeeded  Mart s management has shown that the marginal field is a viable concept and it works   I d also like to make one other point about Nigeria  The country is making some tangible progress in building a corporate culture  in building a civil society  It has created a middle class that s generating its own energy demand  which is good for natural gas production in Nigeria  With increasing demand for electricity  entrepreneurs are looking at natural gas as a source for electricity generation  If smaller E Ps get a chance to sell their natural gas  that s a separate and new revenue stream for them  So the timing is also good for Mart  Oando and other independent junior E Ps   TER  Mart s market cap is now just over  600M  At that market cap  this is a company that now can be owned by mutual funds  Do you expect to see this transition from it being a retail story to an institutional story   AH  Yes  Institutions expect to buy a sizable chunk of shares and the market cap is getting to that level  Also  Mart did not have any institutional coverage before  Institutional investors expect some institutional broker support while they take an interest in a company   TER  Could you talk about another story that you like   AH  Sure  A similar story to Mart  also in Nigeria  is Oando Energy Resources  One risk about Mart is that its production is from a single asset  For Oando  the picture is different  It has interests in nine different blocks  It produces from two  So it s not that dependent on a single field or a couple of fields  It has production and cash flow  At the same time  it has some very lucrative exploration blocks  Its management has worked for Schlumberger Ltd   SLB NYSE  and other international companies  But at the same time  it s a Nigeria based company  so the management team has more appreciation of the issues on the ground   TER  You have a really nice target price with over 100  implied upside from current levels  But I see that 95  of outstanding shares are held by one entity  its parent  Oando Plc  OANDO NSE  OAO JSE    AH  You are correct  But other than Mart  there are not many opportunities to get exposure in Nigeria  Oando will need additional capital to develop these assets  My belief is that it will come to the capital markets  and that will create an opportunity for investors who have interest in Nigeria   TER  As an investor  you re not concerned that 95  of these shares are owned by one entity   AH  I think that should change over the short term  Oando Energy Resources came into being as a spinoff of the upstream assets of the parent company  Oando Plc  The current shareholding structure is a result of how this company became public  through a reverse takeover and through a spinoff of assets  But my strong belief is that that s not the ideal situation for any of the parties involved and that situation is going to change   TER  Is there another story you d like to talk about   AH  I mentioned Greenfields Petroleum earlier  It has assets in Azerbaijan  the Bahar project  where it has a one third interest  An Azerbaijani company holds the remaining two thirds  Azerbaijan is a country that has the longest history of producing oil and gas  But in the middle of the last century  when Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union  all the capital was shifted from Azerbaijan to Western Siberia  so it did not receive any new capital  new ideas  technology  focus or interest   But the resources are there  It was very astute on the part of the Greenfields management to find this particular asset  Greenfields  management team is trying to prove what can be done in an old field using new technology  When you are operating in a country that has not seen the introduction of new energy technologies for over a half a century  you face challenges getting trained people  moving equipment  procuring supplies  etc   The project has been delayed by a year or so  but it looks as if everything is lined up and drilling should start within a couple of weeks  Greenfields should be able to get some good results out of its current drilling program   I would also like to mention that several key people in the management team of Greenfields have worked in Central Asia in Azerbaijan and some of the neighboring countries for over a decade  So management has connections there  They know the country and the people  I would say those relationships and that knowledge are extremely important for any junior E P getting into a lesser known international jurisdiction such as Azerbaijan   TER  Another you might mention if you wish   AH  The last one I d like to mention is Touchstone Exploration Inc   TAB TSX V  TCHSF  OTCPK   It is located in Trinidad and Tobago  which is a country with a very long history of petroleum production  Again  it s a redevelopment story  where production went down in some fields because there was no infusion of new technology or capital   The state oil and gas company  Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd   Petrotrin   owns this concession  Touchstone went into an arrangement called a lease operatorship agreement whereby Petrotrin would still hold the concession but Touchstone would get a percentage of the production when it brings in new capital and increases production  But one major challenge in Trinidad and Tobago is its vast bureaucracy   What I like about Touchstone is its dogged persistence  In the last year  it has faced many challenges  But it still has been able to increase production from 500 bbl d to about 2 Mbbl d currently  Consider that there are thousands of old wells that can be recompleted and brought into production  Even if they contribute 15 20 bbl d  you are talking about a very large level of incremental production at a low cost  That s what Touchstone is targeting   TER  Did you want to mention one more   AH  Another company on my list is New Zealand Energy Corp   NZ TSX V  NZERF OTCQX   For Canadian companies  New Zealand is a comparatively new jurisdiction  There are a couple of Canadian companies active there  New Zealand Energy had some impressive initial successes  It has a large land position right now  The thesis is that it can replicate the initial success in the remaining land base   TER  The stock has suffered over the past six months  It s down about a little bit more than one third  What were the issues that contributed to that   AH  The first three wells were quite successful  but the decline rates were high  So current production has come down  I guess the market is waiting for new wells to start augmenting production   TER  It s been a pleasure  I thank you for taking the time   AH  Thank you  It s been a great pleasure talking to you   Amin Haque joined Stonecap Securities  oil and gas

38539,260054,SLB,Risk Off Move on the Horizon ,opinion,Welcome to the first week of March   probably my favorite month of the year The days are getting longer  and warmer   we ve got daylight savings time coming up at the end of the week  baseball pre season has started  and the March Madness basketball tournaments are just around the corner March is looking like an interesting month for equity traders as stock prices perform their own version of the pick and roll maneuver   On Friday  the broad indices backed off from their recent highs   but the weakness was particularly acute in the S P Smallcap Index which dropped 1 6  This action put the Smallcap Index below a tight consolidation it formed throughout the month of February   and it now looks like the index is stalling out at a key resistance area on a long term chart  If the Smallcaps follow through on Friday s breakdown  it will be a major sentiment shift for speculative traders The prospect of a  risk off  move   with bulls fleeing to the sidelines   has us watching our risk points carefully and looking for opportunities to set up counterbalance trades that will help to offset our current bullish posture   There are a number of key sectors that are either reversing at key resistance points  or have already established bearish trends   The key is finding proper entry points that allow us to set reasonable risk points   and have expectations for a strong reward to risk ratio Below are some of the area s we re tracking for potential trades this week Discount Retailers Stalling Out It s a tough time to be making a living by selling products to budget conscious consumers  Despite the  global economic rebound   the majority of shoppers are still very price sensitive  seeking the best value for their dollar   Over the past two years  we have seen a widening chasm between the  have s   affluent customers with plenty of money to spend  and the  have not s   price sensitive consumers struggling with tight budgets   Retailers who have always catered to the low price consumer did well initially   After all  their target market broadened much faster than the increase in competition  But over the past few quarters  middle of the road retailers have been adjusting their product lines to capture market share from these deep discount retailers  creating a more competitive environment for all  Late in February  we saw a sharp break in Wal Mart  WMT  as the company announced that it was struggling to maintain attractive profit margins   This was a direct result of new competition in the discount retail market  Last week we noted the declining patterns for retail stocks   and put readers on notice for potential short setups in the near future   From our Live Feed  Retailers are realizing that they either need to compete on price or on quality   and it s a lot easier to drop prices than to reinvent brands to a higher quality standard   This means more retailers are cutting prices  and cutting profit margins  in an attempt to capture a bigger slice of the low end consumer demographic  So after two years of broad advancement  we re seeing cracks in the trends for a few key discount retailers   This week  WMT and Family Dollar Stores  FDO  look particularly interesting with short term flag  drift  patterns within the context of larger topping formations     February 27th  2012On Friday  Big Lots Inc   BIG  broke down sharply after reporting fourth quarter earnings that beat estimates  but at the same time issued guidance for lower margins in 2012   As discount chains break down and then consolidate or drift  we should be able to set up numerous short trades in the months ahead For Profit Education   Pressure From All SidesEducation stocks have had more than their share of ups and downs over the past few years   As employment numbers dropped  investors flocked to education companies because they believed that laid off workers would have incentive to beef up their education to qualify for better jobs But the group ran into severe regulatory issues after it came to light that Federal student financing programs were helping students get their degrees   but the degrees were often useless in terms of leading to employment that provides enough income to cover the education costs Taxpayers were paying for defaulted loans  and the Fed began investigating enrollment practices  and graduation rates Over the last few quarters  the group finally got relief as it looked like the regulatory hurdles had been cleared  and new standards for enrollment were in place  But last week  Apollo Group  APOL  dropped a bomb on the sector   warning of lower enrollment due to the new standards Education stocks arre now reversing their 2011 gains and look extremely vulnerable   In addition to the regulatory issues  the most recent employment reports have been encouraging   showing more job growth  Whether you believe the published employment data or not  the perception of a better jobs market may encourage would be students to go ahead and move into the work force  It s certainly something on the mind of investors in the for profit education sector Now that APOL has gapped sharply lower  we re watching names in the group for  drift  patterns  A stock that breaks down suddenly  is likely to continue the pattern as investors look for opportunities to bail out  As traders  we want to see a consolidation first   giving us a chance to short on a continuation move   with a reasonable risk point above the high of the drift pattern Oil Service Stocks Perk UpWith oil prices continuing to hold above  100 per barrel  oil service companies are seeing improvement in their business  After bottoming in the fourth quarter last year  several of these names have set up healthy bases and now sport bullish formations Schlumberger Ltd   SLB  looks particularly interesting after breaking above resistance in February   and now drifting back to key EMA support  The stock has a 1 4  dividend yield  which is attractive in the current  zero rate  policy environment  and analysts expect earnings growth to increase more than 20  both this year and next year A new surge higher would represent an interesting buy opportunity as the breakout would be confirmed   Even in an environment where small caps break down and managers reduce risk  SLB could hold up well based on its defensive characteristics   along with an attractive valuation and dividend yield Last week s fade could embolden the bears and invite short sellers to step back into the fray   Or we could see renewed buying as bulls defend the trend and use the pullback as a buying opportunity This is a tricky spot with plenty of good arguments for both camps  The beauty of the situation for us is that we don t have to hold an allegiance to either side of the argument Using price action as our key indicator  we can dial up the exposure  or cut back  quickly   and we have plenty of great setups for either camp   should one group emerge the clear victor So this week  manage your risk carefully  pay attention to the indicators  and keep an open mind in terms of direction   Opportunities abound for traders who keep their capital intact ,2012-03-06,Mercenary Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/risk-off-move-on-the-horizon-115992,115992

Production revenue fell 2  Y Y and 9  Q Q  primarily due to weaker OneStim revenue as SLB  continued to right size our  hydraulic fracturing capacity by stacking more fleets in the face of  lower demand  
Q4 pre tax operating margin improved 40 bps from the year ago quarter to 12 8   even as U S  crude prices fell from as high as  77 bbl in September 2018 to   63 bbl by year end 2019 
Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow totaled  2 3B and  1 5B  respectively
SLB recorded  456M in various charges during the quarter from items including restructuring in North America and workforce reductions 
 We are confident we have turned the corner  particularly as we have now seen sequential international margin growth for the last three quarters as a result of our discipline and focus on execution performance   CEO Olivier Le Peuch says ",2020-01-17,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pjaj8,2061937

47805,269320,SLB,Slowing U S  oil growth to spark shale buyouts  Schlumberger s Papa says,news,"U S  oil production growth should slow over the next five years  likely causing big companies to  gobble up  smaller shale oil producers  Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  non executive chairman and shale pioneer Mark Papa tells Reuters 
The Energy Information Administration has forecast U S  oil production to increase 1M bbl day this year  but Papa predicts U S  output to grow by just 400K bbl day in 2020 and by 100K 500K bbl day per year through 2025  depending on future oil prices 
 I m not saying U S  shale oil will go away but I m saying it will become a less powerful force as we go through the 2020s than it was in the previous decade   Papa says 
U S  shale producers need a price of  55 bbl to break even  above which they can achieve an adequate return on investment  but generally lower oil prices over the last couple of years has reduced the amount of capital available to the industry  Papa says 
So   what is likely to happen over the next 5 10 years is that some of the smaller companies will    get gobbled up by the majors    Exxon Mobil  Chevron and even BP are becoming bigger in the shale oil business  and probably five years from now those three companies will be even bigger and there will be  fewer  small companies

47813,269328,SLB,5 Oil   Gas Stocks Likely To Surpass Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,The fourth quarter earnings season for  sector kicked off recently with a host of companies expected to release results by this weekend  Notably  extreme volatility in oil and natural gas prices might affect the industry players  fortunes this time around Q4 Report Card  Volatile Oil  Gas RealizationsSo  how does the oil and gas price compare with the year ago valuations Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  WTI prices started the fourth quarter of 2018 at  75 30 per barrel and exited the period at a moderate  45 41  Meanwhile  in 2019  prices were  53 62 a barrel at the onset of the fourth quarter and scaled up to  61 06 at the end of December  reflecting a steady improvement in the fundamentals However  the news is not rosy on the natural gas front In fourth quarter 2018  natural gas prices were  3 09 per MMBtu in the beginning and fell gradually to end December at  2 94 per MMBtu  Coming to 2019  the fuel was trading even lower at  2 28 per MMBtu at the inception of October and struggled throughout the quarter to close at  2 18 per MMBtu The divergent oil and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter cannot conclusively predict the earnings trajectory for the period  Let s take a glance at the scenario to date Picture Thus FarThe latest Earnings Preview indicated that the energy sector s fourth quarter 2019 earnings are expected to have plunged 47 2  from the year ago reported figure  At the same time  the top line is likely to have declined 4 5  Notwithstanding

surges on a positive surprise How to Identify Potential Winners With a multitude of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to select stocks with

swinging to a GAAP quarterly loss for the first time in two years and beating adjusted profit expectations   Oil field services companies steered investors  toward back half of this year  vs  first half  to see the long awaited acceleration of international offshore oil field activity growth   analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said in a note  On Monday  energy stocks were among the worst performers in the U S  markets pullback  with shares of Exxon poised to end at their lowest since October 2010 and extending a losing streak to its straight ninth session   The losses came as oil prices got derailed by fears the coronavirus out of Wuhan  China  would weigh on global economic growth and weaken demand for oil  The pullbacks in oil and natural gas prices have led to a drop around 5  in fourth quarter consensus for oil majors broadly  analysts at JPMorgan said in a note Monday   The market is generally less pessimistic about 2020  but given the more recent drops in oil and natural gas prices  we would not be surprised if consensus expectations for the majors started to reverse  and turn negative  with the prints   they said  Here s what to expect   Earnings  Analysts polled by FactSet expect Exxon to report GAAP earnings of 75 cents a share  which would compare with GAAP earnings of  1 41 a share in the fourth quarter of 2018  Adjusted profit is seen at 46 cents a share  which would compare with  1 29 a share in the year ago period  Estimize  a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy side analysts  fund managers  company executives  academics and others  is expecting earnings of 58 cents a share for Exxon  For Chevron  the FactSet surveyed analysts expect GAAP earnings of  1 51 a share and adjusted earnings of  1 44 a share  which would compare with GAAP and adjusted earnings of  1 95 a share in the fourth quarter of 2018  At Estimize  earnings are expected to come in at  1 56 a share    Revenue  The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect sales of  64 4 billion for Exxon  That would be down from  71 9 billion a year ago  Estimize sees revenue of  68 7 billion for the company  For Chevron  revenue is seen at  38 9 billion  which would be down from  42 3 billion in the year ago quarter  Estimize sees fourth quarter revenue at  38 7 billion   Stock movement  Exxon shares have lost about 9  in the past 12 months  and Chevron shares have lost 2 3   That compares with an advance of 18  for the Dow Jones Industrial Average

71256,292771,SLB,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Halliburton  Kinder Morgan   Baker Hughes Report Q4 Earnings,opinion,It was a week where oil futures hit the lowest levels since Oct 31 and natural gas prices ended below the psychologically important level of  2 On the news front  energy companies Halliburton   NYSE HAL    Kinder Morgan   NYSE KMI   and Baker Hughes   NYSE BKR   reported December quarter earnings Overall  it was a pretty bad week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures suffered a loss of 7 5  to close at  54 19 per barrel  while natural gas prices fell 5 5  for the week to finish at 1 893 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   The crude benchmark fell for the third week in a row on fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would have a severe impact on oil demand  The health scare was enough to offset the impact of U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  The report showed that crude and distillate stockpiles recorded unexpected weekly declines Natural gas also ended sharply lower even as the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected decrease in supplies  The bullish sentiment was overwhelmed by mild winter weather forecasts amid strong production  which led prices to trickle down to their lowest level in more than three and a half years Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1   Halliburton beat the fourth quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings as robust international activity more than offset headwinds in North America  The world s second largest

internally generated cash flow to fund dividend payments  The company expects adjusted EBITDA and DCF for 2020 to be  7 6 billion and  5 1 billion  respectively  For 2020  it expects to spend  2 4 billion on growth developments and joint ventures   Read more  3    Baker Hughes Company has reported fourth quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents primarily due to lower contributions from flexible pipe and surface pressure control businesses However  the bottom line improved marginally from the year ago quarter s adjusted
