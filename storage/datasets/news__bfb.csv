117208,338723,BFb,New tariffs risk turning U S  whiskey sour,news,"By Martinne Geller
 Reuters    American craft distiller Adam Spiegel is bracing for a double shot of pain 
An escalating international trade spat is driving up his equipment costs and threatens to cut into his profit from the bottles he exports to Europe  just as business is booming 
U S  President Donald Trump on June 1 imposed tariffs for aluminum imports from Mexico  Canada and the European Union  As a result  Spiegel expects his bill for recently ordered steel fermentation tanks  worth several hundred thousand dollars  to be  50 000 to  60 000 higher 
Spiegel will also get squeezed by the tariffs the EU announced in retaliation on U S  goods  including whiskey  earlier this week  They could put his roughly 58 pounds   77 83  per bottle of Sonoma Rye and West of Kentucky Bourbon out of reach for some European drinkers unless he swallows some of the cost 
With nearly a quarter of his sales coming in Europe  lowering his prices enough to offset the entire tariff would be too stiff a drink for Spiegel given total revenue only amounts to a few million dollars a year 
 We are not a big company who can absorb such frivolous fluctuations   he said  predicting   American whiskey will get more expensive  
For a graphic  click 
To be sure  Spiegel s business Sonoma Distilling Co of California is a tiny fish in the world of spirits  But the multinationals that dominate the American whiskey industry   worth some  5 billion a year to suppliers and triple that at retail   are facing similar questions about an uncertain business climate with proposed tariffs from the EU  Canada  China and Turkey  and Mexico s own tax on U S  whiskey imports that kicked in earlier this week 
In a letter Thursday to U S  Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross arguing these tariffs  will seriously harm producers   the industry trade group Distilled Spirits Council noted that 46 percent of global U S  spirits and 65 percent of global U S  whiskey exports are either currently facing   or are at risk of facing   retaliatory tariffs 
It requested a meeting with Secretary Ross to discuss the matter further 
Brown Forman  N BFb   the Louisville based home to market leader Jack Daniel s and higher end Woodford Reserve  already started shipping more whiskey to its warehouses overseas ahead of the tariffs  CEO Paul Varga told analysts on Wednesday 
Brown Forman  which also sells tequila and other drinks  generates about half its revenue domestically  a quarter in Europe and a quarter elsewhere 
Beam Suntory  BSI UL   home to bourbons including Jim Beam  Maker s Mark and Knob Creek  is also  making contingency plans to manage through all potential scenarios   spokeswoman Emily York said   We will continue to make our case on both sides of the Atlantic because no one wins in a trade war where consumers  distillery workers  farmers  bartenders and wait staff are among the innocent victims   she said 
Those two companies make about 62 percent of all American whiskey  according to researchers IWSR  Other big players include Heaven Hill   Diageo   L DGE  and  Campari   MI CPRI  
Ninety five percent of bourbon  a major American whiskey style  comes from Kentucky  The Southern state  which helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election  is also the home state of prominent Republican politicians Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul  McConnell has publicly stated his opposition to tariffs 
Kentucky s largest city  Louisville  has benefited from what its mayor Greg Fischer has called  bourbonism   or the convergence of bourbon making and tourism 
Bourbon  which can only come from the United States and is often sweeter than Scotch  has been growing beyond its home state  due in large part to a resurgence of cocktail culture 
Exports grew 43 percent to  1 billion over the past decade  according to the Distilled Spirits Council  About 59 percent of exports went to the EU last year 
To meet rising demand and interest  many whiskey producers are expanding  with the help of last year s massive U S  tax cut that lowered federal excise tax on distillers from  13 50 to  2 70 per gallon for the first 100 000 gallons   but only for two years 
HIGHER PRICES FOR CONSUMERS 
Once the tariffs come into effect  suppliers can choose to swallow the extra cost themselves or they can pass it on to customers  Protecting margins is always a priority  but in this case they risk losing hard earned market share if drinkers pick cheaper brands 
Generally  if the price of a distilled spirit increases 10 percent  sales volume of that spirit falls by about 5 percent  according to Henry Saffer  a researcher with the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York 
Therefore  if bourbon prices rise in the EU  he says people would just  buy cheaper versions of something very similar  
With a recent boom in whiskey  there are more choices than ever   from classic places like Scotland and Ireland  as well as newcomers like Sweden and Australia 
Yet Euromonitor analyst Spiros Malandrakis predicted those alternatives will not see a boost until it becomes obvious that the tariffs are here to stay because suppliers will likely suck it up if the duties are short lived 
Because the U S  has shifted positions in the past  several whiskey executives Reuters spoke with displayed a  wait and see  attitude  hoping that the tension will die down and any tariffs would be temporary 
 It s very hard to predict what will transpire   said Mark Brown  chief executive of Sazerac Co  owner of Kentucky s Buffalo Trace distillery   There isn t going to be any certainty over whether it s going to be a one week spat or a two year spat  
The tariff may be shared all along the supply chain  from producers to importers and distributors to retailers 
But producers such as Brown Forman  whose Jack Daniel s sells for about 23 pounds   30 86  per liter in British supermarkets  tend to have fat profit margins  Its operating margin was 32 percent last year  versus only 16 5 percent for  Unilever   LON ULVR  and 12 percent for Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International  
Joseph Magliocco  president of Michter s Distillery  sees the premium price of his bourbon as insulation  The cheapest version can be found in Britain for around 53 pounds   67 10  
That puts him in prime position to weather the tariff storm  and keep his plans to expand with a new distillery set to open the public in downtown Louisville in September 
 In general if taxes go up  I would think the super premium products will be affected less   Magliocco said  Even though Michter s is available in some 40 countries  international markets are only about 15 percent of sales

117211,338726,BFb,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  August 29 
1  Trade Headlines Remain in Focus
Markets will be watching for more trade related headlines as optimism over the U S  Mexico trade deal gave way to caution ahead of an upcoming deadline in the Sino U S  trade dispute 
In Washington  Canada s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was in talks to preserve a three nation North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  following Monday s deal between the United States and Mexico 
U S  President Donald Trump warned that he could proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with the revised trade terms 
Yet even if Trump were to go with Mexico alone  Congress would have to approve the deal in a process that would take months and put it beyond the mid term elections 
The White House has also said it wants to settle NAFTA before dealing with China  suggesting that trade dispute could run well into 2019 
The deadline for public comment on the Trump administration s increased tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on September 5 
2  U S  Q2 GDP   Second Estimate
Investors will get one of the week s biggest economic reports when the second estimate of second quarter GDP is released at 8 30AM ET 
The data is expected to show that the economy grew at a 4 0  annual rate in the April June quarter  a slight downward revision from a preliminary estimate of 4 1  
That would still be the highest reading since the third quarter of 2014 
The current U S  economic expansion  already the second longest on record  has been given extra fuel in the form of major tax cuts  which will help keep the chances of a major slowdown quite low for the rest of this year 
Besides the GDP report  today s economic calendar also features the July reading on pending home sales  which are forecast to rise 0 3  from the prior month 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was marked modestly higher at 94 75  pulling away from an overnight low of 94 34  which was the weakest level since August 1 
In the bond market  Treasury prices inched higher  pushing yields a tad lower across the curve  The benchmark 10 year yield stood at around 2 87   while the 2 year yield was at 2 66  
3  U S  Stock Futures Point to Another Solid Session
U S  stock index futures ticked higher  suggesting that equities could push even deeper into record territory  as major indexes aim for their fourth straight advance 
The blue chip Dow futures were up 20 points  or around 0 1   at 5 30AM ET  the S P 500 futures tacked on 3 points  or around 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 19 points  or roughly 0 3  
Wall Street ended slightly higher on Tuesday  with both the S P 500 and the Nasdaq closing at records for the third consecutive session 
The day s trading could be light  which is typical for late August  as it serves as the unofficial last week of summer ahead of the Labor Day holiday in the U S 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the region s major bourses were largely unchanged in quiet mid morning trade  with most sectors moving in opposite directions 
Earlier  in Asia  markets in the region ended mixed 
4  Last Wave of Earnings
The second quarter earnings season has all but wound down  however results today are expected from a few notable companies 
Earnings before the opening bell are expected from Brown Forman  NYSE BFb   Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS    American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   and Express  NYSE EXPR

5  EIA s Weekly Oil Supply Report
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended August 24 at 10 30AM ET

U S  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures were up 25 cents at  68 78 a barrel 
International Brent crude oil futures were at  76 50 per barrel  21 cents higher from their last close 
Crude futures were supported by indications of falling supplies from Iran ahead of U S  sanctions  which will start to target its oil industry from November ",2018-08-29,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1590543,1590543
117232,338747,BFb,Consumer Staples Outlook   January 2018,opinion,"Popular as an abode of defensive stocks  the Consumer Staples sector mainly comprises companies that provide essentials and products used in daily lives  Including companies that sell food  beverages  soap and cleaning materials and products related to beauty and personal care among others  the sector is one of the most trusted even when economic conditions are not congenial  Thus  adding stocks from this basket usually lends more stability to investors  portfolio 
Now with the economy looking more stable  the Consumer Staples sector is well poised to reap the benefits  Moreover  the sector remains a lucrative space for income seeking investors  given its strong dividend yield and growth rate 
U S  Economy  The Picture Looks Good
The overall economy appears to be in good shape  driven by an improved labor market  higher consumer spending  rising consumer confidence and increased business investments  This is quite evident from the latest GDP data  which suggests that the U S  economy improved at a better than expected rate in the third quarter  Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the third and final estimate for third quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3 2  
Notably  the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate  The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4 1  in November from 4 8  in January  All these factors have been driving consumer stocks higher  despite disruptions as a result of hurricanes 
Also  the underlying strength in the U S  economy paved the way for a rate hike for the third time this year  The Fed raised its benchmark target by 0 25 points to a range of 1 25 to 1 50  leaving the doors open for three more hikes in 2018  These factors have backed the rise in the major indices this year so far  with the S P 500  Nasdaq and Dow Jones rallying roughly 19 9   15 6  and 25 3   respectively 
Status of Consumer Staples at a Glance
Courtesy of the favorable economic conditions  consumer driven companies appear well placed for the New Year  Additionally  Trump s latest tax policy is likely to provide a big push to consumer goods companies 
Apart from these factors  the sector should continue to gain from focus on innovation  product launches and strategic buyouts  However  many companies in the consumer staples space garner significant revenues from emerging markets  While some emerging markets are witnessing improved trends  exchange rate volatility and other global risks remain threats  Moreover  responsiveness to rising consumer preference for organic products remains a challenge as it creates competitive pressure  price wars and a high promotional environment  thereby posing threats to margins 
Additionally  greater marketing and R D costs  along with volatile input prices remains a concern  Nonetheless  the companies are undertaking aggressive efforts to keep pace with shifting consumer patterns  In this regard  the sector players remain committed to adopting the e commerce mantra  alongside adding organic products to their portfolios  Given all pros and cons  let s see how the Consumer Staples sector is placed

However  this space compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P E for the S P 500 is 21 5 while the median level is 20 1  The Consumer Staples sector s stretched valuation shows that there is only little upside left for the space when compared with the S P 500 market index  Also  the group s Zacks Sector Rank of  14  out of 16   which places it at the bottom 13  of the Zacks Rank sectors  confirms this view

117354,338869,BFb,DEO  Safe 3 2  Dividend Yield In The Alcoholic Beverage Market,opinion,"Diageo  L DGE   N DEO  is a leading player in the alcoholic beverages market  Up until the last few years  the company enjoyed great success 
However  consumer trends have started to shift in DEO s most profitable region   North America  The company has struggled to grow volumes and is now in a bit of a transitional period in an effort to strengthen its long term growth prospects 
For these reasons  the stock appears to be relatively cheap today and offers investors living off dividends in retirement a safe 3 2  dividend yield and mid single digit dividend growth potential 
However  is now the time to buy the stock given some of its challenges 
Business OverviewDEO is the largest producer of spirits in the world and was formed in 1997 after the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan  Some of DEO s leading global brands include Smirnoff   1 spirit brand by volume   Captain Morgan  Guinness  Johnnie Walker   1 spirit brand by value   and Bailey s  By beverage category  scotch  24  of revenue   beer  18    and vodka  12   are DEO s largest categories  see below  
Source  Diageo s 2015 Annual Report
By geography  over 40  of revenue comes from emerging markets  However  the United States  45  of operating profit  and Western Europe generate most of the company s profits today Business AnalysisDEO s key strengths are its global distribution network  products are sold in over 180 countries   well known brands  many have hundreds of years of history behind them   broad portfolio  sells at every price tier of every category   dominant market share  see below   and large marketing budget  spent over  2 3 billion on marketing last fiscal year  
Source  Diageo s 2015 Annual Report
With beer and spirits in its portfolio  DEO s distribution network is massive and would take competitors decades of time and significant cost to replicate  This network allows the company to easily expand sales of its brands across numerous geographies  It also helps the company s efforts to quickly introduce new or acquired products to the market to meet changing consumer preferences 
DEO has also made several strategic moves in recent years to position itself for stronger long term growth and profitability  The previous management team relied on acquiring beverage companies across the spirits  beer  and wine markets 
The company is now taking a more focused approach in an effort to become more efficient  focus on its core strengths  e g  premium spirits   and improve longer term profitability  It has sold off several low return wine businesses and beer brands like Red Stripe  Over 60  of the senior leadership team has also been replaced over the last two years 
Whether or not these changes can restore volume growth in North America remains to be seen  Longer term  DEO s size and strength should help the company adapt to consumers  evolving tastes   through both product innovation and smarter brand marketing 
The company also stands to benefit from growth in emerging markets  43  of sales  as consumers in these regions see their incomes rise and are able to consume more spirits  DEO expects one billion new consumers will be able to afford its brands over the next decade and an additional 800 million consumers will reach levels of income where luxury brands are affordable 
All things considered  DEO seems to have many of the characteristics possessed by some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks   a portfolio of leading brands with hundreds of years of history in some cases  strong and consistent profitability  participation in large and slow changing markets  and a management team focused on the long term Key RisksDEO s stock has been a major disappoint over the last three years  It has compounded at an annual rate of 0 5   significantly lagging the market s 15  annualized return 
Not surprisingly  the company s organic growth rate significantly decelerated over that period of time  coming in at 5  in 2011  6  in 2012  5  in 2013  0 4  in 2014  and 0 0  in 2015 
Growth has slowed for several reasons  Scotch  beer  and premium core brands in North America account for about two thirds of DEO s sales  Sales in this group declined by roughly 2  in fiscal year 2014 and 2015  driving the bulk of DEO s underperformance 
Consumer preferences in the alcohol market have shifted over the last few years  hurting demand in the company s scotch  vodka  and beer categories 
DEO s Smirnoff vodka over expanded into too many flavored varieties  which have seen demand fade  Consumers have instead favored whiskey  tequila  bourbon  and craft spirits  In beer  the rise of new craft brewers has also dented demand for the big brands  Interest in Captain Morgan and scotch has also declined 
As a result of shifting consumer tastes and an increasing number of brand choices  DEO s U S  market share declined every year between 2011 and 2014  and likely 2015 as well   It is challenging to say if  when  and how these trends will evolve over the coming years 
Beyond North America  DEO has also been impacted by China s crackdown on government corruption  which has reduced demand in the company s premium spirits business in Asia  The company even had to write down some of its Chinese assets  Once again  it s difficult to know how long it might take for this situation to play out 
Finally  it s worth nothing that DEO is also under investigation by the Securities Exchange Commission  SEC  for potentially shipping too much inventory to distributors in order to boost near term financial results Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
DEO s dividend Safety Score of 58 suggests that its dividend is safer than most other dividend stocks in the market 
In its most recent fiscal year  DEO s earnings payout ratio was 54   which is a very safe level for such a consistent business 
Longer term  we can see that DEO s EPS payout ratio has remained very stable around 50   indicating that its dividend growth has been driven by earnings growth  A stable payout ratio can also be a sign of a business that generates predictable earnings each year Source  Simply Safe Dividends
DEO s business performed fairly well during the financial crisis  While DEO s sales fell by 15  in 2008  its earnings only decreased by 11   The stock ultimately returned  32  in 2008  modestly outperforming the S P 500  The business appears to be more recession resistant than many other companies because consumers will continue to drink alcoholic beverages in most economic environments Source  Simply Safe Dividends
From a profitability perspective  we can see that DEO has maintained high and stable operating margins  which is often the sign of an economic moat  In this case  DEO s strong brands  pricing power  and economies of scale have helped it maintain excellent margins Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  these same factors have helped DEO generate strong free cash flow every year  Free cash flow generation is very important because it allows a company to comfortably reinvest and return capital to shareholders without the assistance of capital markets Source  Simply Safe Dividends
DEO maintains a lot of debt on its balance sheet relative to its cash on hand  but the strong and stable nature of its cash flow mitigates much of this risk  Morningstar and Fitch have given the company an A  credit rating Source  Simply Safe Dividends
All things considered  we believe DEO s dividend is very safe Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
DEO s dividend Growth Score of 55 is slightly above average  The company s low payout ratio and strong cash flow generation support its score 
DEO has increased its dividend for more than 10 consecutive years  excluding foreign currency fluctuations  and hiked its dividend by 9  during its last fiscal year  While DEO is not a member of the S P 500  disqualifying it from ever being included on the list of U S  dividend aristocrats  we think the company can continue raising its dividend by at least 3 6  per year over the long term 
As seen below  the company s historical dividend growth rate in U S  dollars has been in the mid single digits Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationDEO trades at about 20x forward earnings  which is a meaningful discount compared to beverage companies Brown Forman  N BFb   Forward P E 28 8x   Molson Coors Brewing Company  N TAP   24 6x   and Anheuser Busch  N BUD   25x   The stock s dividend yield is also 3 2   which is meaningfully above its five year average dividend yield of 2 8  
DEO clearly needs to show improving growth trends in its most profitable region  North America  to close the valuation gap 
If the company can get back on track  it looks cheap  A high single digit earnings growth rate wouldn t be out of the question  DEO s 5 year earnings per share compound annual growth rate is 7 5   and would potentially result in an annual total return of about 10  ConclusionDEO is experiencing several challenges at the moment  Some appear to be controllable  e g  better marketing   innovation   management of North American division   while others are more uncertain  e g  consumers shifting away from big brands in favor of craft distilleries  flavored vodka losing share to whiskey and bourbon  strong U S  dollar  
DEO has the marketing budget  brand strength  distribution channels  and global reach to get back on track  but the size of its struggling businesses means that a turnaround could take some time  The SEC s investigation  DEO might have been shipping excess inventory to distributors to boost results  is another mark against the company  but it doesn t necessarily impair the company s long term earnings and dividend growth potential 
Either way  we don t see a rush to jump into the stock despite its stable cash flows and 3 2  dividend yield  However  if DEO traded down below  100  it would be hard not to give it more serious consideration for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio ",2016-01-04,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-safe-3.2-dividend-yield-in-the-alcoholic-beverage-market-378642,378642
117355,338870,BFb,BF B  A Reliable Dividend Aristocrat With Recession Resistant Products,opinion,"Brown Forman  N BFb  owns one of the most iconic alcoholic beverage brands in the world   Jack Daniel s Tennessee Whiskey 
The company has enjoyed substantial growth over its rich operating history  The number of Jack Daniel s cases sold by Brown Forman increased from 600 000 in 1965 to roughly 15 million cases in 2015  and the stock s market cap grew from  110 million to roughly  20 billion over that same time period 
Dividend investors have also enjoyed more than 30 consecutive years of dividend increases from the company  and we expect many more dividend raises in the years to come 
Brown Forman has earned extremely high Dividend Safety  93  and Dividend Growth  87  ratings  and it s certainly a business we would like to consider for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewBrown Forman was founded in 1870 and has built up a portfolio of leading alcohol beverage brands  including Jack Daniel s whiskey and Finlandia vodka 
Spirits account for 95  of the company s sales  with wine representing the remainder of the business  This is a big change in mix compared to 20 years ago when spirits and wine were just 55  and 13  of sales  respectively  the remaining 32  was consumer durables  
By geography  43  of Brown Forman s 2015 sales were generated in the U S   38  in international developed markets  and 19  in emerging markets  The company s products are sold in approximately 160 countries around the world Business AnalysisBrown Forman has built up the biggest American whiskey brand in the world  The company has consistently poured advertising dollars into its Jack Daniel s family of brands to build and maintain strong consumer awareness  During its 2015 fiscal year  Brown Forman invested  437 million in advertising  which represented more than 10  of the company s total revenue 
With an operating history dating back over 100 years and billions of advertising dollars cumulatively spent  Brown Forman has created a loyal following of consumers who have developed a preference for the taste of its whiskeys  This has helped the company consistently raise prices and maintain excellent profit margins 
Maintaining high awareness of the Jack Daniel s brand has helped Brown Forman profitably grow into new categories as well  The company can introduce new products and line extensions that leverage the Jack Daniel s brand to quickly win new business  For example  the company s introduction of Jack Daniel s Tennessee Honey  a flavored whiskey  has generated strong growth the last few years 
Importantly  Brown Forman has built an extensive distribution network that ensures its products are reaching the right customers in the right places  Replicating this network  which reaches roughly 160 countries worldwide  would take competitors decades of time and cost millions of dollars of expenses  When Brown Forman launches a new product  it can plug it into its distribution system to get it on the shelves quickly 
The spirits market is also highly fragmented  According to International Wine   Spirit Research  the top ten biggest spirits companies have less than 20  market share on a volume basis  This fragmentation provides Brown Forman with opportunities to introduce new products and acquire competitors  brands to continue growing 
Growth has not been a problem  According to Brown Forman s 2015 annual report  the Jack Daniel s family of brands has grown volumes at a 7  compound annual growth rate since 1956 
However  the company actively manages its portfolio of brands and is not afraid to divest underperforming ones  Most recently  Brown Forman sold its Southern Comfort and Tuaca Brands for about  544 million 
Brown Forman has the strongest American whiskey brand in the world and has done an excellent job building its brand equity and converting it into growth for many decades  With a continued focus on advertising  new product introductions  and deeper penetration in international markets  Brown Forman has plenty of opportunity to continue talking share in the fragmented spirits market Brown Forman s Key RisksConsumer tastes unexpectedly evolve over time  which can hurt or hamper demand for Brown Forman s products  Most recently  bourbon sales in the U S  have increased by more than 35  over the last five years and by 50  in international markets 
The surge in whiskey sales has certainly served as a driving force behind Brown Forman s business over the last five years  but it s less clear how the next five years will play out  There is risk that the rate of growth slows more than the market expects 
Consumer trends are simply unpredictable  According to Brown Forman s 2015 annual report  American whiskey was a declining category from 1970 to 2010 as consumer tastes moved toward white spirits  Where demand goes from here is anyone s best guess  but Brown Forman s business is concentrated in a single category  which creates concentration risk 
Beyond consumer trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  about 60  of Brown Forman s sales are in markets outside of the U S   and volatility in consumer spending can impact Brown Forman s near term results  However  we believe these are transitory factors that have no bearing on the company s long term earnings power 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that Brown Forman is still largely a family owned business  The company has a dual class share structure  and its board of directors mostly consists of insiders  While creating shareholder value has not been a problem at all for Brown Forman  it s worth keeping the family ties in mind for corporate governance purposes 
Overall  as long as the American whiskey category continues to see growth and Brown Forman continues investing in its Jack Daniel s brand  it s hard to find many fundamental risks with the business Dividend Analysis  Brown FormanWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Brown Forman s dividend payment is extremely safe with a Dividend Safety Score of 93  The company s score is helped by its relatively low payout ratio  which sits at 37  over the last four quarters  As seen below  Brown Forman s payout ratios have historically been around 40   which is extremely healthy for such a steady business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
In addition to its low payout ratios  Brown Forman s Dividend Safety Score is helped by the stable nature of the alcoholic beverage market  As seen below  the company s sales fell by just 4  during the financial crisis  highlighting the non discretionary nature of whiskey  consumers have a craving for whiskey whether times are good or bad   The business has also recorded 5  sales growth in each of the last five fiscal years despite the tepid growth of the global economy Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Thanks in part to the company s steady sales growth  Brown Forman has been a free cash flow machine  The business has generated positive free cash flow in each of the last 10 years and has seen free cash flow per share rise by more than 50  over the same time period  helping fuel its dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Brown Forman has also generated a return on invested capital of at least 19  for more than a decade  Few businesses have demonstrated such strong profitability  and this is usually the sign of an economic moat  In Brown Forman s case  the company benefits from strong pricing power resulting from its branding Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Taking a look at the balance sheet  Brown Forman s debt load has increased recently to fund its  1 billion share repurchase plan  However  the planned divestiture of its Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands will add some cash to the business  and we have already noted the stable free cash flow generation of the company  We think its balance sheet is reasonable given the quality and consistency of the business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Brown Forman s dividend looks extremely safe  The company maintains relatively low payout ratios  sells non discretionary products  generates excellent free cash flow  and maintains a wonderful portfolio of brands Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Brown Forman s Dividend Growth Score of 87 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is better than 87  of all other dividend paying stocks in the market  The company has increased its dividend for over 30 straight years and is a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrat Index 
As seen below  Brown Forman has grown its dividend by about 10  per year over each of the last 3   5   and 10 year periods  Looking even further back  Brown Forman has grown its dividend at an 8  annual rate over the last 30 years  Talk about consistency Source  Simply Safe Dividends
With relatively low payout ratios and booming demand for its Jack Daniel s whiskey  the company s long term dividend growth prospects appear solid  We expect Brown Forman to continue growing its dividend at a high single digit rate for at least the next few years ValuationBrown Forman s stock trades at roughly 28 times forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 1 4   which is approximately in line with its five year average dividend yield of 1 44  
These types of businesses rarely appear cheap due to their strong brand value  stable revenue growth  and global opportunity for expansion  We believe Brown Forman is also rich in price today because it is one of the few large bourbon players left in the market 
According to DealBook  Jim Beam was acquired in early 2014 for a price tag of  13 6 billion  Usually when mergers and acquisitions take place in an industry  the valuations of all companies in the space are lifted on speculation that more consolidation activity could be in the works 
While we believe Brown Forman will continue generating high single digit earnings growth  representing total annual total return potential of 8 10   we can t get ourselves to pull the trigger at 28x earnings 
The strong rise in demand for bourbon and increased M A speculation in recent years have certainly caused the market to raise its expectations for Brown Forman ConclusionBrown Forman is an excellent business with a long runway for growth as it expands its product lines into adjacent categories and reaches into new geographies  The Jack Daniel s whiskey brand is one of the most iconic in the world and plays in a fast growing market segment that will likely see only higher demand over the next decade and beyond 
We can t get ourselves to buy the stock at its current earnings multiple  but this is one of the blue chip dividend stockswe will certainly keep on our watch list ",2016-02-17,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bf.b:-a-reliable-dividend-aristocrat-with-recession-resistant-products-200118644,200118644

117358,338873,BFb,Brown Forman  BF B  Q4 Earnings  What Awaits The Stock ,opinion,"Brown Forman Corporation   the leading producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages  is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on June 7 before market opens  Investors are keen to know whether the company will post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  after missing the same in the preceding quarter  In the trailing four quarters  Brown Forman outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2 3  
Brown Forman  NYSE BFb  Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents for the fourth quarter and  1 73 for fiscal 2017 has remained stable over the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  736 4 million for the upcoming release  Let s now have a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Brown Forman gains strength from its strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands  along with its Jack Daniel s trademark  The company expects to grow on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide  consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits  Its consistent focus on pricing  product innovation and expansion solidify its market position 
However  the company has been battling currency woes for a while now  along with tough economic conditions in emerging markets and soft travel network  These have been hurting its top line which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the past seven quarters  Further  the company anticipates these obstacles along with an uncertain geopolitical environment to linger in fiscal 2017 
Management had earlier projected 3 4  growth in underlying sales and earnings per share in the range of  1 71  1 76 
Also a look at Brown Forman s share price movement in the past three month shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  While shares of the company increased 6 7  in the said time frame  the industry registered growth of 8 6  

What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Brown Forman is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Brown Forman has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 40 cents Although  the company has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP in order to be confident about earnings surprise 
Stocks with Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
MGP Ingredients  Inc    NASDAQ MGPI   has an Earnings ESP of  2 44  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Cott Corporation   NYSE COT   has an Earnings ESP of  6 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Amplify Snack Brands  Inc    NYSE BETR   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

117391,338906,BFb,As Diageo Is Learning  Sometimes You Just Need Tequila,opinion,Sometimes  you just need tequila  It s not really a matter of wanting it  Perhaps it s due to an inner self loathing  or perhaps it has something to do with the naughty fun involved with grabbing a slice of lime off the navel of a perfect stranger at a bar with your teeth  Whatever your reason might be  when you need tequila  you need tequila  Right now  Diageo  DEO   needs tequila  The world s largest seller of premium spirits pulled out of negotiations to buy Jose Cuervo  the world s top selling tequila brand  Diageo currently has a distribution deal in place with Cuervo  but it is scheduled to expire in June of 2013  So  shortly after the next Cinco de Mayo  Diageo is going to find itself without a major tequila brand  For a global conglomerate looking to maintain and expand its presence in promising emerging markets like Mexico  that is distinctly no bueno  Diageo s shares reacted badly to the news  but it is the Berkman family  the owners of the Cuervo brand  that are likely to be the real perdedores here  Cuervo sells a single product tequila that is only popular in Mexico and in the United States  And within the United States  its popularity is limited mostly to margarita cocktails in Tex Mex restaurants and to college frat parties  Demographics are also moving against the fermented cactus juice  The Baby Boomers and my own Generation X moved beyond the tequila drinking stage of their lives years ago  and today s young drunken louts tend to prefer vodka based drinks  What s more  for a mega distiller of Diageo s size  Cuervo was barely a drop in the bucket  accounting for barely 3  of company sales  The bulk of Diageo s business is scotch whisky and vodka  This is a long way of saying that Cuervo needs Diageo more than Diageo needs Cuervo  Still  Diageo s product portfolio is incomplete without a major tequila brand  This has led to speculation that Diageo might make a move on Beam  Inc   BEAM   the maker of its namesake Jim Beam Straight Kentucky Bourbon and of the world s number two tequila by sales  Sauza  I wrote about a possible Diageo Beam merger last month  see  Whiskey Stocks to Burn the Throat   and noted that the possibility of being acquired by Diageo was one of the reasons that Beam and rival Brown Foreman Co  BF B  traded at a premium earnings multiple  But Beam would be a hard acquisition for Diageo to digest  We re talking about a stock with a  10 billion market cap  the Jose Cuervo deal that fell through was reportedly worth only  3 billion   Even for a  74 billion company like Diageo  that s a lot of pesos for tequila market share   If Diageo did decide to make a bid for Beam  tequila wouldn t be the primary motivation  Beam s bourbon brands are far more valuable   Diageo isn t left completely high and dry in the tequila war  It still owns the Don Julio brand  which competes with Patron at the premium level where margins are higher  But with Cuervo slipping away and a Beam merger unlikely at this time  Diageo may simply have to be content with wearing a smaller sombrero for now  Disclaimer  Sizemore Capital is long DEO and BEAM  This article first appeared on  ,2012-12-13,Charles Sizemore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-diageo-is-learning,-sometimes-you-just-need-tequila-147346",147346
117392,338907,BFb,The Great Whiskey Shortage  Do Investors Benefit ,opinion,"I have some truly distressing news to report  We re drinking bourbon  can make it   Thus  unless demand abates or prices rise  we re looking at a whiskey shortage 
As a whiskey lover  this saddens me   But as an investor  it piques my curiosity    Today  we re going to take a look at how a whiskey shortage might affect distiller stocks 
Regrettably for those of us who like to live out the songs that   wrote  there is no quick fix to the whiskey shortage   Distillers can t simply ramp up production to meet demand  In order to legally qualify as  straight bourbon   whiskey has to be aged by at least two years  and higher end bourbons are often aged for a decade or more    For scotch  the aging is generally a lot longer    Diageo   The Ultimate 12  to 18 Year Play   
Making it worse  there is  needed to age the whiskey  which isn t likely to be resolved for another two years   The barrel shortage and the skyrocketing cost of barrels that has resulted have led to a  over the legal definition of Tennessee whiskey 
Under Tennessee law   Tennessee whiskey  must  like bourbon  be aged in a new  charred oak barrel   Diageo  DEO   the world s largest spirits company and the owner of the George Dickel Tennessee whiskey brand  is agitating for a law change that would allow whiskey aged in used barrels to qualify   Brown Forman  BFb   owner of the iconic Jack Daniels brand  views this as close to sacrilege and is lobbying for the definition to remain unchanged 
All of this is being fueled by the surge in popularity of a spirit that  up until very recently  was considered a drink for old men and backwoods rednecks 
My tastes in liquor have always been stodgy and old mannish   I like a good bourbon or scotch  and I could never get into vodka cocktails when they were popular   Unless you re James Bond or a Russian gangster there s just something a little emasculating about being seen in public drinking a clear  flavorless spirit   And let s face it  vodka doesn t complement a cigar well 
I m not sure I like the fact that bearded hipsters have embraced my drinks of choice    But as an investor  I m very interested in how the whiskey shortage looks to benefit the stocks of the major bourbon distillers 
Suntory Beverage   Food Limited
Let s start with Suntory Beverage   Food Limited  STBFY  which recently completed its acquisition of Beam Inc   formerly the purest play on bourbon   Beam was the owner of the eponymous Jim Beam brand  as well as the higher end Maker s Mark and Knob Creek  and the lower end Old Crow  Suntory is Japan s leading spirits company  though most Americans will be unfamiliar with its  brands  such as Yamazaki and Hakushu 
 Note for booze snobs  Japanese whisky like Scotch and Canadian whisky is correctly spelled  whisky   American bourbon  Tennessee whiskey and Irish whiskey are correctly spelled  whiskey   
Suntory s Beam sells more than bourbon its brands include Canadian Club Canadian whiskey  Teacher s scotch whisky  Sauza tequila  and Courvoisier cognac  among others but the Beam empire was first and foremost a bourbon story 
A whiskey shortage should mean better pricing for Suntory s bourbon brands   But unfortunately  this means relatively little for Suntory stock    The Beam acquisition  while accretive to earnings  is small relative to Suntory s size   Beam s sales make up about 12  of the combined entity s sales 
As a general rule  I love booze stocks as long term investments   But Suntory is one that I would recommend avoiding   It relies too heavily on a declining Japanese market  and any stock in Japan is subject to massive macro risk  see  Stay away from Japanese Stocks   
Enjoy Suntory s fine selection of American bourbons  But avoid Suntory stock 
Diageo PLC
Next up is one of my very favorite long term holdings  British based Diageo PLC  the largest and best diversified spirits group in the world 
Diageo recently began marketing its Bulleit Bourbon and Orphan Barrel brand  making it a strong competitor in the small batch  high end segment    Going a little more mainstream  Diageo also markets its George Dickel Tennessee whiskey and its Crown Royal Canadian whisky  which while distinctly not bourbon compete with bourbon among drinkers of sweet North American whiskeys 
Diageo will enjoy fat margins on its new premium bourbons   Of this I have little doubt   Yet  as was the case with Suntory  I don t see this having a big impact on Diageo stock 
Diageo is best known for its Scotch brands  and specifically Johnnie Walker   And even while bourbon is enjoying an American renaissance  most whisky lovers outside of America prefer scotch   North American sales for all of Diageo s products make up only about a third of Diageo s revenues  but emerging markets make up about half 
Bourbon can be found in trendy bars in the developing world   But it is still very much a niche product outside of America  and Diageo s primary focus is on strengthening its scotch brands in these markets 
So  while I love Diageo stock and continue to recommend it for long term investors  I don t see the bourbon whiskey shortage having much of an impact on it 
Brown Forman
The best positioned stock to take advantage of the whiskey shortage is Brown Forman the maker of Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey  the most recognizable name in North American whiskeys   Brown Forman also markets Southern Comfort and a handful of other smaller brands 
At the risk of offending whiskey snobs  Tennessee whiskey and bourbon are almost identical products and both suffer from the same factors causing the shortage   And with Beam now under the Suntory umbrella  Brown Forman is the only stock that can be thought of as even close to a pure play 
Brown Forman is a wildly profitable company owing to its branding power   Its return on equity was an impressive 37 5  in the trailing 12 months  and its operating margins a fat 32 3  
But its current valuation it trades at 31 times earnings makes me pause   At that price  you are implicitly expecting one of two things to happen 
The American whiskey boom continues unabated for years and isn t replaced by something new and trendy 
Brown Forman will be acquired by a larger competitor  think Diageo or Pernod Ricard  PDRDY   
The first assumption is one I d be hesitant to make given the whims of fashion   And the second is even less likely   Brown Forman is family controlled  and in the past the company has very adamant about preserving its independence 
If Brown Forman had a nice correction  I would recommend snapping up its shares   But while we re waiting for that to happen  I might instead suggest enjoying a Jack on the rocks this evening to start your weekend right

117393,338908,BFb,Is There Any Money In Bourbon ,opinion,"Bourbon whiskey lovers rejoice  Production of your poison of choice has risen to levels last seen in the 1970s 
For whiskey to legally meet the definition of  straight bourbon   it must be aged a minimum of two years in new charred oak barrels  and many of the high end  small batch bourbons so popular with the hipster crowd are aged significantly longer  For example  Maker s Mark   one of Suntory s    higher end brands   is usually aged about six years This is definitely good news for bourbon drinkers  As recently as this past May  I reported news that I found to be deeply disturbing    And because bourbon   unlike  say  vodka or gin   has aging requirements  shortages cannot be immediately met by ramping up production 
So  a ramping up of production today is essentially a bet that today s high demand for  traditional  spirits like bourbon is a sustainable trend and not merely a passing fancy of fashionable drinkers  Only time will tell whether this proves to be true  but we ve seen drinks juggernaut Diageo  NYSE DEO  make a similar bet on scotch in recent years  In 2012  Diageo embarked on major five year expansion plan  plowing  1 5 billion into new production facilities in Scotland 
And the aging period for scotch is significantly longer than that of bourbon  Diageo s Johnnie Walker Black Label   a respectable though certainly not spectacular brand   has a minimum aging requirement of 12 years   Diageo  by the way  has also jumped into the bourbon race with its heavily promoted Bulleit Bourbon  
My bet is that the bourbon boom has longer to run  If you recall  the boom in vodka popularity steadily gained ground throughout the 1990s and 2000s  reaching its climax with the success of ultra premium brands like Ketel One and Ciroc  If the past is any guide  the bourbon renaissance is still in the early stages 
The question is  is there any way to profit from it 
The Bourbon Boom
If you ve ever dreamed of turning a moonshine still into a respectable business  this would certainly be the time  Just as microbreweries have become popular eating and drinking establishments  so have microdistilleries  And contrary to popular belief  you don t have to distill your product in the state of Kentucky in order to legally call it bourbon  anywhere in the United States will suffice 
Of course  most of us lack the time  patience  and backwoods credentials to distill our own bourbon  And unfortunately  there aren t too many pure bourbon plays left among alcohol stocks 
The two biggest alcohol stocks for bourbon   Diageo and Suntory   are massive multinational spirits companies  and bourbon makes up a relatively small part of their drinks portfolio  Suntory is the owner of the iconic Jim Beam brand  as well as Maker s Mark  Knob Creek and even the stodgy Old Crow  But collectively  all of Suntory s bourbon brands make up less than 10  of Suntory s current revenues  And Diageo s exposure to bourbon is so small as to be almost nonexistent 
What about indirect investments  such as in barrel makers  or  coopers  for the English majors out there   Unfortunately  most coopers are relatively small and are privately held 
Are There Any Alcohol Stocks Worth Buying 
So  what alcohol stocks are we left with 
At the risk of offending purists  the closest thing to a pure play on  bourbon  would be Brown Forman  NYSE BFb   the maker of the iconic Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey 
I should be clear  Jack Daniels is not bourbon  It s Tennessee Whiskey  But for most drinkers  bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are close enough to be interchangeable  and Tennessee whiskey has enjoyed a healthy boom alongside bourbon over the past decade 
Alas  Brown Forman is a very expensive stock at today s prices  trading hands at more than 30 times trailing earnings and 25 times expected forward earnings 
That s too expensive for my tastes  At  say  20 22 times earnings  I would consider Brown Forman attractive  But at today s prices  your money might be better spent on its whiskey rather than its stock

117394,338909,BFb,Company Notes Digest,opinion,"Each week we read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of our investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  
The Macro Outlook 
We re all watching the market s gyrations
 we are not immune to a further deterioration in the global economy  So  like all I view  we are anxiously watching the market gyrations over the last two weeks  particularly in the emerging markets      Liquor 
There s more uncertainty than there was a couple of weeks ago
 I think it s more the uncertainty around what might occur going forward as a result of just the skittishness that we have seen over the last  I mean  literally week to ten days we are acting a little bit more I think to just the recency of some of these market sell off      Liquor 
It s way too early to tell if there s been any impact on the real economy
 What s going on lately  it s too early to tell  It s too early to read anything into it over the last couple of weeks  We re obviously keeping a very close eye on it  but most of our international buyers are Asian American  been here for generations  not impacted by their home country economy And that buyer seems quite confident and ready and able to buy  But we re obviously  as everyone is  keeping a very close eye on it  But right now it s just too early to tell you much more than that      Homebuilder 
And it s impossible to quantify any impact anyways
 With regard to recent news from China in the same way that it s not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years  It s similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation      Jewelry 
But you can t help but be a little more conservative about how you run your business
 The challenge is   trying to operate that business is  trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that s going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going  So you can t help  but look at that business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out both through the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond  So it just gives us pause      Apparel 
Alternatively  you could just try to tune out the noise
 I would just like to address the fact that there is a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector  And just so you know my perspective  I shut it out because from where I sit across all of our businesses  our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that s out there today and what I see is  I see a consumer who has confidence  I see dollars being spent and I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share  as I look forward and I am very optimistic     Apparel 
But people are concerned about deflation
 We re looking at continued deflationary pressures  as those have mounted as we progress through the year  We re looking at a more challenging macro environment      Grocery 
And deflation makes it hard to drive revenue growth
 the challenge  the biggest challenge we re looking at is  how aggressive to raise prices particularly in a world  as you look out there that is facing extraordinary deflationary pressure in just general terms across a   the ways most economists speak  the biggest concern is deflation  not inflation     Apparel 
On top of that  as we enter the final third of the year hedges are rolling off  which will impact earnings
 The six point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters  as the financial hedges are rolling off      Technology 
International 
The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year
 in the recent months  we have seen mixed economic data and weaker than anticipated growth which led The Bank of Canada to cut interest rates for a second time this year      Bank 
A weak Euro is boosting European tourism
 our Chinese consumer or Asia consumer instead of being in the United States is more so in Europe  And as you   I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month  you could see the tourism boom that s going on there and helping their economy      Apparel 
It may be boosting the whole economy
 Europe  It has gone through some macro issues  but we re actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe  We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is re engaging      Apparel 
For what it s worth  a Chinese Real Estate broker says that the property market is warming up
 As expected the overall Chinese property market started to warm up since the end of March driven in part by the governments loosened credit policies and purchasing restrictions in certain cities  Despite recent Chinese Stock Market volatility the real estate sector has stayed relatively stable so far      Chinese Real Estate Broker 
Financials 
Brokerage firms are probably cleaning up in this environment
 In the equities trading side of the business  it s really just agency trading  We are not really putting capital to work for to offer liquidity  So the equities trading business has actually been as you might imagine reasonably robust especially over the last several days     Bank 
These markets make it harder for high yield companies to issue debt
 I can start with the trading conditions currently  I think starting with fixed income  we are seeing because of the recent market volatility high yield for instance in the U S  new issue flows is down  investment grade credit is steady but down a little bit  and in rates trading I would say it hasn t changed      Bank 
It sounds like mortgage markets have opened up though
 Our buyers remain to be strong  We have on the margin  a few people that struggle to qualify  but overall  we re able to get the vast majority of our people into a mortgage if they want one  We re not seeing any issue at all  really  on a macro sense with qualifying for loans Actually  today  the jumbo rate is below the conforming rate  which is pretty astounding      Homebuilder 
Insurance companies are getting into mortgage underwriting
 We believe we re going to introduce a  for the first time in our history  direct sales to a major insurance company  which will be huge  So   and that also  by the way  is going to open up financing for foreign nationals but to a greater degree than we have today  So  I don t see any issues at the moment in terms of availability or liquidity in either the conforming or the jumbo market      Homebuilder 
America s Car Mart saw an increase in credit losses  but blamed their own execution
 Bottom line results for this quarter were obviously disappointing  Sales were very solid and we re pleased with that aspect  Credit losses however were not  And we re not pleased with our results it is apparent to us that for these stores  this was primarily an execution issue      Used Car Dealer 
Royal Bank of Canada has seen a slight uptick in delinquencies in oil exposed provinces
 Delinquencies remain near historical lows and we have not seen an increase in delinquencies for Canada as a whole but have noticed a slight uptick this quarter in oil exposed provinces  This increase is insignificant at this point and it s too early to say that this is a trend      Bank 
The Texas economy still seems to be holding up though
 Texas  overall  has consistently been a good performer for us  In the second quarter and year to date  it s performed above the chain average for us  So it continues to be one of our best performing regions      Off Price Retail 
Consumer 
A late labor day is making it difficult to get a clean read on consumer spending
 the calendar shift has caused a little angst probably out there with the consumer  only from the standpoint that Labor Day has been pushed back a week  as you know  And most states with schools  they sort of key off of that Labor Day date  So in a lot of cases what we ve seen is that the back to school has been pushed back in the calendar a little bit      Retail 
Poor results from retailers could lead to a more promotional environment
 we expect the retail landscape to be highly promotional during the fall season  especially given the recent results from other retailers mixed results and   actually weak results from the department stores forces us to think that the environment which is already fairly promotional will continue to be pretty promotional in the back half some retailers are going in to fall with high inventory levels       Off Price Retail 
Gap is introducing some fast fashion capabilities to its stores
 For the first time  we will be going to in season open in some of our key product programs and therefore able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units  This is obviously an important capability for us  We are building this across the entire company     Apparel 
Denim may have hit bottom
 we are pretty confident that the Denim cycle has hit bottom and it has been coming back over the last several months      Apparel 
Williams Sonoma is still working out kinks from the port disruption earlier this year
 while the port disruption was extremely difficult  the good news is that  it caused us to reexamine every single element of our supply chain  And we have identified significant opportunities to improve service levels and over time drive down costs      Home Goods 
Technology 
Best Buy sees continued strong demand for consumer electronics
 Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services including appliances and mobile phones is growing  This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by micro factors such as population growth  the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance  home theater  connected homes and health and wearables business  which  we believe  will remain positive catalyst in quarters to come      Electronics Retailer 
The cadence of the Windows 10 rollout posed challenges for PC OEMs
 We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition to Windows 10 on two dimensions  One was a free upgrade that was of course offered  And the second was the very short transition time  which is normally about three months  which was compressed to under one month  And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels  and that will take a little bit of time to flush      Technology 
Materials  Industrials  Energy 
Distressed assets still aren t for sale yet in the energy space
 Well  there will be M As and there will be distressed assets and what have you  I don t see it come right now  it will come and  I think  well we will talk again in the quarter  and nothing will happen now in the quarter      Offshore Driller 
John Deere is expecting farm receipts to be down again next year
 Looking ahead to next year  based on our expectation of above trend yield   above trend line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices  our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016      Farm Equipment 
El Nino could cause some swings in growing conditions around the world
 Keep in mind as we go into 2016  we did have some favorable weather conditions  El Nino actually strengthened through the summer  And that certainly bodes well normally for U S  market or growing areas  But keep in mind that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world      Farm Equipment 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 
The best marketing is a good product
 I feel pretty strongly about which is the best marketing is good product      Apparel 
It s easier to train people than to retrain them
 as everyone knows  retraining can sometimes be more challenging than training     Used Car Dealer 
They call it Mad Money for a reason
 when you re on that show with Jim Cramer  it does get a little crazy at times      Apparel 
When you say you re going to do something  follow through
 our best sales tool is to give a potential company that we want to acquire a list of 10 or 15 names of people from whom we have acquired companies and we say just call them up and ask them  And that s really the best sales tool because they do that and they find out that HEICO does what it says it s going to do  If they promise you something that s exactly what will happen  So that s our formula and it works      Aerospace Parts  ",2015-08-28,Scott Krisiloff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/company-notes-digest-263256,263256
