147716,369232,DDD,Why 3D Systems Stock Just Popped 10 ,news,"What happened
Last week  shares of 3D printer maker 3D Systems  NYSE DDD  enjoyed a big 11  pop on some pretty small beans news    the announcement that a little  edible culinary figures  company would be using its printers to print cake decorations and similar stuff  I have to admit that I was pretty underwhelmed with the announcement  and surprised at investors  reaction to it    but today s news may be more worthy of attention 
On Monday  3D announced that it is teaming up with yet another company    Israel s CollPlant Biotechnologies    to use the former s 3D printers and the latter s  proprietary recombinant human collagen  rhCollagen  BioInk technology  to  jointly develop tissue and scaffold bioprinting processes for third party collaborators    

So what
Yes  you read that right  3D is getting into the business of printing replacement people parts    and this has the potential to turn 3D Systems into a biotech stock  with a biotech stock like valuation  That s plenty of reason to justify  perhaps  the stock s 9 6  surge in share price through 11 15 a m  this morning 
Now what
After all  while financial details of the transaction are scarce  and it s unclear how big this market might be  I d bet good money it s bigger than the market for edible tchotchkes  It s certainly true that what the companies call  an unmet market need for a comprehensive solution to produce tissues and scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications   emphasis added  would seem to offer more monetary potential than an unmet want for more cake decorations 
And given that this is a case where a successful product could literally save lives  I think it s safe to assume there will be customers willing to spend money on that 
After all  you can t take it with you   ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phfv1,2058168
147717,369233,DDD,3D Systems Earnings  4 Things to Watch,news,"3D Systems  NYSE DDD  hasn t yet announced a date for the release of its fourth quarter and full year 2019 results  but it should be during the last week in February  or perhaps one of the first couple days in March 
The 3D printing company is approaching the report on a mixed note  Last quarter  it beat Wall Street s estimates on both the top and bottom lines  However  management provided soft fourth quarter revenue guidance  Following the third quarter release  shares dropped more than 3  in after hours trading  but closed up 8 5  the next day  Apparently  investors felt more positive after they had time to digest the numbers and information shared on the earnings call 
3D Systems stock is coming back strong in 2020 after its poor showing last year  In 2019  shares declined 14   compared to the S P 500 s 31 5  return  In 2020  they ve shot up 30 7  through Jan  22  versus the broader market s 2 9  return 
Here s what to watch in 3D Systems  report 

Key quarterly numbers
Here are the year ago quarter s results  the company s ballpark revenue outlook  and Wall Street s estimates to use as benchmarks 

Data sources  3D Systems and Yahoo  Finance  YOY   year over year   Management said it expected  mid single digit sequential revenue growth   The guidance range listed above represents 4  to 6  growth from the third quarter s revenue 
Last quarter  the company s revenue declined 5 6  year over year  While that s far from the performance investors want to see  that decline was at least less steep than in the second quarter  when it was 10 9   and in the first quarter  when it was 8 4   However  as the table shows  analysts expect the year over year revenue decline to widen sequentially in the fourth quarter  to 9 4   
What ails 3D Systems  In the second quarter earnings release  CEO Vyomesh Joshi attributed the 2019 revenue struggles largely to the  ordering patterns of a large enterprise customer  the delay in shipping factory metals systems as we complete technical enhancements  and weaker macroeconomic conditions in some areas of our market   As for the factory metals systems  on last quarter s earnings call  Joshi said   We are confident that we will ramp up our metal factory system solutions by the end of the first quarter of 2020   
3D printer sales
As always  a main focus should be on 3D printer sales  These sales account for about 20  of the company s total revenue  but they are much more important than that number suggests  That s because they drive sales of  consumables     3D printing materials    which sport high profit margins  
In the third quarter  revenue from sales of 3D printers fell 17 2  year over year to  30 4 million  In the earnings release  the company said the decline was driven by the  timing of large enterprise customer orders and the softer macro industrial environment   For context  in the second and first quarters  3D printer revenue dropped 27  and 29   respectively  year over year 
Material sales 
Investors will want to see the year over year materials growth rate accelerate from last quarter s 2 8   or at the very least not decelerate  While last quarter s growth rate was modest  it was notable since this metric hadn t been positive since the third quarter of 2018  when it was 2  
Management had been strenuously asserting for some time that the materials revenue growth would resume in the second half of 2019    and the company came through last quarter  
Cash flows
In 2019  one of 3D Systems  main focuses was cash generation  Indeed  that s because the company has been eating into the cash on its balance sheet  Its cash hoard was still a solid  127 6 million at the end of the third quarter  but that s down from  157 3 million at the end of the first quarter 
Last quarter  3D Systems generated  6 5 million of cash from operations  which was down from the  18 7 million it generated in the second quarter  Both those results were much better than in the first quarter  when it used  15 2 million of cash in its operations ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plyf4,2066169
147723,369239,DDD,Why 3D Systems  Stock Fell 10  Today,news,"What happened
Shares of 3D printing systems specialist 3D Systems  NYSE DDD  fell as much as 10 3  on Friday before closing the day s trading at a loss of 9 6   The company s president and CEO announced his retirement last night  a move that caught investors by surprise 
So what
CEO Vyomesh Joshi will retire as soon as 3D Systems  board of directors finds a suitable replacement  Even then  Joshi intends to stay connected to the company as a strategic adviser 

Now what
Joshi was brought in as CEO in the spring of 2016  Presented as a visionary with three decades of relevant experience near the top of HP s  NYSE HPQ  printing group  he was tasked with stabilizing a rickety financial structure with stalled sales growth and negative cash profits 
Now he s stepping out after four years at the helm  during which 3D Systems  sales continued to hold steady while free cash flows and EBITDA fell deeper into red ink  This poor performance can be partly pinned on weak industry trends in the 3D printing sector  since archrival Stratasys  NASDAQ SSYS  showed similar financial trends across Joshi s tenure 
In any case  3D Systems struggled over the last four years  and its investors would have been much better off trusting their nest eggs to an index fund tracking the market as a whole  I m not persuaded that Joshi s departure should trigger a 10  haircut for 3D Systems  but that s the market reaction ",2020-02-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psmyo,2079727

147751,369267,DDD,Why 3D Systems Stock Popped 11  This Morning,news,"What happened
Shares of 3D printer maker 3D Systems  NYSE DDD  soared in early trading today  rising nearly 11  before retreating to a gain in the neighborhood of 9 5  as of 12 12 p m  EST  But why 
It wasn t analyst action that drove this stock up  According to StreetInsider com  neither upgrades nor price target hikes were relevant to 3D today  And the company itself hasn t issued any positive press releases  which could have explained the sudden enthusiasm 

So what
So what drove 3D higher  The most likely explanation can be found in the  web  pages of the 3D Printing Industry news  where an article was published yesterday describing how 3D has teamed up with Brill  Inc   according to S P Global Market Intelligence  a subsidiary of Dutch publicly traded company Corbion  to produce a  full color  professional grade culinary 3D printing system known as the Brill 3D Culinary Studio  
Beginning with the systems  first installation this summer  the new Brill 3D Culinary Studio will enable chefs to 3D print  edible culinary figures and embellishments   
Now what
Does this development justify a more than  105 million increase in 3D s market capitalization  Is the market for wedding cake decorations really that big 
Perhaps  But until 3D Systems turns things around financially and begins earning profits after a series of five straight years of losing money  today s price action is more a case of investors grasping at any bit of good news as an excuse to buy back into a stock that s underperformed the S P 500 by a whopping 45 percentage points over the past year  and is therefore looking historically cheap 
Until 3D Systems proves it can earn a profit  no price may be cheap enough to justify buying this stock ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfjhe,2055262

147974,369490,DDD,3D Systems  DDD  Q3 Earnings Match  Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   reported third quarter 2019 non GAAP loss per share of 4 cents against earnings of 2 cents a year ago  The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate This 3D printer maker s revenues of  155 3 million declined 5 6  year over year  However  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  152 million  Modest growth in Materials and Healthcare  led by customer demand for core and new product solutions  was a tailwind for the top line However  weakness in the automotive sector in Europe and China was a major overhang on the company s printer hardware and on demand printing businesses  Further  trade tariffs adversely impacted the company s business in Asia Decline in manufacturing activity and industrial production  which led to an overall fall in customer demand  affected the business Continued headwinds due to ordering patterns of a large enterprise customer and the temporary suspended operations of factory metal systems were an overhang on revenues from the Americas and Asia Pacific Suspended shipments of Powder Management units  due to a technical snag in the same  dented revenues However  the company s efforts to simplify cost structure by lowering headcount and trimming cost of sales and operating expenses were a positive The sale of 3D Systems  entertainment business hurt revenues as well 3D Systems Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarterly Details3D Systems  Healthcare services and simulation revenues increased 6 3  year over year to  56 4 million  Excluding the order of the larger enterprise customer  healthcare revenues grew 15   driven by strong demand for Virtual Surgical Planning  medical simulators and advanced manufacturing The company s on demand manufacturing revenues were down 12  to  23 1 million  Headwind associated with the suspension of federal contracting by the U S  Air Force was a dampener  Softness in demand from automotive customers in Europe was also a downside Printer revenues dropped 17 2  to  41 4 million due to the order timing of a large enterprise customer

148045,369561,DDD,Wall Street Wary Ahead Of 3D Systems Earnings,opinion,"3 D printer maker 3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  will report second quarter earnings after the close this Tuesday  Aug  7  The shares have been on fire in 2018    and are now testing a key level on the charts    yet most of Wall Street remains skeptical of DDD 
3D Systems shares are up 2 3  to trade at  13 15 today  After touching an annual high of  15 94 on July 13  DDD stock pulled back to test the support of the  12 region  which represents a 50  Fibonacci retracement of the equity s rally from its November low of  7 92 to the aforementioned peak  This area is also home to the security s uptrending 160 day moving average  Now  DDD is attempting to establish a floor in the  13 neighborhood    a 38 2  Fibonacci retracement of the same rally  and representing a 50  gain year to date 

On the earnings front  DDD stock last week got a halo lift from sector peer Stratasys  SSYS   which reported stronger than expected quarterly figures  Looking back eight quarters  3D Systems shares have averaged a one day post earnings swing of 11 2   regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a bigger 16 6  swing for DDD stock 
While bought calls have outnumbered puts on an absolute basis in the past two weeks  the stock s 10 day put call volume ratio on the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  of 0 43 is in the 80th percentile of its annual range  This suggests traders have ramped up their DDD put buying relative to call buying ahead of earnings 
Plus  although the stock has rallied more than 30  in the past three months  just one of eight analysts maintains a  buy  rating on DDD  Likewise  the average 12 month price target of  10 represents a discount of 24  to the equity s current perch 
And while short interest has dropped in recent reporting periods  these bearish bets still account for 29  of the security s total available float  At 3D Systems stock s average pace of trading  it would take more than four weeks to repurchase these pessimistic positions

148208,369724,DDD,3D Systems  DDD  Q1 Earnings  What Factors Are At Play ,opinion,"3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   is slated to report first quarter 2017 earnings  before the opening bell on May 3 
3D Systems has an impressive earnings surprise history  having posted three massive beats over the trailing four quarters  Last quarter  it surpassed estimates by 50  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Over the past couple of quarters  3D Systems  healthcare business has proved to be its strongest profit churner  Healthy demand for printers and materials for medical and dental customers has been fuelling growth of this segment  These trends are expected to supplement top line growth of the soon to be reported quarter  In a bid to fortify its healthcare offerings during the first quarter  3D Systems expanded its Virtual Surgical Planning service and rolled out the revolutionary Figure 4 platform 
Further  it announced the acquisition of dental materials provider  Vertex Global Holding B V   which operates under the Vertex and NextDent brands  This apart  3D System s first quarter 2017 top line is expected to benefit from robust demand for production printers  materials and software  Of late  the company has witnessed impressive recovery in production solutions and metals business  This is expected to drive the upcoming results 
Over the past year  3D Systems has been making concerted efforts to improve it quality  reliability and supply chain and has made significant progress  It has improved the cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure  go to market and innovation  and re invested these savings back into key areas  We believe these diligent restructuring efforts will likely boost first quarter profitability 
Despite these positives  3D Systems broader market concerns have thwarted growth of the premium 3D printing company  The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years  Other headwinds  including economic slowdown  inflation  currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries  have also marred the performance of most players in the industry 
In addition  the company s escalating research and development costs  and higher expenses related to IT and go to market initiatives may play a spoilsport for the operating income performance  Moreover  intensifying competition in the industry  rapid technological changes  and alterations in customer requirements and preferences pose as concerns for the upcoming results

148209,369725,DDD,4 Stocks To Watch  CRNT  GIMO  MZOR  NVCR,opinion,"Ceragon  NASDAQ CRNT   one of our favorites  has a beautiful long term chart similar to a lot of low priced stocks we follow closely  It broke out of a falling wedge  pulled back and flagged for a week  I think Monday was a significant day  It popped 21 cents  or 61 4   to 3 57  on 446 146 shares traded on low volume  but it picked up to one of the bigger volumes in the last three or four weeks  More importantly  it took out a resistance zone and may be headed to the 33 75  80 zone  If it gets through that  the next target is 4 25  followed by 5 00  50  It s already four waves up  and the fifth wave could take it up to that zone 
Gigamon Inc   NYSE GIMO   which was looking pretty dire  had a good day on Monday  It was one of our favorites last year when it ran from 20  all the way up to 60  but then it cracked  If formed a long wedge and cracked again  holding near support around 30  and then last week it moved up sharply  On Monday  it popped another 6 20  or 18   to 41 20  on 5 3 million shares traded  So  basically  it moved from 30 30 1 2 all the way up to 41 90 in a week  Even though there is resistance ahead  I think the momentum could carry this into the high 40 s  There may be an entry opportunity perhaps on a pullback  It has 3 9  
Mazor Robotics Ltd   NASDAQ MZOR  has a beautiful chart  jumping 2 71  or 8   to 38 48  on 1 1 million shares traded on Monday  It s four waves up and the fifth wave is underway  It could lead to 43  or even to mid to high 40 s  It has 7 3  
NovoCure Limited  NASDAQ NVCR   one of our swing trades  is finally moving  gaining 70 cents  or 6   to 12 50  on 834 818 shares traded on Monday  The volume was decent  Look for it to run to the 13  14  and ultimately 17 and 18 if it picks up energy

148231,369747,DDD,3D Systems Benefiting From Restructuring   Positive Trends ,opinion,"3D Systems   NYSE DDD   robust healthcare portfolio  strategic partnerships and successful product launches have managed to catch the eye of investors  as year to date  the company s shares have returned over 14 times the Zacks categorized Computer Mini Market industry average of 5 1  

As analysts have maintained a neutral stance toward the stock  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 9 cents over the past couple of months 
Here s highlighting few of the strongest growth drivers of the company that signal bright days ahead 
Factors Fueling Growth
Sturdy demand for production printers  materials and software  as well as healthcare solutions have been acting as key profit churners  Moreover  3D Systems is well on track toward transitioning itself from prototyping to production domain in order to boost profitability  Unveiling products  including the 3DXpert software solution for direct metal 3D printing as well as upgrading the Stereolithography system highlights some of these initiatives 
Currently  the company is focusing on expanding its quickparts services  facilitating channel expansion  developing new products  boosting growth of its healthcare solution and providing integrated 3D platform for customers  In addition  we believe that the company s concerted streamlining actions bode well for operational efficiency in the long run  Changes being implemented in the sales network and lean manufacturing initiatives deployed in the supply chain operations are likely to be conducive to the company s growth 
We perceive that these efforts will significantly reduce 3D Systems  cost of sales  operating expenses as well as generate cost savings  thereby driving growth  This apart  positive industry trends are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum  going forward  According to the research reports of Markets and Markets  the global 3D printing market is projected to grow to  30 2 billion by 2022  reflecting an anticipated compound annual growth rate of 28 5  from 2016 to 2022 
Transition from prototypes to end user products  mass customization  production of complex parts and government investments in 3D printing projects are estimated to stoke the growth of this billion dollar industry  For instance  sectors like automotive  consumer products  government and defense  industrial business machines  education research and others  arts and architecture  are expected to raise demand for 3D printing products 
Apart from this  aerospace and the trillion dollar oil   gas industry are showing a penchant for 3D printing too  that will aid the company s growth in future  Consequently  3D Systems has been making acquisitions to diversify its offerings  add synergistic technology and fortify its domain expertise in operating markets  Encouragingly  the company has already secured an important place in sectors like manufacturing  medical and aerospace  while also pursuing unconventional sectors like food and fashion 
What s Restricting Growth 
Over the past few quarters  3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions that have badly hampered its financial performance  Macroeconomic factors  such as economic slowdown  inflation  currency fluctuations  commodity prices and credit availability  hurt the company s performance 
This apart  the company sells a variety of products  materials and services to a large number of domains  These products  applications and channels involve a range of products with different gross profit margins  vulnerable to substantial quarterly fluctuations  depending upon the mix of product shipments in each quarter  Additionally  introduction of new products or services can likely trigger quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and margins due to manufacturing ramp ups and start up costs 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the same space include Barracuda Networks  Inc    NYSE CUDA    Amdocs Ltd    NASDAQ DOX   and CDK Global  Inc    NASDAQ CDK    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Barracuda Networks is a CA based security and storage solutions provider  The company has a striking earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters  having beaten estimates in each of them  for a remarkable average of 525  
Amdocs is a leading provider of customer care  billing and order management systems for communications and Internet services  The company has a decent earnings history  with an average positive surprise of 2 8   for the trailing four quarters

Commentary And just like that the stock market is back to overbought conditions  This is a scenario that was far from my mind a month ago  I would have said this scenario was inconceivable in the immediate wake of post Brexit woes  But here we are 
 closed with a resounding thunderclap deep into overbought territory  My favorite technical indicator jumped from 68 95  all the way to 78 3  

T2108 makes a convincing surge into overbought territory

T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200 day moving averages  DMAs   got back into the bullish act by returning to a breakout from the  now former  post recession downtrend 

The vast majority of stocks are once again trading above their long term trendlines  Can the rally continue from here this time 

So NOW the breakout of the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   to a fresh all time high looks a LOT more convincing 

The S P 500  SPY  hits a fresh all time high as it tags its upper Bollinger Band  BB 

Except  the market will not let us off the hook so easily  This break out is actually a bit unbalanced 
First of all  the volatility index  the VIX  rallied again to close in the green  It is another very marginal gain  but I am duly noting that support is holding at a point from which the VIX has staged numerous rallies  A sudden rise in volatility while the market is so far aloft typically makes for an unstable mix 

The volatility index  the VIX  is stubbornly holding resistance even as the S P 500s rally continues 

Secondly  the high beta stocks in the S P 500 carried the entire load on this major breakout day  The  low volatility  stocks actually pulled back a bit 
Now  I can understand traders and the like chasing after high beta on a major breakout to all time highs  such stocks promise the biggest and fastest gains when buyers in the market are in  risk on  mode 
However  thinning participation makes for a more vulnerable rally  We have seen this time and again  I am going to keep a close eye on developments here 

The Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  pulled back  0 5  while the rest of the S P 500 soared to a collective new all time high 


The Powershares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB  soared 3 4  to lead the charge to all time highs for the S P 500 
This divergence would be even more stark if SPLV were not pulling back from its own all time high while SPHB remains well off its all time high  SPHB made its last all time high around  35 68 in April  2015  just ahead of the S P 500 s last all time high 
Perhaps an overdue rotation is underway  Regardless  I am fine with SPHB outpacing SPLV  but I do not want to see the two moving in distinctly opposite directions on too many days 
Rounding out some of the usual suspects for assessing the health of a rally are gold  via SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   and iShares Trust   iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE TLT   Both declined and both moves should support the bullish case for stocks if they continue to decline 
I have been bracing for a top in the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD  over and over in the past few months  The post Brexit malaise invalidated the last potential blow off top for GLD  This time around  the  buy gold  sentiment indicator is flashing a much stronger signal that this latest extreme move in gold is due for a notable pullback 

The SPDR Gold Trust  GLD  pulls back from a 28 month high on sizable selling volume 


Google searches for  buy gold  are reaching another monthly peak  This has reliably signaled that an extreme move in GLD is ending or has ended   July data is partial  


Let s not forget that speculators have not been this  net  long gold since at least 2008  Gold has been an extremely crowded trade most weeks since May 
Source  
A pullback in bonds could begin a rush of money out of the  safety  of very low yielding instruments into chasing stocks ever higher  A move out of bonds into high beta stocks would be like a double whammy of risk on behavior 

iShares Trust   iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  gaps down sharply off a furious uptrend  Has the rush for  safety  finally ended 

Rounding out the rush from safety is the current sharp pullback in the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  in the wake of a major party victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  Against several currency pairs  the yen has reversed all its post Brexit gains in the span of just two days  I sold my FXY put options expiring this Friday  I am holding steadfast to the fistful of put options expiring next month 

The CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust  FXY  falls sharply for a second straight day  A retest of support and the 50DMA uptrend seems in the cards 

Like gold  the Japanese yen has not had so much net bullish support from speculators since at least 2008 
In honor of the traditional weights on the stock market  I am coining the term GraVITY  Gold ra VIx Treasuries  or TLT  Yen  Typically  or conventionally  the stronger GRAVITY gets  the more pressure should weigh on the stock market  As I pointed out in a recent T2108 Update  this time around  the stock market has rallied quite happily in the face of stronger GRAVITY  So imagine the lift off possible when GRAVITY is lessening its grip on the market s ankles   I am taking ideas for the  ra  part of GRAVITY   
So the breakout for the S P 500  SPY  is not as clean as I would like but it is still a bullish breakout  My trading call now flips from neutral to bullish  I skip neutral and go straight to bearish  if  once  T2108 drops from overbought conditions  I am managing my wariness over the unbalanced nature of the breakout by honing in on specific breakouts 
Not only could these breakout moves signal the start of a new run up  but also they generate definitive stops  below support   I post some charts below to consider  I did not get a fill on orders for shares and call options on 3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD   I consider Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF  to be my latest big miss 
I made an earlier attempt to play a breakout from the Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze  but I gave up after failing to get my preferred entry price on call options  Finally  I meant to load up on call options and shares of ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  but failed to do so  I am looking to fill up on the next  intraday  dip 

3D Systems  DDD  confirmed 200DMA support with this 50DMA breakout 


Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  may be stuck in the middle of a larger consolidation  but this move above the 50DMA could at least begin a retest of the top of the range 


United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  is a true champ  It broke out to what is essentially a new 52 week high  It is stretched above its upper BB  so a buy on the dips strategy is likely best now 


Cliffs Natural Resources Inc   CLF  resolves a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze to the upside   bigtime  Today s catalyst was a major upgrade from JP Morgan with a  10 50 price target 


If Joy Global  NYSE JOY  can break out to a new 10 month high  the commodity complex must be getting a LOT of support from buyers right now

DDD was downgraded from neutral to underweight  while SSYS was downgraded from overweight to neutral  The main reason for the downgrade is HP Inc  s   NYSE HPQ   increased 3D printing capabilities 
HP announced its plans to sell two 3D printers for business customers exclusively in mid May  Although its core sales have declined in recent years  the company has hedged its bets in its 3D printing division  and appears to be on the right track  HP s lower end 3200 model sells for  132 000  or  155 000 with extra software  while their 4200 model can go for over  200 000 
3D Systems also announced on Monday that their partnership with Mystic Aquarium  ACT Group and middle school students resulted in the creation of a custom fit boot to increase the mobility of a disabled African penguin

148269,369785,DDD,An Investor s Guide To 3D Printing ,opinion,"3D printing is one of the many inventions that will help characterize the innovation of the 21st century  It is a process in which a physical object is made from a digital three dimensional model  In terms of what can be created  the possibilities are as limitless as one s imagination 
So far  3D printing has been used for creating objects such as parts of a human skull  parts of internal organs  a rocket engine injector  and prosthetics  to name a few  It can also be used to make simpler items  such as a soap dish  screw  or a showerhead 
3D printing is still at a very early stage as an industry  with the earliest technology dating back to the late 1980s  Because it is still so new  investors may not yet know much about the companies focused in creating these products  Let s take a look at some of players in the industry that investors can look out for moving forward 
HP Inc    NYSE HPQ  
Although best known for their computers  the Palo Alto  CA based HP also has a rapidly growing printing division  It is the surviving entity of the split of the Hewlett Packard Company into Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and HP Inc 
HP announced its plans to sell two 3D printers exclusively for business customers in mid May  Although its core sales have declined in recent years  the company has hedged its bets in its 3D printing division  and appears to be on the right track  HP s lower end 3200 model sells for  132 000  or  155 000 with extra software  while their 4200 model can go for over  200 000 HP INC Price and EPS Surprise   HP Inc  currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
3D Systems Corp    NYSE DDD  
Based in Rock Hill  SC  DDD offers 3D printers  print materials  on demand parts services  as well as digital design tools  It offers both professional and desktop 3D printers  as well as 3D scanners that can capture images and render them in 3D  Its CubePro printer retails at  4399  and targets a broader audience than HP s current printers 
  DDD stock fell over 9  last week after a downgrade from analysts at Piper Jaffray  an investment bank and asset management firm  The downgrade was largely due to 3D printer demand falling below what was planned in the June quarter 
Still  while analysts have not revised earnings estimates for DDD  they are trending upwards over the next two years  which make it worth keeping an eye on 3D SYSTEMS CORP Price and EPS Surprise   3D Systems currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stratasys Ltd    NASDAQ SSYS   
Based both in Minneapolis  MN and Rehovot  Israel  SSYS manufactures 3D printers and materials that are used by manufacturers to create models and prototypes  The company s products are used in the aerospace  defense  automotive  medical  and business markets  amongst many others 
SSYS was downgraded alongside DDD under the same aforementioned concerns  However  like DDD it has an uptrend in earnings estimates  and has a revised estimate for this fiscal year of   0 16 per share  up from   0 17 60 days ago STRATASYS LTD Price and EPS Surprise   Because the Zacks Rank is based on earnings estimate revisions  SSYS currently sits at a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy     SSYS has notable potential upside 
ExOne Co    NASDAQ XONE  
Based in Irwin  PA  XONE provides 3D printers and printed products to industrial customers  Noticing a trend here    It also offers replacement services as well as training and technical support 
XONE announced on Thursday that it was recently awarded a  1 5 million three year contract with the U S  Middle Defense Agency  MDA   under which it will develop silicon carbide components  The company is still very small  but has a growth style score of  A   reflecting its potential EXONE CO THE Price and EPS Surprise   ExOne currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Based in Friedberg  Germany  VJET provides 3D printers and on demand parts services to industrial and commercial customers  The company operates in two segments  systems and services  It provides products to the aerospace  film and entertainment  art and architecture  engineering and consumer product industries 
VJET is another small company that could be threatened by HP s entry into the industry  but has been given upward earnings estimate revisions for this fiscal year as well as the next one  Current  estimates for this year stand at a loss of  0 21 per share  up from   0 22 60 days ago  while next year s estimates stand at   0 09 compared to   0 13 60 days ago VOXELJET AG ADR Price and EPS Surprise   VJET currently sits at a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Print ETF 
The 3D printing ETF is one was created on July 18th  and is managed by Ark Investment Management LLC  As per the firm s website  the fund seeks to  provide investment results that closely correspond  before fees and expenses  to the performance of the total 3D printing index  
PRNT has exposure to each of the aforementioned firms with weights  in order of appearance  of 5 09   4 57   4 36   4 69   and 4 93  respectively  It will be rebalanced quarterly  and has a weighted average market cap of  18 billion  PRNT has 40 holdings in total 
PRNT does not yet have a Zacks Rank 
Bottom Line
Although still a fledgling industry  the world of 3D printing still has much left to be discovered  According to McKinsey and Co  the 3D printing market could grow from  4 billion in 2014 to as high as  490 billion by 2025  Considering the massive amount of potential it has  investors should watch this industry s movements in the years to come ",2016-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-investor's-guide-to-3d-printing-200143661,200143661
148294,369810,DDD,What Is The Best 3D Printing Stock To Buy This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Earnings season is well underway  and some notable 3D printing stocks have yet to report their quarterly earnings   Optimism is budding for the industry  and uses of the technology are being seen across multiple industries   In fact    NYSE F   has been experimenting with a type of 3D printing for manufacturing purposes  
   As 3D printing builds momentum  what is the best 3D printing stock for your portfolio this earnings season   Below  we outline three popular 3D printing stocks and assess how likely they are to surpass our EPS  earnings per share  consensus estimate when they release their quarterly earnings 
Voxeljet AG   NYSE VJET  
Voxeljet is a small 3D printing company with a market capitalization of just  112 34 million   It serves the automotive  aerospace  film and entertainment  art and architecture  engineering  and consumer product industries   Voxeljet stock is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Voxeljet has seen an unfavorable trend of negative earnings estimate revisions from financial analysts over the last 60 days   In that time frame  there have been four estimate revisions  with all of those being revised lower   Our EPS consensus estimate for this quarter has seen some deterioration over the last 30 days  going from an estimate of   0 10 to   0 11   Our fiscal year EPS consensus  however  has been improving over the last 90 days  going from an estimate of   0 45 to   0 26 
The company has missed our EPS consensus estimate in three of  the last four quarters  missing by an average of  22 33  per quarter over that span of time   VJET is expected to release its earnings on the 10th of May   Below is a chart that shows how VJET s stock price has reacted to earnings beats and misses 

3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD  
3D Systems is a leading provider of 3 D modeling  rapid prototyping  and manufacturing solutions   DDD is the largest stock by market cap in this article at a value of  1 97 billion  It is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
3D  unlike Voxeljet  has seen earnings estimates being revised upwards this quarter   The company has received three earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days  and all of those were revised in the positive direction   This has helped to boost the company s quarterly EPS consensus   Over the last 60 days  our EPS consensus estimate for this quarter has improved  going from   0 05 to   0 01   Our yearly consensus has seen a dramatic improvement over the last two months as well  going from  0 00 to  0 16  
3D Systems has beaten our EPS consensus in two of the last four quarters  but it should be noted that the  by 433  when it released its earnings last quarter   3D Systems reports its earnings on the 5th of May   Below is a graph depicting how 3D s share price has reacted to EPS surprises over the last few years 

Stratasys Ltd   NASDAQ SSYS  
Stratasys is a manufacturer of 3D printers and materials   It has a market cap of about  1 28 billion  and it is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Stratasys has received one positive earnings estimate revision in the last two months for this quarter   Our consensus has increased over that time frame  going from   0 22 to   0 15   Our fiscal year consensus has improved as well  going from   0 56 to   0 21  
It won t be too surprising if the company beats our   0 15 EPS estimate when it releases its earnings on the 9th of May   After all  the company has beaten our earnings consensus in each of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 83 33  per quarter   The graph below shows how correlated Stratasys  share price is with our fiscal year EPS consensus

148304,369820,DDD,3D Systems  DDD  Boosts Bastech s Process   Productivity,opinion,"Leading 3D printer maker 3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   disclosed that its end to end 3D solutions were used to make Bastech s conformal cooling mold making process more efficient and economical 
3D Systems  end to end manufacturing solutions enabled the integration the customized mold design toolsets of Cimatron with ProX DMP 200 s flexibility for constructing complex metal geometries and Geomagic Control for quality inspection  This combination allowed Bastech to reduce overall costs by 16   design time by 70  and cycle time by 14  
These factors lend Bastech a strong competitive advantage by improving its design and manufacturing process in an industry where efficiency  cost and quality are the primary drivers of success 
Bastech chose 3D Systems solutions after conducting two benchmark tests using conformal cooling channels for manufacturing molds  one with 3D Systems  end to end solutions  and the other with conventional processes 
The firm found that using 3D Systems  Cimatron mold making software  Geomagic Control and the ProX DMP 200 3D printer resulted in measurably higher productivity and cost efficiency  It also streamlined the manufacturing process 
Further  compared with traditional methods  Cimatron design and analysis reduced programming and shop time by more than 40 hours 
Thus  the solutions facilitate a more efficient production run for Bastech by enabling faster designing and more efficient and economical molds  further boosting company productivity 
In order to share Bastech s findings from its benchmark testing  3D Systems and Bastech will host a design and manufacturing webinar  They will also discuss how 3D Systems  end to end solutions have the potential to unlock greater efficiency and cut costs 3D SYSTEMS CORP Price

148319,369835,DDD,Stratasys  Here s Why It s Climbing,opinion,"Stratasys  NASDAQ SSYS  is having an incredible day in the market  So naturally  I decided to do a bit of research on the stock to see exactly what was going on  However  I ve got to say  I had to dig for this one  it wasn t very easy to find  Nonetheless  I figured it out  There was great news published that shows that the 3D printing industry is growing in a big way  Today  we ll talk about that news  how it has anything to do with SSYS  how the market is reacting  and what we can expect to see moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
Why SSYS Is Climbing In The Market Today
When searching for news that had to do with Stratasys  I simply couldn t find anything  There has been no recent fundamentally good nor bad news surrounding the company over the past couple of days  Of course  there have been the automated news networks pushing hedge fund numbers trying to take advantage of traffic trends  but when it comes to real  quality news  there was nothing asset specific about SSYS  However  there was good news with regard to the 3D printing industry  3D Systems  NYSE DDD  reported its earnings for the fourth quarter  beating expectations and showing exponential year over year growth 
Now  I know what you may be thinking    What does this have to do with SSYS  Well  on an asset specific level  it has absolutely nothing to do with SSYS  However  on an industry wide level  this news is incredible news  You see  Stratasys reported solid earnings just 11 days ago  Now  3D Systems has done the same  showing exponential growth in year over year revenue and sales  This is a signal that the 3D printing industry is in the midst of a growth spurt  and investors seem to want to get involved 
How The Market Is Reacting To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time we see positive news with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with that company  So naturally  with the good news associated the 3D printing industry as a whole  investors are becoming relatively excited with SSYS  sending the value of the stock upward  Currently  10 40   SSYS is trading at  25 93 per share after a gain of  1 74 per share or 7 19  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See From Stratasys Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Stratasys  The truth is that they make some of the most detailed 3D printers on the market today  The company has made a name for itself with regard to quality and state of the art technology  Now  there are clear signs that the 3D printing industry is growing  and in a big way  With the 3D printing industry growing  it only makes sense the SSYS is going to take a rather large chunk of the pie  Here s the bottom line my friends    SSYS has one of the best products  if not the best product  on the 3D printing playing field  On top of this  they have an incredible management team  great marketing strategies  and a strong overall plan for growth moving forward  Between these aspects  it simply doesn t seem like it would make sense to expect to see anything but growth moving forward  All in all  I m incredibly impressed with what we ve seen from Stratasys and excited for what we can expect to see from SSYS moving forward ",2016-03-14,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stratasys-(ssys)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-climbing-200121530,200121530

The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 03  1 cent below Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  171 41 million  roughly  13 million above the Street
A systemic market drop off coupled with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions have been troubling for 3D Systems and all other 3D printing companies 
Historically  3D Systems has rarely beat the Estimize consensus  trumping EPS estimates a meager 7  of the time 
What was once expected to be the next big thing  3D Systems  DDD  and all other 3D printing companies had another disappointing 2015  3D Systems is coming off a dismal third quarter  posting 94  YoY declines on the bottom line while also missing its sales number  Macroeconomic factors  particularly currency headwinds  have been the biggest hindrance to the company s financial performance  as it generates a large portion of its revenue from international markets  Unfortunately  weaker conditions are expected to persist through 2016 and adversely impact earnings  This should bode poorly for shares  which fell 65 3  in the past 12 months 

This quarter  the Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 03  1 cent below Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  171 41 million  roughly  13 million above the Street  However our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is predicting greater sales gains of  177 48 million  Compared to Q4 2014  this projects as a YoY decline in profitability and sales of 86  and 9   respectively  Historically  3D Systems has rarely beat the Estimize consensus  trumping EPS estimates a meager 7  of the time 

Over the past few quarters  3D systems has encountered a systemic dropoff that has badly hurt its financial performance  For the most part  currency headwinds have made it difficult for the company to produce modest growth  Last quarter  the 3D printer maker reported 9  revenue declines on a year over year basis  Even on a constant currency basis  revenue dipped 3   3D Systems competes in a highly competitive industry where it not only faces pressure from other 3D printing companies but also traditional manufacturers of small plastics Despite its challenges  the company remains focused on expanding through strategic partnerships and entering the healthcare industry  Remarkably  3D systems has very manageable debt and has continued to remain cash flow positive despite the volatile markets ",2016-02-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-3d-systems-hit-rock-bottom-200119672,200119672

148385,369901,DDD,A Hot Market Sector Heading for A Buy  Again,opinion,"Everything in the stock market experiences its own cycle of enthusiasm among investors  And this is especially well illustrated among speculative issues 
There was a time only a few years ago when some of the hottest speculative stocks were in solar energy  Now this small equity universe is still trying to rebuild itself 
And in more recent history  3D printing companies experienced incredible capital gains  only to experience incredible capital losses in what is a commonality among the market s most speculative stocks 
At the end of the day  high flying positions are still real businesses that have to deal with managing their own business conditions and hype among institutional investors 
As an investor  you have to consider both realities the growth an underlying business is experiencing and the enthusiasm the marketplace has for such an enterprise or sector 
Twelve months ago  3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  was trading at  44 00 a share  Then it appreciated to a high of  97 28  before spending most of this year retreating to the  50 00 per share level 
It s only recently that the position broke the  55 00 per share barrier  still sporting a forward price to earnings ratio of approximately 46 
Fervor for speculative stocks definitely diminished at the beginning of this year  and it s part of the cycle that equities perpetually experience 
At the beginning of 2013  the breakout was in large cap blue chips  Institutional investors had just started buying these stocks  and they led the broader market higher 
Then the NASDAQ Composite began to improve and actually took the lead for a while  But even with the Federal Reserve onside  it didn t take too long for big investors to just book some profits  And they did so in the most speculative names  which included biotechnology stocks and initial public offerings  IPOs   
The explosion experienced in 3D printing stocks is both a reflection of genuine business growth and bandwagon fervor among momentum traders 
Stratasys Ltd   NASDAQ SSYS  is worth about the same as 3D Systems currently  The company should produce about 40  in sales growth this year and 25  in 2015  according to current estimates 
It won t be too long before Stratasys crosses the billion dollar mark in annual sales 
But while these are growth companies  stocks like this typically are boom and bust  just like so many technology stocks were in the late 1990s 
The stock market is currently trading off of geopolitical events and global economic news  which it tends to do during the lull between earnings seasons 
Because the broader market is right at its high  I would generally not be buying stocks currently  And this is especially the case regarding the market s most speculative issues 
But this doesn t mean that 3D printing stocks won t move again  All that s required is relative outperformance  which is to say that if a company is able to beat Wall Street financial estimates  these stocks could be on fire again 
I wouldn t buy before second quarter earnings season  but after the numbers  this market is likely going to keep ticking higher

148386,369902,DDD,Tale Of Two Markets  Worst May Not Be Behind Us Yet,opinion,"Last week s market action didn t affect our core health indicators too much  but many of the ancillary indicators I watch suffered some damage  While the market looks healthy on the surface there are enough indicators warning to suggest the worst isn t behind us yet  Currently we have a tale of two markets 
Although our  are positive  most of them have weak enough readings that they could turn negative over the next few weeks  However  this would be very unusual given the fact that many of them turned positive just last week  Generally  when all of them move above zero they stay there for at least two months  Weakness in these indicators will provide significant warning 
Another indicator that is telling two stories is our core measure of risk  It is still showing low perceptions of risk  but just came out of an overbought condition  This often marks the beginning of corrections larger than 10  
Momentum stocks are also acting indecisive  Many of them have had good runs over the past few months  but are correcting sharply  To confuse matters even more  many of them have fallen to moving averages or breakout points that are now providing support  Below are a few charts  along with several others  I ll be watching closely  If they break below current support it will be a warning that more downside is ahead for the general market 
Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU 

SalesForce  NYSE CRM 

3D Systems  NYSE DDD 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
The most sensitive measure of breadth that I follow is the ratio between the S P 500 Equal Weighted Index  SPXEW  and the S P 500 itself  SPX   When this ratio falls below its 20 week moving average it warns of choppiness going forward 
This past week we also saw some damage to junk bonds  SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF  ARCA JNK   which indicates market participants are shying away from risk 
Our sentiment indicators for the S P 500 Index  SPX  from both Twitter and StockTwits issued consolidation warnings on Friday  The rally from 1900 to 1985 on SPX has been met with skepticism from traders on StockTwits and Twitter  As the rally progressed  smoothed sentiment steadily decreased creating a negative divergence from price lasting two months  At the close on Friday  smoothed sentiment broke sharply below a confirming uptrend line that had been in place for over three months  The break of the uptrend line after a negative divergence creates the warning 
Please note this isn t a prediction of a long term top  merely warning that the market has lost support from active traders and investors  Recent warnings have been whipsaws that have been closer to market bottoms than tops  This is similar behavior to other indicators I follow and are a reflection of the willingness of people to buy the slightest dip over the last year or so  Nevertheless  the long term odds from this indicator suggest more decline in price 
Support and resistance levels generated from the Twitter stream remain scarce  Traders are increasingly reluctant to target prices above or below the market  This is a sign of indecision  caution  and waiting  Current levels show 2000 on SPX as resistance and 1925 as support 
Sector sentiment suggests a rotation to safety with defensive sectors showing strength and leading sectors lacking support from the Twitter stream 
Overall sentiment is suggesting more weakness ahead for the market  A consolidation warning was issued this week  traders still won t target higher prices  and sectors are suggesting a rotation to safety 
Conclusion
We have a tale of two markets  Core indicators are still positive  perceptions of risk are still low  and beaten up stocks are currently holding support  Unfortunately  our core measure of risk fell from overbought readings which warns of a correction  junk bonds are weak indicating low tolerance for risk  the S P 500 equal weight index is signalling a rotation to safety  and traders on StockTwits and Twitter aren t supporting the market  
The critical thing to watch in the next few weeks will be if momentum stocks hold current support levels  If they can hold and continue higher they ll push the market up with them  If they start to break down I ll get very concerned ",2014-07-13,Blair Jensen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tale-of-two-markets:-worst-may-not-be-behind-us-yet-219198,219198

148416,369932,DDD,This Sector Might Look Dim  But Future Looks Bright,opinion,"The reckoning that s going on in high valued  former momentum stocks is continuing and if the trend continues  there should be some very good trades to be had 
One sector of the stock market that s been consistently hot until recently has been the 3D printing area  It s recent cooling off is not because these stocks aren t still growing like mad  but that the marketplace decided to book some profits from the group 
3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  has been one of the best performing companies within the sector  The stock is up 10 fold within the last four years  It was up almost 20 fold since the position began breaking down in January 
Stocks like this   strong momentum plays among institutional investors are very much worth following  because they are indicative of the sentiment among big money pools 
The stock broke its 20  and 50 day moving averages in January and has been in a sustained downtrend ever since 
At some point  this position is going to level out and the business is still growing  There s going to be a buy low sell high trade available at some point  But that is the  64 000 question  3D Systems  stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy of 
Very often with these kinds of stocks  expectations  valuations  and  reasonableness  get way ahead of reality  According to the company  business conditions remain strong  But stocks can still go down significantly if the numbers don t beat the hype  and that s exactly what s going on with this position 
The Rock Hill  South Carolina company said its 2014 first quarter revenues grew 45  to  148 million  By any standard  that is exceptional growth   The Street s average estimate was around  145 million  
Management reported across the board comparative quarterly growth in all its operating sectors  3D printer sales were up 53  to  61 0 million  printer materials were up 41  to  40 0 million  services were up 38  to  47 0 million  healthcare sales grew 53  to  22 0 million  and consumer sales were up 150  to  10 0 million 
The company s operating expenses have been climbing and management is investing a lot into new research and development  They ve also been making acquisitions and the first quarter s bottom line got light because of it  Earnings were actually down comparatively to  4 88 million from  5 88 million  the Street wasn t too pleased about that 
But so many corporations aren t investing in new operations  they are returning excess capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases  The only way to create innovation is to spend money  and 3D Systems is doing that 
Many speculative stocks got the wind knocked out of them recently  and it was well deserved   See   I d keep an eye on stocks like 3D Systems near term  as the position s downtrend could very well create an attractive entry point for new positions 
This is still an industry and technology in its infancy  The company has a ton of money in the bank and little debt 
Investor sentiment in stocks sure has changed this year and market leadership is going back to the safer names  3D printing technology is still very much a growth business  and while prices are catching up to reality  future prospects remain excellent

148433,369949,DDD,Sector Detector  Investors Suffering From Acrophobia,opinion,Stocks are inching ever forward  but investors are showing plenty of indecisiveness along the way  They might be suffering from acrophobia fear of heights  Their trepidation is reflected not only in the ongoing price consolidation as the major market averages struggle at long term highs  but also in the extremely low trading volume  The Dow and S P 500 are teetering at 5 year highs  the Nasdaq is at a 12 year high  and the Russell 2000 small caps and the Dow Jones Transportation Average are at all time highs Perhaps investors are busy nursing nosebleeds from the thin air up here  Perhaps they are listening to all the warnings about an imminent correction  Perhaps they have been suffering anxiety about what President Obama might say and did say in his State of the Union address The President s noble vision for the country is one in which a compassionate Federal government arrives like a superhero to right wrongs and alleviate all suffering  Such an ambitious objective is costly and therefore must be financed by taxing the productive elements of society  especially the rich who have obviously plundered and exploited the rest of us and so must be forced to pay their proverbial  fair share  But the true yardstick of a fair and compassionate nation should be how few people need government programs rather than how many are being served and how much assistance is doled out  And history has proven that entitlements foster dependency  It also has proven that the best way to help a struggling populace is not through make work initiatives  government directed training programs  mandated wage levels  and wealth redistribution  but by providing the freedom for people to do what comes naturally in a free society  i e   pursue market driven opportunities  innovate  take risks  hire staff in accordance with business growth  pay market based wages and benefits  and expand wealth In other words  seek first and foremost to encourage the pie to grow rather than focus on how to slice up the current pie in ways that stifle its growth  Rather than arbitrarily deciding who should get less pie and who deserves more pie  let s have more pie for everyone  And no  you can t create enduring economic growth by simply printing money and handing it out through individual and corporate welfare programs Let s look at the charts  Among the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs  Industrial  IYJ  has been particularly strong lately  The S P500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 152 15 as it attempts to break out of its technical consolidation since overcoming tough psychological resistance at 150  Certainly Dow 14 000 also has impacted investor psychology  The 50 day simple moving average continues to hold after crossing bullishly through the 100 day SMA  Oscillators RSI and MACD still have not cycled all the way back down from overbought territory since the year began  and Slow Stochastic is also back in overbought territory after making a brief trip to the neutral line After surpassing 150  SPY tested resistance turned support within a narrow sideways channel that appeared to be the makings of a bull flag continuation pattern  with the uptrend line of support starting from the bottom of the New Year s gap serving as the flagpole  But the top of the sideways channel broke quickly  and now I see what appears to be a bullish rising channel  although not without the indecision reflected by Wednesday s doji  If the bull flag breakout fails  I expect strong support at 150  the convergence of the 50 day SMA and prior resistance at 148  and then the top of the gap at 145 The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 12 98  which is near its 52 week low  No investor fear in sight according to this indicator Overall  whether or not we see a temporary correction  equities remain well positioned to attract investors  I fully expect the S P 500 to ultimately challenge its all time closing high of 1565 By the way  I finally sold the last of my SPY Feb 144 call options at the close on Tuesday in advance of the President s speech  Too much risk to hold into his speech  given expiration this week Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Technology  IYW  stays in the top spot with a slightly lower score of 77  while Financial  IYF  moves back into second place with a score of 75 in its weekly battle with Healthcare  IYH   These three generally have been controlling the top of the sector rankings for a while now  IYW and IYF enjoy the lowest forward P Es  Stocks within IYW also show strong projected growth and solid return ratios  while stocks within IYF have enjoyed the most support from Wall Street analysts in the form of earnings upgrades 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 11  which is slightly improved as Wall Street has let up a bit on its reductions to earnings estimates within the sector  It is joined in the bottom two this week by Utilities  IDU  with a score of 18 as Wall Street suddenly came out with a rash of downgrades in the sector 3  Overall  this week s rankings appear to have moved the needle a little more bullish  after moving somewhat less bullish last week   as defensive sectors Consumer Goods  IYK  and Utilities  IDU  fell somewhat while economically sensitive sectors Financial  IYF   Industrial  IYJ   and Materials  IYM  rose 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the leader on strong market days  scoring 58  while defensive sectors Consumer Goods  IYK  and Utilities  IDU  are the laggards on strong market days  scoring 46  This is only a 12 point range from top to bottom  which continues to indicate high correlation across sectors on those particularly strong market days  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Consumer Goods stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Financial  IYF  and Basic Materials  IYM  are serving as the favorite  safe havens  on weak market days  scoring 49  while Energy  IYE  is the worst during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 39  But there s still only a 10 point range from top to bottom and none are scoring above 50  which indicates high correlation among sectors and across the board selling on particularly weak market days  Energy stocks  which are the leaders on strong market days  have been selling off the most when the market is pulling back  while Materials and Financial stocks have held up the best  relatively speaking 6  Overall  Financial  IYF  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 179  followed by Technology  IYW  at 177  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 106  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Financial  IYF  again has the best score at 104  followed by Materials  IYM  at 103  Consumer Goods  IYK  and Utilities  ID  share the lowest at 92  This indicates that Financial stocks have tended to perform the best in all market conditions These scores represent the view that the Technology and Financial sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Utilities sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYW and IYF include CommVault Systems  CVLT   3D Systems  DDD   Jones Lang LaSalle  JLL   and Portfolio Recovery Associates  PRAA  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts

month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-02-14,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sector-detector:-investors-suffering-from-acrophobia-155294,155294

148435,369951,DDD,Why MagnaChip Semiconductor May Soon Explode Higher,opinion,After a nasty shakeout from a false breakout in mid February  MagnaChip Semiconductor Corp   MX   which IPO d in March 2011  has tightened up nicely above intermediate term support of its 50 day moving average  and is holding above near term support of its 20 day exponential moving average as well Big breakouts are typically preceded by a tightening of price action  which MX is now exhibiting  The recent  false breakout  absorbed overhead supply  which should make it easier for MX to surge higher after it breaks out above the high of its recent range  The technical swing trade setup for MX is shown on the annotated daily chart below Although our stock picking strategy for swing trading is based primarily on technical trend following and market timing  we also incorporate certain elements of the popular and proven CANSLIM model into our stock selection process  although we tweak the indicators to be applicable for shorter holding periods than CANSLIM is intended for   The IBD Relative Strength Ranking for MX is very strong at 92  along with an equally strong EPS  earnings per share  ranking of 94  The earnings and revenues of MX have ramped up over the past three quarters  and the ROE  return on equity  is at an impressive 35   Furthermore  there has been a strong increase in fund sponsorship over the past 7 quarters  signaling that institutions want a piece  Finally  the IBD Industry Group rank is 20 out of 197  stocks in the top 40 groups are ideal buy candidates   As we have mentioned several times in recent weeks  the king of technical analysis is always price action  volume is queen   Therefore  until key leadership groups and stocks in the market start clearly breaking down  our bias must remain on the long side  albeit cautiously   With that in mind  we have added several new individual stock and ETF buy setups  including MX  to our  official  watchlist  Navigating the stock market over the past few weeks has been challenging due to the mixed signals being received by our stock market timing model  However  don t forget that price action is always king  For the moment  the market is holding up and new technical trade setups are emerging  both of which are bullish signs  Although the stock market continues to advance on light volume  it s tough to ignore the fact that chart patterns of many leading stocks still look good  Yes  we have seen a few market leaders break down  such as 3d Systems Corp  DDD  or Ocwen Financial Group  OCN   but the majority of leading individual stocks are still holding above their 50 day moving averages and trending higher  or forming bullish basing patterns  ,2013-03-27,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-magnachip-semiconductor-may-soon-explode-higher-160720,160720
