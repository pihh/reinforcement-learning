23196,244711,RDY,Mylan  MYL  To Pay  30M To Settle SEC Charges For EpiPen ,opinion,"Shares of generic maker Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   were down 2 4  after U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  announced charges against the company in connection with its EpiPen product probe 
The SEC charged Mylan for accounting and disclosure failures relating to a Department of Justice  DOJ  probe into whether the company overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for its largest product  EpiPen  The SEC stated that investors were kept in the dark about EpiPen misclassification and the potential loss the company faced as a result of the pending investigation into the misclassification 
Consequently  Mylan has agreed to pay  30 million as charges for the same 
Per SEC s complaint  the company misclassified EpiPen as a  generic  drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  This led Mylan to pay much lower rebates to the government than what it would have paid if EpiPen had been classified as a  branded  drug  The complaint also states that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  informed Mylan in October 2014 about this misclassification 
Thereafter  the DOJ conducted a civil investigation into whether the company misclassified EpiPen and thereby overcharged the government for the drug s sales to Medicaid patients  The investigation started in November 2014 and continued for nearly two years  During the investigation  DOJ issued multiple subpoenas and investigative demands  rejected Mylan s arguments to close the investigation  and indicated its intent to sue the company if it failed to make a settlement offer  
Moreover  the complaint alleges that Mylan produced documents and other information to DOJ  including potential damage calculations and offers for settlement  The allegations of misclassification and resultant charges further add to Mylan s woes 
The stock has lost 29 6  year to date compared with the  s decline of 7 2  

 
Earlier  there were allegations against Mylan and rival Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   for inflating the prices of generic drugs  Both companies were also accused of obstructing a probe on the same by a few lawmakers 
The going has been tough lately for Mylan  It had previously undertaken a strategic review of its business due to challenging business conditions in North America and pricing pressures  Along with the quarterly results  Mylan announced a merger agreement with Upjohn  Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   off patent branded and generic established medicines business  including Lipitor  Celebrex and Viagra   to create a new global pharmaceutical company  The decision to merge with Upjohn comes as a result of this review 
Zacks Rank and a Stock to Consider
Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank 3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the same space is Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd   NYSE RDY   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Dr  Reddy s earnings estimates have moved up by 37 cents to  2 06 for 2019 over the past 90 days

23223,244738,RDY,Is It Apt To Foray Into The Indian Stock Market   An Analysis,opinion,The Indian stock market has taken a beating ever since the country s new budget was presented  This is predominantly because of the foreign portfolio outflows that the Indian stock market witnessed a sharp sell off  But why the foreign portfolio investors  FPIs  are lowering their equity investments remains a valid question  It s because in the new budget  the tax surcharge on FPIs was increased  which compelled them to turn net sellers of late  Lest we forget  the FPIs had been net buyers in the Indian stock market until June Simultaneously  one may wonder that higher tax surcharge was applicable to the affluent  then how are the FPIs getting affected  The reason for this is that many FPIs are still not registered as a company in India  Instead  they pay their taxes under a taxation concept called Association of Persons  AOP   Needless to say  AOPs are considered individuals per the Indian law  and the new surcharges are therefore pertinent to the FPIs as well What s more disconcerting is that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was yet to drop any hint about withdrawing such a proposal to raise taxes any time soon  In fact  the harsh truth is that this kind of budget proposition isn t boosting economic growth Talking about economic expansion  India s GDP growth rate came in at 6 8  for 2018 19  the slowest growth rate since 2014 15  The automobile sector is now feeling the heat with nearly 2 30 lakh jobs being slashed  The number of unsold houses saw a spurt recently and that doesn t look promising for the real estate sector  To top it all  FMCG companies registered a decrease in volume growth for the second quarter this year  The Reserve Bank of India s  RBI  recent data doesn t present an encouraging picture either  RBI consumer confidence survey exposed a bearish mass sentiment as uncertainty about the general well being prevailed in July with jobs being scarce and economic growth remaining lackluster Another widely known fact is that the Indian economy is in bad shape as it is intermingled with the global economy  A slew of factors has been ailing the global economy of late  which is now on the cusp of a crippling slowdown Nevertheless  it s still not an appropriate hour to shun the Indian stock market now  This is primarily because the market recently soared to its maximum in almost a decade on the expectations of better corporate profits  courtesy of the government slashing the corporate tax rates  Finally  the government of India scrapped the huge surcharge on the capital gains owing to the sale of equity share announced earlier in the budget  Sitharaman announced a 1 45 lakh crore rupee stimulus package in order to pep up the economy that is grappling with slowdown issues  The Finance ministry has trimmed the corporate tax rate to 22  while the new manufacturing organizations will have to pay even a lower corporate tax rate of 15  Prime Minister Narendra Modi added that  the step to cut corporate tax is historic  It will give a great stimulus to  MakeInIndia  attract private investment from across the globe  improve

These Sectors Healthcare  part of the Zacks Medical sector has reported an earnings growth rate of 8 9   Healthcare Providers and Services has been the best industry in this sector with a 23  growth rate  The medical sector has seen growth due to discovery in new drugs and surgery methods  new patents in line and advances in biotechnology The future seems even brighter with an increase in outpatient clinics as they are cost effective and favored for treatment and diagnostics  Moreover  the implementation of Artificial Intelligence  AI  in genetics has opened doors to better treatment

strong consumer confidence  As per U S  Bureau of Labor Services  reading  professional and business services added 160 000 jobs in the second quarter  which shows that the business services sector has expanded Additionally  banks and insurance firms that dominate the financial sector have reported nearly 9  growth rates  A major boost came from retail banking that was fueled by strong borrowing  Revenues and profits from credit cards were high as consumers used credit cards more than debit to purchase and the low interest rates also boosted buying Grab These 5 stocks NowDriven by strong

23279,244794,RDY,Dr  Reddy s  RDY  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  before the market opens  on May 17 
The company s shares have increased 6 1  year to date compared with the  s growth of 2 0  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors in Play
Dr  Reddy s North American generics unit is witnessing pricing pressures since the last few quarters  due to enhanced channel consolidation and increased competitive pressure on sales of some of the key generic products  We do not expect to see any improvement in this negative trend in the upcoming quarterly results 
The U S  generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressures  The ongoing consolidation of customers in the industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volumes  The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs  A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drug makers and distributors 
However  generics sales should continue to improve in the Emerging Markets and India units  Moreover  revenues are expected to continue to rise in the Pharmaceutical Services   Active Ingredients   PSAI   segment  Sales declined in the Proprietary Products and Others segments in the fiscal third quarter and it remains to be seen if the metric improves in the to be reported quarter 
As of Dec 31  2018  Dr  Reddy s had 103 generic filings  100 abbreviated New Drug Applications  ANDAs  and three new drug applications  that are pending FDA approval  Of these ANDAs  59 were Para IV filings and 33 have first to file status  We expect to get more updates on the company s NDA filings during the fourth quarter conference call 
Dr  Reddy s currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd Price and EPS Surprise

Shares of VIVUS have fallen 68 6  in the past six months compared with the  s decline of 15 7  

 
The company remains focused on maximizing the value of and monetizing its legacy products  Qsymia and Stendra  Qsymia sales were lackluster in 2018 due to challenges in the obesity market  Its uptake has been slow due to high out of pocket cost burden for patients as a result of lack of reimbursement for the product 
However  the company remains committed to reimbursement and promotional initiatives to boost sales of the drug  Moreover  settlement of patent litigations with Teva   NYSE TEVA   and Dr  Reddy s   NYSE RDY   in 2017 has pushed back generic competition to late 2024 
Early last year  the company had announced its intentions to build a portfolio of commercial drugs with positive cash flow  In May 2018  the company acquired a cash flow positive drug  Pancreaze  as part of the strategy from Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    The acquisition has been encouraging as the drug had a strong contribution to the company s topline in three months ending September  its first full quarter after acquisition

23375,244890,RDY,Akorn  AKRX  Gets FDA Warning Letter For Illinois Facility,opinion,"Troubled generic maker  Akorn  Inc    NASDAQ AKRX   announced the receipt of a warning letter  dated Jan  4  from the FDA related to an inspection of its Decatur  IL manufacturing facility in April and May of 2018 
The company will respond to the FDA letter within 15 working days 
Akorn shares have crashed 89 7  in the past twelve months compared with the 21 8  decline for the  

 
Shares have taken a beating as the company s proposed merger with Fresenius Kabi AG has run into troubled waters  We remind investors that Akorn entered into a merger agreement with German entity Fresenius in April 2017  In July 2017  the company s shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement 
However  in April 2018  Fresenius decided to terminate the merger agreement  primarily due to Akorn s failure to fulfil several closing conditions  Fresenius cited material breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to operations found  during the former s independent investigation 
The latter had filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for breach of contract and declaratory judgment  Thereafter  in October 2018  the Court of Chancery issued an opinion  denying Akorn s claims for relief  The Court concluded saying Fresenius had validly terminated the merger agreement 
The woes do not seem to end for Akorn  Thereafter  Akorn stated that it will move forward and rebuild shareholder value as an independent company  following the disappointing decision from the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware upholding the lower court s decision to allow Fresenius Kabi AG to terminate the April 2017 merger agreement 
CEO Raj Rai decided to retire following the failure of the merger  Last month  Douglas S  Boothe was named the new president and CEO effective Jan 1  2019

23376,244891,RDY,Dr  Reddy s  RDY  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2019 results  before market opens  on Feb 1 
Dr  Reddy s shares have increased 4  in the past year  against the  s decline of 19 8  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Dr  Reddy s North America base business is witnessing pricing pressures since the last few quarters  due to enhanced channel consolidation and increased competitive pressure on sales of some of its key generic products  We do not expect to see any improvement in this negative trend in the upcoming quarter s results 
The U S  generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressures  The ongoing consolidation of customers in the industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume  The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs  A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drug makers and distributors 
Moreover  the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs  which means more competition  increased price cuts and decreased volumes  The pricing and competitive pressures are expected to continue in 2019 
However  the Global Generics segment is expected to improve  driven by growth in the emerging markets and India  Revenues from the Pharmaceutical Services   Active Ingredients   PSAI    and Proprietary Products and Others segments are also expected to rise in the third quarter 
Dr  Reddy s also launched few generics in the quarter  The company launched the generic version of Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Strattera in the United States  It also launched Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole capsules  a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Aggrenox  aspirin and extended release dipyridamole  capsules 
Dr  Reddy s also launched the therapeutic equivalent generic version of Renvela  sevelamer carbonate  for Oral Suspension  These should add to revenues of the company in the to be reported quarter 
Dr  Reddy s currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

23415,244930,RDY,Bet On These 5 Low Beta Stocks To Fight Market Volatility  ,opinion,There is a common misconception that only risky stocks can prove rewarding  Notably  those securities generate handsome returns only when the market is bullish However  there are investment strategies that show that low beta stocks also generate high returns if some parameters are considered Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months Here are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill Headquartered in New Albany  OH  Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   is among the top tier retailers with specific and premium apparel for children  women and men  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 88 6   In fiscal 2018  the stock will likely see earnings growth of 40  Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY    headquartered in Hyderabad  India  is the provider of innovative medicines at affordable rates  We expect Dr  Reddy s Laboratories to see earnings growth of 40 6  and 50  in fiscal 2019 and 2020  respectively Headquartered in Durham  NC  Cree  Inc    NASDAQ CREE   is among the leading providers of semiconductor products  For fiscal 2019 and 2020  the stock will likely post earnings growth of 284 2  and 74 3   respectively Otter Tail Corporation   NASDAQ OTTR    headquartered in Fergus Falls  MN  is primarily involved in businesses related to manufacturing and electric utility  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 18 6   For 2018 and 2019  the stock will likely see earnings growth of 10 2  and 2 4  Employing its high speed network Shenandoah Telecommunications Co   NASDAQ SHEN     headquartered in Edinburg  VA   is primarily engaged in providing communications services  The stock posted an average positive earnings surprise of 86 7  for the past four quarters  We expect the stock to post earnings growth of 250  and 50 9  in 2018 and 2019  respectively  You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading  Further  you can also create your own strategies and test them first before taking the investment plunge The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   ,2018-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bet-on-these-5-lowbeta-stocks-to-fight-market-volatility-200368176,200368176
23416,244931,RDY,Lilly Wins Favorable Ruling From U S  Court In Alimta Row,opinion,Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY   has received a favorable ruling from a U S  district court in a patent dispute against India s generic drugmaker Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Limited   NYSE RDY    The case was related to the vitamin regimen patent on Lilly s key cancer drug  Alimta  pemetrexed disodium  The U S  District Court for the Southern District of Indiana validated Alimta vitamin regimen patent  stating that it would be infringed by Dr Reddy s proposed generic products  which are alternative salt forms of pemetrexed Concurrently  Lilly also informed that earlier this month  the district court also ruled in its favor in a lawsuit against Hospira  a subsidiary of Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE    The court denied Hospira s motion for summary judgement and instead  granted Lilly s cross motion for summary judgement Although the compound patent covering Alimta in the United States expired in January 2017  the vitamin regimen patent will remain valid till May 2022  if Alimta s patent is ultimately upheld through all the remaining challenges   The compound patent already expired across major European countries and Japan in Dec 2015 Other than Hospira and Dr Reddy s  several other generic manufacturers including Teva   NYSE TEVA   and Sandoz are seeking approvals in the United States for marketing generic forms of Alimta prior to the expiration of its vitamin regimen patents  We remind investors that last October  the U S  Patent and Trademark Office had validated the Alimta vitamin regimen The latest wins against Hospira and Dr Reddy s means these companies can launch their generic versions of Alimta only after the patent expires  However  both companies are expected to appeal against the district court s decision Notably  Alimta is one of the top revenue grossers at Lilly and a longer commercial life for Alimta would provide top line support as several products in Lilly s portfolio are already facing patent expiration The entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid decline in revenues for the product In first quarter 2018  Alimta sales rose 2  to  499 6 million as higher sales in the United States offset sales decline in the international markets  Outside the United States  the sales of this cancer drug are being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries as well as competitive pressure  Its U S  sales are also being affected by an increased competition due to the entry of immuno oncology agents in the market  The favourable patent decision lowers the chances of a generic competition for Alimta before patent expiration  which could have hampered its sales more Year to date  shares of Lilly have risen 2  against the  s decline of 4 4   Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lilly-wins-favorable-ruling-from-us-court-in-alimta-row-200327611,200327611

23457,244972,RDY,Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day Dr  Reddy   s Laboratories  Dillard   s  Facebook  Netflix And Amazon,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 27  2018    Dr  Reddy s Laboratories   NYSE RDY   as the Bull of the Day  Dillard s Inc   NYSE DDS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and Amazon Prime   NASDAQ AMZN   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Obviously  the last three months have been brutal for equity investors  Fears about interest rates  the yield curve  trade wars  budget impasses  Brexit  and a host of other concerns have conspired to take almost all stocks lower   in many cases sharply lower Blue chips  tech stocks  small caps  and even the usually defensive sectors like heath care and consumer staples have all been sold off broadly   It s hard to find a stock that has even managed to keep its head above water as uneasiness turned to fear and then to panic Not all stocks have been battered  though Since the S P 500 began the steep decline at the beginning of October that has taken that broad market index down 20   Dr  Reddy s Laboratories has actually gained almost 12  An Admirable Mission That s Also ProfitableFounded by a scientist who recognized that life saving medications were often too expensive for a large portion of the world s population  Dr  Reddy s goal was to accelerate access to affordable and innovative medicines for as many people as possible  The realization of that goal is a state of the art research facility  employing 800 research scientists as well as extensive support personnel and with several strategic partnerships RDY s business is fully vertically integrated  offering products and services at all levels of the pharmaceutical supply chain   starting materials  intermediates  active ingredients and finished dosages  Their research encompasses cancer  diabetes  cardiovascular disease  inflammation and bacterial infection  serving the world markets  focusing on India  the US  Europe and Russia The company is divided into three units  Pharmaceutical Services and Active ingredients  Global Generics and Proprietary Products Experience in navigating the various regulatory requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which they operate allows them to be first to market with in demand and life saving medications all around the world  In their most recent report to investors  the company lists  Actively work with the regulatory agencies for accelerating the new product approvals  as one of its key priorities Earlier in December  Dr  Reddy s won an important decision in US Federal Circuit court that will allow it to sell its generic version of Suboxone  which is widely prescribed to treat opioid use disorder   a potentially enormous market for RDY as that epidemic continues to grow in the US  and also potentially a life saver for those who are afflicted FinancialsHaving earned  1 01 share in FY 2018  future estimates are on the rise for RDY  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY 2019 currently at  1 42 share   an increase of 40   Estimates for FY 2020 show even stronger growth  up another 50  to  2 13 share Dr  Reddy s Laboratories is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Though it currently trades at a forward P E ratio of 26X  which is a premium to the Drug Industry average of 19X  RDY s strong balance sheet boasts a debt equity ratio of just 21   well below the industry average of 66   potentially allowing the company to make strategic investments and or acquisitions that might not be feasible for the competition Even when the market looks dark for almost all stocks  there are still some shining stars out there  and Dr  Reddy s Laboratories has certainly been one of them  Through the good and bad periods for the equity markets in 2018  it s been an especially interesting environment for retail stocks  In many cases  it has been feast or famine with some spectacular success stories and some real duds Lululemon and Restoration Hardware are both still showing outstanding 2018 gains even in a weak overall market  and Macy s and Kohl s Stores are certainly holding their own as well  with double digit YTD returns that look awfully good compared to an 11  loss in the S P 500 Dillard s Inc is unfortunately one of the retailers that has not fared nearly as well and analyst estimates going forward are not optimistic about an imminent turnaround Dillard s finds itself in an uncomfortable position in the retail space  not high end enough in terms of brand cache to command premium margins  yet with its goods not inexpensive enough to attract the more budget minded customers Third quarter results at DDS showed an increase of 3  in same store sales   typically a good sign for retailers  yet net earnings were only  0 27 share  well below the  0 50 they posted in net earnings in the same quarter in 2017 and badly missing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate of  0 56 share CEO William T  Dillard II explained   While we are encouraged by our 3  comparable sales performance  this was a disappointing quarter as markdowns weighed heavily on gross margin  particularly in the first month  Basically  increased sales numbers don t matter much if you have to drop prices to achieve them Shares of DDS are nearly 40  off of their 52 week highs reached in June After the big miss  analysts began revising their full year earnings forecasts downward and the consensus has fallen from  6 48 share 60 days ago  to  5 73 share currently The consensus estimate for 2020 has fallen by a similar percentage  from  6 03 share to  5 42 share  Additional content Citron Turns Bullish  Buy Facebook  FB  in 2019 Shares of Facebook surged over 8  Wednesday after Citron Research and Andrew Left raised their price target for the embattled social media powerhouse  citing Facebook s long term appeal  So the question is should investors buy Facebook stock on the dip as we inch closer to 2019 CitronWell known short seller Andrew Left of Citron thinks that Facebook stock could reach  160 per share in 2019  The firm pointed out that the company s user data and privacy scandals have had little impact on Facebook s user base and revenues Citron and Left dove into just how impressive Facebook s user base is  which should help it continue to attract advertisers as non ad supported platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime attract more and more customers  Plus  the firm presented its case as to why Facebook is hardly  evil  compared to many other firms in a report titled     Books have been written and movies have been made on the Facebook is evil topic  but never before has Facebook been this compelling of an investment opportunity   Citron wrote  As investors have become overly concerned about the short term noise of privacy and propaganda  they have forgotten to look at the earnings power and potential of the most advanced advertising tool with global reach in messaging  networking  and the future of shopping  The Facebook platform has advanced a long way and has turned this research firm from a one time skeptic to a major bull  Shares of Facebook climbed over 8  to reach  134 18 per share Wednesday after investors reacted positively to Citron calling the social media giant its  2019 S P Stock of the

23502,245017,RDY,Dr  Reddy s  RDY  Q3 Earnings Fall  Revenues Improve Y Y,opinion,"Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY   reported third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings per American Depositary Share  ADS  of 32 cents  down 27 3  from 44 cents earned in the year ago quarter  However  earnings include a one time charge of  14 6 million  Rs  930 million  due to recent tax law change in the United States  The Zacks Consensus reported earnings of 41 cents per share 
However  revenues increased 2 6  year over year to  596 million 
Quarter in Detail
Dr  Reddy s reported revenues under three segments   Global Generics  Pharmaceutical Services   Active Ingredients   PSAI    and Proprietary Products and Others 
Global Generics revenues fell about 2  year over year to  472 million during the third quarter  The decline was attributed to adverse foreign exchange as the US dollar depreciated by about 4  and lower contribution from Europe generics market  On a sequential basis  the segment registered growth of 5  driven by the United States and Emerging Markets 
PSAI revenues were  85 million on par with the year ago quarter figure 
Revenues at the Proprietary Products and Others segment came in at  39 million  up 145  from the year ago quarter 
Further  research and development expenses were down 6  year over year to  73 million 
Also  selling  general and administrative expenses were  189 million  up 6  year over year 
As of Dec 31  2017  Dr  Reddy has 102 generic filings  99 abbreviated New Drug Applications  ANDAs  and three new drug applications  that are pending for the FDA approval  Of these 99 ANDAs  59 were Para IV filings and 29 have first to file status 
Our Take
In third quarter fiscal 2018  though Dr  Reddy s bottom line suffered a year over year decline  the top line witnessed an increase  Earnings were below expectations due to price erosion  and increased competition  The company remains focused on launching of new products  as well as on improving operational efficiencies and quality management systems  The company s first cycle NDA approval of high potency topical steroid Impoyz for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age or older is a significant milestone in the commercialization of its proprietary products pipeline

area as  critically polluted   the state PCB says its own monitoring shows the situation has improved  The rise of drug resistant  superbugs  is a growing threat to modern medicine  with the emergence in the past year of infections resistant to even last resort antibiotics  In the United States alone  antibiotic resistant bacteria cause 2 million serious infections and 23 000 deaths annually  according to health officials  Thirteen leading drugmakers promised last week to clean up pollution from factories making antibiotics as part of a drive to fight the rise of drug resistant superbugs  while United Nations member countries pledged for the first time to take steps to tackle the threat  MAJOR EARNER Patancheru is one of the main pharmaceutical manufacturing hubs in Telangana state  where the sector accounts for around 30 percent of GDP  according to commerce ministry data  Drug exports from state capital Hyderabad are worth around  14 billion annually   Local doctor Rao pointed to studies by scientists from Sweden s University of Gothenburg that have found very high levels of pharmaceutical pollution in and around Kazhipally lake  along with the presence of antibiotic resistant genes  The scientists have been publishing research on pollution in the area for nearly a decade  Their first study  in 2007  said antibiotic concentrations in effluent from a treatment plant used by drug factories were higher than would be expected in the blood of patients undergoing a course of treatment  That effluent was discharged into local lakes and rivers  they said   The polluted lakes harbored considerably higher proportions of ciprofloxacin resistant and sulfamethoxazole resistant bacteria than did other Indian and Swedish lakes included for comparison   said their latest report  in 2015  referring to the generic names of two widely used antibiotics  Those findings are disputed by local government officials and industry representatives   The Hyderabad based Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India  BDMAI  said the state pollution control board had found no antibiotics in its own study of water in Kazhipally lake  The state PCB did not provide a copy of this report  despite several requests from Reuters   I have not seen any credible report that says that the drugs are no longer there   Joakim Larsson  a professor of environmental pharmacology at the University of Gothenburg who led the first Swedish study and took part in the others  told Reuters by email   There might very well have been improvements  but without data  I do not know    WATER TREATMENT Local activists and researchers say the Common Effluent Treatment Plant  CETP  built in Medak in the 1990s was ill equipped to handle large volumes of pharmaceutical waste  After protests and court cases brought by local villagers a 20 km  12 mile  pipeline was built to take effluent to another plant near Hyderabad  But activists say that merely diverted the problem   waste sent there  they say  mixes with domestic sewage before the treated effluent is discharged into the Musi river  A study published this year by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology  Hyderabad  found very high levels of broad spectrum antibiotics in the Musi  a tributary of the Krishna  one of India s longest rivers  Local government officials responsible for the plants did not respond to Reuters  requests for comment  Nearly a dozen current and former officials from companies producing medicines in Patancheru told Reuters that factory staff from various firms often illegally dump untreated chemical effluent into boreholes inside plants  or even directly into local water bodies at night   All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity and Reuters was unable to independently verify those allegations  Major manufacturers in the area  including Dr Reddy s and Mylan  said they operated so called zero liquid discharge  ZLD  technology and processed waste onsite   Mylan is not dumping any effluent into the environment  borewells or the CETP   said spokeswoman Nina Devlin  Dr Reddy s said it recycled water onsite and complied with all environmental regulations  The same industry officials who spoke to Reuters said the pollution control board rarely checked waste treatment practices at factories  adding that penalties for breaches were meager  The Telangana state government did not respond to requests for comment   We are aware some companies are releasing more than the allowed effluent  but they are profit making companies   said state PCB spokesman N  Raveendher   We do try and take action against the offenders  but we cannot kill the industry also   Many smaller companies also lacked the funds to install expensive machinery for treating waste  he added  COURT BATTLES A series of local court cases have been filed stretching back two decades  accusing drug companies of pollution and local authorities of poor checks  In some cases  companies have been ordered to pay annual compensation to villagers  but many are still grinding through India s tortuous legal system   Wahab Ahmed  50  owns five acres of land near the shores of Kazhipally lake  where he grew rice until a decade ago  He says the worsening industrial pollution from several nearby pharmaceutical factories left his land barren   We have protested  sued  and done all sorts of things over the years     that s how some of us are now getting around 1 700 rupees  roughly  20  a year from the companies   he said    But what can you do with that small sum today   More than 200 companies were named as respondents in the case he was referring to  filed by a non profit organization on behalf of villagers  While pollution of farmland is a serious problem for villagers who depend on it for their livelihood  the potential incubation of  superbugs  in Medak s waterways has wider implications  The issue is particularly worrisome in India  where many waterways also contain harmful bacteria from human sewage  The more such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics  the greater the chances they will mutate and render such drugs ineffective against them  The risk is that resistant bacteria would then infect people and be spread by travel   So far  most of the focus worldwide on antimicrobial resistance has been on over use of drugs in human medicine and farming  
 Pollution from antibiotic factories is a third big factor in causing antimicrobial resistance   the chairman of one of the world s largest drugmakers told Reuters   But it is largely overlooked  ",2016-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/the-cost-of-cheap-drugs -toxic-indian-lake-is-'superbug-hotspot'-429165,429165
23535,245050,RDY,Generic Drugmakers To Dump As Teva s Woes Continue In 2018,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical   NYSE TEVA   reported another disappointing quarter last week  Its fourth quarter earnings declined 32  year over year  while sales were down 16  
The Israel based company s product sales in 2017 were hurt by increased pricing erosion  volume declines in the U S  Generics unit and rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone    Teva s blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection    in the Specialty segment  Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   earlier than expected launch of the first generic version of the 40 mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva  The company is also bogged down by new competition for branded products and huge debt burden of over  32 billion 
On the fourth quarter call  Teva provided a weak guidance for 2018 wherein it expects sales and profits to decline further this year 
Teva expects revenues in the range of  18 3    18 8 billion while earnings are expected in the band of  2 25  2 50 per share in 2018  The numbers fell below investors  expectations 
However  Teva has undertaken strategic restructuring efforts including the divestiture of some non core assets closure of plants  trimming of its generics portfolio  termination of low value R D projects  and plans to reduce its workforce by more than a quarter over the next two years 
Although the company expects to save almost  3 billion by the end of 2019 from these restructuring initiatives  a clear path to growth is not visible as it faces erosion of its largest product  Copaxone  Other than that  loss of sales due to divestures and pricing pressure in the U S  generic business will continue to hurt the top line in 2018 
In fact  price erosion and several other challenges cast a shadow over the whole generic drug industry 
Generic Drug Industry in Doldrums
 has a Zacks Industry Rank  176  bottom 34  of the 250 plus Zacks industries   The industry has declined 32 6  in the past year  underperforming an increase of 2 4  for the broader drugs industry and 14 6  for the S P 500 

The generics industry in the United States faced significant competitive and pricing pressure in 2017 and the trend is expected to continue in 2018  Moreover  customers in the industry are consolidating thereby increasing the scope for negotiating lower prices for generic drugs  This is leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume 
A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors  Moreover  the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs  which means more competition  increasing price cuts and decreasing volume 
3 Stocks to Dump
With generic pricing erosion expected to continue this year  we recommend investors to dump three companies in this industry  including Teva 
Teva
Teva has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Following its unimpressive fourth quarter results and trimmed view for 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings declined from  2 93 to  2 91 over the last seven days  Teva has lost 43 4  of its value in the past year 

Dr  Reddy s Laboratories   NYSE RDY  
This India based generic drugmaker has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Like its larger peers  Dr Reddy s also suffers from drug price erosion  fierce competitive pressure and lower contribution from product launches in the United States  In addition  the implementation of general sales tax   GST   in India is also hurting its top line to an extent 
However  the company has launched several generics of various drugs including Sanofi s billion dollar drug  Renvela  These launches may have a favorable impact as the company s generics sales have registered sequential growth in the quarter ending December 2017 
Dr Reddy s earnings estimates for 2018 have declined almost 6 1  over the past 60 days  The stock has declined 22 6  in the past year 

Teligent   NASDAQ TLGT  
Teligent is a small pharmaceutical company with 21 generic and four branded products in its portfolio  The company has also suffered due to the generic market headwinds  Moreover  product launches have not been able to make up for the loss due to pricing pressure for the company s two leading products 
Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  sales and earnings are expected to decline 24 5  and 1200   respectively  in the fourth quarter of 2017  Teligent also carries a Zacks Rank  4  Shares of the company have tumbled 58 5  in the past year 

Conclusion
Generic companies at large are seeing declining sales and profits due to price erosion  However  there are a few exceptions  Mylan being one of them  Though Mylan stock declined in the first half of 2017  shares rebounded from August 2017  outperforming the industry  The stock has gained 4 2  since August 

Mylan has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its earnings estimates for 2018 have risen 1 1  over the past 90 days  You can see  
Mylan s turnaround was driven by launch of generic versions of several drugs including blockbuster drugs  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Gleevec and Teva s Copaxone  in the second half of 2017  Moreover  the U S  Patent and Trademark Appeal Board instituted inter partes review proceedings ontwo patents related to Sanofi s Lantus  A favorable ruling will boost Mylan s prospect as Lantus is a blockbuster drug with sales over  4 billion in the first nine months of 2017  The potential launch of a generic version by Mylan will significantly boost its top line

23537,245052,RDY,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  AstraZeneca  Bayer  Dr  Reddy s Laboratories  Teva Pharmaceuticals And Adamas Pharmaceuticals,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 12  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Pharma  Part 3  including AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN    Bayer   OTC BAYRY    Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY    Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   and Adamas Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ADMS   Industry  Pharma  Part 3Link  While the drug pricing issue is no longer a major headwind for pharma and biotech stocks  it will nevertheless remain a headline risk until the Trump administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  The sector  previously a Wall Street favorite  was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs  With the drug pricing controversy gaining steam since September 2015  companies like Valeant saw their share prices plunge According to the April 2017 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  six in 10 Americans believe that affordability of prescription drugs should be the top priority for the President and Congress  The focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices Some of the options favored by the public for drug price control include getting drug companies to reduce prices of medication for people on Medicare  making it easier for generics to enter the market  and requiring drug companies to provide information on how drug prices are set Although pharma and biotech sectors rebounded in 2017 and started 2018 on an optimistic note  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to develop additional treatments Biosimilars a Key HeadwindAnother challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the United States  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative  with several blockbuster biologics slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments According to research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics last year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the United States through 2020  The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that have annual sales of  50 billion Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs Generics Pose a ThreatQuite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  Pfizer s Pristiq and Viagra  Merck s Vytorin  Sanofi s Renagel  Lilly s Strattera  Axiron and Effient are some key drugs  which started to face generic competition in the United States in 2017  The launch of a generic version of Teva s 40 mg formulation of blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone in October last year significantly hit the company s sales and profits  Some other key drugs expected to face generic biosimilar competition in 2018 include Glaxo s Advair  Amgen s Neulasta  Epogen and Sensipar  Lilly s Cialis  Allergan s Namenda XR and Restasis  among others With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking toward new products to pick up pace and make up for lost sales  However  relatively newer products like Amgen s Repatha and Sanofi Regeneron s Praluent have yet to ramp up significantly  With efforts on to control drug prices  the FDA is focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process  especially for third  fourth or fifth generics  which is leading to rapid erosion of branded drug sales Slowdown in Sales of Mature ProductsSeveral companies like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  are facing a slowdown in sales of mature products while new product sales have yet to pick up significantly  Many of these companies are also facing loss of patent protection  which means generics or biosimilars  as the case may be  could enter the market soon and lead to price erosion Pricing Pressure to Hit SalesWhile concerns regarding the drug pricing issue may have taken a backseat for the time being  pharma and biotech companies remain wary of increasing scrutiny of drug prices  Moreover  with increasing competition in the market and the entry of innovative treatments  pricing pressure is expected to hit sales Regulatory SetbacksAlthough the FDA surpassed 2016 s tally of new drug approvals in 2017  a few companies failed to gain approval for their drugs last year and were issued complete response letters  CRLs  by the agency  A CRL is issued by the FDA to inform the company that its application will not be approved in its present form  There could be several reasons for the same including insufficient data to support approval as well as manufacturing issues Some of the companies that are facing a delay in getting their drugs approved include Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   biosimilar version of Amgen s Neulasta   Lilly  Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis   Amgen and UCB  Evenity for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  Stocks to AvoidAs concerns regarding pricing pressure  slowdown in legacy product sales and biosimilar competition continue to keep the sector volatile  it would be prudent to stay away from stocks that have not been able to win analysts  confidence and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank Companies like AstraZeneca

Our Take
In fourth quarter fiscal 2018  Dr  Reddy s to and bottom line suffered a year over year decline  This was mainly due to continuing headwinds in the U S markets and a temporary drop in sales in Russia in the fourth quarter  due to a shift in the channel purchasing pattern

23541,245056,RDY,Dr  Reddy s Mylan Get FDA Nod For First Generic Of Suboxone,opinion,"Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Ltd    NYSE RDY   and Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   announced that the FDA has approved the first generic version of a Suboxone  Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film  under the tongue film for the treatment of opioid addiction  Both the companies will sell the generic version of the drug  Per the FDA  the approval was aimed at making the treatment available to more people 
Buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat adults with opioid dependence addiction  Buprenorphine helps to suppress withdrawal symptoms caused by discontinuation of opioid drugs  and naloxone reverses and blocks the effect of opioids

23578,245093,RDY,Mylan Down On FDA Warning Letter To Manufacturing Facility ,opinion,"Shares of Mylan  Inc    NASDAQ MYL   declined 2  after the company received a warning letter from the FDA for its manufacturing facility in India 
The FDA cited significant violations of current good manufacturing practice  CGMP  regulations for finished pharmaceuticals in the warning letter  The violations relate to the agency s inspection in Sep 2016 and even though the company had responded to the same  the agency deemed them inadequate 
The warning letter was issued on Apr 3  2017 wherein the FDA stated that the company s methods  facilities  or controls for manufacturing  processing  packing  or holding do not conform to CGMP  resulting in drug products being adulterated under section 501 a  2  B  of the Federal Food  Drug and Cosmetic Act  FD C Act   21 U S C  351 a  2  B  
The FDA determined that Mylan invalidated 101 out of 139  about 72   initial out of specification  OOS  assay results without sufficient investigation to determine the root cause of the initial failure from Jan 1 to Jun 30  2016 
The FDA warned that until Mylan redresses the violations completely and confirms its compliance with CGMP  the approval of new applications and the listing of the company as a drug manufacturer may be withheld 
The facility at Nashik produces antiretroviral therapies used to treat HIV 
We remind investors that in 2013  the FDA issued a warning letter to Strides Arcolab for its Agila Sterile Manufacturing Facility 2 in Bangalore  prior to the completion of the Agila acquisition  In 2015  the FDA issued a second warning letter regarding this facility  the Agila Onco Therapies Limited  OTL  facility and the Agila Sterile Product Division facility  SPD  
Mylan currently has nine API and intermediate manufacturing facilities and a total of sixteen finished dosage form facilities  which includes nine oral solid dose facilities and seven injectable facilities  all located in India 
Mylan s woes do not seem to end  Last month  the company received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug Advair Diskus 
We note that shares of Mylan have performed better than the Zacks categorized  industry in the past year with the stock losing 17 5  compared with the industry s decline of 22 2  

Shares of Mylan has been under immense pressure since Aug 2016 when the company faced criticism for the price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007 from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike  The pricing controversy even led to a congressional hearing and attracted immense censure 
Also  right after the pricing issue  Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The misclassification implied that Mylan has been greatly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one 
The guidance for 2017 was a silver lining in the clouds  However  with the company s ANDA for Advair being served a CRL  it might be a daunting task for the company hereafter   Meanwhile  we note that Mylan s biologics license application for a biosimilar version of Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Neulasta  pegfilgrastim  is also under FDA s review 
Of late  the FDA has issued several warning letters to drug manufacturing facilities have in India for violating quality standards  Dr Reddy s Laboratories Ltd   NYSE RDY   too received a warning letter from the FDA relating to cGMP deviations at three of its manufacturing facilities

23582,245097,RDY,Teva s New CEO Brings No Relief  Generic Drugmakers To Dump,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   on Monday announced that it has hired H  Lundbeck s   OTC HLUYY   chief K re Schultz as its new CEO  The appointment ended Teva s more than six month long search for a permanent CEO after Erez Vigodman stepped down in February this year 
Israel based Teva has been facing tough times  A challenging environment in the U S  generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela have been hurting its sales  Meanwhile  delay in the launch of some new generic drugs and fierce competition for some others is also hurting Generic segment sales  Teva is also facing several other challenges in the form of generic competition for branded multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  its key revenue generator  new competition for branded products  a high cost base and debt load 
It remains to be seen if Schultz can use his 30 years of extensive global pharmaceutical experience to help the world s largest generic drugmaker regain lost ground  Schultz will be tasked with increasing sales and reducing debt for the generic drugmaker  It is worth mentioning here that Schultz joined Lundbeck in 2015 when the company was struggling due to loss of patents for key drugs and helped the company to turn around  backed by significant restructuring initiatives 
Meanwhile  the huge development at Teva has once again shifted focus to the  industry  which is presently facing several challenges
Generic Drug Industry in Doldrums
The Generic Drugs industry has a Zacks Industry Rank  246  bottom 7  of the 250 plus Zacks industries   The industry has declined 15  year to date  YTD   significantly less than a return of 11 2  for the S P 500 

The U S  generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure  The ongoing consolidation of customers in the industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume  The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs 
A sharp decline in generic drug prices is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors  Moreover  the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs  which means more competition  increasing price cuts and decreasing volume 
3 Stocks to Dump
With the generic pricing erosion expected to continue this year  we recommend investors to dump three of the biggest names in this industry  including Teva 
Teva
Teva has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see  
Following its disappointing second quarter results and trimmed view in August  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings declined by 12  and 13 5   respectively over the last 60 days  On a YTD basis  Teva has lost 49  of its value compared with the 15  decline of its   

Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL  
Mylan s second quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in the U S  generic drug industry  The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing  Contributions from new product launches in the United States were one of the lowest in the second quarter  The generic maker also saw increased competitive pressure for its existing generic products  as the FDA approved more generics through accelerated approvals 
Ongoing challenges in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment in the region have led the company to defer all major launches from 2017 to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone 
Meanwhile  sales from Mylan s key branded product  EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic  We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since August last year when the company came under the spotlight for an increase in EpiPen price  drawing immense criticism from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike 
Mylan is also a  5 Ranked stock  Mylan s stock has declined 13 4  this year so far 

Its earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have declined 12 6  and 10 8   respectively over the past 60 days 
Dr  Reddy s Laboratories Limited   NYSE RDY  
This Indian generic drugmaker has a Zacks Rank of 4  Like its larger peers  Dr Reddy s also suffers from drug price erosion  fierce competitive pressure and lower contribution from new product launches in the United States  In addition  the implementation of general sales tax  GST  in India is also hurting its topline to an extent 
Dr Reddy s earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have declined almost 19  and 9 3   respectively over the past 60 days  Dr Reddy s stock has declined 25 1  this year so far 

Conclusion
While Teva s shares were up close to 20  on Monday  Mylan and Dr Reddy s also shared some of the positive momentum as their shares rose almost 3  and 1 7   respectively  The positive share price movement came after a long time for these generic makers 
However  the relief is probably temporary as the companies have a daunting task ahead of countering the broader market challenges

23645,245160,RDY,3 Surging Growth Plays As India s Polling Ends,opinion,"Key market indexes surged at the end of the world s largest democratic exercise  As polling ended in India  the Sensex gained 2 42  to end above 23 000  The Nifty posted an even more impressive performance  posting its largest two day gains in nearly three years  Ultimately  the index ended above the 7 000 mark  propelled by expectations that the NDA alliance will form the next government    
ADRs Surge
The buildup of strong momentum helped around 189 stocks to notch up gains  Banks and manufacturing stocks were among the major gainers  several of which were near one year highs  This includes names like AXIS Bank Ltd   NS AXBK   Coal India Limited  NS COAL   JSW Steel Limited  NS JSTL  and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd   NS MRTI  
Among the ADRs to move upwards were HDFC Bank Limited  NYSE HDB   and Tata Motors Ltd   NYSE TTM   This is in keeping with gains made by both these companies in recent times  For instance  last Thursday HDFC Bank had gained 1  to close at  41 29 and Tata Motors also gained around 1  to close at  38 12 
The strength in India ADRs was borne out by the massive increase in the Bank of New York Mellon India ADR Index at 10 35 am local time  The index gained 3 2   coming within striking distance of its highest level in around three years 
Possible Economic Spoilers
Despite optimism arising out of a new dispensation at the center  economic indicators remain worrying  Retail inflation has increased to 8 59   its highest level in three months  This will possibly make it difficult for the Reserve Bank of India to reduce interest rates when it reviews monetary policy in June 
On the other hand  the index of industrial production or IIP has reduced by 0 5  in March  This is primarily due to a reduction in manufacturing output  with capital goods production declining significantly  Taken together  these are significant downsides for market watchers 
Impact of Exit Polls
Despite these numbers  exit polls which predict a resounding victory for the NDA alliance will continue to drive markets upwards  Several market analysts believe that the Nifty and the Sensex will continue to rally this week  riding on exit poll results  Since nearly all exit polls predict a clear majority for the NDA alliance  this momentum is expected to continue going forward 
However  given the complex nature of the elections there is a slim chance that a small number of votes could change the nature of results  This is because it could translate into a large difference which in turn could impact the nature of the new government  If these factors come into play  markets could soon experience a high degree of volatility 
Below we present three Indian stocks which have a track record of consistent performance  Each of them also has a good Zacks rank  These make them ideal choices  since they could capitalize on market momentum  However  in case the market experiences a few jitters they remain solid choices 
Tata Motors Limited
Tata Motors is the largest automobile company in India  It is also the fifth largest truck manufacturer and the fourth largest bus manufacturer in the world  It also provides automotive solutions  Commercial and passenger vehicles are also sold in Europe  Africa  the Middle East  South East Asia  South Asia  Russia and South America

HDFC Bank Ltd

Modi s Method
The Congress led UPA regime  which lost the election  was hampered by two major problems  Subsidies ballooned and industry lost its momentum  Consequently  growth floundered  declining below 5  from the pre crisis level of 8   The government also faced a disruptive opposition which resisted major reforms  such as the entry of multi brand retail  Inflation continues to rise  presenting a daunting challenge for the new government 
The success of the BJP  which has managed to garner a clear majority for itself  is being solely attributed to its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi  A long term chief minister of the state of Gujarat  Mr Modi has distinguished himself in several areas 
His rural electrification program is a case in point  which has not only improved the quality of life for many but also significantly reduced the power subsidy  The fact that this has been achieved through close association with private enterprise is equally significant   
The Road Ahead
One of Mr  Modi s frequent slogans has been   Minimum government  maximum governance   Developments in the national capital indicate that an assertive Prime Minister s Office would be able to increase the pace of decision making  significantly reducing red tape  A renewed emphasis on manufacturing  which has slipped in recent times  also augurs well for the economy
