1315,222830,FCX,Stocks Seem Ready To Rebound On Positive Headlines,opinion," Wednesday Market Open  You ve heard of turnaround Tuesday  Well  it just appeared to arrive one day late this week 
Stocks look like they could be walking the rebound path early Wednesday after a three day losing streak highlighted by Tuesday morning s stomach churning plunge of more than 400 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI   The recovery in pre market trading today follows an upturn in European indices after a news report that said wait for it trade talks might be making progress after all  Specifically  the U S  and China are moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase one trade deal  Bloomberg reported 
For investors  this back and forth action around trade headlines once again shows how important it is not to get caught up in all the noise and stick with your long term plan  The market has the trade channel on its favorites list  and that s causing a lot of daily and hourly action that might look relatively benign six months from now but can feel dramatic when it happens  like yesterday   At times like these  when there s little distraction from earnings  people tend to tune in to the only station that s playing  and that s partly why there s so much volatility around every new development between the U S  and China  
While it s true that earnings tend to be scattered at this time of year  software company Salesforce  NYSE CRM  reported late Tuesday and posted better than expected earnings and sales  The stock fell a bit in pre market trading  however  as analysts called the company s guidance a mixed bag  It was good to see subscription and support revenue  a key metric  come in a little above third party consensus views 
 Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB  topped analysts earnings estimates but missed on revenue and shares fell in pre market trading  In its press release  the company noted that it grew soup share for the first time in 10 quarters  which it called  one of the early signs of progress  in a three year  journey  to revitalize the business  
Tomorrow morning it s back to retailers  with Kroger  NYSE KR  and Dollar General  NYSE DG  on tap 
In other news  a report early Wednesday showed slow private payrolls growth in November  This could potentially take some of the shine away from the more hopeful trade news  but the real data to watch is Friday s official government jobs number  see more below  
What Tuesday s Late Recovery Might Mean For TodayThere s no getting around it  The market had a rough start this month thanks mainly to trade related drama  What s good to see  though  is how stocks clawed back yesterday from their steep early losses to finish moderately lower instead of dramatically lower One school of thought suggests that when there s a two day sell off  what happens toward the end of day two and the start of day three can help determine whether investors face a longer string of losses or if the pressure is just a brief interlude  The way stocks took a stand late Tuesday might raise chances that this isn t the start of something prolonged  though today s open could also play a part Support down below might rest near the 50 day moving average of 3033 for the S P 500  SPX   and just below 3000  which roughly corresponds with the 100 day moving average   analysts noted  One thing to consider if this trade impasse continues and Dec  15 approaches without a resolution to the new tariffs scheduled to take effect that day is the chance for a more dramatic drop and maybe a test of the 200 day moving average down near 2930 Even a drop to 2930  which can t be ruled out but isn t necessarily in the cards   would still mean 17  gains year to date for the SPX  which would represent a very good year  Keep in mind that the trade situation remains very fluid  too  While the week began with negative news  any positive headlines have the chance to take stocks right back the other way  kind of like we re seeing this morning   Things could get interesting as we approach that Dec  15 tariff deadline  In the past  the U S  has often pulled back tariff threats as the date approaches  Failure to do that this time might hint that the situation has gotten worse There s not a heck of a lot on today s economic or earnings calendar  but sit tight because the end of the week brings the November payrolls report  see more below   Today does include the weekly U S  crude stockpiles data  and tomorrow morning gives investors a look at weekly jobless claims  Anything above 220 000 might raise some eyebrows after initial claims fell to 213 000 last time out With the weak manufacturing numbers over the last few months  there might be more attention paid to those weekly claims from here on  These data could represent one canary in the coal mine if the soft manufacturing climate starts making employers start to shed workers  Fed Seen Staying On Sidelines
If stocks keep falling  don t necessarily look for the Fed to step to the rescue when it meets next week  At least that s what the futures market seems to be saying  with CME Group  NASDAQ CME  futures showing zero odds of a rate cut  However  some analysts argue that if stocks go into a prolonged struggle related to bad trade news  just the idea that the Fed might be waiting in the shadows could potentially limit selling pressure 
In the meantime  most of the  risk off  metrics lit up Tuesday after being kind of quiet during Friday and Monday s lower stock market sessions  By the end of the day Tuesday  bonds had executed a pretty major move higher  sending the 10 year yield all the way back toward recent lows just above 1 7   Other caution signs included a rally in gold  the Japanese yen  and the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   The VIX climbed to nearly 18 early Tuesday but then took a long ride lower the rest of the day to finish below 16  This could be a sign that investors don t think the current turbulence will last 
The only sectors to post gains Tuesday were Real Estate and Utilities  which makes sense on a day when bond yields tanked  Falling yields can sometimes make dividend paying stocks seem more attractive  Not too long ago  the 10 year yield was pretty close to matching the S P 500 dividend yield  Now it s well below that  perhaps making Treasuries less enticing for some investors  Of course  if the trade situation really starts to look dire  it might be hard to keep people from embracing more defensive investments  even at low rates  
Sector Parade Heads South
With worries mounting about delays to a trade deal  semiconductors got hit harder than most of the Technology sector  falling 1 5   Quite often over the last year  some investors have seen semis as a barometer for how trade negotiations are doing  The other big barometer some people have adopted for trade is Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   and that stock fell nearly 1 8  on Tuesday 
Another weak sector Tuesday was cars  trucks and other things that go  The Transports fell more than 2   with airlines particularly hard hit  and many of them were looking weak even before now   That s kind of ironic considering many analysts had forecast a record setting Thanksgiving travel season  We ll have to see if any numbers start coming in to confirm whether that happened  because confirmation might help some airline names 
The Materials sector which has a lot of exposure to the trade war and has been trailing the SPX all year didn t do well  either  However  some gold miners  including Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM  looked strong in part because of the rally in gold  Copper miners like Freeport McMoRan  NYSE FCX   however  had a challenging time thanks to weakness in that commodity  Briefing com noted  
Small caps fell Tuesday but outpaced the broader market possibly because investors see smaller firms having potentially less exposure to trade issues 
If you re long the market  it s never fun to lose money on a day like Tuesday  Still  it s kind of reassuring to see things behaving so predictably  The semis and AAPL lost ground on trade worries while gold and bonds rallied  It s just what you might expect  The question is whether it lasts much longer  Those technical support points might have something to say about that

CHART OF THE DAY  TREND STILL ON  In the short term  the downside breakout on the S P 500 Index  SPX   candlestick  below the lower support of the upward sloping channel  yellow lines  may look bleak  But longer term  SPX still looks like it may be trending up  as suggested by the 50 day moving average  blue line   Data source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
A Tug of War in Equities  A significant downward move in the S P 500 Index  SPX  for a few days doesn t necessarily spell trend reversal  The SPX  which was trending up in a narrow channel from mid October and hitting new highs during November  recently showed a change of heart  Since then  the markets went into selloff mode  sending the SPX breaking below the support level of that narrow channel  see chart above   This intensified the selling even more  Uncertainty about the trade deal between U S  and China and the ISM numbers that suggested contraction in the manufacturing sector may have played a role  Is this a short term reaction 
The lower level of the channel could be worth watching since it might act as a resistance level if SPX heads back up toward that positive sloping channel  Or the SPX could move back into that upward sloping channel and continue moving up  But that s looking at a short term move  If we shift gears and look at the big picture  the 50 day simple moving average indicates the uptrend may still be in play  Will the 50 day SMA act as a support level or will SPX move up toward the channel 
 Tis the Season  So called  seasonal  factors get lots of ink in the media every year  but tend to be over emphasized  Just because something worked in the past doesn t mean it will again in the future  That said  one thing to potentially track once the new calendar year begins could be the performance of some of this year s losing names  This time of year is when many investors start combing through  losers  in their portfolios looking for stocks they can sell to hopefully ease their annual tax burden by claiming losses  This tends to raise pressure on those stocks in December  but a funny thing sometimes happens in January  Those same stocks often rise  Barrron s noted last week 
Why  Because the selling pressure comes off in January after the deadline for claiming a 2019 loss expires on Dec  31  Barron s cites the example of  General Electric   NYSE GE   which saw shares drop nearly 35  between November and December 2018 and then climb 34  in January  Does this mean investors should take a chance on some  losers  next month  Not necessarily  It s never a good idea to attempt to time the market or depart from your established investment plan to take advantage of a trend that might not go your way this time around  That said  it could be interesting to watch how some of the beaten down energy and department store stocks perform in January  if this theory comes into play again 
Jobs Wildcard  As we noted yesterday  analysts are converging around a number near 180 000 for November jobs growth ahead of Friday s report  That s solidly higher than the 128 000 seen in October  The wildcard this time is the General Motors  NYSE GM  workers returning from their fall strike  The strike ended in late October and 48 000 striking workers returned to work  Some of this could be picked up by the November report  meaning a big jobs growth number for the month might get seen as a blip related to that development  The glass half full argument would be that October s 128 000 figure was artificially depressed by those workers being on strike  which sliced close to 50 000 workers from job rolls that month  One other factor that s  less bullish  however  is private firm iCIMS reporting Tuesday that it saw hiring and job openings down 0 1  and 0 6   respectively  on a seasonally adjusted basis  in November    Lower demand for workers was evident across industries  but particularly in retail trade   said iCIMS  a recruitment software provider for employers

The S P 500 climbed 0 64   and the Dow Jones industrials climbed 0 57   The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices rose 0 60  and 0 65   respectively 
The trade optimism was set off  in part  by President Donald Trump who tweeted that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  chief of the Chinese negotiating team  would visit the White House on Friday 
Overnight  fears the Chinese delegation would leave Washington Thursday  after just a day of talks  had sent futures markets plunging  Markets have tended in recent months to move violently on any trade news  Thursday s move looked like computer algorithms reacting to the Trump tweet 
If there was a downside to the rally  it was the lack of news during the trading day  The negotiators met  they reportedly called in for takeout at lunch from Clyde s in Washington  but there was no real news 
As a result  the Dow  which had been up as many 257 points in the late morning  lost 40  of the gain  finishing up 151 points  That s good  but not boffo

This has helped Freeport s stock price recover in 2019 and has FCX testing a key breakout level 
The chart above is a weekly look at Freeport McMoRan  The shaded channel outlined by each  1  highlights the longer term downtrend that FCX has been stuck in 
But this could change on a dime  especially if FCX can breakout above  2   This area represents its recent highs as well as its falling downtrend line 
A breakout here with strong volume would be very bullish

14077,235592,FCX,Stocks Jump Following The Fed And Are Setting Up For More Gains,opinion,"The S P 500 managed to finish the day higher by roughly 30 basis points to finish at 3 141  The index got a bump following the FOMC rate decision  which was a no change in rates  as expected  So why did the market rise  Primarily  because the Fed has made it pretty clear that the bar for cutting rates is lower than the bar for raising rates  The Fed is going to be more inclined to cut rates at the first sign of weakness and not increase rates should inflation and the economy strengthen  
If that isn t a bullish scenario for stocks  then I m not sure what is  I talked about some this more in a post Fed commentary  going through the dot plot and the story that dots told   Post Fed Thoughts
The interesting thing is that the S P 500 is starting to show some resemblance of a pennant formation  a bullish continuation pattern  It does suggest that the market is likely to move higher tomorrow  and potentially move on to new highs

The size of the selloff was biggest in the last 25 minutes of trading  It could be that some investors  or the computer algorithms that guide their trading  were put off by Trump s use of the phrase Phase 1  suggesting that there s much more to negotiate and much more that s contentious  The biggest would be technology theft

15760,237275,FCX,Stocks   Boeing  Walgreens Boost Dow  China Stalls Market,news,"Investing com   Stocks overall struggled on Monday  but the Dow was pushed higher by gains in Boeing and  Walgreen Boots Alliance 
The S P 500 fell 0 2   The Nasdaq Composite was off 0 13   while the Dow Jones industrials rose 0 04  
The Dow s gain came because Boeing  NYSE BA  jumped 4 6  after saying it believes its 737 Max will win recertification from the Federal Aviation Administration by the end of the year  with deliveries reportedly starting in December  It would take two months or so before the planes    new and grounded    could go into service 
Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA  rose 5 1  on a Bloomberg News report that buyout giant KKR was considering offering to take the company private 
The two stocks alone added nearly 129 points to the blue chip index by themselves A 0 6  gain for Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  added another 14 points with a 0 8  gain  but the other Dow components  especially 3M  NYSE MMM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and Walt   Disney    NYSE DIS   pulled back enough to offset the first three 
The reason for the pullback for the S P 500 and the Nasdaq was more worries about a U S  China trade deal  There was nothing announced Monday  and all traders had to work with were comments last week from President Donald Trump  The first came on Friday when he said he hadn t signed off on rescinding tariffs  set to take effect on Dec  15  And  while he tweeted Saturday talks were  progressing nicely   that wasn t enough for traders and their computers 
For the past few weeks  the market has been treated with mostly positive news about a deal with a first phase deal signed next month 
The lack of news hasn t threatened the short term rally that began in September  But it did seem to limit upside gains on Monday after record closes for the major indexes on Friday  In addition  there were no economic reports on Monday because of the Veterans Day Holiday 
Only Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  hit new highs among the Dow stocks on Monday  
Others hitting new intraday highs on Monday were farm equipment maker Deere  NYSE DE   Sirius XM  NASDAQ SIRI     Toyota    NYSE TM   autoparts maker BorgWarner  NYSE BWA     United Rentals    NYSE URI  and specialty vehicle maker Oshkosh  NYSE OSK  
Oil prices moved lower as well  Oil traders believe a deal will boost global oil demand and cut inventories of crude oil in the United States and abroad  West Texas Intermediate crude fell 38 cents to  56 86 a barrel  Brent crude  the global benchmark  dropped 33 cents to  62 18  Both have risen about 5  since the end of September as traders have expected a trade deal  
Gold futures tumbled in New York 1 459 50 an ounce  down  3 40 an ounce  Also lower were farm commodities like soybeans  wheat and corn

The S P 500 fell as many as 44 points soon after the open  The Dow Jones industrials were off nearly 458 points before some modest bargain hunting set in and the president  who was attending a NATO meeting in London  withdrew for the night 
The bargain hunting helped cut the day s losses substantially  The S P 500 closed down 0 66   The Nasdaq Composite dropped about 0 55   The Dow ended off 1 01   or 280 points  in part because of weakness in Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Boeing  NYSE BA  and   Home Depot    NYSE HD  
Boeing was lower as skepticism that its troubled 737 Max jetliner will be re certified by Dec  31 
Defensive stocks  including Merck  NYSE MRK     Verizon Communications    NYSE VZ  and Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  led the blue chip index  Only five of the 30 stocks were higher 
Much of the initial selling came so quickly after the open that it appeared to be computer driven 
Then  humans slowly bid stocks up and forced the market to recover at least some of its losses 
The Dow s loss was its largest since Oct  8  The losses for the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite at the close were smaller than their Monday losses 
Tech stocks were hurt  especially chip stocks and hardware  because of the possibility of more tariffs being imposed on goods imported from China and because the Chinese market is so important to these companies as well  Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS   Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU  were among the biggest losers among stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index 
Apple  Intel  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  combined to generate 33 points of the Nasdaq 100 s 54 5 point loss    61  of the total  
After hours  Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  beat earnings estimates compiled by Investing com  But weaker than expected guidance pushed shares lower after hours 
 
 
The market has regularly jumped when the president or other officials working on the China trade talks have said a deal is on track  Wall Street may become skeptical about the assurances going forward 
Nine of the 11 S P 500 sectors were lower  with energy  financial and industrial stocks suffering most  Utilities and real estate were the only winners as investors looked to them for safety 
They also bid up bonds and gold  looking for safety from the political headwinds

15762,237277,FCX,Stocks   Wall Street Drops Ahead of Fed  Tariff Deadline,news,"Investing com   Stocks moved lower on Monday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting this week and on worries about U S  China trade talks 
The S P 500 dropped 0 32   The Dow Jones industrials slid 0 38   and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0 40  
The pullback was probably to be expected after Friday s big rally triggered by the bullish November jobs report 
The declines  including 105 points on the Dow  were enough to push the major indexes into the red for December  Still  the stock market is enjoying its best year since 2013  
 
The Fed will hold its last meeting of the year starting Tuesday  The two day affair will end Wednesday afternoon with the announcement  Investors tracked by Investing com are overwhelmingly betting on the Fed standing pat on the key fed rate of 1 5  to 1 75  
The meeting will begin two days after the Sunday death of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker at age 92  
The trade issue at hand is what happens if the United States and China can t come to a phase one agreement by Sunday night and if President Donald Trump will impose a new round of tariffs on goods imported from China  including cellphones and other electronics 
Larry Kudlow  Trump s economic advisor  said the Sunday deadline was not arbitrary  and there s some betting in Washington that the new tariffs won t be imposed  but tariffs imposed in the fall will be left in place 
What s not clear is how long can either side hold until it says  no mas   A reason for Monday s decline was an overnight report that Chinese exports in November were down 1 1  from October  Investors were expecting a small gain 
A last concern is the outcome of Thursday s general election in the United Kingdom and what it might mean for Brexit 
The China concerns weighed on tech and tech related shares  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Boeing  NYSE BA  were the weakest Dow stocks  with   Home Depot    NYSE HD  and   IBM    NYSE IBM  the leaders

15763,237278,FCX,Stocks   Apple  Chips Lead Nasdaq Higher as Fed Stands Pat,news,"Investing com   Technology stocks were the stars of the day Wednesday as the Federal Reserve held steady on interest rates and Chairman Jerome Powell pronounced the economy  in a good place  
The major averages saw small gains overall  but chip and chip related stocks  including Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   had decent gains as traders appeared to be betting that the Trump Administration will hold off on imposing new tariffs on imports from China 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   which manufactures most of its products in China  hit a new all time high 
The S P 500 was up 0 29   The Dow Jones industrials climbed back from an early loss to end 0 11  higher  The Nasdaq Composite added 0 44  while the tech dominated Nasdaq 100 index added 0 58  
The market moves came as the Federal Reserve held its key federal funds rate at 1 5  to 1 75  and signaled it probably won t move rates lower or higher for some time to come  perhaps all of 2020  It would take a sustained period of inflationary pressures to get the Fed to move rates up  Chairman Jay Powell said in his news conference and the economy is able to cope with current rates 
The Fed sees a growing labor market  modestly growing wages  little inflation  The risks to the economy remain trade disputes and weak business investment 
There are  of course  risks from the ongoing U S  China trade fight and all the tariffs the Trump Administration has imposed so far and could impose over the weekend if President Donald Trump decides the negotiations are unnecessarily stalled 
Additional risks are slowing economies in Europe and elsewhere  Europe  especially  is wracked by the Brexit battle  which will climax Thursday when voters in the United Kingdom head to the polls for a snap parliamentary election  Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Conservatives are expected to add seats 
The uncertainties of both may mean stocks tread water the rest of the week 
 
The Dow was held back in part by a decline in  Home Depot    NYSE HD   which cut its guidance for fiscal 2020 same store sales growth modestly  The shares were down 2   which translated into more than 26 Dow points 
But remember only 14 Dow stocks were higher on the day 
 
For much of the day  Boeing  NYSE BA  was lower  but finished up 0 60   The decline came as Federal Aviation Administration Chairman Steve Dickson told CNBC the agency won t recertify the 737 Max plane before the end of the year 
 If you just do the math  it s going to extend into 2020   Dickson said 
The rebound may reflect the market s conviction that the plane will get recertfied  When is the question 
There are at least 10  maybe 11  milestones to complete  And Dickson did not want to seem to accelerate the recertification process  Documents released at a Congressional hearing Wednesday showed FAA staffers worried the 737 Max was potentially a more dangerous plane than anyone thought after its 2018 crash in Indonesia  It took a second crash in Ethiopia to force the FAA to ground the plane 
Crude oil  fell after several days of gains  Gold  was higher in New York  The 10 Year  Treasury yield was lower 
It may surprise  but the U S  stock market has gone nowhere so far in December 
The Dow is down 0 5  for the month  The S P 500 is basically flat  The Nasdaq is down 0 13   and the Nasdaq 100 is flat

15766,237281,FCX,Asia Open  Fed s Holiday Season Dovish Delight,opinion,"The Fed offered up a surprising holiday season dovish delight for the market  The flattening of the UST 5Y 30Y curve all week indicated some weight was shifting to 2020 dots showing a bias for a rate hike after the strong jobs report last Friday 
However  the FOMC ultimately faded the optimism in the NFP data  and now the dot plots unambiguously suggest a Fed policy where the bar to cutting rates is high  Still  the bar for hiking is even higher 
On the dots for 2020  four members expect a rate hike  with 13 expecting rates to remain on hold  For 2021 and beyond  the number expecting hikes increases  no members expect any cuts from here  So now the Fed s mantra is pivoting from  lower for longer  to  lower forever  
On the rates market  with a lot of data optimism built into the U S  yield curve on the back of the ebullient U S  jobs report  so naturally  some of this should retrace  Ultimately  however  the Fed s message is still one of staying on hold  so there isn t a shift here  leaving U S  China catalysts  and potentially UK elections  as the driver for rates from here 
On FX markets  the less hawkish Fed than expected offered up a mild disappointment for the dollar bulls  However  there were no moon shots as the markets had been reducing  long  dollar risk into year end on the back of improving global economic data  mainly vs  the euro 
Also cushioning the USD weakness  traders were already baking in the seasonality effect that points to US  weakness in the last week of December  the first two weeks of January  Still  USD weakness is healthy for risk sentiment  especially at this late stage of the cycle 
U S  equities strengthened  U S  10 year Treasury yields slipped lower  however  down 5bps to 1 79   providing a fillip to gold prices  But until we ultimately clear the Brexit and U S  China risk  the market could struggle to trade directionally  
Oil marketsCrude stocks rose 0 8Mb  bearish vs  consensus for a 2 8Mb draw  and the five year average of  2 2Mb  It was a smaller oil build than the  1 4Mb reported by the API  An increase in imports was the main driver of the rise  although refinery inputs also declined After a weathering  a pretty significant position meltdown on back of an unexpected inventory builds  a massive jump in gasoline supplies  and unfinished business on the December tariff deferral front  The fact that we are still hovering near WTI   59 00 per barrel is a testament to the positive impact of the new OPEC  agreement is having on oil markets  But in the near term  U S  China trade remains the primary catalyst and the 500 pound gorilla in the room  Navarro downplayed the idea that December tariffs will be delayed allowing more time for negotiations  Still  there seems to be enough evidence in the headlines to suggest both sides want to find a mutual understanding and work towards a phase one deal Gold markets 
Gold got a lift from the move lower in US  yields  and with Fed on hold forever narrative setting in  making it difficult for yields to rise  gold should remain supported on dips 
And given that the current tariff could eventually take its toll on H1 growth  there could be even more downside pressure on yields  and they could subsequently decline materially despite a positive outcome to the trade talks  
And with the Fed possibly expanding the balance sheet again in 2020  amid a plethora of macro uncertainties  it reinforces the notion that gold should be a regular feature in one s asset allocation during periods of market uncertainty  especially when interest rates are low 
The recent history of gold seasonally doing well in January   5 22  for 5 year trailing average  strengthens the case for gold to push higher in early 2020  not to mention US election political risk beckons a gold revival 
Ultimately with US rates on hold indefinitely  it should cushion golds fall on a knee jerk sell off on a decisive phase one outcome  Also  the fed on hold forever narrative should tarnish the US dollar demand but support the glittering gold appeal  
IN the meantime  it s back to December 15 watch  
Currency Markets
Two things that should stand out on the less hawkish Fed are Treasuries and carry trades  But on the currency side  the  EM Asia FX  the carry appeal is getting held in check by the phase one overhang 
The policy statement from the China Central Economic Work Conference released s a risk event to watch  It will set the economic policy theme for 2020  The expectation of a more massive fiscal investment is the market s baseline view going into the conference  but the scale needs to be defined  So  there should be much focus on commodity exporters like the NZD and AUD  as well as the basket of ASEAN currencies as China infrastructure spending announcements will most likely impact them 
The Ringgit 
The ringgithas opened on a favorable tone on the back of the less hawkish Fed  and firm oil prices supported by the latest OPEC  agreement 
However  further gains below 4 15 will be hard pressed unless we get some definitive movement on a delay on the December 15 tariffs for President Trump  And therein lies the inherent problem  President Trump is impossible to predict  So  unless you have some idea of the content of the Trump Twitter feed in advance  I suspect most local traders will opt to play it safe not wanting to test the bullish water below 4 15 
Australian Dollar 
Yesterday I suggested that the Aussie was trading oddly low considering the liftoffs in copper  iron ore  and palladium  Over the past 24 hours  the sleeper has awoken  The AUDUSD is alive and well on the back of the enormous rallies in copper  BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP   Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  lend support  and the market turns a bit more bullish on global growth  Of course  a less hawkish Fed was a pleasant surprise 
While the initial intention was to position for little more than a chip shot to test the 200 DMA   6910   the Fed dovish delight suggests a possible moon shoot in the making  even more so if the market decides that  Global Growth Recovery  is the big theme going into 2020  Sure  the recent run of domestic data  looks dreadful but forward looking global growth optimism will always trump backward looking local data any day of the week in currency land 
The Pound
The mighty pound trades resoundingly well as the market is taking the view that  a majority is still a majority   whether it s 28 or 68 seats  I would have thought that the lead shrinking below the margin of error would make the market more nervous as a hung parliament no longer looks like a zero delta 
But the market might not be anywhere near as long as I thought  and with virtually every good FX trader I ve talked to is retaining a very confident and robust bullish lean into the election tomorrow  they re probably right  
The Euro 
Ultimately  if this is a risk on USD move  EURJPY could look attractive even more so after EURUSD remained bid after the US payroll inspired  long  position washout  which should keep traders  interest in the bullish camp ",2019-12-12,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-open-feds-holiday-season-dovish-delight-200492012,200492012

Stocks are on a path higher  with the S P 500 rising to close at a record high this week at 3 169  The patterns in the chart suggest the market continues to climb this week  heading towards 3 200 






Dollar Index
The dollar index should be on everyone s watch list this week  The index fell below uptrend and is testing support 96 50  A drop below 96 50 can really get the dollar moving lower towards 94  One should not underestimate the power the dollar has to move commodity prices and to stock inflationary forces  I talk a lot more about the dollar in this video segment from Friday 






Freeport  FCX  
Freeport  NYSE FCX  is one stock to keep on your radar if the dollar weakens this week  The stock is testing resistance at  13 20 and could be on its way to  13 80  I was seeing bullish betting in the stock earlier this week  but that was around  12 80  Then again  I have been seeing bullish betting in the stock since September 6  when the stock was only  9 50  






Netflix  NFLX 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  has a bullish uptrend that has formed  and I have recently seen some bullish options betting that suggests the stock rises to around  316 







Amazon  AMZN 

Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  also appears to be showing some bullish trends as well  along with bullish options betting  It suggests the stock finally push up to around  1840 for starters 






ACADIA  ACAD 
It looks like the lazy trader or the  set it and forget it  Algo  have been cleaned up in ACADIA  NASDAQ ACAD   Now the stock appears to be forming a double bottom and likely push higher once again towards  48  I love it when people email me to tell me how the CEO sold some stock  Big deal  He acquired 150 000 for  19 65 and sold them around  52  can you blame him  Not to mention  it was part of a 10b5 1 plan that was instituted on August 22  The guy only owned 1 4 million shares in April  when they filed the proxy statement  There have been a whole bunch of insider sales recently  all part of 10b5 1 plans

 If  4 2  is the actual decline for the quarter  it will mark the first year over year decline in earnings for the index since Q2 2016 and the largest year over year decline in earnings since Q1 2016   FactSet said

15807,237322,FCX,Trade Drama Finally Has Competition As Earnings Come Into View,opinion," Monday  Market Open  This week  it gets real 
Real in the sense that investors will finally have something solid to trade on and not just the latest back and forth around trade talks with China like the one that helped spike stocks on Friday and now has them looking softer  see more below   The backbone of the stock market is corporate results  and tomorrow the season starts with a bang as   

Like a lot of sectors going into an earnings season when results are expected to be overall negative  the Financial sector faces challenges notably the low rate environment and slowing growth around the world  That said  JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon takes the mic tomorrow morning and there s a lot potentially riding on how he characterizes things 
Dimon had a positive outlook last quarter  and he s arguably the dean of the group  His confidence is incredibly important  and investors might want to see if he strikes a positive note that a slowdown in Europe and Asia isn t impacting results 

The lineup for tomorrow morning includes JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   and  Wells Fargo    Company  NYSE WFC   Later this week brings Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC  and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   Investors get their first look at a FAANG on Wednesday afternoon when Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  streams its results to the world 
After spiking Friday on hopes for what the administration called a  phase one  deal with China  stocks suffered a setback in futures trading Monday as doubts crept in  People are re evaluating what  phase one  might mean  Reports that China might want more talks before putting the initial deal in place appear to have some investors waiting to start celebrating  There s really no reason to think the S P 500 can break above 3000 in any significant way until something gets signed  
Another thing to keep in mind about today is that it s Columbus Day  and banks are closed  The bond market also gets a day off  That might mean seeing some herky jerky kind of trading with certain products closed and relationships out of line  so it s important to be careful for anyone trading  It wouldn t be surprising if volume is thin  especially since we re in the waiting game for earnings tomorrow 
Another Friday Fiesta
Friday put a big exclamation point on a dramatic week  with excitement building over what the Trump administration called  phase one  of a trade deal with China  It looks like tariffs that were scheduled to rise this week might not  but it s unclear exactly how this is all going to work 
Any positive news about an initial agreement if it happens  would arguably be positive for Technology stocks  especially semiconductors  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose more than 2  Friday  partly on hopes that this phase one agreement might mean less U S  Chinese friction over Chinese telecom giant Huawei Culture Co Ltd  SZ 002502   The administration said last week that it plans to soon issue licenses allowing some American companies to supply non sensitive goods  according to The New York Times 
It was interesting to see indices roll back some of their biggest gains in the last half hour of Friday s session  It could have simply been some profit taking heading into the weekend  with the trade situation still unclear as the closing bell rang  Some investors might have been hoping for something more cut and dry as far as a trade agreement  and could have become disappointed when they heard  phase one   Briefing com said  That implies there could be many phases to come  and it s something to consider keeping in mind before getting too excited 
Still  last week saw gains for the S P 500 Index  SPX  after three consecutive weeks of losses  Another positive note came on the data watch Friday morning as Michigan consumer sentiment rose to 96  That was well above the 89 9 expected and September s 93 3  implying consumers remain on firm footing so far this month  
Industrial Power
Industrials led the way Friday with a huge gain of more than 2   One big mover was Fastenal Company  NASDAQ FAST   which sure seemed to pick the right day for a better than expected earnings report  Shares of FAST  a wholesaler of industrial and construction supplies  rocketed more than 17  for the company s best day in nearly 20 years  The company got a double boost from strong earnings and the China news  If trade relations smooth out  it could help companies like FAST by loosening up what s been a real tough barrier for the big Industrial firms for the last 18 months lack of clarity around the rules of trade  more on that below  
The other thing a trade deal could do is slow rising costs for firms across the Industrial and Information Technology sector  Remember  a lot of them have been struggling with higher supply expenses due to the tariffs  Companies like  Boeing Co   NYSE BA    Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   and  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  all could benefit  CAT shares rose nearly 5  Friday for the company s best day in weeks 
Material sector companies also got a boost at the end of the old week  including a sparkling day for mining company Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   which climbed 7   Here s a sector that could benefit from rising metals prices after commodities stayed under pressure throughout much of this trade battle  Copper Futures are now around  2 61 a pound  still way below highs from 2018  However  if trade relations smooth out  it s possible commodities like copper  crude oil  and agricultural products could start to rise  with potential benefits for the Materials and Energy sectors  We ll have to wait and see 
Bonds  which had been under pressure all day Friday  came off their lows by the end of the session  but the 10 Year yield remained near recent highs above 1 7   That s about halfway between the longer term lows just below 1 5  and highs just above 1 9   So for now  it looks like investors are trying to find some middle ground in bonds 
It s hard to believe that the CBOE Volatility Index had once traded above 20 early last week  the way it finished Friday well under 16  In like a lion  out like a lamb  as the old saying goes  It s back above 16 this morning 
One thing worth noting is that the rally Friday stopped well short of the psychological 3000 mark for the S P 500 Index  SPX  after approaching within seven points of it at its high for the day  The all time intraday high of around 3027 from late July remains an important point to watch  If we can t reach 3025 or above at some point soon  it s possible that the market could fade last week s rally  That becomes even more likely if there s a lack of concrete news about this phase one deal

FIGURE 1  DONE TREADING WATER  The S P Industrials sector  IXI candlestick  and copper futures   HG purple line  have been trading water for months  but both got a boost in part from news of trade deal progress Friday  These could be two metrics to continue monitoring if trade optimism continues  Data Sources  S P Dow Jones Indices  CME Group  NASDAQ CME  Chart source  The  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
Chip Sector Demand In Question  Last week s Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  downgrade of Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  based on weak enterprise sector spending isn t just bad news for CSCO  It also could extend to other companies in Technology  including semiconductor firms  Remember  this isn t the first sign of weakness in the enterprise sector  Back in August  enterprise data services company NetApp Inc  NASDAQ NTAP   shares got hammered after the company cut its Q1 sales and profit outlook and lowered its full year sales growth guidance  NTAP blamed macroeconomic factors  including the trade war 
So first there was NTAP  and now there s the GS note on CSCO  Does all this trickle through to other parts of the Technology sector  including chip firms   Chipmakers could be the first place some of this shows up  Semis are near their highs  and these companies provide the chips for data centers  That said  chip companies have been left on the roadside for dead maybe five times this year alone  and they keep performing  You do have artificial intelligence and gaming  two areas that look to continue to be strong and could rescue the sector  Still  some analysts see the chance of a slowdown in gaming  Where do tariffs settle and how do they affect semis that s the big question mark  Semiconductor earnings come into focus the week of Oct  21  when several big names are expected to report 
Infrastructure Watch  Even with the trade winds apparently blowing in the market s favor as the year winds down  companies are still working without a rulebook until a final deal gets signed  That means infrastructure spending could stay restrained  a potential worry going forward  This might be particularly important in the Industrials sector  which is tied pretty closely to business with China and has been holding up better than many analysts had expected  The concern is that many continue putting off infrastructure spending  It s hard for them to invest without knowing the rules of the game as far as trade is concerned  When the rules can change at any moment  that makes things difficult  The problem is  if you don t spend money on infrastructure now  that s something that can haunt you two or three years down the road  In recent quarters  we haven t heard many Industrial or other companies talk about their infrastructure spending plans  so it might be something to keep tuned into as this earnings season gets underway  Some of the big Industrial firms like CAT  BA  and LMT are expected to report the week of Oct  21 
Manufacturing Back in Picture on Tuesday  A weak manufacturing sector survey helped put the brakes on the market earlier this month  and tomorrow brings an important regional indicator with the Empire State Manufacturing survey  Last time out  the headline number still showed expansion  but just barely  The index edged down to just 2 0 in early September  with new orders looking weak  Shipments fell to their lowest level in three years  More weakness in this report could signal additional challenges for the manufacturing economy  Other key data this week include September retail sales on Wednesday and September housing starts on Thursday

15808,237323,FCX,1 Sector To Buy  2 To Avoid As Q3 Earnings Season Kicks Off,opinion,"The fallout from the prolonged U S  China trade war on U S  companies has investors bracing this week as Wall Street s third quarter earnings season ramps up 

FactSet data shows analysts expect third quarter S P 500 earnings to fall by 4 1  on a year over year  Y o Y  basis  That follows a drop of 0 4  in the second quarter and 0 3  in the first  If confirmed  Q3 2019 would mark the first time in three years that the benchmark index reported three consecutive quarters of earnings declines and the largest slide in earnings reported by the index since Q1 2016 when it contracted 6 9   

At the sector level  six are projected to report a Y o Y decline in earnings  led by Energy  Information Technology and Materials  While only four are expected to report annualized earnings growth  led by Utilities and Real Estate 
Industrials is the single sector forecast to post flat Y o Y earnings 





Revenue growth expectations are equally concerning  The estimated Y o Y rate for Q3 2019 is just 2 7  and would mark the lowest revenue growth rate for the index since Q3 2016  Three of the eleven sectors are predicted to report a Y o Y drop in revenue  led once again by the Materials and Energy sectors  Meanwhile  eight sectors are projected to report Y o Y revenue growth  with Health Care and Utilities leading 




2 Sectors Set To Disappoint Energy  Sliding Crude Oil Prices 
Lower crude oil prices are taking their toll on the Energy sector  which is expected to report the largest Y o Y decline in earnings of all eleven sectors at  35 2   The average price of oil in the June September period was  56 44  down 19  from the same period a year earlier   





Three of the six sub industries in the Energy sector are projected to report a decline in earnings for the quarter  Stocks in the Oil   Gas Exploration   Production group are anticipated to fare the worst  with an EPS predicted to drop a whopping  46   Integrated Oil   Gas  and Oil   Gas Refining   Marketing are also forecast to see a decline in their respective earnings  at  45  and  15  

With West Texas Intermediate crude down 7 5  in the third quarter alone  25 of the 28 companies in the group  89   have seen a decrease in their mean EPS estimate  led by  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM   down from  1 15 to  0 73    Chevron   NYSE CVX   to  1 66 from  2 10  and Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   to  0 51 from  1 00  
Materials  Dropping Commodity Prices
The Materials sector is expected to report the third highest Y o Y earnings decline of all eleven sectors  at a dismal  9 3   The sector is also forecast to suffer the largest Y o Y plunge in revenue  at  12 8   as sliding prices of commodities help drive the drop 




 

Two of the four sub industries in the sector are projected to report double digit earnings declines  Metals   Mining   55   and Containers   Packaging   15    The companies anticipated to lead the earnings slide for the sector are  Nucor   NYSE NUE  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   For Nucor  the mean Q3 2019 EPS estimate is  0 87  while the EPS a year ago was  2 33  For Freeport McMoRan  the mean Q3 2019 EPS estimate is  0 02  compared to the year ago EPS of  0 35 
Expect Strong Results From This Sector Utilities  All Sub Industries Forecast Growth
The Utilities sector is set to enjoy tailwinds from the Federal Reserve s rate cuts  as it is expected to report the highest Y o Y earnings growth of all eleven sectors  at  4 2   

All five of the sub industries in the sector are anticipated to report EPS growth  with Gas Utilities expecting a double digit increase   20   
 
At a company level   Duke Energy   NYSE DUK  and Nextera Energy  NYSE NEE  are two to watch  Duke s revenue forecast is  7 13 billion compared to sales of  6 63 billion a year ago  while Nextera is expecting to report revenue of  5 15 billion  beating last year s  4 42 billion reading

15809,237324,FCX,Oil Outlook  Earnings Season Will Provide Clues About Demand,opinion,"The U S  earnings season is beginning to provide some useful glimpses into where real oil demand is positioned  According to the U S  Energy Information Agency  69  of all the petroleum bought in the U S   or 14 16 million barrels a day  are used in transport  In that respect an update of Tesla s  NASDAQ TSLA  earnings and the level of sales for electric cars will be key to see how the balance of oil fuelled versus electric cars is changing 
In Europe the sight of cars being plugged into the sides of houses charging up for the night is becoming more and more common  particularly as the climate change protests have gathered steam  but the number of electric cars on the road still constitutes a relatively very small percentage of the overall cars 




Another useful gauge of petroleum demand are other resources companies  such as metal producers who have their finger on the pulse of industrial production  which makes up 25  of total oil demand  This week aluminium giant  Alcoa   NYSE AA   which sells aluminium to car producers and other major industries worldwide  warned that weakening economic conditions and trade tensions between China and the U S  will cause a decline in global industrial production  particularly in the car industry  Next week look out for results from miner Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  on Wednesday for an insight into the copper market  construction and electronics industries 
Results from ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are due on Thursday and will show how the company handled the last quarter of fluctuating oil prices which were pushed and pulled by crises in the Persian Gulf on the one hand and signals of  on the other  More information about the state of the domestic U S  oil industry will be provided by an update from U S  Well Services  a specialist in electric fracking services  which reported a slight quarter on quarter reduction in its Q2 net loss to  21 5m

Overall  the market looks fine to me  and I think the trade headlines blow over  There is likely only one person in the WH that doesn t want to repeal the tariffs  and at this point  President Trump needs to release the economy from this stranglehold it has been in  If that can happen  then perhaps the economy can begin to fire on all cylinders in 2020 and help to strengthen his re election bid 
Politics are not something we discuss much of  here  but like it or not  the polls will become a big part of 2020  The interesting thing with most of the polls I have observed today i to what he got in    It at least would suggest to me that he hasn t lost much favborbalitly if any at all despite the negative headlines  Why is that  I have my theories  I will keep private for the time 
STOCKS




 Roku  Inc  NASDAQ ROKU  filled a minor gap at  116 today  and the stock looks terrible  I was worried it might retrace back to  135 intraday  but only go to around  129  The stock is breaking down  and a drop below  116 sends it back to  100 
 Shopify Inc   NYSE SHOP   If you are in Shop  now is the time to GET nervous  The stock is on the cusp of another  20 drop to around  261  The last time the stock got to  285  it held  this time  it may not be so lucky 




Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  had a huge breakout today  rising above its old highs around  1300  That should act as a healthy level of support going forward  It would be healthy for the stock to consolidate around here 




 General Electric  Company  NYSE GE  continues to look healthy  heading towards  12 35 




Copper is trying to break out at  2 71  with the potential to rise to around  2 8 









Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   A big winner if copper does break out will be FCX  I spoke out FCX today  in a video  and could have some further to rise

15813,237328,FCX,2020 To Bring Long Awaited Relief To Freeport Investors,opinion,"It s been a rough couple of years for U S  based copper miner Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   The stock reached  20 25 a share in the first month of 2018  Now  in the last month of 2019  FCX is hovering around  12 10  Despite the significant recovery from as low as  8 43 in October  the stock is still down 40  since January 2018 
Can the recent two month rally be trusted or is it just another short lived recovery within the larger downtrend  With that question in mind  let s put the daily chart of Freeport stock in an Elliott Wave context 






The daily chart above reveals the entire wave structure since the bottom at  3 52 in January 2016  It can be seen as a leading diagonal in wave I A  followed by an  a   b   c  expanding flat correction in wave II B  Together  these two parts   motive and corrective   form a complete 5 3 Elliott Wave cycle 
Freeport Stock Looks Promising Heading into 2020 
Wave I A ended at  17 06 in January 2017  Wave II B occupies the rest of the chart as it took nearly three years to develop  The initial decline to  11 05 in wave  a  was followed by a simple a b c zigzag to a new high in wave  b   Wave  c  was a five wave impulse  labeled 1 2 3 4 5  where wave 5 is an ending diagonal 
If this count is correct  the current recovery must be the beginning of wave III C  which should be able to reach  21 and beyond  Another reason for optimism is the fact that wave  c  of II B seems to have terminated shortly after touching the 61 8  Fibonacci level  All told  2020 is shaping up to be a better year for Freeport McMoran investors ",2019-12-10,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2020-to-bring-longawaited-relief-to-freeport-investors-200491422,200491422

S P 500  SPY 





The S P 500 cleared three major hurdled last week as I talked about in yesterday write up  My expectation is for the index to continue to trend higher towards 3 000 

Amazon  AMZN 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  had a good week increasing above resistance at  1825  we can see it even acted as support later in the week  I think that pushes AMZN up towards  1900  But I have been saying that for weeks 





Cisco  CSCO 
Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  is also starting to look much better  with a stock that is approaching resistance at  49 30  Should CSCO break out above that resistance it could result in CSCO rising back to  51 





AMD  AMD 

The chart for AMD doesn t look right  with strong resistance around  31 40  I m torn because the sector has been hot  but the chart for AMD seems lousy  I think it falls this week to  29 40 





NVIDIA  NVDA 

NVIDIA jumped over resistance at  178  and that may help to shares up to  198 





Alibaba  BABA 




 Alibaba   NYSE BABA  is at resistance at  179  and now with the trade war worries on hold  a break out sends the stock higher towards  188 
JD  JD 

Jd Com  NASDAQ JD  is once again back to resistance at  31 50  and every time it gets there  it fails  Not this time  This time  I think the stock is going to break out and rise finally  towards  34 80 





Intel  INTC 




Intel  NASDAQ INTC  is close to breaking a downtrend which could send its stock higher towards  53 60

15853,237368,FCX,You ll Never Catch Me  Copper ,opinion,"Much has been made recently about copper s decline in value  The fabled  Doc Copper  is supposed to be a harbinger of economic direction  I m not so sure  but I will say that the continuous contract of the metal is fascinating  particularly because it s one of the very few instances in which a Fibonacci fanline seems to be instructive about key levels of support and resistance 





As you can see in the chart above  copper is teetering on a precipice  and its downtrend could start to get even more powerful should it break the fanline  I am betting this is a nearly forgone conclusion 
However  the correlation between copper and stocks is a bit iffy  to say the least  Comparing the SPY  NYSE SPY  to Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   Freeport McMoran  for example seems to illustrate they are in separate universes 





It s a little more interesting when you compare the SPY to the continuous contract itself  The first third of the chart  on the left side  certainly suggests that copper and stocks were joined at the hip  The rest of the time  however  they drifted apart like two cruise ships heading toward utterly different ports of call 





I m inclined to think the whole Doc Copper thing is about as useful as the SuperBowl indicator  but it was fun to experiment with a few charts anyway ",2019-08-05,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/youll-never-catch-me-copper-200450582,200450582
15861,237376,FCX,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Trade rhetoric could hang over the market in the coming week  as investors watch further developments surrounding the ongoing trade spat between the U S  and China 
Headlines on trade were a positive last week  including one that the U S  was considering rolling back tariffs and another that China was offering to ramp up U S  imports 
The holiday shortened week ahead also marks the first big week of the fourth quarter earnings season on Wall Street  with nearly 60 S P companies set to report 
On the data front  economic reports will be limited due to the government shutdown  Regularly scheduled durable goods will not be available  but there will be existing home sales data on Tuesday 
U S  markets will remain closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr  Day 
Elsewhere  China will be the first major economy to report fourth quarter growth data when it publishes its GDP numbers this week  amid warnings from analysts that the ongoing trade dispute with the U S  was likely to drag on economic activity 
Meanwhile  in central bank news  monetary policy announcements from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will be on the agenda  though it s highly unlikely either will rock the boat policy wise 
Political headlines will also be in focus as investors watch developments surrounding the U S  government shutdown  now in its 29th day  and British Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit plan 
Another headliner this week will be the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  which kicks off on Tuesday  The forum will not be attended by U S  President Donald Trump or representatives of his administration as a result of the government shutdown  Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron also won t be in attendance 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  U S  China Trade Optimism
Markets will also be keeping abreast of the ongoing trade spat between the U S  and China to see if any more news materializes amid recent signs the world s two biggest economies are working to resolve their differences 
U S  President Donald Trump said on Saturday there has been progress toward a trade deal with China  but denied that he was considering lifting tariffs on Chinese imports 
 Things are going very well with China and with trade   he told reporters at the White House  adding that he had seen some  false reports  indicating that U S  tariffs on Chinese products would be lifted 
 If we make a deal certainly we would not have sanctions and if we don t make a deal we will   Trump said 
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the U S  on Jan  30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington 
That follows lower level negotiations held in Beijing last week to resolve the bitter dispute between the world s two largest economies by March 2  when the Trump administration is scheduled to increase tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods 
2  Fourth Quarter Earnings Season Kicks into High Gear
There are about 60 S P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead  including seven Dow stocks  in what will be the second big week of the fourth quarter earnings season 
Tuesday sees Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Travelers  NYSE TRV   and  Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD  post results in the morning  while  IBM   NYSE IBM  is due in after the close along with TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD   and  Capital One   NYSE COF  
On Wednesday  Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   United Technologies  NYSE UTX   Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT   and Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  report earnings in pre market hours  while Ford  NYSE F   Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN    United Rentals   NYSE URI   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   and  Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS  will post results in the evening 
American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU   Textron  NYSE TXT   Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   and Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  are on the docket Thursday morning  After the close  results are expected from Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   E TRADE  NASDAQ ETFC   and Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  
Finally  corporate results from AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  and DR Horton  NYSE DHI  round up the week on Friday 



3  China Q4 GDP
China is to release fourth quarter GDP figures on Monday morning 
The report is expected to show the world s second largest economy grew 6 4  in the October December quarter from a year earlier  slowing from the previous quarter s 6 5  pace and matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis 
The Asian nation will also publish data on December industrial production  fixed asset investment and retail sales along with the GDP report 
Recent data has started to show that China s economy may be losing steam  raising concerns about the potential fallout from the ongoing U S  China trade dispute 
The U S  has slapped tariffs on more than half of over  500 billion in Chinese imports  for which China has retaliated  after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U S  complaints over Chinese industrial policies and lack of market access in China 
4  European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep interest rates at their current record low levels at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting at 12 45 GMT  7 45AM ET  on Thursday 
President Mario Draghi will hold a closely watched press conference 45 minutes after the rate announcement as investors seek further clues on when the central bank plans to start hiking borrowing costs 
After ending its asset purchase program at its previous meeting in December  markets expected the ECB would follow with a rate rise in the third quarter of 2019 
But a barrage of weak data suggesting growth has slowed prompted traders to push back expectations for a rate hike to the fourth quarter of this year 
This week s calendar also features flash January PMI surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity  which should give further indication of how the region s economy is coping with global trade conflicts and messy Brexit negotiations 
5  Bank of Japan Policy Meeting 
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep monetary policy unchanged at its two day rate review ending on Wednesday  maintaining a pledge to guide short term interest rates at minus 0 1  and long term bond yields around zero percent 
It will also issue a quarterly report analyzing Japan s economy that will include fresh growth and inflation forecasts through the fiscal year ending in March 2021 
BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a press conference afterward to discuss the decision 
According to sources familiar with the central bank s thinking  the BoJ is expected to cut its inflation forecasts to reflect recent declines in oil prices  but maintain its upbeat assessment that Japan s economy will keep expanding moderately

15862,237377,FCX,U S  copper projects gain steam thanks to electric vehicle trend,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
YERINGTON  Nev   Reuters    Once seen as a laggard in the global mining industry  U S  copper deposits have quietly drawn more than  1 1 billion in investments from small and large miners alike as Tesla and other electric carmakers scramble for more of the red metal 
Four U S  copper projects are set to open by next year   the first to come online in more than a decade   with several mine expansions also underway across the country  home to the world s fifth largest copper reserves  according to the U S  Geological Survey 
The rising popularity of electric vehicles   which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines   and increasingly pro mining policies in the U S  while other nations exert greater control over their mineral deposits are fueling the spending  according to mining executives and investors 
 Fifteen years ago  U S  mining was thought to be a dead industry  but now it s a profitable area for us   said Richard Adkerson  chief executive of Freeport McMoran Inc  N FCX  
The Phoenix based miner  which last month relinquished majority control of the world s second largest copper mine under pressure from the Indonesian government even though it will remain the project s operator  is set to open a  850 million expansion of one of its Arizona copper mines next year 
 The U S  is really the core for our future growth   Adkerson said  The U S  is home to half of Freeport s reserves 
The buildouts are expected to boost U S  copper production by at least 8 percent in the next four years  according to data from the International Copper Study Group and DBS  with  Nevada Copper Corp   TO NCU    Taseko Mines Ltd   TO TKO   THEMAC Resources Group Ltd  V MAC  and  Excelsior Mining Corp   TO MIN  aiming to open copper mines by the end of 2020 
The development trend has gone largely under the radar  with copper industry customers like Tesla Inc  O TSLA    rather than miners themselves   grabbing the headlines  But that is slowly changing 
The prospect of a copper boom in the U S   where the Trump administration is pushing for mining permit approvals to be approved five times faster and where resource nationalism fears are largely absent  is starting to draw major institutional investors 
Industry analysts recommend investors buy shares of companies building new U S  copper mines  a marked change from just 12 months ago when most recommendations were to hold 
Four analysts  for instance  advise buying Taseko shares  none did a year ago  These analysts also have set price targets for the miners at more than double current trading levels  according to Refinitiv data 
 The copper industry needs areas of good supply with low political risk  and that s what we get in the United States   said Stephen Gill of Switzerland based Pala Investments  Nevada Copper s largest shareholder 
 COPPER IS KING 
Nevada Copper s Pumpkin Hollow copper project in Yerington  Nevada is less than 60 miles  100 km  from Tesla s massive Gigafactory  a proximity that Gill said was a key factor in Pala s investment 
Surrounded by onion farms and backed by the Sierra Nevada mountains  the Pumpkin Hollow mine will produce more than 100 000 tons of copper each year once its underground and open pit portions fully open  which is slated to happen in phases 
 Copper is king for this electrification trend taking over the global economy   said Matt Gili  Nevada Copper s chief executive   We see demand increasing steadily in the years ahead and  so far  supply is not keeping up  
Majors Freeport   Rio Tinto   L RIO  and BHP Group Ltd  AX BHP  also have U S  copper projects of their own under development  These come just as copper prices are forecast to rise more than 10 percent in the next two years  according to Canaccord Genuity 
Nevada Copper s project has been largely supported by local residents in a state whose economy is linked to mining  But elsewhere  there has been opposition due to concerns about water rights and native lands 
 Green technologies can have a dark side   said John Hadder of Great Basin Resource Watch  a Nevada based environmental group 
SMALL VERSUS BIG
Nevada Copper and other junior miners have an advantage over larger peers  Their smaller balance sheets force them to plan small copper mines  making permitting and negotiations with local residents easier 
Rio and BHP  for instance  have been trying since 2001 to open Arizona s Resolution Copper mine  one of the world s largest projects of its type 
The two are still waiting for regulatory clearance  having spent more than  1 3 billion since 2001  in a delay brought on partly by a dispute involving local American Indian tribes 
The mine is not slated to open until at least 2030  The U S  Forest Service is expected to post a draft environmental study on the project by this summer  after which American Indian groups and others will be able to give feedback 
Rio is also studying ways to open the mine sooner   perhaps a year or two   by making engineering changes  but nothing has been finalized  said Arnaud Soirat  head of Rio Tinto s copper and diamond businesses 
Resolution is on U S  federal land  complicating the development  Many of the projects that are set to open in the next two years  though  are on private land  fueling an easier path to bring copper to a hungry market 

 I m convinced over time there will be a global movement toward renewable energy generation and electric vehicles     that means the world will need our U S  copper   said Freeport CEO Adkerson ",2019-01-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-copper-projects-gain-steam-thanks-to-electric-vehicle-trend-1755959,1755959
15863,237378,FCX,Stocks   Market Ends Mixed as Dow Sees Red on Fresh Trade Jitters,news,"Investing com   Wall Street closed mixed Thursday  as a rally in chip stocks helped offset some investor worries about a lack of progress on U S  China trade talks 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0 09  and the S P 500 gained 0 14   The Nasdaq Composite rose 0 68  
A slew of blowout earnings from chip companies ushered in a sea of green across tech 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 6   led by chipmaker Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  as its above consensus earnings and guidance sent its share price soaring more than 18  
Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  also delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines  while Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  results were mixed 
The sunny spell for semis helped offset fresh concerns over U S  China trade 
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered an update on the progress of U S  China trade talks  admitting in an interview with CNBC  that both parties were still  miles and miles  from resolving their differences on trade 
The latest update on trade arrived just days after President Donald Trump touted optimism  insisting that  we re doing very well in our negotiations with China  
Time is running out for both sides to reach an agreement before March 1  after which  in the absence of an agreement  the U S  could raise duties on imports from China to 25  from 10  
The months long trade war has weighed on risk sentiment  with many U S  businesses flagging the tariffs on imported Chinese goods as a key driver of increased costs  which have compressed margins 
On the domestic front  the partial government shutdown looks set to continue after the Senate rejected rival bills to end the shutdown 
The Democrats  bill aimed to reopen the government without the  5 7 billion President Donald Trump has demanded to build the border wall  The Republicans  measure included funding for the wall and offered some legal protection for immigrants  Neither measure secured the 60 votes needed to pass 
Airlines  meanwhile  caught a bid as investors cheered a above consensus earnings from Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  and JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU   with each ending the day more than 5  higher 
The energy sector rebounded from a slide a day earlier  thanks to rising U S  oil prices as a surge in domestic crude inventories was offset by hopes U S  sanctions on Venezuela s crude exports could curb global supplies

Falling energy stocks also weighed on the broader market following a slump in oil prices as weak Chinese industrial production data flagged concerns about global growth that could hurt global oil demand growth

U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  a China trade hawk  will lead the discussions  President Donald Trump s administration said

15868,237383,FCX,Sector Rotation Sends Technology Stocks Lower And Banks Higher,opinion,"It was a rather dull day on Monday with the S P 500 finishing the day flat  However  underneath the surface  there was some sector rotation that was taking place  It sent the financial and energy stocks higher  and technology lower 

Based on the movement in yield and oil  the rotation seems rational and somewhat logical  The big question is if it will last  That part I m not sure at this point  One day doesn t make a trend  but I do not happen to think that oil and yields can continue to rise a bit more   

S P 500  SPY 




The good news is that the index is holding support around 2975  Nothing in my outlook has changed 
Russell  IWM 





The Russell had a great day  rising by over 1  today  and is attempting to clear resistance at 1 521  I think that is positive and that 1 536 is likely next 
Roku  ROKU 





Is the  Roku   NASDAQ ROKU  bubble popping  It certainly seems possible  The stock s valuation makes Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  look cheap  But at this point  you can see that the uptrend is still intact  However  should the stock drop below  155 then perhaps it sends the  100  But  155 is the level to watch 
Freeport  FCX 

Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  jumped today  and the next level to watch for is  9 90 




Lululemon  LULU 

 Lululemon Athletica   NASDAQ LULU  was down today after last week s significant gains  But for now  it holds support at  195  However  a break of support will send shares towards  189 





Apple  AAPL 

Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  got close to failed at resistance around  217  I saw bearish options betting in the stock  It has me thinking that perhaps the stocks run may cool some    209 50 is the next level of support

MACRO
Fed Futures

Fed Funds futures are currently trading at 1 875   which fall pretty much in the middle of the 1 75 and 2  range  That rate has been on the rise since the beginning of September  Additionally  the CME Group now projects just an 80  chance of a 25 bps rate cut next week   That is down from a 90  chance last week 




So we can wait and see what develops next week  I d be surprised if the Fed doesn t cut rates

It looks like there is a bullish pennant pattern that is forming on the intraday of the S P 500   I think it is positive for the start of next week

AMD  AMD 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  had a nice turn around this past week after falling to the support level we had been targeting at  27 40  I think it continues to move higher  I have seen a lot of bullish betting in the stock over the past week or so  The next level I m looking for is at  29 40  then  31 40

1        That the company just reported disappointing results  and
2        It suffers from protracted neglect or unpopularity 
There are plenty of these companies right now on the stock exchanges

Screening for Bargain Stocks
Graham suggests looking for stocks that are trading at 52 week lows  which would indicate they were unpopular  as well stocks selling for less than net value of net working capital

15883,237398,FCX,3 Sectors To Avoid Ahead Of Q1 2019 Earnings Season,opinion,"With less than a week to go until the start of Wall Street s Q1 earnings season  investors are bracing for what may be the first U S  profit decline since the second quarter of 2016  FactSet data show analysts expect first quarter S P 500 earnings to fall by 3 9  on a year over year basis  If confirmed  it would also represent the largest YoY decline in earnings since the first quarter of 2016 
Estimated earnings per share  EPS  for the first quarter have fallen by 7 2  since December 31  according to FactSet  This percentage decline is heftier than the 5 year average   3 2    the 10 year average   3 7    and the 15 year average   4 0   for a quarter  As well  relative to recent quarters  a larger percentage of S P 500 companies have lowered the bar for earnings for the first quarter 

Of the 107 companies that have issued Q1 EPS guidance  79 have released negative forecasts  At the sector level  seven are projected to report a year over year decline in earnings  led by the Energy  Materials  and Information Technology 

1  Energy
The Energy sector is expected to report the largest year over year earnings decline of all eleven sectors   18 4   as lower oil prices helped drive the expected decline  Despite an increase in price during the current quarter  the average price of oil in Q1 2018   62 89  was 13  higher than the average price of oil in Q1 2019   54 81  
Overall  26 of the 29 companies  90   in the Energy sector have seen a decrease in their mean EPS estimate  led by Hess Corporation  NYSE HES   to   0 32 from   0 02   Noble Energy  NYSE NBL   to   0 03 from  0 16  and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV   to   0 01 from  0 07   At the sub industry level  four of the six sub industries in the sector are projected to report a decline in earnings for the quarter  Integrated Oil   Gas   23    S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Select Industry   21    Oil   Gas Refining   Marketing   16    and S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services Select Industry   16   
As well  the Energy sector is expected to report the highest year over year decline in revenue of all eleven sectors at  3 5  
2  Materials
The second largest year over year earnings drop is expected to come from the Materials sector  at  12 2   At the industry level  three of the four industries in this sector are predicted to report a decline in earnings for the quarter  One of these thee industries  Metals   Mining  is anticipated to report a serious double digit decline   40  
Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  and DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP  are expected to see the most significant earnings declines within the sector  The mean EPS estimate for Freeport McMoRan for Q1 2019 is  0 08  compared to year ago EPS of  0 46  while the mean EPS estimate for DowDuPont for Q1 2019 is  0 87  compared to year ago EPS of  1 12 
The two companies are so heavily weighted within the sector  that  were they to be excluded  the estimated earnings growth rate would rise to 0 4  from  12 2  
3  Information Technology
The Information Technology sector is projected to report the third highest year over year earnings slump of all eleven sectors  at  10 5   Three of the six industries in the sector are expected to report a decline in earnings for the quarter  Indeed  two of these three are projected to report double digit earnings declines  Semiconductors   Semiconductor Equipment   23   and Dow Jones Technology Hardware   Equipment   22   
Of the 68 companies in the Information Technology sector  50  or 74   have seen a decrease in their mean EPS  Of these 50 companies  21 have recorded a decrease in their mean EPS estimate of more than 10   led by Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   to  0 47 from  1 11   NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   to  0 62 from  1 30   and Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR   to  0 21 from  0 37  
However  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU  are expected to be the largest contributors to the decline in earnings for the sector 
This sector has also witnessed an unusually high number of companies issuing negative revenue guidance for the quarter  Overall  31 companies in the sector have released negative revenue guidance  which is above the 5 year average  20  ",2019-04-08,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-sectors-to-avoid-ahead-of-q1-2019-earnings-season-200404599,200404599

15887,237402,FCX,2 Mining Stocks To Watch Tomorrow,opinion,"It s a busy week for Cleveland Cliffs Inc  NYSE CLF   with the mining firm hosting its annual shareholders meeting today  and reporting first quarter earnings before the market opens tomorrow  April 25  At last check  CLF stock was trading up 0 6  at  9 55  but could be in for a bigger move tomorrow  if history is any guide 
Trade Alert pegs CLF s implied earnings deviation at 13 1   much wider than the 6 9  next day move the stock has averaged over the past two years  The closest any of the last eight earnings reactions have been to tomorrow s projected move was a 12 7  single session gain last July  while last quarter  the equity jumped 8 5  the day after earnings 
Another post earnings move to the upside could shake some of the weaker bearish hands loose  Short interest on CLF stock rose 11 7  in the two most recent reporting periods to 58 66 million shares  This accounts for one fifth of the security s available float  or 6 2 times the average daily pace of trading 
On the charts  Cleveland Cliffs has had a tough month  down 13 6  since its April 3 peak at  11 07  However  the shares appear to have found a familiar floor near  9 20    a region that served as support in late March  and is home to a 61 8  Fibonacci retracement of CLF s rally from its Dec  26 low at  7 40 to its Feb  8 high at  12 26 

Arizona based mining company Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  will report its first quarter results ahead of tomorrow s open  as well  The consensus per share estimate is 7 cents  according to Refinitiv  and the firm has beat per share profit forecasts in two of the past four quarters 
FCX stock  however  has closed lower in the session subsequent to earnings in each of the past four quarters  averaging a loss of 9 2   This time around  the options market is pricing in an 8 9  next day move  regardless of direction

15889,237404,FCX,Freeport  FCX  Provides Operational Update  Revises Q2 View,opinion,Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX   announced an update on operations and guidance at PT Freeport Indonesia  PT FI   Moreover  the company provided revised estimates for the second quarter of 2019 as well as reaffirmed earlier announced 2019 guidance for consolidated copper and gold sales volumes In second quarter 2019  PT FI achieved significant milestones related to its newly commissioned underground mining operations in Grasberg  The company stated that the undercutting in the Grasberg Block Cave surpassed 20 000 sq  meters  more than 20  from prior forecast Moreover  extraction of ore ramped up from an average of 5 000 metric tons per day during the first quarter to roughly 9 000 metric tons per day in June 2019  The company expects ore extraction to reach 15 000 metric tons per day by the end of 2019 The company expects to produce 8 billion pounds of copper and 8 million ounces of gold from the Deep Mill Level Zone  DMLZ  underground mine over its life  In June  undercutting in the DMLZ underground mine initiated on the second production block for mine extraction  Production at the mine rose to an average of around 9 000 metric tons of ore per day in June from an average of 6 800 metric tons of ore per day during the first quarter  The company expects production from the mine to reach 11 000 metric tons of ore per day by the end of 2019 Regarding the Grasberg open pit  PT FI continues to mine the final stages  In second quarter 2019  PT FI opened an additional mining area  which will extend pit life options into third quarter 2019 and beyond  Access to high grade material were delayed due to mine sequencing changes in the open pit during the second quarter  This led to lower gold and copper production from the open pit than the initial estimates provided by the company in April 2019   For second quarter 2019  Freeport projects consolidated copper sales volumes to approximate the April 2019 estimates of 800 million pounds  Higher copper sales from the Americas are expected to offset lower copper sales from Indonesia  Gold sales are expected to be roughly 190 000 ounces  lower than the previous expectation of 265 000 ounces  The decline can be attributed to mine sequencing changes in the Grasberg open pit that delayed the company s access to high grade material Moreover  Freeport expects copper sales to be recorded at an average price of roughly  2 73 per pound  In March  the company provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations totaling 364 million pounds at average price of  2 94 per pound  However  the company anticipates that mark to market impact of lower copper prices in the second quarter to lower revenues by roughly  85 million Notably  unit net cash costs from the Americas for the second quarter are expected to be in line with prior estimates  The company currently estimates consolidated unit net cash costs to be roughly 15  higher from the prior guidance of  1 67 per pound of copper given in April 2019 Based on the projected realized prices and updated gold sales and cost outlook for the second quarter  the company projects adjusted EBITDA to be roughly  430 million  It also expects to record a loss of roughly 5 cents per share to net income before any non recurring items The company projects consolidated sales for 2019 to be in line with the estimates provided in April  Consolidated gold sales are forecast to be 0 8 million ounces and consolidated copper sales are estimated to be 3 3

After earnings per share  EPS  contracted 0 3  in the first quarter  FactSet data show analysts expect second quarter S P 500 earnings to fall by 2 6  on a year over year  Y o Y  basis  If confirmed  it would also represent the largest annualized drop in earnings reported by the index since Q2 2016  when it fell 3 2  FactSet notes 
Relative to recent quarters  a larger percentage of S P 500 companies have lowered the bar for earnings for the April June period  Of the 114 companies that have issued Q2 EPS guidance  88  or 77   released negative forecasts  The only time the number was higher was in the first quarter of 2016  which saw 92 companies issue negative guidance 
At the sector level  six are projected to report a decline in Y o Y earnings  led by Materials and Information Technology  On the other hand  Utilities and Health Care are the strongest of the five sectors predicted to report annualized earnings growth 


Revenue growth expectations of 3 8  Y o Y are just as worrying  If confirmed  Q2 would mark the index s lowest revenue growth rate since the third quarter of 2016  Three of the eleven sectors are predicted to report a Y o Y drop in revenue  driven lower once again by the Materials and Information Technology sectors  Meanwhile  eight sectors are projected to report Y o Y revenue growth  propelled by the Communication Services and Health Care sectors 

Q2 Earnings Season  2 Sectors To Avoid
1  Materials  Sliding Commodity Prices

2  Information Technology  U S  China Trade War
The second largest Y o Y earnings drop is expected to come from the Information Technology sector at  11 9   The sector is also forecast to suffer the second largest Y o Y drop in revenue at  1 1   with the impact of the U S  China trade war taking a toll 
The Information Technology sector witnessed an unusually high number of companies issuing negative guidance for the quarter  Overall  26 companies in the sector have warned that earnings may miss  which is above the 5 year average of 20 
Two of the six sub industries in the sector are expected to report a decline in earnings for the quarter  Indeed  both are estimated to report double digit earnings declines  Semiconductors   Semiconductor Equipment   31   and Technology Hardware   Equipment   22   
At the company level  Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU  is predicted to be the largest contributor to the decline in earnings for the sector  The Idaho based memory and storage company reported EPS of  1 05 for Q2 2019 on June 25  down 39  from EPS of  3 15 in the same quarter a year earlier  Revenue totaled  4 79 billion  down from  7 80 billion in the year ago period

15947,237462,FCX,Copper Industry Carnage  The Worst Is Yet To Come ,opinion,"The second largest copper mining company in the world saw its stock price plummet by nearly 15  yesterday due to poor earnings  Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  fourth quarter net income fell nearly 90  compared to the same period last year  The large decline in net income was attributed to falling production  due to scheduled maintenance  and lower copper prices 
Freeport McMoRan s stock price  FCX  started trading in premarket after releasing its dismal earnings at  12 30 a share  and by the time the closing bell rang  the stock fell to  10 70  FCX lost a  1 86 in one day 

According to the company s financial results  Freeport s net income fell to  140 million Q4 2018 compared to  1 04 billion during the same period last year  While it s true that the company s poor results were due to a decline in production  another reason was the lower copper price which fell to an average of  2 75 in Q4 2018 versus  3 21 in the same quarter last year 
The copper price was trading at a high of  3 30 at the beginning of 2018 but has now fallen by more than 20  to  2 64  The drop in the copper price over the past year has negatively impacted Freeport s share price  FCX share price has fallen from nearly  20 in January 2018 to  10 70 as of the close on Thursday s trading  Jan 24th  

Freeport s stock price is shown in the candlesticks while the copper price is shown in the orange line  I didn t put a line in the chart  but if Freeport falls below the  9 50 level indicated by the arrow  it doesn t have any support below it for quite a while  Unfortunately for Freeport  my analysis suggests that the copper price is getting ready to take the next stage lower along with the broader markets 
As I mentioned weeks ago  the copper price was stuck between two moving averages and would likely stay there until it fell below it substantially  On January 4th  the copper price was trading at  2 65  in between the 50   200 Month Moving Averages  MMA  

If you look at the magnified view  you can see the copper price positioned between the RED LINE  50 MMA  and the PINK LINE  200 MMA   Now  if we look at the copper chart on January 15th  see how much has changed 

The copper price was at  2 63 but was still stuck between the moving averages nearly ten days later  While the copper price trades up and down during the day  it continues to close between the moving averages  So  let s look at the most recent copper chart done today  Who wants to guess as to where the copper price closed today 

Well  look at that  The copper price is a penny more today than it was nearly ten days ago and it is still stuck between those moving averages  While the type of candlestick isn t a rare formation  we can definitely see the tug of war going on in the trading pits  Also  this was the same setup with the oil chart in December before the price fell  Interestingly  the oil price only remained between the moving averages for a week before it headed lower  However  the copper price continues to trade in the same place for nearly four weeks 
I believe the reason the copper price hasn t fallen yet has to do with the strength of the broader markets as they recovered from their lows on Christmas Eve  The copper price will likely begin its next stage lower along with the broader markets within the next week or so 
The carnage in the copper industry has only begun  If the copper price falls below the  2 08 level  300 MMA Orange line   shown in the chart above  then it can be very ugly for the copper mining companies who are just beginning to feel the pain

McDonalds  MCD 
McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s was upgraded at Stephens to overweight from equal weight  while the price target was raised to  200 from  180  Unfortunately  I have never understood the love affair with this stock  It is a company that has shrinking revenue  while it grows its EPS from cost reduction and buy backs 
If you have read me long enough  you know that I am bearish on McDonald s  However  I have been wrong for some time  as the stock never breaks below the  155 level 
There appears to be a double forming in the stock  and a break below  170 confirms that double top  The RSI continues to point to a stock that is heading lower over time  not higher

15949,237464,FCX,Stocks May See A Steep Decline February 20 ,opinion,"S P 500  SPY 
Stocks continued to rise on Tuesday with the S P 500 increasing 15 basis points to close around 2 780  We are now about 15 points from our zone of resistance at 2 795  I m getting the sense that the rally may pause tomorrow  February 20 with a steep pullback to around 2 750 over the next day or two  There appears to be short term rising wedge forming in the S P 500  and then there is a pretty sizeable gap at that level  It would at the very least suggest a drop to 2 760 

I don t think it changes anything longer term  I don t think a one or two day sell off is the end of a rebound in global growth or stocks  It will be a one or two sell off  nothing more and nothing less  I m sure all the headline will be something bearish like   The Next Big Wave Lower Is Upon Us   with this big scary bear  but I don t believe that to the case 
I could be wrong  and the S P 500 can continue to rally  I see a pullback in stock prices at the moment 
NASDAQ
We can see a similar pattern has formed in the NASDAQ as well 

Boeing  BA 
Boeing Co  NYSE BA  is one example of a stock that has a similar pattern forming in the chart  Maybe we will get some  trade news  tomorrow that reads something like  U S  and China still light years apart 

Industrials  XLI 
The same pattern is present in the industrial ETF the Industrial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLI  

Consumers  XLY 
Here it is again in the consumer discretionary ETF Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY  

Be prepared  that s all  Don t be shocked  Again  maybe I m wrong  but a lot of charts are all pointing to the same thing  hard to ignore  Still  at this point  I m not concerned 
Yields
Here is one more thing  look at the 10 year yield  Does this look like a chart that is about to rise sharply  Not to me  How do Christmas Eve lows sound  Certainly speaks to falling stock prices 

Copper
Did you see the monster break out in copper today  Yes  it rose all the way to  2 86  That is a big move for copper  watch for  2 91 

Roku
That may be all Roku Inc  NASDAQ ROKU  wrote  The stock reached about  55 50 and backed off  Close enough to our  56 target if you ask me  The gap is filled  Next stop is probably  48 

Freeport  FCX 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  had its big break out today  and as long as copper keeps rising  Freeport stands a chance to increase to  13 90 

General Electric  GE 
General Electric Company  NYSE GE  is at the point where if it will continue to rise  it needs to do it soon  Otherwise  my idea of it rising to  12 20  will be finished  The RSI suggests that it does continue to increase 

Advanced Micro Devices  AMD 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  looks like it is getting ready to rise and break out  after consolidating the last few days  A break out could take the stock on towards  I would think   29

15950,237465,FCX,Will 2019 Be The Year Of King Copper ,opinion,"Because of its wide availability and exceptional conductivity  copper is found in everything from consumer products to automobiles to semiconductors  Last year global demand for the red metal stood at 23 6 million tons  and by 2027  it s projected to reach just under 30 million tons  representing an average annual growth rate of about 2 6 percent 
This phenomenal growth is attributable not just to the   art 200125490  rise of middle class consumers    It s also thanks to our steady rotation into clean  renewable energy such as wind and solar which is good news for copper demand going forward 
As I ve shared with you before  renewables require many more times the amount of copper as traditional energy sources  A typical wind farm those that blanket whole areas of West Texas  California and some other states can contain as much as 15 million tons of the metal 
2018 Was a Record Breaking Year for Renewables
Whether you re a believer in renewable energy or not  the tipping point may have already occurred  Among the fastest growing jobs in the U S  right now are wind turbine service technician and solar panel installer  for whatever that s worth  And according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance  BNEF   corporate purchasing of renewable energy more than doubled from 2017 to 2018  Globally  companies bought 13 4 gigawatts  GW  last year  compared to the previous record of 6 1 gigawatts in 2017  Over 63 percent of the purchasing activity occurred right here in the U S  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  alone was responsible for consuming 2 6 GW of renewables  three times as much as the next biggest corporate energy buyer  AT T  NYSE T  
The trend toward renewables is expected to accelerate at a white knuckle pace for years to come  Take a look at the chart below  courtesy of McKinsey s  Global Energy Perspective 2019   Analysts believe that  by 2035  renewable energy will account for more than half of all power generation as its price falls below that of coal and gas generated energy  Fifteen years after that  nearly three quarters of total energy consumed around the world will be derived from renewable means  chiefly wind and solar 
If this is compelling at all to you  now might be an excellent time to start participating  One of the best ways  I believe  is with exposure to high quality  well managed copper miners as well as funds that have a large position in copper mining 
China Will Lead the Transition from Internal Combustion Engines to Electric Cars
And we haven t even mentioned electric vehicles  EVs   which are notorious copper gobblers  As I ve shared with you before  EVs consume between three and four times the amount of copper as traditional internal combustion engines 
China is leading the world in EV adoption and will likely continue to do so for some time  In the fourth quarter of last year  China was responsible for 60 percent of global EV sales  according to Bloomberg  which adds that the country holds half of all vehicle charging infrastructure  By the end of last year  electric cars made up about 7 percent of total new vehicle sales in China  with a compound growth rate of 118 percent since 2011  In about a decade  the Asian country will account for nearly 40 percent of the global EV market  followed by Europe  26 percent  and the U S   20 percent   according to BNEF 
Not only does China have national subsidies in place  but its carmakers are also incentivized to manufacture EVs thanks to the country s  New Energy Vehicle  credit system  The system acts as an EV quota  requiring carmakers to generate credits through the sale of electric cars  According to BNEF  this is the  single most important piece of EV policy globally and is shaping automakers  electrification plans  
Adding to this acceleration is the fact that China has elevated the adoption of new  Phase 6  emissions standards under its anti pollution  Blue Sky Defense  action plan  Just as we re seeing in parts of Europe right now  China will soon begin banning the production of the most polluting diesel engines 
Many cities in China see the writing on the wall and have already enacted restrictions on gasoline powered vehicle sales  In 2018  Shenzhen and Shanghai collectively led the world with more than 165 000 EV sales  That s more than Norway and Germany combined 
With demand for EVs so high  it s little wonder that China s copper imports climbed to 479 000 tonnes in January  the second highest on record 
Morgan Stanley Bullish on Copper  Upgrades Freeport McMoRan
All of this leads me to believe that 2019 could be not only copper s year but also copper miners  year  The price of the red metal is up about 6 percent so far in 2019  trading at close to  2 80 a pound  That s about 67 percent short of the metal s all time high of  4 62  set in February 2011 
Last week Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  joined Citi and Goldman Sachs  in making a bullish call on the metal  The investment bank projected a 14 percent upside for copper in 2019  based on a widening supply deficit and the likelihood of a resolution to the U S  China trade spat 
As for copper miners  Morgan Stanley upgraded Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   while Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  recently upgraded Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Piyush Sood  lead analyst at Morgan Stanley  said in a note that Freeport s  earnings sensitivity to copper is still the highest among its peers  and combined with its high trading liquidity  we believe it will emerge as the go to large cap stock for exposure to a copper price rally   Shares of the Phoenix based company s stock jumped nearly 7 percent on the news last Wednesday 
Singapore based DBS Bank also sees a copper shortage over the mid term  Analysts expect supply to be in a deficit each year between now and at least 2022  when it could be at its widest since 2004 
 Copper is king for this electrification trend taking over the global economy   Matt Gilli  CEO of Nevada Copper  told Reuters   We see demand increasing steadily in the years ahead and  so far  supply is not keeping up  
To meet surging demand  four U S  copper projects are set to open by next year  the first to do so in decades  according to Reuters  And Ivanhoe Mines  founded by my friend Robert Friedland  is in the process of developing the Kamoa Kakula copper deposit in the Democratic Republic of Congo  which Robert describes as the second largest copper mine in the world 
 You re going to need a telescope to see copper prices in 2021   Robert told us when he visited our office last year

Aphria Inc   APHA 
Aphria Inc  TO APHA  the marijuana stock that we had a swing on since December  looks to me like it wants to go higher  On Wednesday  it was up 1 01  or 1   to 93 48  on 1 1 million shares  If it was a breakout that occurred in December  then it had a quick run up to resistance and pulled back  this was a breakout on Wednesday  in my opinion  It needs to take out 11  and then it will be headed to 14 and 16 1 2 
Everbridge  Inc   EVBG 
Everbridge Inc  NASDAQ EVBG  one of my top picks for the year  broke out and ran all the way up to a new  52 week high at 71 61 on Wednesday  before pulling back and closing at 57 95  up 3 69  or 5 74   on 1 5 million shares  With Wednesday s big volume  I think it will extend  The long term chart shows the top of the channel and potential target is in the low 80 s 
Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  one of our swing trades  is following through with a nice 3 day run  although on Wednesday it did back off and close up only 26 cents  or 2   to 13 35  on 38 2 million shares  I still think that after backing and filling a little  it s going to get to 15  and eventually 17 1 2 
Harrow Health  Inc   HROW 
Harrow Health Inc  NASDAQ HROW  broke out on Wednesday as well  popping 38 cents  or 6   to 6 68  on 680 237 shares traded  That s the biggest volume in 2 1 2 months  It looks to me like  that if it can get up above the spike high from January when it reached 6 75  it could see 7 75 and 9 00 
HUYA Inc   HUYA 
HUYA Inc  NYSE HUYA  another one of our swing trades  popped out of the consolidation area from the last three weeks  It had a nice run on Wednesday  up 1 95  or 9 73   to 22 00  on 5 4 million shares  That s the best volume we ve seen on an up day since mid November  I think this stock is headed for a quick retest of around 24  and then  eventually  26 and 30 will be doable 
Swing Trade
Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  NASDAQ LSCC  is doing fantastic  On Wednesday it exploded to 11 78  a 52 week high  closing at 11 75  up 52 cents  or 4 63   on 3 3 million shares  It closed at the highest level going back 14 15 years  I think this stock can extend to the mid 14 1 2 range

15978,237493,FCX,Wanna Buy A Copper Mine  Ask A Junior ,opinion,"As a general rule  the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information
Copper is one of the most abundant metals among the world s mined commodities  but getting your hands on a new copper mine is getting tougher and tougher  Despite the major miners wanting to add new supply to their pipelines  nobody wants to sell  and that is putting a renewed focus on high quality development projects like the Ootsa project being explored by Surge Copper Corp  V SURG  
Bloomberg explains the dilemma being faced by potential acquirers 

So what s the problem  For a start  nobody who owns a copper mine wants to give it up  Even when Glencore  LON GLEN  and Anglo American  LON AAL  Plc were crippled by debt during the 2015 commodity slump  neither was willing to entertain an offer from Rio for their holdings in the giant Collahuasi deposit in Chile  according to people familiar with those talks  who asked not to be identified 

When it comes to listed companies  there aren t that many options   U S  based Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  and Canada s First Quantum Minerals Ltd  TO FM  are among the only copper focused producers of any real size 
They all see the potential in copper  with its multiple uses including in construction and telecommunications  and its growing demand due to its importance for renewable energy applications and electric vehicles  where copper is used in the electric motor  batteries  inverters  wiring and in charging stations 
They also know about the coming copper crunch  Mine supply has failed to come to fruition due to regular labor disruptions at the world s major copper mines like Grasberg in Indonesia and Escondida in Chile  KPMG is predicting that by 2020 global copper demand will outstrip mine output 
Lower ore grades are also expected to be painted into the waning supply picture  Copper grades have declined about 25  in top producer Chile in the last decade   highlighting the urgent need for grassroots exploration to arrest the trend  Producing copper mines are feeling the pinch  having noticed a significant decline in resources 

London based commodities analyst CRU says unless new investments arise  existing mine production will drop from 20 million tonnes to below 12 million tonnes by 2034  leading to a supply shortfall of more than 15 million tonnes  That s because over 200 copper mines are expected to run out of ore before 2035  with not enough new mines in the pipeline to take their place

15979,237494,FCX,Unenthusiastic Rebound For Stocks From Stretched Conditions ,opinion,"AT40   51 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   54 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   12 1Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
CommentaryI flipped cautiously bullish last week  As I suspected  the prospects for a bounce were not as good as the previous time the stock market was similarly over stretched  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 1 1  in a week of choppy  sometimes slow motion  trading action 
On Monday  the index trickled higher into its short term downtrend line  It gapped down on Tuesday only to bounce right back for a breakout  On Thursday  the index gapped up  The index stopped short of its all time high  and I decided to take profits on my SPY call options  While the 20 day moving average  DMA  held well as support  I did not see enough strength to justify the risk of hanging around much longer  calls had an expiry this coming Friday   I will recharge the trade on the next dip to or toward the 20DMA  the dotted line in the graph  
The S P 500  SPY  found support at its 20DMA to rally back toward the all time high set at the end of August 
The NASDAQ and the Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  were a little more definitive than the S P 500 in their bounces away from 50DMA support  The 20DMA looks ready to become support for the current upswing The NASDAQ pivoted around its 20DMA in a wide range before breaking out of the latest churn  The intraday lows found support above the 50DMA 

QQQ swung widely below its uptrending 20DMA while finding support at its uptrending 50DMA  The week ended with a breakout holding 
While the major indices tentatively reached higher  the volatility index  the VIX  definitively imploded all over again  The VIX fell every single day of the week  Friday s drama beat Tuesday s drama by swinging all the way from above Thursday s intraday high to a close at a 3 week low  The overall swift return to complacency supports a bullish bias for the coming week even with the renewed headlines generating trade war angst 
The volatility index  the VIX  rapidly reversed the previous week s angst filled trading 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  sealed my impression of a tentative week  My favorite technical indicator swung around from lows to highs but barely made any progress  it closed the previous week at 48 0  and ended the week at 51 6   AT40 did little to confirm the stock market s bounce  The coming week could then hold good upside potential as loitering stocks get moving  The alternative scenario is a break of the 45  level that has held as support since late April  Such a move would require the kind of selling that creates oversold conditions  AT40 below 20    Needless to say  I am still holding my trading hedges 
CHART REVIEWS While AT40 exposed the lack of enthusiasm in the overall stock market rebound  there are of course  as always  dramatic stock moves of interest 
Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  When the herd is right  it is a powerful sight  The upward surge in AMD continues apace much to my surprise  Per my trading strategy  I jumped into AMD call options once the blow off topping action was invalidated  With analysts continuing to chase AMD with upgrades and bullish commentary  stubbornly betting with the herd has become the clear winner on AMD 

Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  continues to barrel upward through its upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel 
BHP Billiton  LON BLT  I used the latest sell off in commodities to finally switch around my BHP vs Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  pairs trade  The latest wave of selling in BHP reached a crescendo after the stock gapped down well below its lower Bollinger  Band  BB   Subsequent buying interest was strong enough to close BHP with a gain on the day  I bought call options near the close of that day  The stock has been off to the races ever since  Despite this show of strength off the lows  I still think of the commodity space as overall weak and suggesting that the global economy is not well BHP Billiton  BHP  bounced sharply from its recent low which successfully tested the 2018 low set in April 
Rio Tinto  RIO  RIO found a bottom with much less drama than BHP  I bought put options before the BHP call options  If RIO does not attract more interest soon  I anticipate new lows in due time Rio Tinto  RIO  bounced off a 13 month low 
Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  Declining copper prices compounded FCX s operational issues this year  The downtrend off January s high accelerated off July s temporary high  Like many commodity plays  buyers rushed into FCX at the intraday lows on Tuesday  September 11  The buying was strong enough to create a long hammer bottoming pattern  The following rebound so far has found stiff resistance at the downtrending 20DMA 
Freeport McMoran  FCX  created a long hammer bottom at a 14 month low  The 20DMA downtrend is still in effect however 
U S  Steel  NYSE X  U S  Steel is still not benefiting from the tariffs on steel  or perhaps it would have performed even worse than it is    Last week  X gapped down to a new 10 month low U S  Steel  X  is struggling at 10 month lows as it continues to confirm August s major 200DMA breakdown 
Cleveland Cliffs  NYSE CLF  While tariffs are not helping the stocks of steel producers like U S  Steel  makers of the iron ore used by domestic steel producers seem to be grabbing the lions share of the benefit  I missed out on CLF s great bounce off 50DMA support  I did not want to buy CLF without first reviewing the last earnings report  I simply never got around to doing that review 

Cleveland Cliffs  CLF  found firm support at its 50DMA and bounced back toward resistance at its 2009 intraday low 

Camping World Holdings  NYSE CWH I first covered CWH back in June  I did not buy because the stock gained 25  in just three days and stopped cold at 50DMA resistance  I decided not to buy the 50DMA breakout or even the subsequent test of the 50DMA as support  persistent weakness in sector mates Winnebago Industries  NYSE WGO  and Thor Industries  NYSE THO  made me wary and stayed my hand  Sure enough  the excitement over CWH faded away as a second test of 50DMA support gave way to a breakdown  CWH reported earnings on August 7th and the market responded by retesting the May and all time low  While buyers almost closed the gap down in the next 6 trading days  the stock faded all over again for another test of the all time lows  So despite the great things CWH s CEO had to say in June  I consider this stock and story broken all over again 

Camping World Holdings  CWH  slowly eroded most of its sharp gains from June  The 20DMA is now providing effective resistance 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Facebook bumped against stiff resistance at its downtrending 20DMA and dropped nearly straight down  Now the stock s lower BB is guiding the stock downward  I turned the crank on another short position this week  I have not been bearish enough on FB s chart  A test of the March and 2018 low is in play 

Facebook  FB  set new post earnings lows as its lower Bollinger Band  BB  channel guides the stock downward 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  GS is weak again and below its 50DMA  Last month  the 200DMA provided picture perfect resistance  I failed to catch that trade  I am now watching to see whether GS can hold support from August s 50DMA breakdown and low  If not  I will try a fresh short  put options   I am as yet undecided on whether I would go long on a new 50DMA breakout  Regardless  weakness in GS is just one more source of sector weakness that keeps me wary and cautious about the health of the stock market 
Goldman Sachs  GS  traded down 11 straight days to break below its 50DMA again 
Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  Speaking of sector weakness  semiconductors were smacked down again last week   outside of the fortunate few like AMD and Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA   A selling crescendo occurred on Wednesday  a day after a similar rush for commodity plays  LRCX has suffered much of 2018 since hitting an all time high in March that now looks like the third peak of a major topping pattern 
Lam Research  LRCX  broke down to a new 13 month low and further confirmed 2018 s topping pattern 
Intel  NASDAQ INTC  INTC has of course suffered company specific issues  The on going sell off in the semiconductor sector has piled onto INTC s problems  After the stock printed a hammer and 7 month low  I decided to add to my existing INTC calls as a low priced  pre earnings speculation  I expect overhead resistance to hold on the extension of any short term relief rally 

Intel  INTC  created a hammer bottom well below its lower Bollinger Band  BB  for a 7 month low 
Micron  NASDAQ MU  Even MU has succumbed to semi weakness  Despite a steady stream of strong results and a large share buyback  MU has broken down like much of the rest of the sector  August s sharp relief rally met stiff resistance at a downtrending 50DMA  This month  MU sliced right through 200DMA support and signaled major weakness  Last week  after MU opened higher the day after the big selling crescendo  I bought call options for a swing trade under the assumption the stock was launching a new relief rally  I am hoping the stock continues to rally into earnings on September 20th  I plan to sell my calls ahead of earnings as I am already in accumulation mode on shares 
Micron  MU  succumbed to sector wide weakness in confirming a 200DMA breakdown and hitting a 7 month low 
El Pollo Loco  NASDAQ LOCO The chicken trade continues to deliver  I started re accumulating shares in LOCO in March and got a boost from a Jim Cramer recommendation in June  The really big boost came at the beginning of this month  I took profits as LOCO tested the June  2017 high  Given the current uptrend  I like returning to the play on a 50DMA retest 

El Pollo Loco  LOCO  pulled back from a test of the June  2017 high 
Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH Last month I pointed out that MTCH was strong enough for a buy on a breakout  The breakout happened  but I missed the opportunity  The stock is up about 13  since it broke out to a new all time high on September 4th  MTCH is now running near parabolic 
Match Group  MTCH  went near parabolic this week and hit new all time highs 
Global X MSCI Nigeria ETF  NYSE NGE Higher oil prices have not helped Nigerian stocks  With a wobbling economy and Presidential elections coming in early 2019  investors are in flee mode for NGE  After making a profitable trade on NGE off 2017 lows  I am eyeing NGE once again  I am definitely a buyer on a retest of that low  In the meantime  I am looking for ANY sign of life from the buyers 

Global X MSCI Nigeria ETF  NGE  accelerated to the downside this month and is down a whopping 35  from the 2018 high made in January 
Impinj  NASDAQ PI In my previous Above the 40 post  I expressed my hesitations on going long PI again  I have frequently seen issues with 10Q filings taking weeks and months  In this case  PI took 4 weeks to fix the issue  and I now find it ironic I mulled over the risk reward just ahead of the fix  PI soared at one point for a 51 7  intraday gain  but settled back to close in line with the July high  Buyers returned the next day for a 5 6  gain 

Impinj  PI  exploded higher after filing its 10Q  but it took follow through buying to finish erasing the loss from the July high 
Snap  NYSE SNAP My bad on SNAP  It is that simple  I made a play for SNAP on what I thought was a bottoming process  the bottom has now fallen out  Even selling calls against the position could not compensate for the current collapse  With SNAP in single digits  the stock enters the danger zone of pressure  I still think SNAP will eventually figure out how to effectively monetize its audience  but there could also be a race against time with social media under increasing scrutiny  Indeed  some pairs trades in this sector make sense   I am really feeling the irony now of starting out as a strong bear on SNAP  

Snap  SNAP  accelerated to the downside this month  making repeated all time lows 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA I am glad I decided not to dump my shares into the panic  I sold into the bounce the next day around  280  I am impressed the stock was able to keep pushing higher even with the IPO of Chinese electric car maker Nio Limited  NIO   Still  my interest in the bullish case for TSLA is over for now  any trades going forward will be strictly short term  Another test of 50 200 DMA resistance is in play 

Tesla  TSLA  printed an impressive abandoned baby bottom on high volume  Buyers followed through right through the NIO IPO

15982,237497,FCX,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  Apple  Chevron And Freeport McMoRan,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 10  2019   Zack Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Earnings estimates have been coming down lately  reflecting the impact of economic weakness and rising costs  but many in the market suspect that they have further room to fall  3 Key Points for Q4 Earnings SeasonNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  please click here   Here are the key points Earnings estimates have been coming down lately  reflecting the impact of economic weakness and rising costs  but many in the market suspect that they have further room to fall With results from 20 S P 500 members  having fiscal quarters ending in November already out  the Q4 earnings season has gotten underway  But the reporting cycle really gets going with next week s releases from the big banks Total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  10 7  from the same period last year on  5 2  higher revenues  This represents a notable deceleration from the average  25  earnings growth in the first three quarters of 2018 Q4 estimates have come down sharply  with the current  10 7  rate down from  15 9  at the start of the quarter  This is a bigger magnitude of estimate cuts than we have seen in the preceding four quarters The negative revisions trend for the quarter is widespread  with estimates for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down since the quarter got underway  Estimates have come down the most for the Conglomerates  Construction  Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors The Transportation sector is the only one experiencing positive estimate revisions  a reflection of weakening oil prices The strongest year over year earnings growth in Q4 is expected to come from the Energy  Transportation  Construction  and Retail sectors  Excluding the Finance sector s strong growth  Q4 earnings growth for the rest of the index comes down to  8 6   from  10 7   For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  5 1  on  6 7 higher revenues  This would follow  33 6  earnings growth on  5 7  revenue growth in 2018 Q3 For full year 2019  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be up  6 7  on  6 3  higher revenues  which would follow the  20 6  earnings growth on  6 4  higher revenues in 2018  Estimates for 2019 have been steadily coming down  with the current  6 7  growth rate down from  9 8  in early October 2018 The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 20 6X and index close  as of January 8th  is  157 59  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  168 22 for 2019  P E of 6 7X  and  185 78 for 2020  P E of 10 4X   The multiples for 2018  2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year Driving this negative revisions trend is a combination of weakness in business conditions  cost inflation and commodity price softness Uncertainty about the international economic growth backdrop has emerged as an additional headwind to corporate earnings  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   is a good example of a major operator experiencing a weaker business outlook  forcing estimates to come down  Estimate cuts to Chevron   NYSE CVX    Freeport McMoRan   NYSE FCX   and others in the Energy and Basic Materials spaces reflect commodity price weakness  which itself is a function of uncertainty about the global economic backdrop It is not unusual for estimates to be coming down  But the magnitude of negative revisions that we saw for Q4 exceeds any of the preceding four quarters The revisions trend that full year 2019 estimates have suffered over the last three months is in contrast to the trend that we had seen in the run up to the last two years when estimates had actually increased The bigger issue will be how estimates for the coming quarters hold up going forward  particularly given the emerging late cycle narrative of slowing economic growth or even a recession on the horizon The growth pace was expected to decelerate in 2019 already as the direct benefits of the tax law changes faded  But even these low growth expectations for the coming quarters are vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

15983,237498,FCX,Square  Freeport McMoRan  Netflix And American Express Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 18  2018    Square   NYSE SQ   as the Bull of the Day  Freeport McMoRan   NYSE FCX   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and American Express   NYSE AXP   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Square  the  fintech  disruptor and hero of small business owners everywhere  just launched its in app payments software development kit  SDK   which will enable sellers to process payments with Square through their own mobile apps  Here s how the company described the new offering in a January 9 press release     With just a few lines of code  developers can easily and professionally build a fully PCI compliant  secure  and elegant Square powered payments flow in their Android or iOS apps  With this SDK  developers leave the complexity of payments to Square and focus instead on providing a delightful buyer experience    The in app payments software will aid buyers in securely making payment for goods purchased online  using their credit or debit cards and digital wallets including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Pay and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Pay  The new software can also be customized per developers  need and will assist buyers to make seamless transactions  Notably  the new solution is expected to gain momentum with developers and sellers as it will enable them to manage online and offline payments on a single unified platform Square Emerges as an Omnichannel Payment PlatformNow offering first party payment solutions in stores  online  and in mobile apps  the company says it s the only platform delivering solutions across all three channels While some competitors might challenge that assertion  Square innovations for small business are definitely expanding its presence in the digital payment solutions space and the company differentiates itself by offering a comprehensive payment platform  which enables sellers to combine software  hardware and payments services from various vendors An omnichannel payment solution enables sellers and developers to accept payments in multiple ways through one processing company  This aids in curtailing the complexity and security of managing payments across different channels  And omnichannel buyers spend 50  to 300  more than shoppers who use a single channel  Notably  a single unified system also garners in depth information about buying patters and enhances customer loyalty E commerce Drives Innovation and CompetitionFrom a simple idea to offer entrepreneurs a way to accept credit card payments using their mobile devices  Square has expanded and evolved into a thriving ecosystem of financial management for the small business person  The variety and uses of sales and accounting information tools is only expected to grow in the era of cloud based data apps  Just this week  Square launched a free debit card for business  with sellers immediate access to funds  The launch of Square Card  a free business debit Mastercard  NYSE MA  that helps businesses manage their cash flow by eliminating the time between making a sale and having the funds available to spend  will only further embed the ecosystem for entrepreneurs And the total addressable market  TAM  for transactions is enormous  Global retail sales from e commerce are expected to hit  1 7 trillion in 2018 and  2 5 trillion in 2022 at a CAGR of 9 6  between 2018 and 2022  While China dominates this flow  the US is expected to top  600 billion in e commerce sales by 2020  Freeport McMoRanshares recently touched 2 year lows as the global economy comes to a screeching halt and commodity inflation takes a dive Based on projected gold and copper prices  the  17 billion metals miner is expected to see revenues drop 22 7  to  14 5 billion this year And earnings are expected to plunge 55  from  1 66 to just  0 75 When the company reports on January 24  analysts project FCX to deliver a Q4 year over year decline in earnings on nearly 23  lower revenues for the same period   The miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  57  Downward Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering research analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change While it s possible that FCX could deliver a positive surprise vs  these lowered expectations  any results and corresponding outlook must be viewed in the context of peak global growth remaining in the review mirror as China and Europe slip closer to economic recession Could recent stimulus measures by the Chinese government and central bank help reflate and support the Chinese economy They certainly could  But it probably won t help the revenue and earnings outlook for FCX in the first half of this year Before you consider buying FCX  keep your eyes on the EPS revisions to signal a turn in the growth outlook The Zacks Rank will let you know Netflix  NFLX   AmEx  AXP  Report Mixed Q4Netflix has just reported Q4 earnings following the closing bell today  with mixed results that are sending shares down 4  in late trading  Earnings of 30 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus of 24 cents  though revenues came in light of expectations at  4 19 billion  as opposed to the  4 21 billion analyst were looking for Overall  8 8 million new paid subscribers joined Netflix in the quarter   1 53 million in the U S  and 7 31 million overseas   though this is also light of estimates for 9 4 million net adds  The company projects negative free cash flows for the year as the company continues to invest in new content  which is driving Netflix sales  Guidance for Q1 is lighter than expected on top and bottom lines After gaining in stock price 15  since the start of the year  anything less than a full blowout number was likely going to lead to a sell off in shares during after market  and this was something less than a blowout number  Yet after initially dropping in the immediate aftermath of the report s release  shares have fought back a bit at this hour  though they are back down 4  currently  American Express also improved over projections of  1 80 per share in its Q4 reported after the bell  although tax benefits are muddying up this bottom line result  reportedly  2 32 per share  Revenues missed expectations  however    10 47 billion was beneath the  10 58 billion in the Zacks consensus   which is what led to another initial 4  sell off  which has ebbed a bit back to  2 5    Earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 is stronger  however  to a range of  7 89 8 35 per share  the Zacks consensus had been  7 39 per share Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent

16020,237535,FCX,Freeport s  FCX  Q1 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX   is set to release first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24 Last quarter  the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 1  by posting adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents Revenues went up around 15 2  year over year to  5 041 million  also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 811 2 million Notably  Freeport beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing the other two  with an average negative surprise of 1 4  Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Freeport McMoRan Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayFreeport  during fourth quarter earnings call  stated that the company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3 9 billion pounds of copper  2 4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum  including 1 billion pounds of copper  675 000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first quarter 2018 The company assumes average prices of  3 15 per pound of copper and  1 300 per ounce of gold for 2018  Notably  average realized prices for copper and gold were  3 21 per pound  up from  2 48 a year ago  and  1 285 per ounce  from  1 174 a year ago   respectively  in the fourth quarter  The company gained from higher copper prices in the last reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues is  4 760 million  reflecting a year over year increase of around 42 5   Meanwhile  consolidated copper production for the first quarter is expected to fall 2 6  from the prior quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 991 million pounds Total copper sales from Freeport s North American Copper Mines for the first quarter are projected to witness a 4 8  rise sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 371 million pounds  The segment s sales volume decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades   Total copper sales from the company s South American Mining are expected to see a 2 6  decrease from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 304 million pounds   Copper sales from Indonesia Mining are expected to fall around 10  on a sequential basis as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at 316 million pounds  However  gold sales from Indonesia Mining are projected to increase roughly 1  from last quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 590 000 ounces Rising unit net cash costs for copper in Freeport s North American operation is a concern  Unit net cash cost per pound of copper for North America increased from  1 41 in 2016 to  1 57 in 2017  and is expected to be roughly  1 67 per pound this year  mainly reflecting lower expected sales volumes  Also  the unit net costs for South American mines increased last year due to higher mining and milling costs at Cerro Verde and lower sales volumes Nevertheless  Freeport should gain from favorable copper market conditions  its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline Shares of Freeport have lost 3 9  in the last three months  underperforming the  s 2 9  decline  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Freeport for the first quarter is  6 67   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 55 cents and 59 cents  respectively  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a negative ESP  makes surprise prediction

16022,237537,FCX,OPEC Meeting  Saudi Aramco And The State Of Commodities,opinion,"Because of the diminished long terms returns on invested capital and the inability for many commodity companies to build what Mr  Buffett and Morningstar call the  sustainable moat   clients have never owned substantial positions in commodity companies for longer periods of time  Yes  Alcoa  AA  and Freeport McMoran  FCX  have been owned as well as energy  post Q1  16  but I ve found the sector  Basic Materials  and the asset class  commodities in general  to be tough investments in general  particularly today when   in the last 20 years   we ve seen longer term bear markets and now reasonable valuations in  Technology    Financials   Retail  and yes even  Energy  
Is crude oil in a new bull market 
The Friday  June 22nd  2018  OPEC meeting looms large 
In a recent Stratfor piece written in April  18 when crude oil jumped from the low  50 s to the low  70 s  Stratfor asked the same question 
Blaine Rollins  CFA of 361Capital writes a great weekly blog that comes out every Monday night  that is chock full of useful information for investors 
The chart from Blaine s April 30  18 post shows Energy as a percentage of S P 500 s market cap 

I think Blaine was using a chart from John Roque  the great technician that called the top in the NASDAQ in early 2000  after John noted that the Nasdaq s standard deviation was 2 5x above its long term moving average 
This chart actually makes a good case for the the crude oil   energy sector bulls 
Personally  i m still agnostic to long term negative on crude oil and energy despite global growth  since I suspect some of the recent renewed interest in crude oil and the higher prices is due to the Saudi s interest in maximizing value around the Saudi Aramco IPO  whenever that happens  possibly in early 2019  
Here is what Stratfor had to say about this topic from their April  18 article   Has the Bull Oil Market Returned  

The bull market s appearance is not driven by just one factor  indicating that perhaps reasonably high oil prices  that is  about  65 a barrel  are here to stay  Saudi Arabia s tone here is critical  Recently leaked financial statements of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co   Saudi Aramco  show why Saudi Arabia has been aggressively pushing for higher oil prices even while some oil producers  like Iran and Iraq  have been skeptical of its moves  Saudi Aramco s financial figures showed that it was the most profitable company in the world for the first half of 2017  It earned a profit of  33 8 billion for the period  beating Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  by nearly  5 billion  The leaked statements also showed that Saudi Aramco had virtually no debt and that its production costs per barrel were just a fraction    4 a barrel   of its peers  But investors were left concerned  Despite the profit margins  on a per barrel basis  the dividend Saudi Aramco would have paid out would have been smaller than its multinational oil company peers because of its high tax and royalty rates  This means a realistic valuation of Saudi Aramco may be around  1 trillion to  1 5 trillion 
That figure is far below the  2 trillion valuation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has targeted and the one he may need in order to sell his plan of an initial public offering  IPO  to the House of Saud  Moreover  this valuation would confirm earlier reports that global investors had a lukewarm response to Salman s target valuation during his recent trip to the United Kingdom and the United States  One way to boost Saudi Aramco s valuation  of course  is to boost oil prices  the company s profit margins  as one would expect  are highly sensitive to oil prices  And because Riyadh wants to sell only 5 percent of Saudi Aramco through an IPO  every bit counts when it comes to boosting the company s valuation  High oil prices also mean more dividends  royalties and taxes for the Saudi government  which has seen its expenditures balloon now that it has reversed the austerity measures imposed under previous budgets 

 Unrelated to the Energy debate  think about the size of Saudi Aramco   it could be 50  larger than Apple s market cap if it IPOs  I d love to see the annual revenue of this crude oil production giant  
Other reasons to be skeptical about a long term rebound in crude oil is that 50  of the long run demand for crude oil in the US is driven by gasoline distillation and with the continued trend towards electronic vehicles  EV s  over the next 10 years  will gasoline demand slowly erode  Ford Motor s recent announcement that they were eliminating production of all midsize sedan s and focusing on trucks might help long term gasoline demand except more aluminum is being used in trucks to reduce the weight of light duty and mainstream pick up trucks  which continues to add to improving gas mileage 
California s EPA Director is adamant that despite the Trump Administration s relaxing of some of the fuel standards for emission target s  California is moving to a zero emission standard in the next 10   15 years   This is from the headlines and the public spat that occurred in the press sometime last year  I havent kept up with the fine print or below the headlines progress from either side  
Conclusion  Friday s OPEC meeting is big  Looking at the longer term prospects of crude oil  lower demand from less gasoline demand  higher supply from fracking and a world awash in crude oil  maybe offset a little by synchronized global growth  I still think the fundamentals portend lower rather than higher crude oil prices over time  Volvo announced in 2017 that they were moving to an  all EV  car lineup within 5 years or by 2022 
Core Capital  a commodity advisor that has built a nice business managing the commodity asset class for investors  came through Chicago in 2017 and presented to the CFA Chicago Vault Series  and made a good case for  65    70 crude oil  and they in fact turned out to be correct 
Recent commodity weakness in grains and cattle   pork seem more related to China and the tariff tiff 
Gary Morrow  a great technician whose work is used on this blog frequently  noted the very weak PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF  NYSE DBA  yesterday 

According to Morrow  this chart looks grim  but I suspect it could change if the China tariff issues get taken out of the headlines and get resolved sooner rather than later 
The energy bull   bear case will no doubt be discussed further in comments but commodities can be a very tough asset class in which to invest  My experience is that they are more trades than longer term investments given lower capital returns and the rapidity with which conditions change 
Personally  the financial sector looks much better today given bank and finance valuations  the release of capital for dividends and stock buybacks coming over the next calendar year  and easing regulation

16023,237538,FCX,2 Mining Resource Companies At Good Buying Levels,opinion,"Money manager Adrian Day discusses two resource companies in his portfolio that he finds are buys at current levels 
Nevsun Resources  NYSE NSU  continues to make progress on advancing the Timok property in Serbia  as well as turning around Bisha in Eritrea  Earlier in the month  Nevsun started construction of the exploration decline  a necessary development for the development and eventual construction of a mine at the site  This project will take approximately 24 months 
An alternative development plan is being studied  to de risk the project by reducing the initial capex and production in the early years  If the company adopts this scenario  an updated pre feasibility study will be released in the fall  with a full feasibility by the middle of next year  on schedule  Concurrently  an initial resource estimate for the Lower Zone  a joint venture with Freeport  NYSE FCX   is expected in coming months 
The company is looking at various alternatives for project capex  including strategic partners who could provide political  technical  or offtake support in addition to the capital 
In Eritrea  the company is proceeding with an expansion of mining at Bisha  with an incremental capital cost of around  40 million  This reflects confidence that the metallurgical problems that bedevilled recoveries at the end of last year and early this  The expansion is estimated to generate an additional  104 million in cash flow over the next five years  which will go towards development at Timok 
The lawsuit against Nevsun for alleged mistreatment of workers in Eritrea will now move to the Supreme Court of Canada  Nevsun argues that the case should be heard in Eritrea not in Canada  but lost its argument in lower courts 
Bidders
Separately  Euro Sun said it would pay half its share of the joint proposal with Lundin to buy the company in cash  earlier  the proposal included C 1 in Euro Sun shares   The cash would come from Nevsun s war chest  if the bid were successful   This came in response to investor reluctance to take Euro Sun stock  Significantly  this revised offer was made by Euro Sun alone  We surmise this indicates that Lundin may have heard the market message that Euro Sun is not regarded as a serious partner  We could also infer that Lundin may be talking with Nevsun 
Is Another Offer Coming  
We would not be surprised to see an improved offer perhaps for a joint venture from Lundin  or from some other company  though any such offers are slow in coming  Nevsun has stated  however  that after the Lundin proposal was made public  it received interest from several other companies  Given the long term value of the Lower Timok as well as the significant  if largely ignored  regional exploration potential  we think the current offer undervalues Timok and its long term potential  It is possible that a formula whereby Lundin buys the Upper Timok and shares with Nevsun in the Lower Zone and exploration could be found  increasing the overall value to shareholders without meaningfully increasing what Lundin has to put up 
This is clearly a story to be continued  In the meantime  Nevsun is good value at the current price level  notwithstanding that the stock could fall back in the near term if it became clear that no offer would be forthcoming 
A Quality Company With Lots Of Activity 
Midland Exploration  V MD  continues to advance work on several projects  At the prospective Vortex zone  a new high grade discovery at a joint venture with Soquem near the Detour Lake mine  a follow up drill campaign of eight holes has been completed  Once the assays have been received  which should be shortly  the next drill campaign  to target the best zones identified  will be planned and perhaps commenced later this month 
In the James Bay region  there has been work with partner Osisko in the  l onore area  work on several gold and base metals projects in the joint venture with Altius  and on its wholly owned James Bay Gold project owned property 
In all  Midland has 11 active projects at varying stages  in joint venture  under option  and some 100  owned  with a total of  6 7 million of exploration spending budgeted  of which Midland is responsible for a little over  4 million  Of course  these numbers can change depending on results  but we can expect a continued steady news flow throughout the rest of the year 
With nearly  15 million in cash including some  1 75 million from the exercise of expiring warrants in May Midland is well funded to continue its program  Top management  a solid balance sheet  and multiple active projects add up to a company that is well positioned for success  At the current price  Midland is a buy

16024,237539,FCX,Freeport McMoRan Short Term Sell Signal Flashes Again,opinion,"Mining giant Freeport McMoRan  NYSE FCX  has been trending lower since late January  with the stock now down 10 8  year to date to hover at  16 91  The shares have notched a series of lower highs along the way  and as a result  FCX has breached former support at its 80 day moving average  Based on historical returns from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  the commodity stock s latest rally up to this trendline could be a viable sell signal for short term bears 
Looking back over the past three years  there has been only one prior instance of FCX rising to within one standard deviation of its 80 day moving average after a lengthy stretch of time spent below it  defined as 60  of the time over the preceding two months  and at least eight of the previous 10 trading days   Following that prior occurrence  the stock was down 4 72  a month later 
FCX is pulling back from its 80 day in today s trading  which has the stock testing its footing around its 200 day moving average  This benchmark trendline cushioned the equity s mid November 2017 lows  but proved itself an unreliable layer of support during a couple of second quarter tests  Instead  the 320 day moving average stepped up to contain FCX s early May drop 

Despite the equity s technical troubles  calls have dominated the FCX options action lately  Over the past 10 days  traders on the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  have bought to open 24 729 calls on FCX  compared to just 3 912 puts  The resulting 10 day call put volume ratio of 6 32 registers in the 87th annual percentile  revealing a stronger than usual skew toward bullish bets over bearish 
With FCX not due to report earnings until after July options expiration  front month bets on the stock are going cheap  Schaeffer s Volatility Index  SVI  checks in at 40   which registers in the 27th percentile of its annual range  In other words  short term FCX options have been cheaper from a volatility standpoint only 27  of the time in the last 52 weeks  As such  traders expecting another move lower following FCX s latest 80 day rejection may want to consider standard monthly July puts ",2018-07-06,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freeportmcmoran-shortterm-sell-signal-flashes-again-200329498,200329498

16040,237555,FCX,Best In Class Copper Story  Inks Deal With Indonesia,opinion,"In a July 13  2018  research note  CIBC analyst Oscar Cabrera reported that Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  entered a nonbinding agreement with state owned PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium  INALUM  and Rio Tinto  LON RIO  regarding the Grasberg joint venture  JV  project in Indonesia 
Upon closing of the transaction  expected in the second half of 2018  PT Freeport Indonesia will own 60  of Grasberg  and INALUM will own the remaining 40   after 2022   The successful closing of the Grasberg transaction should close the price net asset value gap to peers   Cabrera added  referencing Freeport McMoRan 
The analyst provided the agreement s terms  which are 

INALUM would acquire Rio Tinto s 40  interest in the Grasberg JV for  3 5 billion   Rio Tinto is PT Freeport Indonesia s JV partner in Grasberg  PT Freeport Indonesia is a subsidiary of Freeport McMoRan  
INALUM would acquire 100  of Freeport McMoRan s interest in PT Indocopper Investama for  350 million   PT Indocopper owns 9 36  of PT Freeport Indonesia   On closing of the transaction  INALUM would own  51  of PT Freeport Indonesia  and Freeport McMoRan would own  49  
Rio Tinto  would forego to Freeport  McMoRan   an amount equal to the former s share of JV cash flows received between Jan  1  2018  and the deal s closing 

Cabrera noted for the deal to go through that PT Freeport Indonesia s mining rights need to be extended through 2041  Shareholders need to develop and agree on an arrangement for Freeport s continuing management of PT Freeport Indonesia s operations  Also  environmental regulatory issues need resolving 
Upcoming catalysts for Freeport McMoRan  indicated Cabrera  include a rising copper price  a successful closing of the Grasberg transaction   a potential special dividend and or share buyback by the end of 2018 and execution of the Lone Star development project over the next 18 months  
As for Freeport generally  Cabrera asserted   We continue to consider Freeport as the best in class North American copper miner   CIBC maintained its Outperformer rating and  20 per share price target on the copper miner  whose stock is trading today at around  16 77 per share

16073,237588,FCX,How Have 2018 Growth Expectations Changed By Sector ,opinion," see link  was written last December  2017  and given tax reform and the hefty 6  return for the SP 500 in January  2018  I thought a refresher might be in order 
Since Thomson doesn t publish annual revenue estimates  Factset s revenue estimates are used  although the expected EPS growth for 2018 is Thomson Reuters I B E S data 
A couple of trends jumped out 
1   Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  had tough days on Friday  after their earnings reports but Energy is still expected to show robust earnings growth in 2018  It will be interesting to see if Energy sector estimates change in the next few weeks  Clients own no Energy in their portfolio s   None  
2   Financial sector EPS growth has nearly doubled since mid December  17  Wells Fargo s news could take a little steam out of that next week  but I still think that Financial s are one of the best sectors to be invested in  in 2018 
3   Technology has been less robust  in terms of upward revisions  Expected revenue growth for the sector hasn t budged since December  17 while EPS growth has been revised higher  understandable given the substantial cash positions  but still investors are seeing better revisions in sectors like Financials  Basic Materials  etc 
4   Basic Materials  just 3  of the S P 500 and a lot of that is Chemicals  Chemical companies   from eyeballing the Materials Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLB  ETF   make up 50  of the XLB  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  is the 9th largest position in the XLB and is 3 85  of the ETF as of Friday s close  per Morningstar   The iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM  or Basic materials ETF is almost an identical portfolio from looking at it quickly and again Freeport is the 9th largest position at 3 9  of the ETF 
5   Industrial sector earnings have seen a nice ramp since mid December  17 up over 50   surprising since General Electric Company  NYSE GE  is still in the sector  GE s weight in the Industrial ETf s has declined to where it is now 8th or 9th in the XLI but still 3rd in terms of weighting in the iShares iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ  
If 2018 turns out to be a  1994  type year  where rising rates suppress equity valuations and the stock market winds up fighting the bond market headwind  Cyclical stocks  Industrial s  Basic Materials  those sectors will tend to be least sensitive to the bond market 
Here was the  and also here was the  both compiled in mid December  17 
Financial stocks have been added to and the weighting lifted in the Finance sector and Tech s weighting has been reduced but still overweight to market weight  Cyclicals will likely be added to on any pullback

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FCX due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers

16083,237598,FCX,Copper MMI  Prices Retrace As U S  Dollar Firms,opinion,"The Copper MMI  Monthly Metals Index  traded lower this month  falling two points to 87 for our March reading 
The Copper MMI fell for the second consecutive month  after the sharp increase in prices at the end of last year  In February  LME copper prices fell by 3 5  

The LME copper short term downtrend does not seem that bearish when looking at the two year chart  Copper prices retraced this month again  but still hold above the blue dotted line  which represents the trend line  prices below that line might indicate a change in trend   In December  copper prices skyrocketed and breached the  7 000 st level  confirming long term bullish sentiment remains intact 

Source  MetalMiner analysis of FastMarkets
Meanwhile  this month  a stronger US dollar added downward pressure to commodities and industrial metals  Analysts also claim the latest  bearish  downtrend occurred due to increasing LME stocks 
MetalMiner analyzes copper supply from two different perspectives  copper stocks and global copper supply 
Copper Stocks
Copper stocks at the major metal exchanges totaled 537 722 tons at the end of November 2017  reflecting a decrease of 0 3  from stocks in December 2016  In particular  LME stocks fell by 41   while SHFE stocks increased by 12  in 2017 
However  2018 has come with some recoveries for LME copper stocks 
Copper stocks are at a current 324 900 tons  This means LME copper stocks are 13 075 tons higher than at the beginning of 2017  and 85 500 tons higher than at the beginning of 2016 These numbers show some recovery for LME copper stocks  this information has likely fueled trading sentiment this month 
CME stocks also increased at the beginning of the year  In 2015  CME stocks were just at 20 000 tons  compared to the current 209 000 ton level  Both of these numbers  CME and LME stock levels  have moved trader sentiment 
Global Copper Supply
The Indonesian unit of Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc s copper mine and Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara  AMNT  are waiting for last minute ministry approvals to their application for an extension to continue with copper concentrate exports  Freeport s export order for the Grasberg mine expires this month  copper mines have to reapply for export licenses every year  
Freeport had an export quota of 1 1 million tons of copper ore concentrate ending February 2018  Exports could stop this month  but mine production could continue 
Meanwhile  the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has tightened the  allowable  impurities levels further  Therefore  instead of importing scrap  China now imports unwrought copper for downstream production 
Copper supply also looks threatened in Chile and Peru  particularly if workers go on strike since labor contracts expire soon  The powerful labor union at the Escondida copper mine cast doubt on the chances of starting talks on a new labor agreement with the company before formal negotiations commence in June 
Global copper supply still shows some uncertainty with possible copper supply shortages coming in 2018  Therefore  buying organizations may want to understand the global picture rather than just considering the trend based on stock levels and actual copper supply 
What This Means for Industrial Buyers
In February  buying organizations had some opportunities to buy some volume  As long as copper prices remain bullish  buying organizations may want to buy on the dips  For those who want to understand how to reduce risks  take a free trial now at the

The RSI is also falling back to the lower bound of the bullish range with the MACD crossed down and now negative  The Bollinger Bands  have tightened and are shifting lower to allow a move down  There is support lower at 17 50 and 17 10 then 16 35 and 15 25 before 14 75 and 14 35 then 13 85 and the bottom at 13 25  Resistance higher comes at 18 and 19 then 19 25 and 19 70 then 20 25  Short interest is low at 2 5   The company is expected to report earnings next April 23rd 
Options chains show big open interest at the 17 and 15 strikes on the put side this week  On the call side it is comparable and big from 18 to 20  The April chain shows the biggest open interest at the 18 strike on the put side and then it tails to 15  On the call side it is biggest at 20 and 21 with lower amounts at 19 and 18 The April 27 chain  the first after the earnings report  shows the biggest open interest at the 18 strike on the call side  The at the money straddle suggests an implied  2 00 move or 11 4  between now and expiry  Finally the May options have biggest open interest at the 13 put strike and it is comparable at the 20 and 21 call strikes

Trade Idea 1  Sell the stock short on a move under 17 50 with a stop at 18 
Trade Idea 2  Sell the stock short on a move under 17 50 and buy the April 6 Expiry 18 Calls  37 cents  as protection

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with another Fed rate hike behind it and now the prospect of trade wars  saw the equity markets finish the week breaking down and looking weak 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil also moves higher  The US Dollar Index seems content to move sideways while US Treasuries are biased to continue to the upside  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside within broad consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts show short term weakness continuing and for the first time in years the prospect of intermediate term weakness in the SPY and IWM  The QQQ remains the best chart on the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

16091,237606,FCX,Is Freeport McMoRan  FCX  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Freeport McMoRan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 9  as you can see in the chart below This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Freeport McMoRan  current PE level puts it well below its highs over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Freeport McMoRan has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 3   considerably lower than the current level  So it is fair to say that a significantly more value oriented path may be ahead for Freeport McMoRan stock in the near term PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Freeport McMoRan have a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Freeport McMoRan currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Freeport McMoRan a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Freeport McMoRan might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives FCX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the next year estimate has seen two upward and none downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current year consensus estimate has increased 2 2  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has moved higher by 2 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Freeport McMoRan Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though the company has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFreeport McMoRan is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 11    it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three months  its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be

surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Freeport for the fourth quarter is  2 83   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 50 cents and 49 cents  respectively  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors at PlayFreeport  during third quarter earnings call  stated that the company expects sales volumes for 2017 to be roughly 3 7 billion pounds of copper  1 6 million ounces of gold and

company gained from higher copper prices in the third quarter which is expected to continue in the December quarter Meanwhile  consolidated copper production for the fourth quarter is expected to rise 2 1  from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at 1 017 million pounds  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter is  4 8

ounces  Copper sales from Indonesia Mining are expected to rise 16 7  from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is 342 million pounds The Zacks Consensus Estimate

of  1 26 per pound Consolidated average unit net cash costs for copper is also expected to decline 19 8  sequentially in the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 97 cents per pound  This should also lend support to fourth quarter margins Freeport McMoran  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other

16141,237656,FCX,Gold And Gold Stocks  Patterns  Cycles  Insider Activity  Part 1  ,opinion,"Repeating Patterns and Positioning 
A noteworthy confluence of patterns in gold and gold stocks is in evidence this year  At the close of trading on December 26  the HUI Index has given a  tentative  buy signal by completing a unique chart pattern  which is why we decided to briefly discuss the situation  As usual  things are not as straightforward and simple as they would ideally be  but there is always an element of uncertainty   one has to accept that as a given  Let us look at a chart illustrating one of said patterns 

This chart shows the gold price  the weekly net hedger position in gold futures  the inverse of the net speculative position   with the Fed s December rate hikes in 2015  2016 and 2017 highlighted by red vertical lines  Keep in mind that the December 2015 hike was the start of the current rate hike campaign  In the weeks leading up to it  the gold market was in the grip of a bearish hysteria  just as it approached a major lateral support level  Nearly every day Bloomberg  Reuters and other mainstream financial media published articles by  experts  no one had ever heard of before  or since    along with reports from analysts working for various well known investment banks  all of whom stridently insisted that the beginning rate hike cycle was going to be the most bearish thing that could possibly befall the gold market  and that a further collapse in prices was nearly certain to coincide with it 
Not surprisingly  the exact opposite has happened  You were definitely not surprised if you were reading this blog at the time   see for instance     As we pointed out therein 

  The  guessers at SocGen might actually have improved their statistical odds a bit if they had said  now that the Fed is hiking rates  gold prices should rise  

As noted in the chart annotation  in all three years gold prices declined into a December low  seemingly driven by fear of the coming rate hike and then proceeded to rally in a typical  buy the news  scenario  The declines tended to lower net speculative long positions to levels conducive to a renewed advance  So far the gold price lows coinciding with these rate hikes are increasing by approximately  100 per year  We expect this uptrend to accelerate noticeably once the rate hike campaign is unceremoniously thrown overboard  ETA  sometime next year  the precise timing depends on when the asset bubble peaks and reverses   the clock is ticking on that 
Naturally  there is no guarantee that the December low will once again result in a playable multi week  or even better  rally this year  but so far things look actually good for that idea  Here is a chart showing the moves in the HUI index and gold prices over the past 2 years and 7 months  i e   including the drawn out bottoming period from July 2015 to January 2016  

As this chart shows  the HUI has once again taken off like a scalded cat right after the rate hike  After the 2015 rate hike low  the index lurched lower one more time in early January  as the broader stock market suffered one of its biggest declines since the 2009 low 
We have highlighted the false break of support  a k a  bear trap  that occurred at the time  it was even more pronounced in the XAU Index  which actually fell below its low of late 2000   False breaks of major lateral support levels that put in a multi year low tend to be of long term significance  usually these prices are never seen again 
A comparison that comes to mind is the false break of support in the S P 500 Index in 1982  which at the time greatly excited Joe Granville and his flock as we recall  Granville expected it to lead to a major price collapse  but the excitement didn t last long and the index waved good bye to these price levels forever  On the chart above we also want to draw your attention to the most recent divergence between the HUI and the gold price  While the gold price put in a higher low in December vs  its low in early July  the HUI broke below its July low before reversing  Such divergences are typically seen near medium to long term turning points  
Eerie Self Similarity
Below we take a closer look at the chart pattern in the HUI in isolation  The extremely lengthy consolidation pattern following the strong rally in the first half of 2016 increasingly wore investors out  Their patience was undoubtedly tested quite a bit  particularly in light of other stocks and cryptocurrencies going bananas at the same time 
Per experience  such long lasting  grinding sideways ranges often turn out to be very powerful set ups though  In the gold sector we would for instance point to the consolidation from July 2015 to January 2016  see the chart above  as a recent example of such a patience challenging  grinding pattern   The HUI went nowhere for months  occasionally teased traders with false starts  and in the end even threatened to break down  only then did a powerful rally finally kick in 

 Pattern completion  in the HUI was achieved this Tuesday with a close above the red signal line  the decisive criterion was the reversal of the entire immediately preceding down leg by closing above the upper boundary of the small sideways range which started in late October   Unfortunately  the 200 day moving average is directly above the current index level  given the fact that this moving average provided stiff resistance for much of 2017  the index may struggle a bit in the near term  even if it eventually surpasses it 
The broader XAU index has already overcome its 200 dma  but this is probably mainly due to the fact that Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  is one of its constituents  and has a large weight in the index  While FCX does produce a lot of gold  its gold production is estimated to reach 2 3 million ounces in 2018   it is primarily a copper producer  the world s second largest   In recent days the stock was particularly strong due to copper rallying to its highest level since early 2014 
 What makes the pattern especially interesting is that there exists a strikingly self similar pattern that was also built after a major bear market  a slightly worse bear market even    namely in the S P 500 Index right after the 1932 low  This pattern similarity was discovered by James Flanagan of   who spends quite a bit of time and effort looking for potentially useful historical chart analogs in the markets he analyzes 
 We should add that self similar patterns as such often have only limited value  For a number of reasons  this particular analog is quite interesting though  For one thing  several other signals are currently falling into place as well  such as the speculative positioning in futures and the  buy the news  effect after the Fed rate hike we mentioned above  as you will seein Part 2  there are still more signals   Moreover  this consolidation pattern is both complex and quite unique  and the similarities are really striking 
Not only were the preceding bear markets of nearly the same size  the initial rally from the low in 1932 was just as rapid and produced almost the same percentage gain as the one seen in the HUI in early 2016  the subsequent consolidation took a roughly similar amount of time to play out  and lastly  the shape of the consolidation pattern extremely closely matches the one in HUI and XAU 
Especially noteworthy is the succession of slightly lower lows in the course of the sideways consolidation  This must have been quite frustrating for investors at the time  It probably felt as though the initial ray of hope provided by the rally off the bottom in 1932 was yet another false dawn  It turned out though that it had indeed heralded the end of the bear market 
Here is the chart of the SPX from 1932 to 1937 which shows the self similar pattern and what happened after it concluded 

The SPX from 1932 to 1937   this is a snapshot we have taken from a Gann Global presentation  The blue rectangle contains the initial rally and the subsequent consolidation pattern  The 132  rally following on the heels of the consolidation was definitely nothing to sneeze at
Playing it Safe
The recent break to a lower low in the HUI followed by an immediate reversal was the last ingredient that was hitherto still missing to complete the same pattern  If one wants to play it extra safe  one can always wait for the index to move a bit further above the  signal line  level  as this would entail overcoming the 200 dma in the case of the HUI as well 
Of course there is no guarantee whatsoever that the ultimate outcome will actually be similar  One can of course always limit the risk by setting a stop loss level in case the idea fails to work out  Depending on what instruments one uses  options may offer a viable alternative as well  both for playing the rally potential and  or to hedge a position  
In Part 2 we will look at cycle signals  sentiment as well as recent insider activity  the latter is particularly interesting  there was quite a big surge in insider buying  which rarely happens in this sector  ",2017-12-28,Pater Tenebrarum,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-gold-stocks--patterns-cycles-and-insider-activity-part-1-200276192,200276192

s shares have moved up 14 4  in the last three months  underperforming the 16 6  growth recorded by its    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderFreeport  in July  cut its sales volume expectations for 2017  The company now sees sales volumes to be roughly 3 7 billion pounds of copper  down from 3 9 billion pounds expected earlier   1 6 million ounces of gold  down from 1 9 million ounces expected earlier  and 93 million pounds of molybdenum  including 940 million pounds of copper  375 000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third quarter 2017 The company assumes average prices of  1 250 per ounce of gold   2 65 per pound of copper and  7 50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017 The company s consolidated copper sales volumes in the second quarter were lower than its expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia  However  gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia  Copper sales from Freeport s North American Copper Mines for the third quarter is projected to witness a 13 5  decrease from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 353 million pounds  The segment s sales volume also decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades  The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter Gold sales from the Indonesia  Mining for the third quarter is projected to decline 11 9  from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 376 000 ounces The Zacks Consensus Estimate for copper sales from the company s South America Mining is expected to be 315 million pounds for the third quarter  reflecting an estimated 8 9  growth on a sequential comparison basis  The company s sales were affected in the second quarter due to reduced mining rates  ore grades and recoveries Freeport is taking actions to cut mining costs and reduce debt  It is also conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity  The company s copper cash costs declined roughly 10  year over year in the second quarter  Freeport s cost reduction actions should lend support to its margins in the third quarter The company is also expected to gain from higher copper prices in the to be reported quarter  providing support to its top line  Copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017 However  Freeport has cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017  partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia  Freeport reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10  and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion to make up for the losses suffered due to the halt of export  Nevertheless  Freeport and the government of Indonesia have agreed on a framework that would allow Freeport to keep operating its Grasberg mine Freeport McMoran  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive   Expected Surprise Prediction  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below

16233,237748,FCX,Metals And Miners Eye Significant Breakout,opinion,"The SPDR S P Metals and Mining ETF  NYSE XME  could be on the verge of a surprising  very powerful upside breakout after completing a 6 month corrective accumulation period 
After Trump was elected last November  the XME climbed from just under 25 to a February 2017 high at 35 21  or a whopping 41   in anticipation of the enactment of the Trump agenda  concurrent with lower taxes  stronger economic growth and upward pressure on inflation 
Thereafter  however  in reaction to the administration s failure to pass health care legislation  coupled with a myriad of disappointments and political fumbles  prospects for  The Trump Trade  faded miserably 
All through the disappointment period  despite numerous downside violations of its 200 day moving average  DMA   the XME managed to find support between 30 and 28  During the last major downside breach of the 200 DMA in early August in the vicinity of 30 60  the XME bears had another opportunity  the fifth since late April  to inflict very serious technical damage to the developing corrective accumulation pattern  However  they failed to do so 
In its totality  all of the action since early March 2017 has chiseled out a rounded cup and handle like accumulation formation that is putting increasing upward pressure on resistance lodged between 32 65 and 33 43  If hurdled and sustained  this will trigger powerful upside technical potential that projects to 36  

We added the XME to our MPTrader Model Portfolio on September 29 at 32 29  Last week  after early weakness in sympathy with the overall pressure on the major indices Thursday morning  the XME put in a key upside reversal day and then followed through by gapping up Friday morning and closing strong at 33 15 
The 2 day upside thrust  which pivoted off the rising 20 DMA  32 49  as well as off nearest trendline support from the September 22 low  31 38   likely derived strength from the steel sector after the Steel Dynamics  NASDAQ STLD  upgrade to Overweight from Sector Weight and a  44 price target  from  38  by KeyBanc last Thursday  10 19 17   In addition  STLD management made positive comments after its recent earnings report  10 18 17  that the U S  steel market has bottomed and they are largely positive about the near term steel pricing  Although foreign dumping of steel and other industrial metals continues to be problematic for certain producers  it is on the radar of the Trump Administration  which continues to work toward leveling the playing field against foreign competitors who receive support from illegal subsidies 
With this latest move  XME is attempting to hurdle its 8 month resistance line  which cuts across the price axis in the vicinity of 33 20  This is the third attempt to take out the resistance line since September 9  Given the juxtaposition of the rising momentum indicators  a significant breakout from the larger rounded accumulation pattern likely is already in motion 
From an event driven perspective  earnings in NUE  X  MT  FCX  ATI and CNX are due within the next two weeks and should provide the XME with some event driven directional catalysts  From a market psychology perspective  my sense is that such a move will be directly related to renewed prospects for the Trump growth agenda  tax cuts  tax reform  and the resumption of  The Trump Trade  that propels the cyclical and industrial names to the upside  industrial miners and manufacturers included  ",2017-10-25,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xme-minersmetals-etf-pushing-towards-significant-breakout-200221027,200221027

16249,237764,FCX,Here s Why Copper s Price Will Continue Higher,opinion,"As many of you know  copper is often seen as an indicator of economic health  historically falling when overall manufacturing and construction is in contraction mode  rising in times of expansion 
That appears to be the case today  Currently trading above  3 a pound   Doctor Copper  is up close to 28 percent year to date and far outperforming its five year average from 2012 to 2016 

Several factors are driving the price of the red metal right now 
Manufacturing activity  as measured by the purchasing manager s index  PMI   is expanding at a pace we haven t seen in years in the U S   eurozone and China  The U S  expanded for the 100th straight month in September  climbing to a 13 year high of 60 8 
Speculators are also buying in response to word of copper shortages in China  despite September imports of the metal rising to its highest level since March  The world s second largest economy took in 1 47 million metric tons of copper ore and concentrates last month  an amount that s 6 percent higher than the same month in 2016 
Why Copper Is the  Metal of the Future 
Why are we seeing so much copper entering China  One reason could be battery electric vehicles  BEVs   which require three to four times as much copper as traditional fossil fuel powered vehicles 
China is already the world s largest and most profitable market for BEVs  and Beijing is now reportedly working on plans to curb and eventually ban the sale of fossil fuel powered vehicles  according to the  This would place the Asian giant in league with a number of other powerful countries similarly crafting bans on internal combustion engines within the next 25 years  including Germany  France  Norway  the United Kingdom and India 
Because of the sheer size of the Chinese market  this move is sure to delight copper bulls and investors in any metal that s set to benefit from higher BEV production  That includes cobalt  lithium and nickel 
According to  BEVs will account for 54 percent of all new car sales by 2040  That year  China  Europe and the U S  are expected to make up 60 percent of the global BEV fleet 
This could have a huge effect on copper prices over the next 10 years and more  With fewer and fewer large deposits being discovered  demand should accelerate from 185 000 metric tons today to an estimated 1 74 million tonnes in 2027  according to the 
These are among the reasons why Arnoud Balhuizen  chief commercial officer of Australian mining giant BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP    called copper  in an interview with Reuters last month 
 2017 is the revolution year  for electric vehicles   and copper is the metal of the future   Balhuizen said  adding that the market is grossly underestimating the red metal s potential as BEV adoption surges around the world 
Cobalt Gets Its Day in the Sun
And let s not forget cobalt  The brittle  silver gray metal  used to extend the life expectancy of rechargeable batteries  is up more than 81 percent so far in 2017 and 109 percent for the 12 month period  Performance is being driven not only by growing BEV demand but also supply disruptions in the Republic of the Congo  where more than 60 percent of the world s cobalt is mined 
 It s a really bright future for cobalt   Vivienne Lloyd  analyst at Macquarie Research  told the   There doesn t seem to be enough of it  
Before now  there was very little mainstream interest in cobalt as an investment  but that s changing as rapidly as world governments are joining the chorus to move away from fossil fuels  One sign of that change is the London Metal Exchange s  LME  upcoming cobalt contracts  one for the physical metal and another for the chemical compound cobalt sulphate  This will allow investors to trade the underlying metal and participate in the electric vehicle  revolution   as Balhuizen calls it 
In the meantime  investors can participate by investing in a producer with exposure to cobalt among our favorites are Glencore  OTC GLNCY   Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  and Norilsk Nickel  OTC NILSY  or a natural resources fund 
Gold Closes Above  1 300 an Ounce
Gold also looks constructive as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond  according to a number of new reports and analysis last week 
UBS strategist Joni Teves finds it  encouraging  that gold has managed to recover this year off its 2016 lows  Although a likely December rate hike could be a headwind  Teves points out that the metal performed well in the months that followed the previous three rate hikes  What s more  gold has rallied in each January since 2014  We could see a similar bump in price this coming January 
Not only is gold trading above its 50 day moving average again  but for all of 2017  it s been following a nice upward trend as the U S  dollar dips further 

A weaker greenback  of course  is bullish for all commodities  including copper  According to Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone  unless the dollar unexpectedly recovers in the near term  commodities  as measured by the Bloomberg Commodities Index  could gain as much as 20 percent between now and year s end 
Meanwhile  BCA writes that major risks in 2018 inflationary expectations stemming from President Donald Trump s protectionism  tensions between the U S  and China  and continued strife in the Middle East among them could keep the shine on gold 
The research firm reminds investors that gold has historically done well in times of economic and geopolitical crisis  outperforming the S P 500 Index  U S  dollar and 10 year Treasury by wide margins  Because the metal is negatively correlated to other assets  it could potentially serve as a good store of value if equities entered a bear market 
Such a bear market  triggered by tighter U S  monetary policy  could take place as early as 2019  BCA analysts estimate  Gold would then stand out as a favorable asset to hold  especially if inflationary pressures pushed real Treasury yields into negative territory 
A Fear Trade Lesson from Germany
This is the lesson Germany has learned over the past 10 years  as I shared with you last week  Before 2008  Germans  investment in physical gold barely registered on anyone s radar  with average annual demand at 17 metrics tons  The country s first gold backed exchange trade commodities  ETCs  didn t even appear on the market until 2007 
But then the financial crisis struck  followed by monetary easing and low to negative interest rates  These events ultimately pushed many Germans into seeking a more reliable store of value 
Now  a new report from the  shows that German investors became the world s top gold buyers in 2016  ploughing as much as  8 billion into gold coins  bars and ETCs  Amazingly  they outspent Indian  Chinese and U S  investors 
Analysts with the WGC believe there is room for further growth  citing a recent survey that shows latent demand in Germany holding strong 
Impressively  59 percent of German investors agreed that  gold will never lose its value in the long term   That s a huge number  suggesting the investment case for gold remains attractive

As FCX took off  we started sharing with our Premium and Metals members that it was  pocket change  time  and profits were taken on part of the position  Recently  with gains on remaining shares up almost 30   stops were pulled on the position  This week the stops were hit and the last 40  of the shares were sold 
We are now using the capital and gains to find another hard hit asset that looks to be forming a bullish pattern 
FYI  Taking gains on FCX does not mean we are now bearish on the stock  Picking up 25  in 100 days is enough for now  as momentum is lofty in copper and FCX ",2017-08-30,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-we-closed-out-our-copper-plays-200210473,200210473
16266,237781,FCX,Copper Zooms To 3 Year High  Will The Momentum Last ,opinion,Copper is on a tear  hitting fresh three year highs thanks to encouraging economic numbers out of China   the world s biggest consumer of the metal  Renewed optimism about the Chinese economy has given the red metal a fresh shot in the arm   Dr  Copper  on FirePrices of copper for December delivery touched roughly  3 18 per pound on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday  a level not seen since September 2014  Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange  LME  also hit a three year high on Tuesday  clocking  6 970 per ton  according to Reuters    The widely used industrial metal  nicknamed Dr  Copper for being a reliable barometer to track the health of the world economy  gained from encouraging economic data from China  This raised expectations of higher demand for the commodity China s official manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for August came in at 51 7  up from 51 4 in July and also exceeded expectations  A reading above 50 indicates growth  The better than expected August reading came on the heels of strong production and a rise in new orders Moreover  China Caixin Markit services PMI rose to 52 7 in August from 51 5 in July on a pickup in new business orders  These data suggest that the world s second largest economy is in good health notwithstanding a cooling property market and high debt levels China maintained the momentum of steady and sound development in first half 2017  laying a strong foundation for achieving the government s GDP growth target of 6 5  for this year China holds the largest share by far of global copper consumption  roughly 46    and has a significant share in the total production of pure copper  Trends in Chinese GDP growth and world trade have a significant influence on copper prices  There is a strong correlation of the metal with ups and downs in the Chinese economy  As such  positive economic data are likely to step up the nation s demand for the red metal Another factor that contributed to copper s rally is a sharp drop in output from Codelco   the world s biggest copper producer  On Sep 5  the Chilean state copper company said that production for first half 2017 from its copper operations fell to 798 000 tons from 843 000 tons a year ago Copper prices were also supported by a weak U S  dollar  A weaker greenback makes dollar priced metals cheaper for holders of other currencies The Red Metal s ReboundCopper  an important barometer for the global economy  is a major industrial metal that plays a significant role in emerging countries  Trends in the copper market are often a useful indicator of the state of the global economy given the metal s diverse applications  Developments in the world economy have a strong correlation with movements in copper prices After vastly underperforming other metals  copper witnessed a sudden spike at the end of 2016  A pick up in global manufacturing activity and hopes of Trump s infrastructure spending drove the red metal s recovery  Optimism around the Chinese economy and indications of tighter global mine supply aided prices Moreover  supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines including BHP Billiton s Escondida mine  the world s biggest copper mine  in Chile earlier this year and a strike at Freeport McMoRan s Grasberg operations in Indonesia led to a decline in mined copper production and provided a thrust to prices Copper received further boost in July on reports of a potential Chinese ban on certain imports of copper scrap by the end of 2018 as part of the country s move to reduce waste  This would lead to higher demand for refined copper and copper concentrate  While China s imports of copper scrap increased this year  the country s demand for refined copper remains depressed  As such  a ban on scrap would result in increased imports of refined copper   Moreover  investors are betting on copper as the metal is expected to significantly gain from the booming market for electric vehicles that use a substantial amount of copper in their batteries Copper prices are up around 24  so far in 2017 and the metal is trading roughly 50  higher than last year  The non ferrous metal is among the best performing commodities this year The  has also outperformed the broader market in a year s time  The industry has gained around 31 6  in this period  higher than the S P 500 s return of around 12 3  Rising prices have also given a boost to share prices of copper producers  Mining majors Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX   and BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited   NYSE BHP   have both seen their shares shoot up roughly 25  over the past three months Moreover  shares of Glencore  LON GLEN  Plc   OTC GLNCY    one of the world s top copper producers  have rallied around 27  in the same time frame  Southern Copper Corporation   NYSE SCCO   shares are also up 15  while Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc   NYSE RIO   has gained 17   Rising prices of copper is a good sign for these mining stocks While Freeport  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto and Southern Copper carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Glencore is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see Will the Rally Last While copper has lately been enjoying a stellar run  analysts are skeptical about the sustainability of the recent price rally  Many believe that prices of the metal will come under pressure as the market remains adequately supplied and demand is not strong enough  Some analysts have also cautioned that the markets are overheated and will experience a price correction soon Oversupply in the market also continues to pose a threat on copper prices  In the short to medium term  new and expanded production should keep the market well supplied  Chile is expected to contribute significantly to supply growth in 2017 BHP Billiton  last month  said that production from the Escondida mine is running at normal levels  Completion of a major investment program is expected to significantly boost output from the mine this financial year  Freeport and the government of Indonesia have also recently agreed on a framework that would allow Freeport to keep operating its Grasberg mine   the world s second biggest copper mine There are also lingering concerns surrounding China s copper demand  China s move to tighten credit growth could hurt demand for copper in its property and infrastructure sectors  Beijing s crackdown on risky debt may lead to slower economic growth in the second half of 2017  Any demand weakness in China would put downward pressure on copper prices As such  it remains to be seen if the good times for copper stay or passes soon One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea

16268,237783,FCX,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Freeport McMoRan  Newmont Mining  Golden Star Resources  Randgold Resources And Kinross Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 22  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Gold Mining  Part 1  including Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE   NYSE FCX        Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE   NYSE NEM        Golden Star Resources Ltd   NYSEMKT   NYSE GSS        Randgold Resources  LON RRS  Ltd   Nasdaq   NASDAQ GOLD       and Kinross Gold Corp   NYSE   NYSE KGC       Industry  Gold Mining  Part 1Link  Gold has exhibited a bullish run in the markets so far this year  The yellow metal s safe haven appeal was evident from its gain of 14   riding on the back of a weaker dollar  terrorist attacks in the U K  and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea  In fact  the precious metal broke the threshold limit of  1 300 an ounce this year Further  uncertainty over the economic agenda of President Trump and mounting speculation on whether the Fed will deliver a third rate hike this year has fueled the price rise  Concerns over the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma led to some safe haven buying as well Demand Dips in the First Half  India Holds GroundPer the data available from the World Gold Council  global gold demand in the first half of 2017 was at 2 003 8 tons  a 14  decline year over year  The decline can primarily be attributed to the slowing down of ETFs from the record levels last year Jewelry demand grew 5  year over year to 967 4 tons  remaining persistently below the 1 000 ton mark  India was the main driver of demand as the market stockpiled gold ahead of the implementation of GST  Goods and Service Tax   Sales also escalated with festival and weddings related buying and improved rural sentiment  Meanwhile  demand in China in the first half was 4  below prior year levels reflecting customer shift from pure 24k gold to lower carat gold jewelry  which remained the dominant trend Technology demand registered its third consecutive quarter of growth in the second quarter  Gold used in technology rose 2  year over year  driven by growth in demand for bonding wire  Printed Circuit Boards  PCBs  and LEDs  particularly in the automotive sector Investment in gold bars and coins improved 11  year over year  from exceptionally weak demand last year  China and India were primary catalysts Central banks purchased 94 5 tons in the second quarter  20  rise year over year  This brought the total in first half to 176 7 tons  down 3  year over year  One major development in the second quarter was Turkey buying 21 tons   its first significant addition to reserves since the 1980s ETF Inflows Slowed DownCompared with the last year s record pace  ETF inflows have slowed  In the first half of 2017  inflows reached 167 9 tons  Europe mainly drove the ETF market in 2017  accounting for 76  of inflows in the first half The three main factors that influenced investor attitudes toward gold ETFs were   monetary policy normalization  gold price and event risk  The prospect of continued monetary tightening dampened ETF demand  Rising interest rates are usually considered as negative for gold Higher gold prices led to some investors taking a more cautious approach  Event risk  particularly surrounding geopolitical tension  remained a key driver of demand for ETFs  Frequent global terrorist incidents  tension between the United States and North Korea added to the inflows Supply Growth in the Red  A Signal of Caution Mine Production was flat at 1 557 tons in the first half  In the second quarter  mine production was pegged at 791 2 tons  the lowest second quarter since 2014  Production in China dipped 8  due to more stringent environmental regulations  In Tanzania  an ongoing dispute between the government and Acacia Mining led to 20  plunge in production  Production in Mongolia declined 30  year over year  as Oyu Tolgoi continues through a planned phase of low grading In Indonesia  the resumption of concentrate exports from Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE      operated Grasberg mine led to 30  rise in gold production  In Suriname  the continued ramp up of Newmont Mining Corp  s  NYSE      Merian gold mine helped output surge by 80  year over year  In Canada  second quarter output rose by 8  year over year  partly due to the start up of the Hope Bay and Brucejack mines Sector Level Earnings TrendPer the Zacks classification  the gold mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector  The sector s earnings rose 7  in the second quarter  a deceleration from growth of 13 5  witnessed in first quarter 2017  Even though the sector s earnings will decline 11 2  in the third quarter  growth will resume with a projected 9 1  rise in earnings for the fourth quarter   For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others  please read our  report  Industry Ranking   NegativeThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  The way to look at the complete list of industries is that  we put our X industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Click here to know more  Within the Zacks Industry classification  the gold mining industry is grouped under the  sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   The gold mining industry occupies a space in the bottom half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of  172 Improved Price Performance  Attractive ValuationYear to date  the Zacks Gold Mining  has gained 13 0   outperforming the S P 500 s advance of 11 9  Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures   the gold mining industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 7 55  lower than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 09 Where Is the Industry Headed In the United States  even though there are positive expectations about President Trump s economic proposals  there are also concerns  Further  the United States North Korea imbroglio has turned the tables this year for gold  Mounting fears regarding what s next   negotiation or war   works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during political turmoil Macroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years  Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent  gold demand will increase in tandem  In Asia  gold demand is mainly retail demand for the metal  due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China While demand will remain strong  supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports  Despite major miners improving cash flow and cutting debt in the last few years  project capital expenditure remains at multi year lows There are a few new projects and expansions anticipated to commence production this year  Further  those in the near term pipeline are generally fairly modest in scale  Per the World Gold Council  the project pipeline will experience a small pick up in 2017 and 2018 before global mine production levels begin to decline in 2019  The combination of lower mined gold supply and higher demand could eventually propel the prices north How to Play the IndustryDespite a low ranking now  improved performance compared with the S P 500  low valuation and earnings growth expectation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry  Investors can consider the following gold stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank Golden Star Resources Ltd   NYSEMKT       Randgold Resources Ltd   Nasdaq      and Kinross Gold

16305,237820,FCX,The Stock Market Gets A Reflex Bounce,opinion,"AT40   35 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   46 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   11 4  14 0  decrease Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary Since last Thursday when I lasted posted Above the 40  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   increased 4 percentage points  AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is flat since then  T2107 takes some of the shine off the rebound from Thursday s low that sent the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   closing above its 50DMA on Tuesday  The NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  also closed above their respective 50DMAs  Note the the 20DMA for each index is in decline

The S P 500  SPY  surged a percent to regain its 50DMA support 

The NASDAQ made an even clearer statement with 1 4  gain that took the tech laden index well above its 50DMA 

The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  made a very clean gap up over its 50DMA
The big dramatic change occurred in volatility  As has been the case for a while  the last spike could only sustain flight for a few days before completely imploding  The volatility index  VIX  cratered from 15 6  just above the critical 15 35 pivot  to 11 4  hovering just above the level I consider to be  extremely low  

Imagine that   another volatility implosion  The VIX lost 14 0  on the day 
While I missed trading this latest volatility fade  I jumped at the opportunity to re establish my standing call options in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  NYSE UVXY   For good measure  I also bought puts on ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures ETF  NYSE SVXY   With the indices above their 50DMAs  I consider these positions to be hedges  not bearish bets  My short term trading call stays at neutral until the S P 500 closes above the topping pattern formed by last week s selling  Unlike my last short lived switch to bullishness  I am not rushing to get ahead of a reflex bounce from  close enough  oversold conditions  AT40 in the low 30s   
There are two indices which make me think today was mostly about reflexive buying 
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  came within a hair of 2017 s closing low and was in the red year to date  Tuesday s 1 1  bounce makes the index appear to have confirmed solid support despite last week s 200DMA breakdown 

In one month  the iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  went from all time high to the closing low for 2017 and a 200DMA breakdown 
AT40 and AT200 suggest that a sizable number of stocks are lagging the major indices  The under performing small caps are a part of that story  There are also a notable group of S P 500 stocks that are heavy weights on the trading action  PowerShares S P 500 High Beta ETF  NYSE SPHB   SPHB bounced off its lows of 2017 and barely crept back into the green for the year  I include the PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility ETF  NYSE SPLV  for comparison 

The PowerShares S P 500 High Beta ETF  SPHB  has been stuck in a trading range all year  it dates back to last December   The index promptly bounced off the lows for the year 

The PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility ETF  SPLV  has clearly helped lead the S P 500 higher this year  The index is up 9 6  year to date 
On this day of rebounds  I had a big whiff and a bunt single 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  rebounded nicely from its former all time closing high set in May  On Monday  my lowball offer for call options was never filled  and I missed Tuesday s 1 6  rebound  If AAPL delivers a dip on Wednesday  I will likely pay up for some call options in anticipation of a fresh challenge of the current all time highs 
Apple  AAPL  seems to be fortifying support at its former all time high even as the stock is stuck in a post earnings trading range 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  steadily dribbled downward after hitting a post earnings and fresh all time high in late July  After Walt Disney Company  NYSE DIS  announced it will dump NFLX as a distribution platform  the NFLX sell off kicked into a slightly more urgent gear  Yet  NFLX s 50DMA was up to the task for providing support  I speculated on call options on yesterday s test and promptly locked in profits today with NFLX on its way to a 1 6  gain 
Netflix  NFLX  made an almost picture perfect bounce off 50DMA support 
One of the big stories on the day was copper  Its price hit a 3 year high in a move that has to be interpreted as bullish for the global economy  While I am already long Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   I am looking at adding call options to the mix to play what looks like an imminent breakout 
Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  is trying to breakout from its post earnings pullback

16345,237860,FCX,Chart Of The Day  Rio Tinto Rides Copper s Surge,opinion,"By Pinchas Cohen
Copper  sometimes called the red metal  is red hot right now  Its price has surged to the highest level for the metal in more than two years 
While the immediate beneficiaries are producers such as Australian British multinational metal miner Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   copper   alongside the biggest oil upleg since November   is leading the rally in commodities and global indices 
An industrial metal used for manufacturing and construction  copper took off after the IMF raised its growth expectations for China for the remainder of this year and the next 
There some irony for the US economy in copper s recent gains  Once a hot commodity because of Trump s infrastructure plans  the metal fell as markets gave up on the US President s agenda becoming reality  But now  thanks to more aggressive growth expectations for China  it s on the move again 
Yesterday  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  reported during its earnings release that Chinese infrastructure equipment was responsible for a 10 percent boost in its second quarter revenue  leading shares to their highest level since March 2012 

Copper has been trading within a falling channel since February 2011  Since August of that year  it wasn t even able to approach the top of the channel  that is  until yesterday  Today  it crossed above the top  forming a daily shooting star  suggesting a decline 
Some form of price consolidation is due in any case  whether it remains within a downtrend  even though it reached the resistance of its downtrend line  or if investors believe it already bottomed and will continue to rise  since it gained 4 percent yesterday  reaching its highest level since May 2015 
The 78 28 daily RSI is the most oversold since November  though its 65 68 weekly RSI is far below the 72 5 weekly RSI of the same time  It s even below the previous  January 2 770 peak  This divergence may suggest a short term correction  even if it may cause a trend shift in the longer term 
Rio Tinto Gets A Boost Off Copper
Along with it being one of the top 10 global copper producers  Rio Tinto is making headlines  and not in a good way  The financial media is focusing on a corruption investigation over its Guinea operations  after company emails alluded to contractual payments to an unidentified consultant relating to its project in the Simandou mountains  which contain the world s largest untapped iron ore deposits 
The company says it conducted an internal investigation after it became aware of the emails in August  The executive involved has been fired and Rio Tinto has pledged to cooperate fully with the authorities 
That seemed to be good enough for investors  who yesterday boosted the stock by 5 2 percent  with a close that was 4 65 percent higher  Perhaps the rush on copper drowned out the negative news  or maybe savvy investors took advantage of Rio Tinto s industry leading fundamentals to acquire shares on this copper boom 
Of the top five copper producers  only Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  beat Rio  soaring 14 75 percent on the prospect of securing  with the Indonesian government for its local copper mine  The remaining three  top copper mining stocks advanced less  Anglo American  OTC NGLOY  rose only 1 2 percent  Southern Copper  NYSE SCCO  gained 3 15 percent and BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  moved higher by 3 43 percent 
Another reason Freeport shares rose nearly three times those of Rio  is the fact that the good news on the stock follows a period of it being under owned  This is an odd assessment  considering that all five top copper stocks gained by percentages in the mid teens since the May bottom  Either way  Freeport s triple surge makes it the most over owned stock right now among its peers 
Rio s Fundamentals
Yearly EPS of 255 30
Return on Equity of 12 05   profits generated from shareholder capital
Return on Invested Capital of 6 45  dividing Net Income   Dividends by Total Capital Invested
Return on Assets of 5 28  measuring net income from total company assets  revealing how quickly a company can turn its assets into profits
Rio Tinto may also pay a  1 billion special dividend  to be announced when it reveals H1 profits in August  on lower capex  cost cutting and commodity prices rebounding 

The stock has been trading within a downward trend since February 2011  On July 14  the price crossed above this 6 5 year downtrend line for the first time  However  it fell back below it  Yesterday  it gapped up  crossing again over the downtrend line  and perhaps more importantly  overcoming the prices of the initial failed upside breakout  Notice that the initial breakout was on diminishing volume  while yesterday s breakout was on the highest volume since March 
While the price didn t enjoy the support of participation before  it does now  The 50 dma crossed over the 100 dma  which crossed over the 200 dma   a double  golden cross   which demonstrates the multi layered parameter of a rising trend  The last time this happened  in August  the price advanced over 40 percent  from  33 to  46  in the five months leading up to February 
On the other hand  the MACD provided a sell signal  when its slower moving average crossed below its faster moving average  and the RSI seemed to have completed an oversold top 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would avoid a  bull trap  by waiting on a long position for the end of the advance and the correction to follow   which should be confirmed by diminishing volume   during which time the MACD and RSI should cool down 
Moderate traders may wait on a long position for a correction toward the intersection of the short term rising uptrend since June 20 and the violated long term downtrend line since February 2011  in the mid  44 area 
Aggressive traders would enter a long position now  with a stop loss beneath  44 
Very Aggressive traders may enter a short position now  against the trend  with a stop loss above yesterday s  46 18 high  hoping for a correction  before entering long when it turns back up ",2017-07-26,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day:-copper-and-rio-–-get-‘em-while-they’re-hot-200203526,200203526

Before the election last year  copper hit rising support at  3  and spent a good six months testing this support  After it held for a good length of time  a rally then took place  pushing copper up to test the top of falling channel resistance 
Now  copper is breaking above 6 year falling resistance at  4   which historically is a positive sign  And that may be good for other companies in the industry

16443,237958,FCX,Supply Resumes But Copper Prices Hold  MMI Only Falls A Point,opinion,"Copper prices continued to trade flat in March  Over this month  strikes at major mines Escondida and Cerro Verde ended while Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  got a temporary export permit for its Grasberg mine 
Escondida s Strike Ends
The strike at the world s largest copper mine  Escondida in Chile  ended in the final week of March  The strike had lasted 44 days  longer than expected 
The mine is not rushing to ramp up back to prestrike output levels  Owner BHP Billiton  LON BLT  has said will outline the impact of the strike on Escondida s output in results due for release on April 26  The strike is estimated to have cost Escondida more than 200 000 metric tons in copper production 

Workers at the mine voted to return to work  despite not having reached an agreement on a new pay deal with management  Instead  workers extended their existing contract by 18 months  losing out on a new signing bonus or wage increase  but they will be able to renegotiate a new deal in 2018 after a new pro union Chilean labor law goes into into effect 
Cerro Verde Mine Resumes Operations
Cerro Verde  Peru s largest copper mine  had been operating at 50  of capacity since workers initiated a strike on March 10  At the end of the month  workers signed an agreement as the union accepted the company s offer to improve family health care benefits and pay workers their portion of the mine s profits earlier than usual  The mine produced just under 500 000 mt of the red metal last year 
Grasberg Mine Gets Temporary Export Permit
Freeport McMoran was granted a temporary permit to export copper concentrates from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia  the world s largest gold mine which also produces copper  The new permit broke a 12 week deadlock that had cut supply to Asian smelters  The new export license will last eight months  The amnesty means the company can renew deliveries of copper concentrates in Asia after declaring force majeure in February  but longer term discussions over the company s rights in Indonesia have yet to be determined 
What This Means For Metal Buyers
Copper supply disruptions have lasted longer than expected  Although they seem to have come to an end  their impact on supply still need to be outlined  In addition  these strikes have set the case for wage negotiations across the industry 
Some major contract negotiations in large mines are due in the coming months  In the meantime  copper investors might focus their analysis on macro factors such as the ongoing China U S  trade negotiations  the performance of the U S  dollar and global demand for industrial metals ",2017-04-10,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/supply-resumes-but-copper-prices-hold,-mmi-only-falls-a-point-200181897",200181897
16444,237959,FCX,Copper  Is The Bear Market Continuing ,opinion,"Readers vividly remember how hot the copper market was just 2 months ago  That is when we wrote that  as the metal attempted for the sixth time to break above  2 80 
However  copper did not manage to go higher  even after so many breakout attempts  As it became clear that there was not sufficient bullish power in the copper market  we recommended readers to carefully look at the   That is how it goes  if a market is not able to go higher  investors better wait and focus on other markets in the meantime 
Our call was correct  as  since then  copper was not able to go higher  It only lost value  and it seems that process is accelerating now  The chart below shows that the recent decline is picking up steam  and that copper is setting a series of lower lows 
Visibly  the chart suggests to keep a close eye on the  2 50 level  purple circle on the chart   That is exactly where the trendline of the bear market channel runs  Last November  the trendline was broken to the upside  Right now  it is the breakdown level 
In other words  if the price of copper breaks below  2 50  it goes back in its bear market channel  in which case its tactical bull market would end 
Worst case  if copper falls till  2 00  we recall readers to check our  for important bear market price points and decision points 
Are we saying the bear market in copper continues  Not yet  there is still a chance that  2 50 will provide support  Investors should wait for confirmation  Copper tends to move in an aggressive way  so it s better to wait until a new trend is confirmed  as there is plenty of upside or downside  depending on a bull or bear market

For the last three months  Freeport McMoRan has been dealing with regulatory restrictions on its copper concentrate exports  interrupting production at its Indonesia operations  Fortunately for the company and its investors  these restrictions were finally lifted  and Freeport has been given a six month timeframe from the Indonesian government to resume operations while it negotiates a new licensing deal 
Phoenix based Freeport also reported first quarter financial results before the bell today  Earnings per share came in at 15 cents  this number excludes two cents from non recurring items   missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents per share  Revenues of  3 34 billion also fell short of our consensus estimate and declined 4 7  year over year 
In Q1  Freeport s sales of copper and gold were lower than projections  The company sold 809 million pounds of copper and 182 thousand ounces of gold  compared to expectations of 1 billion pounds of copper 160 thousand ounces of gold  This was driven primarily by the regulatory restrictions in Indonesia 
 The resumption of concentrate exports in Indonesia and expected continued strong performance from our Americas operations will enable us to generate significant cash flows in the balance of the year to achieve our balance sheet objectives  Our team is focused on reaching a positive near term resolution to protect our past investments and support our long term investment plans in Indonesia and in building long term values in our large portfolio of high quality copper assets in the Americas   said President and CEO Richard C  Adkerson

16455,237970,FCX,Freeport McMoRan Outlook Turning Bullish,opinion,"Freeport McMoRan Incorporation  NYSE FCX  is the world s largest publicly traded copper and molybdenum producer and it s also a major producer of gold but almost 70  of revenues are from the sale of copper  The Phoenix  Arizona based company is primarily engaged in mineral exploration and development  mining and milling of copper  gold  molybdenum and silver  as well as the smelting and refining of copper concentrates 
In the recent 2 months  Freeport s shares dropped 27  as it had interrupted the production in Grasberg mine which is the largest gold mine and the third largest copper mine in the world because of a regulatory restrictions in Indonesia on its copper concentrate exports  However  the company recently announced that the matter was resolved as it s looking to protect and support its past   long term investment plans in Indonesia and it s now resuming exports of copper concentrate from  The recent actions helped its stock to bounce  but the move is still weak so let s take a look a the technical picture using  
FCX Elliott Wave View
Weekly Chart  FCX did a double three structure from both 2007   2011 peaks and managed to reach both equal legs target at  9 15    4 16 with 7 swings already in place before finding a bottom early last year  Since then the stock managed to rally and it both cycles from the peaks already ended even the price level still didn t break above the descending trend line  Consequently the sentiment for the stock is turning bullish and it should be looking for a bigger 3 waves correction toward the 50  area around  32 
Daily Chart  The stock is showing 5 swing bullish sequence from January 2016 low and will remain supported as long as October 2016 low keeps holding  Currently it ended a flat correction in wave   X   and would ideally resume the move to the upside looking for a target at equal legs area 19 82   22 24 to end 7 swings sequence around the weekly trend line and start a 3 waves pullback 

The short term turn around for FCX would happen if the stock has already ended the cycle from January 2016 low  in that case it will be only doing 3 waves bounce against the peak before another leg lower take place toward the 50  61 8  Fibonacci area around  10 3    8 71 then the stock find buyers again as long as pivot at 3 52 is holding 

Recap 
The mining giant Freeport McMoRan is in a good financial shape despite the Grasberg mine issue in Indonesia and the technical outlook for its stock is turning to the upside as long as the 2016 low at  3 52 keeps holding  This means unless the company go bankrupt then no matter what path it will take in the near term  it will end up bouncing to higher level around  20 at first stage either from current levels or from  10 area then it will be looking to extend toward  33 later on ",2017-04-28,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freeport-mcmoran-(fcx)-outlook-turning-bullish-200186014,200186014
16456,237971,FCX,Strike at Indonesian Copper Mine  Will Prices Drop ,opinion,"Strike at a large mine
The mining company Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  reported a strike at its copper mine Grasberg in Indonesia  Will the copper prices grow 
The Grasberg is the third copper producer in the world  The suspension of its work may cause a copper deficit in the world market  An additional factor for the price increase may be the decline in trade inventories on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in China  Copper premiums rose from the minimum annual level of  10 to  75   the highest level since March of this year 
Besides  according to the Japan Copper and Brass Association data  the production of rolled copper in Japan increased by 6 9  in April compared to the same period of the previous year  amounting to 67 65 thousand tons  In March the production dropped by 2 5   Let us recall that due to the holidays in the US  China and the UK  local commodity exchanges will be closed on Monday  
On the daily timeframe  Copper  D1 is near the resistance line of the descending channel  To open a Buy position  it has to be primarily breached up  The further price increase is possible in case of the production cuts and higher global demand 
The Parabolic indicator gives a bullish signal 
The Bollinger bands indicate ordinary volatility and are tilted upwards 
The  is below 50  It has formed a positive divergence 
The  gives a bullish signal 
The bullish momentum may develop in case Copper exceeds the previous high at 2 63  This level may serve as the entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the 2 last fractal lows  the 200 day moving average  the Parabolic signal and the lower Bollinger band at 2 46  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point 
More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level at 2 46 without reaching the order at 2 63 we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

16477,237992,FCX,Supply Shock Hits Copper Industry Hard,opinion,"In the lucrative world of small cap investing  a supply demand imbalance always piques my interest 
Those who position themselves alongside a fantastic supply shortage are virtually assured to profit 
Let s take the prevailing shortage of olives as a simple example 
Erratic weather in Italy  Greece and Spain has been wreaking havoc on regional harvests  and no crop is more sensitive to climate irregularities than olives 
In Italy  hot and muggy conditions were perfect for fruit flies  and they ravaged olive groves  Consequently  Italy s olive production will fall by 50  
Worse yet  when you combine Italy s plight with a heat wave in Greece and floods in Spain   the olive market is in a full blown supply crisis 
Now  assuming that olive demand remains constant  the price of olives and olive derivatives must adjust upwardly  which is exactly what s happening 

So how do investors benefit 
It s simple  really 
During shortages  suppliers can charge higher prices  which flow straight to the bottom line   resulting in higher stock prices 
The bottom line impact is even greater in the small cap world  as such stocks are known for their upward volatility 
Bottom line  I m aware of every shortage happening in the world   even of olives 
Unfortunately  there s no direct way to invest alongside the explosion of olive prices 
But that s OK   another supply shortage is beginning to get serious  And this particular supply shortage is something we can play  too 
I asked my senior analyst  Martin Hutchinson  to get you up to speed 
Copper Outshines Gold in 2017
Copper is on a tear so far in 2017  with the base metal up 11  on the London Metal Exchange 
I m very bullish on the trend continuing  which puts a small cap Canadian miner in the cross hairs
The stout miner I m tracking is enjoying increased production from its copper mines in Canada and Peru  and the company also has a mine in Arizona gaining traction 
But before I reveal the company  I ll break down my top five bullish forces that will keep copper shining in 2017 
Bullish Force  1  Monetary Policy Worldwide
Now that the world economy is growing again  a decade of ultraloose monetary policies has led to higher inflation and faster growth in commodity prices 
Copper is in a prime position to benefit in an inflationary environment 
Bullish Force  2  Faster U S  Growth
President Trump s plan to spend on    along with his deregulation initiatives   is beginning to produce a burst of faster growth in the United States 
The S P 500 s 11  uptick since early November doesn t hurt  either 
Since U S  growth is bound to impact global growth as well  copper will benefit 
Copper  known traditionally as  Dr  Copper   is the one commodity most sensitive to the state of the global economy 
Thus  economic sluggishness in 2012 16 caused its price to decline 
But the opposite is happening in light of the recent growth spurt  which is already reflected in higher copper prices this year 
Bullish Force  3  Restricted Supply
The next major increase to the global copper supply won t happen until mining begins at Mongolia s Oyu Tolgoi project  which is controlled by Turquoise Hill Resources 
However  construction has yet to start 
The political risks in Mongolia are substantial  and mining operations won t come on line until 2020 at the earliest 
Meanwhile  output from Chile s copper mines is declining  And Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold s  NYSE FCX  Grasberg mine  in Indonesia  has restricted supply even more 
The Indonesian mine is bedeviled by labor unrest and an increasingly nasty long running dispute between FCX and the Indonesian government 
Bullish Force  4  Electric Vehicles
Every Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  electric vehicle uses three times the amount of copper as a conventional internal combustion vehicle 
Moreover  Tesla intends to produce some 500 000 vehicles in 2018 
Tesla s increased output alone will add 35 000 tons to copper demand 
Oh  and Tesla isn t alone in its plans to ramp up production of electric vehicles 
So copper demand will rise more rapidly than analysts  projections 
Bullish Force  5  The Supply Demand Imbalance
Copper demand was expected to exceed supply by 2019 even without my two accelerating factors  faster economic growth and increased electric vehicle production  
Once we account for those factors  the supply demand imbalance will further spark copper s ascent 
Of course  to invest alongside higher prices  we could buy shares in one of the major copper companies 
The most solid in terms of supply and political risk is Southern Copper Corporation  NYSE SCCO  
But to gain greater leverage  I recommend midsize miner HudBay Minerals Inc   TO HBM    a  2 billion capitalization company that produces copper  gold and zinc 
The company s mines are located in Peru and Canada   and it also runs a stateside operation in Arizona 
I particularly like how levered Hudbay Minerals is to the price of copper  as copper represents roughly two thirds of revenue 
The latest regulatory filings looked good across the board 
Copper production was up 19   gold production was up 14   silver production was up 34  and zinc production was up 8  
It s worth noting that low copper prices and the launch of a new Peruvian mine meant a breakeven year in 2016 
However  its cost of production  after subtracting credits for other products  was  1 52 per pound  which lies well below 2016 s copper price and far below copper s current price of  2 74 
With operating cash flow of  122 million against total debt that sits at 72  of equity  I believe Hudbay Minerals is a real bargain 
Throw in a dividend of  0 02 per share and you ve got the perfect  investment to benefit from higher copper prices ",2017-02-28,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/supply-shock-hits-copper-industry-hard-200177216,200177216

16496,238011,FCX,Why Most Analysts  2017 Copper Price Forecasts Are Wrong,opinion,"Copper prices are trading near  6 000 per metric ton  up 30  from just four months ago  Things can change quickly and I don t know where prices will be by the end of the year  but what s clear to me is that most analysts  forecasts seem way off  According to a recent survey polled by Reuters  copper analysts are are expecting prices to average  5 350 mt this year 
In my opinion  this is a very conservative price average and quite bearish due to what  the human tendency to attach or  anchor   our thoughts to a reference point even when it makes no logical sense  Analysts see that copper prices have risen significantly and quickly  so they anchor the new price of  6 000 mt onto the  4 500 mt level where prices were trading at just a few months ago  This creates the idea that  6 000 mt is an expensive price for copper and  for this reason  you will almost see no one but me calling for an average above  6 000 mt this year 
Most of the time  how high the metal was trading earlier is irrelevant when there has been a change in the metal s underlying fundamentals  There are many things that affect the price of a metal  but at the end it all comes down to three things  Demand  supply and investors  sentiment  All these are looking much more bullish for copper compared to last year 
Demand for copper has improved as China  Once again  increased infrastructure and property construction spending last year has boosted the metal there  An increase in infrastructure spending is also expected in the U S  This boost in demand for metals has translated into price increases for all industrial metals   that creates a tailwind to any individual metal as investors tend to overreact on bullish news while dismissing bearish news 
In addition  we are witnessing an increase in raw material prices  Oil prices have nearly doubled since this time last year  Higher energy prices increase the cost of producing metals  especially those energy intensive ones like aluminum  and boost investor appetite for industrial metals 
In addition to this more bullish macro environment  copper is also developing a bullish narrative of supply short fall  The copper supply has been hit due to issues at BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP  s Escondida mine and Freeport McMoRan s  NYSE FCX  Grasberg mine 
A strike at Escondida in Chile  the world s largest copper mine  appeared far from ending this week as the conflict neared its third week  with the union denying a news report that it had returned to talks with the mining company  The mine produced about 5  of the world s copper in 2016 
Freeport McMoRan is barred from exporting copper ore from Grasberg in Indonesia  To make things worse  the company started started talking about adjusting its mining rates and seems headed for arbitration with the government 
There will be other temporary suspensions at smaller copper mines such at El Soldado mine in Chile  In addition  some major contract negotiations in large mines are due this year 
What This Means For Metal Buyers
Copper prices might look expensive compared to what they were just three months ago  however that rally might just be the beginning of a bigger move  Sentiment in the industrial metal complex remains quite bullish and current supply issues could turn into large deficits if stoppages and disruptions are prolonged  building the case for new rallies in copper prices  Analysts price forecasts are looking quite conservative ",2017-03-01,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-most-analysts’-2017-copper-price-forecasts-are-wrong-200177376,200177376

Commentary Two days ago  I titled my Above the 40 update  The S P 500 Coiled In Anticipation   I described the building technical tension that pointed the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   down a runway  really a ladder  going from the bottom to the top of its upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel  The subsequent jump in the index could not have unfolded any closer to my description  In the wake of   the S P 500 gapped up  closed right below its upper BB  and printed a 1 4  gain for its troubles 

A very bullish breakout for the S P 500 to yet another all time high 
The first big move in my pairs trade of long SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  versus short iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  could not have looked any better  GLD gapped down but rallied to close with a minimal 0 1  loss  TLT gapped down and stayed down with a 1 9  loss at the close  Suddenly GLD looks like it could even breakout while leaving TLT further behind  If TLT does not immediately follow through with more selling  I will likely move to lock in profits on my puts and prepare for the next entry point for the short TLT side of the pairs trade 

The SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  rallied back from a gap down that would have confirmed a bearish rejection from 200DMA resistance 


The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  finds itself below its 50DMA once again  Will it break through the bottom of its recent trading range this time 
The S P 500 s bullish breakout day FINALLY ended a 55 day streak where the index failed to move 1  in any direction  The last day with a 1  move was December 7th  At that time  the S P 500 gained 1 3  and broke out to a new all time high  AT40 ALSO crossed into over bought territory  the combination of all time highs and overbought trading conditions is something I expect  After two more days of small gains  the S P 500 settled into a trading range that included a divergence versus AT40  T2108   AT40 drifted downward before bottoming in early February  The divergence ended with a brief breakout for AT40 above its downtrend 
Now  a new divergence has emerged  It is milder than the first with the S P 500 basically rallying away from an AT40 that refuses to budge much  AT40 has failed to return to overbought conditions for 25 straight trading days  At this rate  when  if   AT40 finally returns to overbought conditions  I will have to give serious consideration to a quick flip to a bearish trading bias  For now  the S P 500 s breakout raises the trigger for a bearish bias  if the index closes below yesterday s intraday low at 2359  the red flags will fly 
Overall  I am quite surprised by the inability of buyers to keep AT40 in overbought conditions at the same time the major indices are performing so well  This should be time for an extended overbought rally  Instead  it seems that the market s appetite has been satiated with the current herd of high performers 
My expectation for a volatility implosion after Trump s address worked out well for much of the beginning of the trading day  The volatility index  the VIX  gapped down and quickly declined to a 8 8  loss  I took profits on my call option on the ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY   but I decided to hold onto my fistful of put options on the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  in anticipation of an on going sell off 
After the dust settled  the VIX bounced back  is that why GLD roared back   and closed with a 2 9  loss  The VIX managed to bounce in picture perfect form off its 50DMA support  Suddenly  the VIX looks like it is building its muscle to remain elevated rally or no rally 

With a picture perfect bounce of its 50DMA  suddenly  the volatility index looks ready to rally 


Is the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  starting to stabilize  
It is very possible traders will bid up volatility going into the Fed meeting out of fear that THIS rate hike is the one that deflates the stock market  I highly doubt the Fed will make any single rate hike that causes the market to unravel given it will only hike after the market has prepared well in advance  The Fed prefers that a rate hike happens as a foregone conclusion  So  I look forward to fading volatility around the Fed meeting in what could be the biggest volatility implosion since the November election  In the meantime  I bought a single UVXY call option as a starting hedge to my puts that expire Friday 
The presumed catalyst for these moves was a surge in the 30 day Fed Fund Futures that took the odds of the a March Fed rate hike from 35 4  to 66 4   New York Fed President William Dudley stoked the expectations in an interview by asserting   case for monetary tightening has become more compelling      
I cannot even remember when last I have seen such a dramatic shift in the odds profile  I now need to quickly shift my thinking to the implications of a market anticipating a rate hike in two weeks  Besides a stronger VIX  one likely implication is a fresh rally in the U S  dollar index  DXY0  going into the March Fed meeting  The U S  dollar index ended the day at a new 6 week closing high and broke out from 50DMA resistance 

The odds for a March rate hike surged dramatically 


The U S  dollar index is on the march again ever so slightly 
With the Trump Trade transitioning to the  Trump Volatility   I am keeping a closer eye on the various setups I have referenced in recent posts  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  triggered today with convincing follow through to the end of recent selling  I bought call options with an eye to a fresh 50DMA test  at a minimum  
Did Freeport McMoran  FCX  get  close enough  to a test of support at its 200DMA 
Suddenly cyber security looks a lot more vulnerable  Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW  was absolutely crushed in a 24 1  post earnings loss  PANW has struggled to regain momentum ever since its all time high in the summer of 2015  This collapse pushed PAWN to a new 2  year closing low  I speculated on a relief bounce with a single call option  Regardless  PANW is starting to look like dead money for a while 

The big post earnings gap down in November was not enough of a warning for traders and investors  The latest earnings report brought an abrupt end to a sharp 2 month rally that almost closed PANW s former post earnings gap down

16498,238013,FCX,Copper MMI Contains Gains In February,opinion,"Copper prices remained supported in February  trading in the ballpark of  6 000 per metric ton as a return to production at two top mines  which are combined responsible for some 8  of global output  looks increasingly doubtful in the near term 
Escondida Mine
A strike at the Escondida in Chile  the world s largest copper mine  appeared far from ending during February  The strike increasingly turned more violent as protesters blocked roads and battled police  The events reflect the increasing bitterness and division between the two sides  as positions still appear to be far apart after almost four weeks of strike  Key differences include disagreement over changes to shift patterns and the level of benefits new workers receive 
Grasberg Mine
Meanwhile  Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  is under a concentrate export ban as it negotiates a new operating license from the government of Indonesia  Having limited storage capacity  the company will be forced to drastically cut output if Indonesia doesn t give the company an export license to send material to its local smelter for processing 

In late February  the company announced that it sees  no returning to business as usual   as the miner cut output and laid off workers  Copper concentrate production at the mine has been stopped since Feb  11  and ore output is being limited to stockpiling for future processing 
In a memo  the company stated that during February it revised its operating plans  slowed its underground expansion and announced plans to drastically reduce manpower levels in an effort to cut costs as the company needs to survive while it works with the government to achieve a mutually viable solution to resume exports  So far  that agreement doesn t seem close to coming together in the near term 
This year  there will be other temporary suspensions at smaller copper mines such at El Soldado mine in Chile  In addition  some major contract negotiations in large mines are due this year

The stock market s underpinnings continued their slides on Wednesday with AT40 dropping to a level last seen the day after the U S  Presidential election  AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAs  dropped in unison and confirmed the end of its uptrend  Bullish momentum has come to an end 


AT40  T2108  traded below 50  for the first time since the day after the U S  Presidential election 


AT200  T2107  plunged to a new three month low and confirmed the end of its post election uptrend 
A trader may never guess at the weakening foundations while watching the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   drip ever so slowly downward  The hardy index STILL did not close below the low of the day before its last bullish breakout   a threshold I have held out as the dividing line between a neutral and a bearish stance on the market 
The S P 500  SPY  fell a mere 0 2  and once again stopped short of triggering a bearish trading call 
The volatility index  the VIX  once again showed little interest in flagging trouble ahead 

The volatility index  the VIX  still shows little concern as it gained just 3 6  on the day  However  a bottom may be forming 
With this conflicting setup creating what looks like a  quiet  breakdown a week before the Fed meets  I decided to look at some other technical indicators related to AT40  T2114 and T2116  These indicators measure the percentage of stocks that are a certain distance below their 40DMAs  The bigger the number  the worse off the stock market is  T2114 measures the distance by one channel   think of it as a Bollinger Band channel or approximately one standard deviation  T2116 is two standard deviations 
The charts below suggest there is increasing stress under the hood of an otherwise serene market  A quiet breakdown is indeed underway  The upshot is that a fresh BUYING opportunity will likely accompany these indices on a retest of former highs  In other words  whatever extended sell off awaits around the corner will likely be shallow and brief  don t blink   
T2114  the percentage of stocks trading  one standard deviation  below their respective 40DMAs  returned to pre elections levels and confirmed increasing stress among stocks 


Like T2114  T2116  the percentage of stocks trading TWO  standard deviations  below their respective 40DMAs  fell to pre election levels and confirmed growing stress under the relative calm of the market 
The new high   new low ratio  T2117  also helps display the sudden change in market momentum  New highs went from close to 100  of the total of stocks making new 52 week highs and new 52 week lows on March 1st  93 5   to just 32 7  one week later 

The New High   New Low ratio  T2117  has taken a sudden and abrupt turn for the worse  its lowest point yet since the aftermath of November s presidential election 
A large drop in oil prices drove a good portion of the incremental stress and breakdowns     Oil  GASP  Plummets   

 The U S  Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies for last week came in 8 2 million barrels higher  That means total commercial inventories hit a weekly record level of 528 4 million   its ninth consecutive climb 
The EIA also raised its forecast on crude production for this year and next  This year crude production will average at 9 21 million barrels a day  up from the previous 8 98 million forecast  In 2018  output is expected to hit 9 73 million barrels  up slightly from the 9 53 million call  

The big surprise inventory build took out the oil complex in profound ways  The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  sliced right through critical support 
The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLE  sliced through 200DMA support with a 2 6  loss 
When I pointed out the breakdown in VanEck Vectors Russia  NYSE RSX  and made a play on the Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3X Shares  NYSE RUSS   I vaguely assumed something Russia specific was brewing even as other emerging markets were hurting  Now it looks like traders were trying to get ahead of the oil plunge 

The VanEck Vectors Russia ETF  RSX  dropped 2 5  as selling extended the 50DMA breakdown
Stocks across the commodity complex continued to suffer  My play on Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  looks certain to fail now that FCX has punctured 50DMA support 

Freeport McMoran  FCX  broke down below 200DMA support as it continued to tumble through its downward trending lower Bollinger Band  BB  channel 
A resurgent U S  dollar index  DXY0  likely added to the weight on the commodities complex  The dollar finished a complete recovery from last week s selling that accompanied Janet Yellen s speech last week  An extremely positive number from the ADP employment report pushed rate expectations ever higher 
The U S  dollar  DXY0  finished recovering its loss from last week s  sell the news  reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen s speech which affirmed the coming of a March rate hike 
The U S  dollar punched the Australian dollar  an important commodity currency  through 200DMA support 
Gold and silver could not withstand the pressure  Both SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  and iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  cracked through critical support at their respective 50DMAs 

The SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  gapped down and broke down below 50DMA support for a 0 6  loss 


The iShares Silver Trust  SLV  accompanied GLD in breaking 50DMA support 
So it looks like I got a bit too cute in closing out my gold versus bonds pairs trade and applying the profits on the put options on the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  to more GLD call options  Per plan  I did rush back into TLT put options as gold s weakness continued  I flipped those for a small profit on TLT s gap down  Extremely bullish silver speculators are likely mightily hurting now 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  gapped down to the bottom of its recent trading range  Buyers stepped in from there 
The breakdown theme played out with small caps as well  The iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  gave up its 50DMA support and put in play its 2017 low 
The iShares Russell 2000  IWM  broke down below 50DMA support and put 2017 lows into play 
Last week I pointed out how Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  just missed confirming a bullish bounce off 50DMA support  On Wednesday  TSLA returned to a bearish setup by following the day s breakdown theme 

Tesla  TSLA  closed below 50DMA support for the first time since last December 
There were a few brights spots of note 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  proved out my observation that President Trump s market moving power has transitioned to one of causing volatility that the market reverses relatively quickly  On Tuesday  President Trump once again talked lower drug prices for Americans  and once again IBB reacted by selling off  THIS time  IBB bounced right back the next day  I bought a call option on the pullback form the high of the day 

The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  rebounded immediately from Trump s latest bash 
Financials actually gapped up to start the day  The subsequent selling closed out the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  with no gain 
Financials helped prevent a larger market decline by closing flatline  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  even gapped up before succumbing to sellers 
Even Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP  provided a bright spot  SNAP followed through on my bullish reversal on the shares  Once again  the 5 minute chart shows the dynamism in the SNAP trade  This granularity has helped me spot key pivot points  Notice how SNAP reversed the opening gap up before powering higher  That is bullish follow through on an attempt to carve out some kind of bottom 

Snap Inc   SNAP  gained 6 4  on the day after a wobbly open and failing to hold its intraday high 
Even homebuilders had a good day  presumably on the strong jobs outlook 

The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  gained 1 3  in a rare demonstration of relative strength  ITB now trades at a new 9  year high 
Overall  it looks like next week s meeting of the U S  Federal Reserve will produce an imortant and telling pivot point for the market  Start bracing now as the coming week could be a race against all the  quiet  breakdowns in the stock market

16500,238015,FCX,Financials Continue Drag As Hints Of A Bullish Divergence Emerge,opinion,"After the U S  Federal Reserve hiked interest rates  the market s expectations on future rate hikes relaxed a bit  That relaxation prevented financials from getting the expected rate hike boost  That under performance continued on Friday  March 17 as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLF  fell almost 1  while the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   trickled down by 0 2  
The S P 500  SPY  experienced a large surge in volume  from quadruple witching   as it fell for the second day and continued a post Fed reversal 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  completed a full reversal of its bullish breakout from March 1st and looks poised for its first down month since September 
 I assume the long tail on XLF is a reporting error 
For 2017  the S P 500  SPY  has experienced just THREE periods of multi day pullbacks  Two of those three have occurred this month  The other period was the longest of the year  a shallow 4 day pullback that brought an end to the last over bought period  Instead of licking my chops in preparation for a long overdue confirmation of the deterioration of the underlying technicals of the stock market  I was taken aback by AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   AT40 bounced off its intraday low to end the day with a marginal gain  the rebound was quite a surprise given the weakness in financials  This  very  mild bullish divergence gives me pause  so I will now look to see whether the S P 500 follows through next week from its  very  mild post Fed swoon 
AT40 has now traded for 271 straight days above oversold conditions  AT40 above 20    My favorite technical indicator just missed oversold conditions ahead of the U S  Presidential election  but its bounce from there helped form the basis of my post Trump bullishness  The S P 500 has gained 27 5  since ending oversold conditions on February 12  2016 as part of the    This performance is a few percentage points above what I would expect if the  20  overperiod  ended here 
The chart below shows the history of the 20  overperiod  Note that the duration of the current 20  overperiod is in VERY rare territory  Yet  the duration could extend for more than another 100 trading days before I would call a market top just based on the duration alone  In the meantime  I am noting that the chart below suggests that a sell off back to oversold conditions would not cause a particularly large percentage drop in the S P 500  Some of that behavior was on display when AT40 dropped as low as 36 5  on March 14th while the S P 500 continued its reluctant swoon  The index ended that day just 1 3  off its all time high  Note well that these data do not indicate how much additional selling might occur during an oversold period 

S P 500 historical performance during the T2108 20  overperiod 
I am now 1 1 for my return to the weekly Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  trade  AAPL kept its price close to the vest until the post Fed celebration  I decided to hold onto my position for one more day in the hopes the stock would follow through  AAPL barely gained a penny  so I locked in slightly lower profits before the close  I decided to wait until Monday to reinitiate the trade  My decision may have caused me a good entry point for the next trade  AAPL strangely collapsed intraday into the close  The 90 minute sell off accelerated in the last hour 
I will have my eyes on AAPL right from Monday s open  I assume the rush to sell into the close was somehow related to    the simultaneous expiration of stock and index options  If so  AAPL should experience a nice bounce back at least Monday morning 

Apple  AAPL  has churned for the entire month of March 

This 5 minute chart of AAPL reveals the surprising rush to sell into the last close 
The monthly expiration of options is my time to review trades that went wrong  The most notable gaffes were Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   I stubbornly reinitiated my INTC  between earnings  trade as I think the sell off on the Mobileye  NYSE MBLY  acquisition was overdone  FCX is struggling with support at its 200DMA  I am content to wait for resolution of this battle before deciding my next move 

Intel  INTC  traded below its 200DMA for the first time since June  2016  The selling momentum seems to have ended quickly 

Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  is struggling to hold onto 200DMA support even as commodities in general regained buying interest last week 

Is the bullish divergence a hint of a change in market tone

16502,238017,FCX,Freeport Vs  Indonesia  The Elliott Wave Outlook,opinion,"It looks like Freeport is going to end up as a winner in the Grasberg saga 
Exports from Indonesia s Grasberg copper mine have been halted for 10 weeks now  As a result  shares of Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   one of the world s largest copper producers and majority stake owner of the mine  recently declined from  17 06 in January to  11 92 this Monday  And while the company is still negotiating the terms of a new export deal with the country s government  the Freeport s hourly price chart is already pointing higher for the stock 
The chart allows us to put the recent plunge into a proper Elliott Wave perspective  in order to see where it fits into the big picture count  As visible  Freeport McMoran stock rose from a low at  9 24 in mid October  2016  to as high as  16 42 forty days later  More importantly  that recovery took the shape of a five wave impulse  which means the trend is up  According to the theory  a three wave correction follows every impulse  Here  we could easily recognize an expanding flat correction  whose wave B makes a new swing high at  17 06  In this respect  the selloff people think was caused by the Grasberg mine dispute is actually a natural impulsive wave C  which completes the entire wave  2  corrective sequence exactly at the 61 8  Fibonacci level  What a coincidence 
If this analysis is correct  Freeport s 5 3 wave cycle is complete and the trend could be expected to resume in the direction of wave  1   The solution to Freeport s problems in Indonesia remains unknown  but  the habit of the market is to anticipate  not to follow   Right now  it seems to be anticipating a happy ending for the miner  Let s see ",2017-03-31,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freeport-vs-indonesia:-the-elliott-wave-outlook-200180811,200180811

16514,238029,FCX,It s Time To Buy This Miner,opinion,"Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   looks like it s completing a major correction off of its November 23 price momentum high at 16 42 into the March 27 11 91 low 
Since then  FCX has climbed above its 20  and 200 day MAs and is poised to confront key longer term resistance at 13 80 14 20  which if accomplished  will trigger upside potential to revisit its 1 40 17 65 high zone 
Remember that all of the action off of last January s low at 3 52 notched a series of higher highs and higher pullback lows  which should be considered a major uptrend that remains intact and dominant

16530,238045,FCX,S P 500 Still Finds Overbought Elusive,opinion,"AT40 Status  65 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200 Status  70 2  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX Status  11 7  volatility index Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary The struggle for the overbought threshold continues 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 65 6  a day after scraping the overbought threshold  70   with a close at 69 3   Normally  I would interpret this failure as a bearish warning flag   an indication that buyers are running out of steam  However  the persistent buying in the market has me looking for an  accumulation  of evidence before switching from my neutral trading call  I still have no expectations for switching to bullish from here   Indeed  as AT40 printed a definitive failure at the overbought threshold  the S P 500 barely budged with a 0 1  loss on the day 

The S P 500 barely budged in response to the release of the Fed minutes  The index sits comfortably within a very strong breakout and uptrend 
A bearish confirmation would not occur until the S P 500 reversed all its post breakout gains and closed below 2300  Such a move is a 2 6  pullback away 
The volatility index  the VIX  seems content for now to hover above 11  This period of extremely low volatility is working out just as history predicts  extremely low volatility can last for an extended period of time without leading to a large sell off right after volatility finally starts to rise again  Given this history  I finally pulled the trigger on a fresh batch of short term put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  

The volatility index  the VIX  has finally found some resting time  as it churns above and around 11 
While volatility is mostly a bore  there is plenty of excitement with individual stocks 
Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  has suddenly went from bullish to bearish  Analysts helped knock FCX through support at its 50DMA  Given the high selling volume and follow through on post earnings weakness  I strongly suspect a retest of 200DMA support is not far away 


Thanks to poor analyst ratings  Freeport McMoran  FCX  made a bearish break below 50DMA support on high selling volume 
Intel  NASDAQ INTC  is trying to move in the opposite direction  The stock spent three days trying to break through resistance at its 50DMA  Alas  to no avail  On Wednesday  INTC fell from resistance for a 1 2  loss  Given the loss from guidance provided at analyst day was completely reversed before this pullback  I am still holding out for an eventual breakout 
You can t make this stuff up  Intel  INTC  experiences picture perfect rejection at 50DMA resistance  Fortunately  the 200DMA still points up and to the right 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  is putting up a good fight at its 50DMA support  The bearish engulfing pattern from earnings gave NVDA the look of a double top  and a double bearish engulfing on top of that    The apparently successful test of the 50DMA at support now increases the odds that buyers will soon find enough momentum to invalidate the double top  This development will be important to watch especially given NVDA s status as a tech market darling 
NVIDIA Corporation  NVDA  held its own at 50DMA support despite a looming double  bearish engulfing  top and post earnings weakness

Commentary Nothing says  strong sentiment  like a stock market that actually rallies on a strong U S  jobs report  the fear of the implications for hawkish monetary policy has seemingly disappeared  The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   jumped 0 7  in the wake of the report on January jobs  The index closed within a point of its all time high  The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   pushed to a new all time high by 6 points 

The S P 500  SPY  moves within  inches  of invalidating its 3 day abandoned baby top 

The NASDAQ  QQQ  closed at a new all time high
The current rally has been one of the more stealthy  and halting  ones in a long time 
After the NASDAQ bounced off its pre election low on November 4th  it made a statement after December 1st when it bounced off support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  with a 20DMA newly trending upward  The S P 500 on the other hand came to a screeching halt after its December high on the 13th  Its breakout on January 25th should have heralded a confirmation of a new bullish turn but instead the index came to another complete halt  THAT pause turned toppy when the index gapped down and formed a 3 day abandoned baby top  Amazingly  the S P 500 failed to close cleanly below my line in the sand at 2 280 marking off bearish territory  Now  the index has come back to attempt an invalidation of the bearish topping pattern 
My short term trading call stays at neutral despite the bullish prospects  The bearish divergence between the S P 500 and AT40 remained in place despite AT40 s hop from 53 3  to 60 3   AT40 closed just below a downtrending 20DMA  only a move back into overbought territory will end the bearish divergence  Moreover  as I have stated in earlier posts  I will not flip the trading call to bullish on a fresh breakout simply because the volatility index  the VIX  is so dangerously low 
The volatility index  the VIX  plunged 8 1  to return to 2 1 2 year lows 
The bounce in the VIX on January 30th when the S P 500 gapped down made sense because the VIX historically has spent little time plumbing these depths  Yet  the bears and sellers continue to prove incapable of sealing the deal  This trading situation is sub optimal as I would prefer to be definitive about the trading call when there are so many individual stocks making definitive  up AND down  moves  But it is what it is 
My overall strategy is to keep bullish trades tightly focused on my preferred sectors of commodities  homebuilders  and cybersecurity and be open to one off cases  This approach allows me to avoid regret since these are areas I like over longer periods of time and have no problem accumulating  conditionally  on sell offs  Outside of that  I am looking for reasons to short  Again  not ideal  but this is what happens with a neutral short term trading posture 

ETF Managers Trust   PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  NYSE HACK  is up 6 8  since I responded to IBD s contest  Unfortunately  this performance lags the NASDAQ s 8 7  since then  In the last week  HACK finally broke out to a new 17 month high 

ETF Managers Trust   PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  HACK  has experienced a surge of trading volume in 2017  Buyers have finally propelled HACK into a breakout 
In December  I offered up cybersecurity firm Rapid7  Inc   NASDAQ RPD  as a potential beneficiary of a January relief rally  At the time  RPD was rocketing higher and the next day succeeded in reversing its post earnings loss  RPD has not traded higher since and my position is just above flat right now  I still like RPD as an under valued cybersecurity play and plan to keep holding just like HACK 
After reversing its last post earnings loss  Rapid 7  RPD  has struggled to maintain the momentum 
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  dropped 3 5  in response to its latest earnings report  I went back into  and bought the dip for a two week play  This time around I picked a bullish call spread  820 830   In the chart below  I drew a dark line across all time highs to highlight AMZN s next technical challenge  breaking out above a double top 
Amazon com  AMZN  gaps down below its primary uptrend at its 20DMA  This loss confirms a double top but support from 50 and 200DMAs are rushing upward 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is working on its own double top pattern at all time highs  The post earnings reaction created a bearish fade from an intraday all time high  Buyers stepped back in on Friday only to get turned back again  A retest of the 20DMA uptrend is in play  and I can easily see FB retesting its 50 and 200DMAs in coming weeks 
Facebook  FB  suffered a bearish post earnings fade right at all time highs 
As a reminder  a breakout from a double top is a VERY bullish event  So I am on alert for both AMZN and FB either way the winds blow 
After  by the smallest of fractions on Friday  commodities responded in kind by selling off  China is churning through an on going cycle of heating and cooling its economy that can catch traders and investors off guard  I now have to cool my own jets and watch what develops  My short term trade on Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  is likely over as FCX once again reversed its post earnings gain  My trade on the 50DMA for Cliffs Natural Resources  NYSE CLF  still has a chance with the 50DMA looming directly overhead as a pivot 
Freeport McMoran  FCX  tumbled 5 8  in the wake of China s rate hike 

Cliffs Natural Resources  CLF  fell 4 5   A bounce of its intra day low kept it within the consolidation range 
I am now bearish on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  which is heavily dependent on commodities and China  Per my note February 1st  a close below its 50DMA is a shorting signal  A close below  91 50 will be an aggressively bearish signal  I am going to wait for the latter before acting unless I feel my bullish positions have gotten big enough to motivate me to look for a hedge 

Caterpillar  CAT  is in freshly bearish territory with a test of the last trading range coming up 
Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  is back in focus after one of the nastier post earnings fades that can happen  CMG gapped up only to sell off right from the open  After the smoke cleared  CMG lost 4 5   cracked 200DMA support  printed a bearish engulfing pattern  and confirmed a second failure at what is now resistance at the  Ackman  ceiling 
Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  failed once again to break through the high printed by the Ackman gap up in early September 
Finally  financial stocks responded exceptionally well to news of President Trump s  to begin dismantling the Dodd Frank regulation of the financial industry  The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLF  jumped 2 0  and stopped just short of a fresh 9 year high  XLF added juice to the S P 500 s post jobs rally  The news also catapulted Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  out of a bearish breakdown and its highest post earnings close 
The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  returned to the edge of a freshly bullish breakout  Is this time for real 

Goldman Sachs  GS  escaped a bearish breakdown in a flash with a gap up above 50DMA resistance and a 4 6  gain

Commentary In my last T2108 update  I drew 2 080 as the line in the sand dividing my short term neutral trading call on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   from flipping to a bearish trading call  On a day of raucous disruptions  the index somehow closed exactly on my line of significance 

The S P 500  SPY  rallied from a sell off that cracked the 20DMA trend to close right at the launching point for the last breakout 

The NASDAQ gapped down but managed to maintain its on going uptrend defined by its upper Bollinger Bands 
This inability to close with a clear signal is quite appropriate for an S P 500 that has stubbornly refused to provide much in the way of directional trading signals since early December  For a while  I thought the S P 500 had finally delivered a definitively bearish sell off  However  buyers stepped into the breach ahead of lunchtime and managed to close out the day with a final burst to 2080 5 
However  I am duly noting a potential  abandoned baby top  in the S P 500  This pattern occurs when excited buyers gap a stock higher one day and then sellers gap the stock back down the next day  The signal is most powerful when the stock fades from its high in between gaps as the move solidifies the notion of exhausted buyers  For the S P 500 here  the abandoned baby top pattern played out over 3 days  A close below today s low of 2 268 will confirm this top   at which point I would likely get aggressively bearish in my short term trades 
The trading action was even more dramatic for T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   At one point  T2108 traded as low as 49 2   a level last seen two days after the U S  Presidential election  The recovery back to 53 9  is still a 2 1 2 month low 

T2108 is right back to sagging in what looks like a tantalizing slow unfolding of bearish divergence 
T2108 s 3 day plunge from overbought conditions brings bearish divergence back into sharp relief  I first noted the  surprising  bearish divergence on January 6th  Since then  the S P 500 has gained a mere 4 points while somehow managing to avoid getting dragged into T2108 s sinkhole  The NASDAQ has stayed even more resilient  Unless the abandoned baby top gets invalidated  the guideposts closing in on the S P 500 point to a meaningful sell off in the near future 
On significant days like this one I like to look at T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  as a peak into longer term health  T2107 dropped back to converged support at its own 50 200DMA combination  Even more importantly  the old post recession downtrend asserted itself again as a pivot point  More selling from here would confirm a bearish change in events for the longer term outlook  Otherwise  T2107 is still sitting pretty  healthy  and borderline bullish 

The S P 500  SPY  rallied from a sell off that cracked the 20DMA trend to close right at the launching point for the last breakout 

The volatility index  the VIX  tried its best to put on a show  The VIX launched off a 2 1 2 year low to gain 12 3   The VIX gained as much as 22 8  at its peak on the day  This awakening once again confirmed that the lower bound of the VIX fuels the next big move upward in the VIX 

The volatility index sprang to life once more although it could not its high on the day 
The dramatic and disruptive action was spread far and wide in stocks  Uncertainty soared on the day as a result of renewed geopolitical and domestic tensions generated by the on going flow of executive orders from President Donald Trump   and  roiled numerous sectors from airlines  to high tech  to IT outsourcing  and many other firms with significant international dealings like Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  
Even currencies twisted in the wind with the British pound  NYSE FXB  getting slammed presumably in sympathy with renewed fears of the potential economic damage from a more isolationist approach to the global economy  It was as if the Trump honeymoon had come to a crashing end in just one day 
While I find it tempting to declare an end to the Trump rally and plan bearish trades  I am quickly reminded that two big fundamental stories lay ahead for the week that could disrupt the narrative all over again  The Federal Reserve issues its next pronouncement on monetary policy on Wednesday  February 1st   If volatility can actually remain elevated going into the Fed meeting  I may fade it for a day trade  
Two days later  the market gets to see the U S  jobs report for January  Moreover  the market was so complacent going into the weekend that it was vulnerable to any kind of dramatic news  The willingness of buyers to carry the load well off the lows demonstrated the on going appetite of buyers  In other words  I am treading carefully in interpreting the swirl of signals  The bottom line from T2108 sits at neutral and still awaits a definitive directional signal 
Based on my switch to neutral  I had two outstanding trades that triggered on Monday  they actually triggered before I could think to cancel them    call options on Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  and Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF   These positions should do well IF Monday turns out to be a blip in the narrative of the Trump rally 

Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  is hugging the lower part of the channel that defines the current uptrend 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  rebounded just above 50DMA support 
IT outsourcer Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH  took a 4 4  tumble that marked a clean and bearish breakdown from 50DMA support and a confirmation of standing resistance at its 200DMA  CTSH has long struggled to regain former momentum  The stock last peaked in late 2015  so today s move makes CTSH a short with a clear stop loss above the 50DMA 

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  NASDAQ CTSH  broke down into bearish territory 
Disruptions and chaos at airports dealing with protestors and confusion over Trump s travel bands and the subsequent response of the judicial system had traders flocking to sell airlines with significant international business  Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  and American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  look like the most precarious as both suffered significant selling on Friday 
AAL suffered a bearish engulfing pattern that looks like a top  Both stocks broke down below 50DMA support but have also logged significant gains for months going into today s troubles  I think the current disruption is a temporary disturbance for the airline stocks  but these bearish technicals are compelling 

Will Buffet s airline buys become a distance memory  Delta Airlines  DAL  has struggled to gain much additional traction from the news and today s 50DMA breakdown returned it to the low of that Buffett day 

American Airlines confirmed a topping pattern with its 50DMA breakdown to a 2 1 2 month low 

In my last T2108 Update  I grimaced at the fade in iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB   I noted my plan to sell if the fade received confirmation from sellers  That signal came right at the open the next day  and I wasted no time in locking in my profits on my call options  I am looking to re enter on a test of 50DMA support 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  suddenly looks toppy by confirming last week s fade with two days of selling 
The market of course contains plenty of hope  On a day of global disruptions  Walt Disney Company  NYSE DIS  gained 1 5  and put on an impressive show with a breakout to a new 13 month high  This move is bittersweet as my long term call options expired a week and half ago with  110 strikes  It was one of those rare moments where a longer term  bullish  trade completely failed 
The biggest irony for me is that I could have turned DIS into a shorter term trade  as I would normally do  and made significant gains  DIS is up 21 8  from the October low and up 6 4  year to date  easily outpacing the S P 500  I now await the next entry point even as I suspect DIS will finally deliver another well received earnings report next month 

Disney  DIS  is suddenly making up for a LOT of lost time 
As I noted earlier  the British pound took severe blows that have abated at the time of writing  I am assuming the growing moves by the U S  to insulate itself from global influences reminded currency traders about the same momentum in the United Kingdom  think Brexit   a country likely to be hurt a lot more than the U S  by a withdrawal from globalization  Most significantly  GBP JPY broke below its 50DMA again  EUR GBP looks like it will hold converged support at its 50 and 200DMAs 

GBP JPY looks like a breakdown in slow motion off recent highs 

With 50 200DMA support holding  the euro looks ready to resume its longer uptrend against the British pound  EUR GBP  
The British pound has experienced a wild ride in recent weeks  I am long overdue to write an update describing my changing trading strategies to accommodate the twist and turns of the technicals and the Brexit related drama  Recent action has turned me more bearish 
Finally  AUD JPY  my favorite check on risk appetite in financial markets in general  continues to hold its own  The 50DMA  and now the 20DMA  is clearly holding firm as support  I will need to see AUD JPY break down to get confident that any bearish turn in financial markets can sustain itself 

AUD JPY is  quietly  churning higher guided by 50 20 DMA support

16583,238098,FCX,Copper To Trade At  7 000 Per Metric Ton By The End Of The Year ,opinion,"Last year  investors were wondering whether copper was worth more than  6 000 per metric ton or not 
Late in 2016  prices were struggling to overcome this psychological level  but things are shaping up for 2017 to be a hot year for copper production  which could translate into a 

Upside momentum for copper prices picked up on supply disruptions  Copper rises above  6 000 per metric ton  Source  MetalMiner analysis of FastMarkets com data 
Escondida Stops Production
Chile s massive Escondida mine s processing plants completely stopped supplying refined copper to markets on Thursday as no miners arrived for morning work  The mine produced around 1 million mt of copper last year  or 5  of global production 
Estimates point to a loss of around 20 000 25 000 mt of metal for each week the strike goes on  In 2006 and 2011  strikes at Escondida lasted 25 and 15 days respectively 
Grasberg Mine
Meanwhile  Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  might suspend some of its operations at its Grasberg mine because the company has been unable to obtain an export permit  Having limited storage capacity  the company will be forced to drastically cut output if Indonesia doesn t give the company an export license to send material to its local smelter for processing  A similar dispute with the government in 2014 translated into 125 000 mt of lost output 
Combining Escondida and Grasberg production  there are 1 7 million mt of supply at risk  or 8  of global output 
Potential For More Disruptions
Escondida s strike is potentially setting the case for wage negotiations across the industry since almost a fifth of global mine capacity is facing contract renewals  Glencore  LON GLEN  Plc and Anglo American  LON AAL  s Collahuasi are two of several copper mines in Chile due for contract negotiations this year 
Another big operator to pay attention to is the Las Bambas mine in Peru  which produced 330 000 mt of copper last year  The mine is currently facing renewed protests from local residents  who have blocked access to the mine  This could potentially translate into lower shipments this year and even a temporary suspension 
In addition  we need to remember that copper is a very slow business in terms of new project development  Over the past two to three years  miners haven t committed to new developments  Consequently  even if prices continue to rise enough to incentivize new developments  it will take a long time for that new supply to hit the market 
What This Means For Metal Buyers
 over the past few years  combined with the ongoing supply disruptions  is creating the perfect conditions for a price squeeze  In addition  the ongoing  will give a tailwind to copper prices 
The conclusion  Copper will trade above  7 000 mt by year s end

Four consecutive trading sessions with record highs 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified before the Senate Banking Committee this morning  part of her semi annual   Yellen said the labor market is basically where the Fed wants it to be  and inflation is just a little lower than their target  She said 

Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise  potentially requiring  the Fed  to eventually raise rates rapidly  which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession  At our upcoming meetings  we  will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with  the Fed s  expectations  in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate 

She said the Fed expected three rate increases this year  and they might hike in March  maybe  That doesn t mean the Fed will raise rates in March  but the Fed wants that option  Normally  Yellen talks about downside risks  today she seemed more concerned about the upside risk 
Yellen told members of the Senate Banking Committee 

The economic outlook is uncertain  and monetary policy is not on a preset course     changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook  It is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold 

We know that President Trump has promised details on his  phenomenal  tax reform plan within the next couple of weeks  Fed economists will surely pay attention 
Yellen rebutted President Trump s claims that banks aren t lending  Trump has targeted the Dodd Frank Act as part of his quest to roll back regulations  claiming the regulatory reform prevents banks from lending 
Yellen shot down those claims  saying commercial and industrial lending specifically surged after the crisis  rising 75 percent since 2010  Yellen mentioned   in which only 2 percent of respondents cited access to capital as their greatest obstacle 
She said U S  banks are stronger than their foreign counterparts  which makes them more competitive  and it is reflected in record earnings for U S  banks  Dodd Frank is making life difficult for banks  but the truth is  banks are lending plenty of money  and companies are not starved for capital 
The two year note yield jumped to as high as 1 25 percent from a low of 1 18 percent earlier in the day  The 10 year yield rose to 2 50 percent from 2 43 percent before her remarks were released  The dollar rose after Yellen s comments  hitting a high last reached on Jan  20  During Yellen s testimony  stocks flipped between small gains and losses but started carving out fresh intraday highs as the testimony wrapped up 
  a long time proponent of tighter monetary policy  says the Federal Reserve will likely have to raise interest rates more rapidly than financial markets currently expect given that any new policies by the Trump administration  while uncertain  will force the Fed s hand 
Producer prices  or prices at the wholesale level  rose more than expected in January  recording their largest gain in more than four years  The producer price index for final demand jumped 0 6 percent last month  That was the largest increase since September 2012 and followed a 0 2 percent rise in December  Despite the surge  the PPI only increased 1 6 percent in the 12 months through January  The gains in PPI last month largely reflected increases in the prices of commodities such as crude oil

16603,238118,FCX,Week In Review  Markets Higher  Bitcoin Lower  NFP Mixed,opinion,"by Eli Wright
US equities started the year on a high note  On Friday  the Dow came within one point of the 20K benchmark  while the S P and NASDAQ both closed at record highs  2 276 98 and 5 521 06  respectively 
Bitcoin had an up then down week and Friday s Nonfarm Payrolls report came in mixed  but still helped the dollar rebound 
Also on Friday  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  announced that due to missed annual sales targets and profit goals in 2016  top ranking executives including CEO Tim Cook wouldn t be receiving cash incentives tied to their annual compensation packages 
Bitcoin on a Roller Coaster 
Bitcoin skyrocketed 44  higher since the week leading up to Christmas  with analysts suggesting the rapid propulsion was a result of Chinese and Indian investors looking to shield themselves from local currency depreciations  capital controls and cash crunches  During the early part of last week  the crypto currency reached a peak of  1 135  Many thought it might continue its strong uptrend  to its all time high of  1 216 
China s yuan  however  gained more than 2  last Wednesday and Thursday  and Bitcoin reacted by losing nearly one fifth of its total value 
The digital currency has since regained some balance and is up 4   to  938 99 

Bitcoin is no stranger to wild swings  Over the past five years it has experienced eight dives of 20  or more  20 tumbles of 15  or more  and 38 slips of 10  or more 
Apple misses 2016 targets  but the App Store wins
Apple s SEC filing for fiscal 2016 indicated that the company s annual revenue decreased for the first time since before the iPod was unveiled in 2001  Revenue dropped 8  to  216 billion  while Apple s operating profit declined 16  to  60 billion  Net sales came in 3 6  short of the  223 68 billion target  while operating income came in at  60 billion  missing the  60 3 billion forecast by 0 5  

Source  Apple SEC filing
CEO Tim Cook was forced to take a 15  pay cut as a result  his compensation package was a valued at  8 7 million  down from  10 3 million a year earlier 
Nevertheless  Apple shares rose 1 1  before the weekend  even as unit sales declined  it was confirmed that December was the App Store s most successful month ever  and the company rang in  3 billion in revenue from a combination of in app purchases  paid downloads  and subscription fees  Customer spending at the App Store jumped 40  in 2016 
While the US is still the App Store s largest customer base  the Chinese market has grown by 90  from a year ago  China represents a key opportunity for Apple to extend its edge in the mobile app market  since Google Play  NASDAQ GOOGL  is blocked in the region 
Apple is currently trading at  117 91 and could break its major line of resistance at  123 

Nonfarm Payrolls Disappoint  but Wages satisfy
The US jobs report on Friday was mixed  disappointing some analysts but not others  Nonfarm payrolls rose by only 156 000 in December  down from November s upwardly revised figure of 204 000  and less than the 178K expected  The unemployment rate ticked ten points higher  to 4 7   Wages  however  increased  as average hourly earnings rose to 0 4   following a drop of 0 1  in November 
Despite the mixed results  the US dollar moved higher on the report  It s currently up against a variety of major global currencies 

Commodities get some lift
Gold has bounced up 4  since its lows in mid December  The precious metal is now up to  1 171 90  It s possible the yellow metal could reach  1 200 in the coming week  a point which until late November  had been strong support 

Still  the price of gold is usually closely tied to the value of the US dollar  When one goes up the other generally falls  Last week saw the greenback lose some traction  which coincided with gold s move up  With the dollar making gains to close out the week  gold simultaneously lost some of its value 
Oil prices remain elevated as OPEC  along with eleven other global producers  begins to cut output  Thus far  all involved seem to be in compliance with the agreement  It is therefore possible prices could move higher in the coming weeks 
Crude is currently trading at  53 71  Brent is at  56 83 
Last Week s Biggest Gainers
The S P 500 gained 1 24  on the week last week  led by large gains in the Health Care  Information Technology  Consumer Discretionary  and Materials sectors

The biggest mover was tech company Xerox  NYSE XRX   which spiked more than 20  after completing the spinoff of its business services unit  Conduent  NYSE CNDT

Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  led all Consumer Discretionary gains  rising 10 60  on the week  while TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP  finished up 9 49  
Though telecom was the worst performing sector last week  broadband provider Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  was still one of the top ten gainers  up 10 95  
In Materials  mining company Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  rose 12 96   while Arconic  NYSE ARNC  spun off in November from Alcoa  NYSE AA  gained 11 27  
Rounding out last week s top ten gainers was energy company NRG  NYSE NRG   which rose 8 97  

Last Week s Biggest Losers
Retailers made up the bulk of last week s biggest losers  After disappointing holiday sales  Kohl s  NYSE KSS  plummeted 16 10   while Macy s  NYSE M  dropped 13 93   Everything from fashion  to jewelers  to grocers did poorly  Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   L Brands  NYSE LB   Signet Jewelers  NYSE SIG   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and Kroger  NYSE KR  all made an appearance on the list 
In energy  Southwestern  NYSE SWN  lost 5 27  while Tesoro  NYSE TSO  dipped 4 23  
Bringing up the rear  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  the best performing stock of 2016 fell 3 41  

What to expect this coming week
After two holiday shortened weeks in a row  we re finally entering the first full trading week of 2017  so volatility may drop a bit as trading volume increases

Commentary  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   last topped out on January 4  2016  My favorite technical indicator has declined relatively consistently since then  especially since plunging out of overbought territory  below 70   on January 9th  This steady decline forms the core of my bearish thesis on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    Thursday  T2108 took another plunge   this time dropping from 61 4  to 55 2   This position is the lowest close in over two months and motivated my switch from  cautiously bearish  to  bearish  for the short term trading call 
The steady decline in T2108 this year signals bearish winds in the making 
The stock market has so far performed relatively well despite T2108 s steady decline  Yet  T2108 typically wins this kind of bearish divergence  The bearish divergence going into the August  2015 flash crash was the most dramatic example of the resolution of this tension  The S P 500 still has a marginal gain for the year which includes a fresh all time high  The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   has closed with a gain 9 out of the year s 12 trading days  also including fresh all time highs  The charts below by themselves hardly scream bearish warnings 


The S P 500  SPY  has essentially churned for a month   it even failed to convert a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze into a big breakout breakdown 


The NASDAQ  QQQ  printed a clear breakout earlier this month and quieted observations that tech was playing second fiddle to industrial and cyclical stocks 
Given the lack of bearish clues in the charts above  I embarked on another search for support of the bearish warnings coming from T2108  It almost appears as if the market is positioning for a major catalyst to come from  or soon after  the inauguration of America s 45th President  Donald J  Trump 
First culprit  the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF   Big banks and financial institutions delivered highly anticipated earnings and failed to give XLF the extra juice it needed to break out from six weeks of churn  XLF is now testing 50DMA support  Note how XLF faded after the first batch of earnings  After Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reported earnings  XLF suffered its largest one day loss of this entire post election period 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  teeters on 50DMA support and looks very  heavy   Can inauguration somehow save the day and create a fresh spark or will XLF breakdown and confirm the bearish winds blowing about 
Second culprit  The iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM   Like XLF  IWM is now testing support at its 50DMA  IWM topped out back on December 9th and has churned slowly but surely lower ever since  IWM is under performing with a slight year to date loss 


The iShares Russell 2000  IWM  teeters on support  Like XLF  is IWM looking for encouragement from Donald Trump s inauguration 
Third culprit  The SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT   XRT was an early bearish siren given its steep sell off going into Christmas  The sell off slowed down from there as XRT s 200DMA tried mightily to stave off a major breakdown  That resolve weakened ever so slightly on Thursday with a 1 8  loss that closed XRT at its lowest post election close and below 200DMA support 

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  has churned widely around 200DMA support  Today s close was XRT s first official breach into its post election gap up 
The volatility index  the VIX  is making another run off support from its long standing lows  However  I cannot get too excited because the VIX is not even at a high for the year 
The volatility  VIX  hopped up in anticipation of Trump s inauguration 
While the weakness in financials  small caps  and retail stocks are important tells  there are pockets of bullishness that no doubt are encouraging more rosy interpretations of the market action 
Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA  has impressed with a convincing follow through to the breakout I pointed out in an earlier post  Alas  I never got the entry point I wanted so I still sit here TSLA less  a fortuitous day trade provides me just a semblance of solace   Thursday s big move came on the heels of an analyst upgrade  and  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  into the fatal crash of a Tesla Model S while it was running on its Autopilot system 
Tesla Motors  TSLA  closed near a 9 month high as it continues to skyrocket upward through its upper Bollinger Bands  BBs 
And then there is the Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA    The currency has experienced a revival of sorts  Against the weakening Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY    AUD JPY has rallied to its high from last month which was a 52 week high  AUD JPY is running strong and firmly counter to the bearish signal coming from T2108 

AUD JPY is in rally mode even as much of the stock market churns lower 
While the commodity dependent Australian dollar rallies  many commodity related stocks have done the same  These stocks are enjoying a good 2017 so far after selling off into the close of 2016  Two weeks ago  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  jumped impressively off 200DMA support  FCX followed through with a confirmation of 50DMA support before cooling down a bit lately 

Freeport McMoRan  Inc   FCX  is up 15  year to date after confirming support at its 50DMA 
Gold is one commodity which has surprised to the upside this year  As one would expect  the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  sold off after the Fed hiked rates  The bad mood lasted just one more day  GLD is up 4 7  for the year after following its upper BBs on an orderly path higher 
In my last T2108 Update  I recommended a pairs trade going long GLD call options and put options on the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT   I promptly executed the trade on Tuesday as both TLT and GLD gapped higher 
After two days  TLT s quick losses drove a double for my put options doubled with sufficient profit to pay for the call options on GLD  My options trading rules dictate locking in profits on a quick double  I decided to follow that rule although this position is part of a pairs trade  I am inclined to fade future rallies on TLT as long as I hold the GLD call options 
SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  has enjoy a straight shot upward since carving out an 11 month low following the Fed s rate hike 


The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  continues to pivot around 2015 s closing value  the think  solid  black horizontal line   A 50DMA breakout quickly gave way to a 50DMA breakdown  Can the uptrending 20DMA provide support 
Perhaps nothing says  pre inauguration hold  better than the U S  dollar index  DXY0   The index is off its 14 year high and pivoting around its uptrending 50DMA support  The 100 level sits tantalizingly below 
While Trump s nominee for Treasury secretary  Steven Mnuchin   by saying those words were a short term reference  I strongly suspect the index will be more  jumpy  than usual once Trump jumps into his inauguration speech  Over the longer term  I duly note that economists claim the U S  dollar could soar if Trump is successful in clamping down on imports with higher tariffs 

The U S  dollar index  DXY0  clings to 50DMA support perhaps awaiting its next direction from the inauguration 
In sum  while I am now firmly bearish on the stock market  I have yet to act aggressively on the short term trading call  I still prefer to wait for some kind of technical confirmation like a 50DMA breakdown for the S P 500 
Moreover  Trump presents the ultimate wildcard  no restraint in public utterances and lack of clarity on which of his most impactful policies will ultimately garner Congressional support  It is a bit like fearing I could get caught like the defense of the Denver Broncos on Christmas Day  2016  The Kansas City Chiefs lined up a big man in running formation only to watch in horror as that big man tossed the ball in the air behind the entire defense 

 On December 25  2016  Dontari Poe became the heaviest player  at 346 pounds  in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass  Earlier in the season  he became the heaviest player to run for a TD

16605,238120,FCX,Keep Your Eye On Copper,opinion,"Some think it s important to watch copper s price action because it could send important macro messages about global growth or the lack thereof  Since 2011  Ole  Doc Copper  has been very weak  no question about it  During this weakness  the S P 500 has continued to move higher  So has copper s price action lost its relevance 
Below looks at ratio of JJC to the S P 500 

Copper has clearly been weaker than the S P 500 since 2011 and the long term trend remains down  as the ratio continues to create a series of lower highs and lower lows 
The short term trend is attempting to turn higher as the Copper SPY ratio tests a cluster of resistance at  1  
If a breakout happens  here s my advice  long Copper and Short the S P 500  if one is comfortable with a pair trade  If a breakout does take place  other potential beneficiaries could be FCX  RIO or JJC 
Even though Ole Doc Copper may not have sent a valuable message to the S P 500 over the past 6 years  I think that if a breakout takes place at  1   investors should be aware of opportunities that could present themselves in the hard hit sector ",2017-01-24,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keep-your-eye-on-copper-200173449,200173449

Commentary In the last T2108 Update I made the case for staying bearish on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   and the stock market in general  Tuesday  the S P 500  SPY  did its best to invalidate the growing bearish signals by rallying to a new all time high 
The S P 500  SPY  printed a fresh all time but faded of its high of the day  The new all time closing high beat the previous record by 4 points 
The 0 7  gain came amid a collection of bullish market signals  Yet  while the S P 500 hurtled over one of my criteria for flipping back to bullish    the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   failed to cooperate  My favorite technical indicator performed well on the day  but it did not recover overbought status  above 70    T2108 even closed right at its own 20 and 50DMAs 
T2108 surged and broke out from its primary downtrend  It now needs to break into overbought status 
As a reminder   flag overbought status as a sign of buyer s strength  Falling out of overbought status is bearish  As a result  I have been cautiously bearish and now bearish since January 9th when T2108 fell from the last overbought period 
Ideally  such a fall leads to sustained momentum to the downside and a trip to  or close enough to  oversold conditions to signal the next bullish period  Instead  the S P 500 has defied gravity with a tantalizing trading range for 6 or 7 weeks during which time T2108 fell from overbought conditions three times  T2108 s behavior was the biggest footnote to an otherwise bullish day 
The second footnote was a reminder to stay cautious  The volatility index  the VIX  dropped to a 2 1 2 year low  Since last August  the VIX has bounced from these levels  leading to pullbacks of varying degrees  In other words  the VIX sits at a dangerous level of complacency  If the stock market continues higher  this cautionary footnote will loom ever larger 
The volatility index  the VIX  dropped to a level of complacency unseen since the summer of 2014 
Incredibly  betting against volatility has delivered very consistent and sustained gains 
Now enough of the caution and the negative   here are some peeks at how the bulls and buyers are celebrating the positives 
The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   jumped to a new all time high with a 0 9  gain  This move looks a lot better than the S P 500 s move  it follows a well defined uptrend formed after the sharp 2 day sell off that ended 2016  The NASDAQ is up 4 0  year to date and out performing the S P 500 s 1 8  year to date gain 
The NASDAQ broke out to a new all time high 
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  was almost as impressive as the NASDAQ  This measure of longer term health in the stock market broke out cleanly to a new 3  month high  T2107 is trending upward and looks like it broke out from a bullish wedge pattern  T2107 also happened to launch off the former post recession downtrend line 
T2107 broke out in bullish form 
The currency market is chimed in with a bullish signal from the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  and the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY   AUD JPY bounced off its uptrending 20DMA which now hovers just above an uptrending 50DMA  Note that at the time of writing the Australian dollar sold off sharply after he Australian Bureau of Statistics released  
AUD JPY clung to support at its 50DMA and lended support to a more bullish mix of market signals 
The U S  dollar index  DXY0  is doing a cling of its own  Its 50DMA is still trending upward  and the index is trying to hang on  I expect the declining 20DMA to take over as the primary  short term  trend despite my bullishness  for example  on the U S  dollar versus the Canadian dollar   on USD CAD in anticipation of the next move higher 
The 20DMA of the U S  dollar index looks ready to take over the trend from the 50DMA

USD CAD has nearly reversed all its post Bank of Canada gains as its 50DMA held as approximate resistance 
Home building is one sector of the market for which I use different rules  see my housing market reviews for more details   I wrote last week that immediate policy rollbacks by President Trump included a negative for the housing market 
Now earnings have taken over  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  soared 6 6  on a very positive response to its earnings  This move helped power the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  upward 4 0   ITB closed just short of its December high  the breakout essentially confirmed the 20 and 50DMAs as support  This move happened on a day when interest rates ticked higher  I am well overdue for some detailed reviews of earnings from home builders  stay tuned  
Seasonal strength has arrived with the iShares US Home Construction  ITB  up 5 6  year to date and up 12 6  since the November 1st start of the season 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  followed tech to a new all time closing high  NFLX now looks ready to invalidate the potential bearishness of its  gap and crap  response to the latest earnings report  The upper Bollinger Bands continue to define a notable uptrend for NFLX 
A new all time closing high for NFLX 
Financials made a bid to end the slow drip off recent highs  Most importantly  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  bounced off 50DMA support for a marginal gain  However  the stock did fade well off its high for the day  I am watching VERY closely for the resolution of this important test of support 
Goldman Sachs  GS  made a bid to hold its 50DMA as support 
Commodities made big moves  For example  one day ahead of earnings  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  soared 8 3  to a new 1 1 2 year high  FCX confirmed another test of support at its 50DMA 
Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  broke out the day before it reports its latest earnings 
Just when I thought the industrial sector was on the move in unison  I noticed steel stock AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  drop 6 6  in response to earnings  The high volume selling delivered a triple whammy to AKS  a bearish engulfing top  a 50DMA breakdown  and confirmation of resistance at the downtrending 20DMA 
I will be watching closely to see whether buyers who have auto flocked to these names will soon overlook the bad news in earnings and choose instead to fall back in line with the Trump theme trade 
The run up looks over for AK Steel Holding Corporation  AKS  as it printed a bearish post earnings topping pattern 
Putting things all together  I am keeping the short term trading call growling with the bears  This choice is more out of a desire to reduce churn in the trading call rather than coming from a firm conviction  The bulls are once again writing all over the walls  so I do not expect this bearish trading call to last much longer  Time will soon tell

16607,238122,FCX,Commodities And Materials Sectors Are The Focus In Australia,opinion,"The story in Australia is clearly around the moves in commodities and the materials sector  The bottom line is that if you are a momentum  trend trader or even a quaint guy  this space is flashing red hot right now and if you are not exposed to the space then you are missing out on what is arguably the best place to drive outperformance in an equity portfolio 
In recent reports  I had highlighted that really since the 10th January sellers had pulled the ASX 200 lower from the unwind of the morning auction  but at 10 28  AEDT  yesterday that changed and investors and traders pushed into materials names  Volume was good  with  6 076 billion turnover through the market and 15 8  above the 30 day average  The bulls will take a market closing at its highs every day  but the big flows are in the mining space  although with 196 million shares traded  through the sector  was strong  but not breathtaking 
The good will should flow through again today with the ASX 200 materials sub sector likely breaking out to the highest levels since August 2014  with BHP  NYSE BBL  at the heart of this move with an open some 1 7  higher to  27 46  The pure plays will likely rally more aggressively 

One way to look at the outperformance relative to the broader index is through ratio analysis  Here we can the ASX materials sector   ASX 200 ratio going from 1 24x in January 2016 to currently sit at 1 82x  which is the best levels since mid 2014  Aluminium looks super strong and trading at the highest levels since May 2015  with talk of producers cutting capacity  Copper has pushed 2 5  higher and eyeing a break of the November highs of  2 75p lb level  while the bulls have seen modest upside in the overnight session after strong gains yesterday 
By way of a guide  just look at Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  which has well and truly broken out and now trading at the highest levels since July 2015  gaining 7 3  on the session  Shorting in this space is ill advised  it is long positions all the way  that is until price action tells us otherwise 

By way of a lead  the S P 500 has shown real signs of life and the bulls have pushed the S P 500 to new all time highs  A market at all time highs is bullish and despite the climate of political uncertainty I still can t understand how we can think of this move in US equities any other way  Earnings are coming in thick and fast and names like DR Horton  NYSE DHI  and Dupont have reported well  Still  if we look at the sectors it s a story of financials  energy and industrials putting in the points  helped by a rise in US treasury yield  Clearly fixed income traders have it tough right now  with the yields all over the place 
These leads and the moves in commodities should push the ASX 200 into 5683 on open and through the January downtrend of 5664  Traders will be focused on moves today in copper  iron ore and steel futures  on the Dalian exchange  through the session to give mining stocks another leg up  while the FX traders have the bigger event risk in the form of Aussie Q4 CPI at 11 30 AEDT 
If we focus on the AUD USD  we can see clear indecision in the market  marked by the  doji  candle   with price trading in a range of  0 7609 to  0 7554  This makes sense when traders saw US treasury yields moving higher again and we have strong Aussie event risk  with calls from one investment house that a core inflation print of 0 3   quarter on quarter  or below could force the RBA s hand in its February meeting 
Given that the market is pricing in 8 basis points of tightening over the coming 12 months one suspects a number below 0 3  will send the AUD into a tailspin  but I am still highly sceptical it will push the RBA to move in Q1  Lo and behold we could even get an upside surprise and a core print of 0 7  QoQ would really get the hawks excited  Remember the analysts have a poor record of forecasting quarterly inflation and as Citigroup point out  since 2010 we have seen 27 quarterly prints and over a third of them  on core inflation  have missed forecast by 0 3  or higher ",2017-01-25,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200173553,200173553

16609,238124,FCX,Another Overbought Period Bites The Dust For The S P 500,opinion,"T2108 Status  67 3   ended 1 day overbought period T2107 Status  68 8 VIX Status  10 6General  Short term  Trading Call  neutralActive T2108 periods  Day  235 over 20   Day  55 over 30   Day  54 over 40   Day  52 over 50   Day  3 over 60   Day  1 under 70   underperiod  ended 1 day overbought period 
Commentary For the fourth time in 6 weeks    the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   dropped out of an overbought period  This time around  the overbought period lasted just one day 
In my last T2108 Update  I noted that I flipped the short term trading call to  neutral  to avoid further churn until the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   delivers new technical news  As a result  I am not flipping the trading call to bearish as the T2108 trading rules dictate when an overbought period ends 
From here it will take a close below 2280 to move the trading call back to bearish  As a reminder  the combination of constant churn in overbought status combined with an extremely low volatility index  VIX  means that I do not plan to set the trading call to bullish if the S P 500 breakout continues 
The S P 500 disappointed by lacking follow through to the recent breakout  but the loss on the day was very minor 
The lack of follow through on the S P 500 did not stir the VIX  In fact  the VIX lost yet more ground 

Complacency seemingly knows no bound as the VIX dropped to a fresh 2 1 2 year low 
In an earlier T2108 Update  I noted that I am watching post earnings behavior to see whether bulls and buyers continue to consider dips for any reason as fresh buying opportunities  This is particularly true on Trump related trades  AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  was in focus earlier this week  So far  buyers have shown little interest in  bargain shopping   The post earnings breakdown continued for AKS and a lasting top is looking more and more likely 
Ak Steel  AKS  continues its post earnings slide  At least the downward momentum has slowed 
Traders and investors did not react well to earnings from commodities play Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   think copper  oil  natural gas  and gold   The high volume selling continued on Thursday 
This time the selling was strong enough to close FCX at the bottom of the gap up that looked like a very bullish breakout ahead of earnings  I have my finger hovering over the buy button in case the selling momentum abates and the gap holds as support 

The post earnings reaction to Freeport McMoran  FCX  closed this week s pre earnings gap up and reversed the related bullish breakout 
U S Concrete Inc  NASDAQ USCR  is another Trump trade  think infrastructure spending and big walls   USCR recently bounced neatly off 50DMA support  Thursday  the stock punched higher on more news about Trump s proposed wall for the U S  Mexican border but ended the day with a 2 8  loss 
This pattern is a bearish engulfing pattern  typical of tops  The high trading volume further underlines the possibility of a top  I am watching this trade very closely now 
Did U S  Concrete  USCR  print a top just as talk of a big wall on the U S  Mexico border heats up toward a potential reality 
Whirlpool  NYSE WHR  had another poor post earnings performance  A loss of 8 6  plunged the stock through 50DMA support  Support at its 200DMA managed to hold at the close 
I decided to buy a single call option  This could be the first part of a hedged trade  If WHR cracks through 200DMA support  I will add put options to the mix in anticipation of a major rollback of post election gains 

Will the market s persistent bargain shoppers jump into the breach created by the very poor post earnings performance from Whirlpool  WHR  
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  continues to perform exceptionally well  This is easily my biggest missed trade of 2017 so far  As a reminder  I pointed out Facebook s bearish technical breakdown last month and guessed that FB could be the target of buyers in 2017 
The buyers wasted no time and went right to work on the first trading day of the year  The buying has taken just four days of very brief rest since then  I should have at least jumped on the bandwagon at the breakout point above the convergence of the 50 and 200DMAs 

Facebook  FB  has soared in 2017 to a 15 4  year to date gain  The uptrend channel defined by the upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  has guided FB right back to a near test of the all time high set last October 
Finally  I am keeping a close eye on my call options on iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB   The good earnings news on home builders continued to roll in  but buyers were not able to close out the day in strength  The steep fade from the highs puts me on notice for potential topping action  I will look to lock in profits if the selling gets follow through  Per the seasonal strength in home builder stocks  I will buy into the next dip 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  barely hung on for a gain on the third day of a bullish breakout and confirmation of converged 50 200DMA support 
 In other trade news  I sold my small number of shares in SDS as planned  I also finally cut bait on my AUD JPY short

Commentary No  I am not talking about the maddening Dow 20K watch  I continue to ignore the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  as much as ever because of its price weighting and tiny sample of the market even as it carries a lot of psychological weight for many  For a complete discussion on this topic  see  


Instead  I am talking about the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    The index only rallied 0 6  on the day  but it came just one point short of a fresh all time high  I am waiting for a breakout to motivate me to change the short term trading call from cautiously bearish to  cautiously   bullish 
The S P 500  SPY  knocked on the upper limit of a loose 3 week trading range 
As the Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze tightened around the S P 500  my favorite technical indicator  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    delivered an impressive vote of confidence in an upside breakout  T2108 closed at 77 9   it cleared the recent trading range with a downward bias for a 6 month high  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs was also impressive  it put an end to the recent downtrend and closed at 68 0   a 3 month high  If the S P 500 manages to break out  T2107 will support the sustainability of such a move 

T2107 surges in a vote of confidence in the longer term health of the underlying market technicals 
The volatility index  the VIX  was of course smashed  The VIX lost 7 8  to close at 11 9  It is right back to the edge of its lowest levels in recent trading 
Complacency reins supreme once again as the VIX plunged for a second straight day 
Wednesday s trading day was another one for watching  but the watching had me on the sidelines as Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA  FINALLY confirmed its 200DMA breakout with a 4 6  surge  It was a picture perfect bounce off the 200DMA as support  After I saw TSLA go from a gap down to a 1  gain  I put in a lowball offer for call options  The stock simply never looked back  Once  if   I flip the short term trading call to  cautiously   bullish  I will be stuck looking for ANY pullback to hop on TSLA s speeding train  Note in the chart below how well TSLA is holding an uptrend through the upper Bollinger Bands 

A picture perfect bounce of 200DMA support for Tesla Motors  TSLA  
I should have tried a setup which split my order into two  one half for the lowball  desired price and the other half for  stopping IN  the position if the rally continued past a bullish threshold  Next time 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is another chart I put on watch last month  A month ago  I described how FB was breaking down from a technical perspective  I also wondered allowed whether the new year would bring back the buyers  FB rallied from the point of that post  failed 200DMA resistance  and retested that December low by the end of the year 
Right on schedule  FB jumped the first two trading days of this year  However  overhead resistance looms even larger now with converging 50 and 200DMAs  As a result  FB still looks like a stock breaking down albeit in slow motion  talk about tantalizing   Watch out though if FB breaks through resistance 
Facebook  FB  keeps bouncing off post earnings lows and failing to break through overhead resistance  Do buyers still have the energy and the will to push FB over the hump and away from a slow motion breakdown 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  came back to life today and surged 7 6   Given the buying volume to start the year  I am assuming FCX successfully tested 50DMA support   Note that I do not include commodities in my short term trading call since they are generally uncorrelated with the stock market  
Freeport McMoran  FCX  bounced off 50DMA support and broke its 20DMA downtrend all in one highly bought move 
SPDR S P Retail ETF  MX XRT  jumped 1 9  on the day in a move that confirmed 200DMA support and closed XRT above 50DMA resistance  However  fundamentals may ruin the entire mood on Thursday as Macy s Inc  NYSE M  delivered bad earnings news in after hours trading to the tune of a 10  sell off 
Enjoy the moment  SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  confirmed 200DMA support but fundamental news will likely tank XRT right back into its downtrend off recent highs 
The NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  watch continues  The first two days of the trading year brought some stability to the stock as the 20DMA held as support after an initial gap down and a trade as low as  99 38  Trading volume remains extremely high so there is a good possibility that distribution is unfolding here  distribution is essentially the selling of stock from one group  who are generally locking in profits  to another group who will end up holding the bag  

Nvidia  NVDA  started the year under performing the market  The 20DMA uptrend needs to hold to prevent a test of 50DMA support 
Finally  tantalizing the prospects of a bullish breakout are Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY   I expect CAT to confirm bullish undertones in the market and instead it is still ringing out the cautious tone I emphasized going into this overbought period  CAT even underperformed the market with a 0 5  loss on the day 

Unlike much of the market  Caterpillar  CAT  has gained little since its initial post election pop 
AUD JPY held steady above 50DMA support to end 2016  It looked set to confirm that support with the year starting on two strong days  Fortunes have turned since then as the yen gained renewed strength thanks to renewed weakness in the U S  dollar index in general  DXY0  
Presumably  the sharp drop in the dollar came in the wake of the market s interpretation of   I think the market is coming to my interpretation that the Fed was NOT trying to be particularly hawkish  This sets up for a potentially dramatic response to the December jobs report coming this Friday  Stay tuned 

Is AUD JPY getting ready to break down below 50DMA support  Such a move would be a very bearish warning 


The U S  dollar index looks more and more like it is topping out or at best starting an extended period of consolidation

16623,238138,FCX,In disaster s wake  BP doubles down on deepwater despite surging shale,news,"By Jessica Resnick Ault THUNDER HORSE OIL PLATFORM  Gulf of Mexico  Reuters    About 300  BP   LON BP  workers commute 150 miles here by helicopter  from the Louisiana coast to a deep sea drilling platform that can produce more oil in a day than a West Texas rig can pump in a year  On the deck of Thunder Horse  they work two week shifts  drink seawater from a desalination plant  and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat  On the ocean floor  robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265 000 barrels per day   There s a whole city below us   said Jim Pearl  Marine Team Leader on the platform  This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U S  oil production  Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill  BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more   just as shale oil producers have done onshore  The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated  61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history   and without compromising safety  BP s Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to  17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year  Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors   Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building  and keep it full  to the platform s capacity  Richard Morrison  BP s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico  told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster   We re also exploring for larger pools of oil   BP s deepwater double down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors  who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays  While BP has some onshore U S  developments  the firm is notably absent from the industry s rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin  Majors including  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM    Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U S  shale  Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year  Freeport McMoRan  N FCX  and  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN  have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years  Anadarko Petroleum Corp  N APC  took a  435 million dollar write down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf  deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about  50 a barrel   In a  50 to  60 world  we always felt like greenfield development  in the Gulf in particular  was fairly challenged   Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month  Oil prices dropped steeply last week  settling in the low  40s per barrel  BP says its next Gulf development   the  9 billion Mad Dog phase two   would be profitable even at  40 a barrel  As recently as 2013  BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than  100 a barrel  A BILLION BARRELS In time  BP s offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff  The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms   Thunder Horse  Atlantis  Na Kika and Mad Dog  The find   worth more than  40 billion at today s market prices   amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field  or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf   It seems like every ten years there s another breakthrough  that unlocks more Gulf oil  Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse  Over his shoulder  a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform  In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster  deepwater production was curtailed by a six month U S  government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation  But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand  BP s big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per barrel costs  as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers  For eight decades  geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain  BP used its own new technology for the billion barrel discovery  Called full waveform inversion  the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits  The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi billion dollar platforms  At Thunder Horse and other platforms  BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms  like the legs of a spider  These  tiebacks  allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped  Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog s second phase from an initially estimated  20 billion to just  9 billion  the company said  Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform s profitability at oil prices of  40 a barrel   The struggles of deepwater oil service firms   who were forced to cut prices after per barrel prices tanked in 2014   are also keeping BP s expansion costs low   If you re going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform  now is the time to be doing it   said Norm MacDonald  portfolio manager for Invesco s energy fund  which has increased its stake in BP  its second largest holding  Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry  Shale has a  liquidity premium  because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner  within two or three years  said Michael Roomberg  a portfolio analyst at Miller Howard Investments  Tie backs and other advances  however  could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale  MacDonald said   COST CUTTING  SAFETY CONCERNS BP s growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists  who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill  They also see the threat of another disaster   They never really fulfilled those promises  and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling   said Raleigh Hoke  campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans  Richard Sears   who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling   said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices   The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision making and slipshod safety systems than cost cutting  said Sears  who previously managed production projects at Shell  BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill  introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices  among other measures  The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company  In a glassed in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform  operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells  On the deck below sits a blowout preventer  a room sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site  two miles under water   
But first it would need a safety inspection   unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill  which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years ",2017-06-27,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/in-disaster's-wake,-bp-doubles-down-on-deepwater-despite-surging-shale-499490",499490

16648,238163,FCX,Week In Review  Bitcoin Soars  U S  Indices End 2016 Higher,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Last week  as with every post Christmas holiday week  was all about low volume  quiet trading  Sell offs predominated  but Bitcoin experienced a wave of upward momentum that moved the crypto currency higher  That momentum appears to have continued into this week Bitcoin is up an additional 2 57  as of this writing 
Contrary to US and many global market stocks  a few big Japanese companies trading on the Nikkei saw more volatility than usual 
Here s how last week played out 
Markets ended the year with a whimper  but U S  Indices gained
On Friday  the final trading day of 2016  the Dow closed down 0 29   at 19 762 still shy of the much ballyhooed 20K benchmark  the S P 500 fell 0 046   to 2 238 83  and the NASDAQ ended 0 9  lower  at 5 383 12 

Despite the year end declines  2016 was a positive year for the major indices  Propelled in no small part by the post election Trump Rally  the Dow was up 13 42  in 2016  the S P gained 9 5   and the NASDAQ wrapped up the year with a net increase of 7 5  
Bitcoin grabs headlines
Bitcoin jumped 13  over the course of last week  as FX traders in India and China among other countries  sought to counter weakness and or political problems by avoiding their local currencies  hedging instead with something they deemed safer  Over the course of 2016  Bitcoin gained more than 120   It opened the year at  429 98 and closed at  996 66 

As of this writing  the virtual currency is up more than 2 5  in the first trading session of 2017   and it s broken through the  1 000 threshold  currently trading at  1 026 54  Many analysts think that Bitcoin could soon push upward to its all time high of  1 216  reached back in 2013 
Last Week s Biggest Gainers
The S P had a down week  losing 1 07   Indeed  all S P sectors were negative   except for one  Real Estate  which gained 1 20  

Source  Fidelity com
Not surprising then  that among the top ten weekly gainers were six REITs  Macerich  NYSE MAC   Ventas  NYSE VTR   United Dominion  NYSE UDR   Mid America Apartment Communities  NYSE MAA   Extra Space Storage  NYSE EXR   and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   Two additional REITs  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  and Welltower  NYSE HCN   fell just outside the top ten 

The Energy Index fell 1 25  overall  but Cabot Oil   Gas  NYSE COG  gained approximately 2 5  on the week 
S P 500 Materials fell 1 25  last week  nevertheless CF Industries  NYSE CF  was a top ten gainer last week  up 2 51  
Newmont  NYSE NEM  the world s second largest gold miner  and the only one included in the S P 500 saw a weekly gain of 4 96   most likely helped by gold s own up move  to  1 152 
The Health Care Index dropped 0 85   with pharmaceutical companies falling a collective 0 21   Nevertheless  the S P s biggest weekly gainer was a Big Pharma company   Allergan  NYSE AGN   which rose 5 49  
Last Week s Biggest Losers
Three semi conductor companies were among last week s biggest losers  Micron  NASDAQ MU  lost 5 76   Qorvo  NASDAQ QRVO  fell 5 04   and Skyworks  NASDAQ SWKS  dropped 4 32  
As mentioned above  the Materials Index lost 1 25  last week  and indeed  two of its components were among last weeks biggest losers  Arconic  NYSE ARNC  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  dropped 6 27  and 4 49   respectively 
Three oil energy companies didn t fare too well either  Chesapeake  NYSE CHK  dropped 5 65   Newfield Exploration  NYSE NFX  fell 4 5   and Apache  NYSE APA  sagged 4 41  
Rounding out the bottom ten were electronics retailer Best Buy  NYSE BBY  and specialty pharma company  Mallinckrodt  NYSE MNK  


Major fluctuations for some Japanese companies
Last week also saw fluctuations in some major Japanese companies with international profiles 
Toshiba Corp   T 6502  plunged 43  at the beginning of last week  after it announced that complications at its nuclear power plant subsidiary could force a one time loss of several billion dollars  However  as traders covered their short positions on the last trading day of 2016  the stock rebounded 9 3  on Friday 
Hitachi Koki Co Ltd  T 6581  gained 17  over the week  as news surfaced that private equity company KKR   Co  NYSE KKR  was in talks to purchase the Japanese power tools manufacturer 
Also on Friday  auto parts manufacturer Takata s  T 7312  stock skyrocketed  up 40  as rumors surfaced that the company was nearing a  1 billion damages settlement with US Federal prosecutors over defective  exploding airbags that have been linked to 11 deaths and 180 injuries in the US alone and forced 19 auto manufacturers to recall 42 million vehicles 
The company is not yet out of the woods though  Even if the settlement deal goes through  Takata could come under further pressure if it is required to plead guilty to criminal misconduct  And  the company still faces a class action lawsuit and  
What to expect this coming week
Most global markets will be closed Monday for an extended New Year holiday  and exchanges in Japan and New Zealand will be closed on Tuesday  as well

16654,238169,FCX,Technicals Whispering Warnings For S P 500 Into Today s Fed,opinion,"T2108 Status  74 5   5th overbought day T2107 Status  67 1 VIX Status  12 7General  Short term  Trading Call  cautiously bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  205 over 20   Day  25 over 30   Day  24 over 40   Day  22 over 50   Day  16 over 60   Day  5 over 70   overbought 
Commentary This was day  5 of the  extended  overbought rally that I heralded last week  It is December Fed Eve  the December day before the Federal Reserve hands down its latest pronouncement on monetary policy  This policy statement will almost certainly include a rate hike and some hints as to the Fed s thinking for 2017  In a move that speaks volumes about the surging optimism in financial markets  yesterday investors and traders rushed to put yet more money in stocks and send the major indices to fresh all time highs 

The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 0 7  to a new closing all time high and a FIFTH day in a row trading at or above the upper Bollinger Band  BB 


The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   gained 1 0  to a new all time closing high although it pulled back from its upper Bollinger Band  BB  
The S P 500  SPY  has created the very definition of an extended overbought rally by stretching to or above its upper Bollinger  Band for every day of this overbought period  The money rotation out of and back into tech stocks is abating now that the NASDAQ has joined the S P 500 in printing all time highs 
Several big cap tech stocks notched notable gains on the day  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  1 8   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  2 2   despite Tuesday s gain  Facebook still looks like it is breaking down   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  1 7   and Intel  NASDAQ INTC  2 3  stood out in particular 
I REALLY like the 50DMA breakout on INTC  While I missed playing the perfect test of 200DMA support  I am looking forward to buying the dip 
Intel  INTC  has bounced back sharply from an equally sharp retest of 200DMA support 
With these gains  I expected T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   to press further into overbought territory  I found instead that my favorite technical indicator is whispering warnings for financial markets 
For the third day in a row  T2108 has gone nowhere even as the S P 500 has advanced two of these of three days  I find this bearish divergence particularly troubling ahead of the Federal Reserve s meeting  This divergence represents a market hesitation and underlying weakening that is hidden by the bigger stocks that must be leading the advance in the major indices 
Given this stall in T2108 I looked around at some usual suspects for more evidence  The iShares Russell 2000   NYSE IWM  closed flat for the day and printed a technical pattern called a spinning top on Friday  Monday was a down day 
Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  closed with a paltry 0 3  gain and has gone nowhere for three days  SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT   closed flat on the day and sold off the previous two days from a 16 month high  The iShares Transportation Average  NYSE IYT  closed with a 0 3  gain and topped out three trading days ago  In other words  do not let the major indices fool you  the underlying market has paused and given the Fed meeting its due respect 
The volatility index  the VIX  has also paid its respects by increasing ever so slightly and gaining 4 out of the last 5 trading days after its last bottom 

The volatility index  the VIX  has apparently refused to go any lower for now 
The VIX is too low for me to bother fading volatility ahead of the Fed meeting as I like to do  but I stand ready to fade post Fed volatility 
The bearish divergence and the market hesitation convinced me to downgrade my short term trading call to cautiously bullish  As a reminder of the T2108 trading rules on overbought conditions  I do not switch to bearish UNTIL T2108 drops out of overbought conditions or the S P 500 goes parabolic and forms a climactic topping pattern 
In other words  I am NOT bearish even as we strain to listen to the whispering warning from T2108  As a small precaution  I will sell my shares in ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  ahead of the Fed announcement 
I was disappointed that the S P 500 never dipped in the overbought period and forced me to just jump in and buy  as a result I am sitting on a small gain  I will also lock in my surprisingly large gains in my April call options on iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  
As an example of my on going bullishness  I went ahead and bought the big dips on Tuesday in the commodity and industrial plays that have become extremely popular in this post election rally  I am also preparing to buy any immediate post Fed dips 
I bought handfuls of call options in United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF   and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   X is 6 6  off its most recent high  CLF is down 11 2  off its most recent high and closed at 20DMA support  FCX is down 7 2  below its most recent high and has completely reversed the one day surge that took the stock to that high  My positions in CLF and FCX are my second go rounds in this post election period

16692,238207,FCX,Week In Review  Fed Hike Boosts USD  Dow Still Shy Of 20K,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Without doubt  the biggest event of the past week was the Fed s first  and only  rate hike in 2016  Though markets had already priced in the decision  the big speculation prior to Wednesday s FOMC statement revolved around what sort of forward looking guidance the Fed would provide  The remainder of the week was dedicated to market reactions to the 25 bp increase and the hawkish tone set by the Fed for plans to boost rates three times during 2017  The US dollar rocketed higher on the news  US equities  however  which had been on tear up until then  fell back slightly 
King dollar ascendant
The greenback may be on the verge of consolidating  but last week in wake of the Fed s announcement the Dollar Index soared above 103  Despite the slight retracement on Friday  the dollar still appears to have some upside 
The euro fell below 105 as it moved yet closer to parity  while the Japanese yen fell to 117  a ten month low versus the dollar  Since the US election  the yen has performed even worse than the Mexican peso  The Aussie fell 3 5  on the Fed rate decision  and remains the only major currency that has not yet experienced even a small retracement against the dollar 

Wall Street continues to have room to run
Many thought last week would finally be the week the Dow would hit its next big benchmark    20 000  while other major indices   the NASDAQ  S P  as well as the Russell   would get pulled along  each to new all time record highs 
The Dow  NASDAQ and S P did each move up  0 7   0 65   and 0 8  respectively  through Tuesday  However  the rally faltered once the Fed raised interest rates  At the close for the week  the Dow had gained just 0 5   while the NASDAQ and S P each slipped lower  0 1  and 0 03   respectively 
The US bank sector fell approximately 1   However  even with the drop  they remain the   up more than 20  since just before Trump s election victory  The sector could easily correct and drive higher this coming week 
Even with last week s pullback  the Dow is still only one rally away from 20 000 points which could conceivably occur this coming week  Should this occur  it s likely the other majors will also move up along with it  providing a small bounce before the holidays  and lower market volumes move in 
Oil up  down  then up again
Oil started the week up more than five percent when major non OPEC countries agreed to join OPEC in curbing oil production  However  a mixture of profit taking  a stronger dollar  and questions regarding deal compliance pushed oil lower over the course of the week  It made a comeback on Friday with crude gaining 2 22  to close the week at  52 95 while Brent rose 2 41  to finish at  55 32 

Over the near term  expect the oil roller coaster to continue with prices fluctuating each time rumors of compliance non compliance circulate  Currently  Goldman Sachs  H12017 prices of between  55  60 for the commodity 
Last Week s Biggest Gainers
Telecommunications   2 26    Utilities   1 85    and Health Care   1 49   were the biggest weekly gainers on the S P  However  it was a mixed bag for best individual stock performances  The top ten gainers included companies operating in the following sectors  tech  NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA    energy  Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  and First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR    consumer discretionary  Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG   and staples  Mondelez  NASDAQ MDLZ    REITs  Apartment Investment   Management Co  NYSE AIV    biotech  Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   and Big Pharma  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   

Last Week s Biggest Losers
Retail and apparel were among the biggest losers last week  possibly on the back of the disappointing November retail sales release last Wednesday  Headliners included Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Macy s  NYSE M   Kohl s  NYSE KSS  and Under Armour  NYSE UAA  
Several energy and oil exploration companies also took a tumble  including Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN   EQT  NYSE EQT   and Range Resources  NYSE RRC   There was one additional surprise in the commodities sector  mining company Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   which has gained over 100  on the year  dipped more than 12  last week  as copper prices shifted lower 


What to expect this week
The dollar retraced a bit on Friday  but with higher US interest rates and bond yields still moving up  there s little impetus for dollar strength to fade  Fed Chair Yellen will speak tomorrow  however  and her comments could influence the dollar s trajectory  The US third revision on the Q3 GDP estimate will be released on Thursday  where a 3 3  figure is expected a minimal uptick from previous estimates 
As market volume slows into the holidays next week  it s still possible we ll see a Santa Rally  or something similar ",2016-12-18,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review:-fed-rate-hike-boosts-usd,-dow-still-short-of-20k-200170062",200170062
16693,238208,FCX,S P 500  Here s Why I Hesitate To Trust This Rally,opinion,"T2108 Status  72 4 T2107 Status  65 7 VIX Status  11 7General  Short term  Trading Call  neutralActive T2108 periods  Day  209 over 20   Day  29 over 30   Day  28 over 40   Day  26 over 50   Day  20 over 60   Day  2 over 70   overbought  period ended 4 days under 70  
Commentary The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   quickly returned to overbought status  but it crept its way above this threshold in an unimpressive style    the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed on Friday at 70 4  and on Monday at 72 4   This entry into overbought conditions pales in comparison to the impressive breakout that launched the last overbought period 
The S P 500  SPY  weakened slightly post Fed but still sits inside the upward trend channel defined by the upper Bollinger Bands  BBs 
When T2108 entered overbought conditions on Friday  the S P 500 actually closed for a slight loss which represents a bullish divergence  I was not willing to flip the short term trading call from cautiously bearish to cautiously bullish until I observed the follow through  The follow through barely registered with a mere 0 2  gain for the S P 500 
However  I decided to respect what is likely to be benign trading over the holiday period and switch the short term trading call to neutral  I also hope to avoid getting churned with a market falling in and out of overbought conditions  Moreover  this move keeps the trading call consistent with the trading strategy for overbought trading where the short term trading call does not go bearish until the end of the overbought period or upon a pullback from  
While the S P 500 stayed within a calm consolidation range  the volatility index  the VIX  DID make a dramatic move  The VIX lost 4 0  to close at recent lows which are also barely above the low for 2016  This increased complacency is consistent with benign holiday trading  could it even signal the beginning of a Santa Claus rally   

The volatility index  the VIX  fell back toward 2016 lows 
There are a few reasons for my caution and hesitancy to jump on the potential for an extended overbought rally  First and foremost  the reflation trade of the Trump Rally has definitely slowed down and even corrected in many cases  Since December 7th  the day the last overbought rally burst onto the scene  stocks like commodity and industrial Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   and CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX  have sold off nearly every day sometimes on very heavy volume 
I will focus on their charts in another post  For now  I note that many of these stocks completed full reversals of important breakouts or rallies  I also remind readers that CAT is a key stock for me in gauging the health of a bull run  While I duly bought into some of these pullbacks as I explained I would do in an earlier post  I have now put that program on pause as I wait for signs of life like a successful test of key support lines and trends 
There are also the likes of SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  which started corrections one day after the last overbought period began  XRT even gapped down on the first day of the current overbought period 

SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  has nearly lost all its gains for December despite the looming promise of holiday shopping and a Santa Claus rally 
Finally  the U S  dollar index  DXY0  looks like it regained its post Fed muscle  While dollar strength has been celebrated as a proxy for American economic strength  I strongly expect that very soon continued strength will once again become feared for its potential to hurt American exports and send commodity prices spiraling back downward 

The U S  dollar index  DXY0  closed at a new  marginal  14 year high as another overbought period gets revved up

Alas  here we are closing out the year with the HUI ARCA Gold BUGS 47  from the mid year high at 286 and still a mere 25  of the 2011 peak at 635  After grooming themselves for a magnificent year of outperformance back in August  the script I had been preparing complete with curtain calls and victory laps has been transformed into yet another December assault of tax loss selling and portfolio rebalancing bringing pressure down upon the throats of the miners  big and small 
After the Trump victory  what should have been a December of portfolio managers chasing gold and silver stocks turned into a December where portfolio managers were chasing the banks because higher interest rates brought about by the post election surge in yields were  bullish   Well  yes  I get it that the steeper the yield curve  the bigger the margin for the lenders  but how on earth does Bank of America get marked up by 20  because the 10 year prints a 2 48 yield  Higher borrowing costs  by the way  are NOT good for business especially if borrowers are shutting their doors because higher borrowing costs are crippling their customers  purchasing power 
I guess what really irks me this Christmas is that the miners were given a seven month reprieve in 2016 after a near sixty month bear market of the  granddaddy  variety  in which we witnessed not just  falls from Grace   but rather total annihilation of projects  balance sheets  hopes  dreams and retirement plans over a very long and drawn out time frame  After bear markets of the magnitude of the last one  the new bulls tend to have big advances initially and then a pause correction that typically flushes out all of the late longs and allows the early investors to replace peripheral positions before going for the next major advance 
As we close out 2016  the HUI is actually sitting on the precipice of a large gap zone representing the initial lift off from the lows at 99 17 to around 150  if we don t grab in here  tax loss selling right up until the 31st could easily vaporize the 2016 gains made nine months ago  Now  am I forecasting that  No  However  I am calling it to everyone s attention so that if it actually happens  I can cherry pick it from today s missive and tell everyone that I  nailed it   like all the other gurus do  



Friday s COT was no surprise in that it was before the big smash last week and while you can see that the open interest numbers are flattening out  that would appear to be because the Large Speculators have started to short the market as compared with last August when they were net long 294 000 contracts versus today at 129 000  So it looks like the Commercials are playing bat catchers to the Large Spec pitchers as long liquidation prevails going into year end 
I think that with the Commercials STILL short a ton of paper  gold  versus this time last year  that it is still too early to expect that we are in as good a shape in terms of the COT structure today as we were on December 4th of last year with the Commercial Cretins at  2 911 contracts and the Large Specs massively short instead 
Some of the brilliant minds out there say that gold will be weak right up until Trump s inauguration but I think it will all be pretty much over by end of month  One sad thing is for certain from where I sit  the explosive cannon shot that the miners experienced in the winter of 2016 is going to be a very tough act to follow 


The good news for me is that the base metals have finally rolled over with copper now finally in retreat and taking Freeport McMoran Inc  NYSE FCX  with it  I bought a fistful of January puts that are now finally in the money and as I wrote when I first posted the trading idea  I continue to think that the Trump Trade will get largely reversed after month end when people s gains are moved to 2018 and are probably at a lower tax rate  If that s the case  then FCX could easily check back to the 200 dma at  11 56 but it could also be headed to its pre election level around  10 50  If that happens  the January  14 puts will be between  2 50 and  3 50 and a decent return from the  1 25 paid three weeks ago 
There is no question that gold sentiment is similar to last year in its extreme bearish consensus so there is no doubt that we could and probably will get a really sharp countertrend rally in the miners in early January  However  until the regulators can finally put an end to this horrific process whereby the bullion banks have a total carte blanche to issue as many contracts as they desire under the guise of  hedging   prospective gold investors are simply going to say  Nope  not playing  
Because of the interventions and collusions and bank coordinated gangs attacks such as we are now witnessing via all of the Deutsche Bank evidence coming to the surface  it is actually having a negative effect on sentiment because as much as the revelations are creating transparency  they are also scaring prospective investors at the same time  The prevailing wisdom that is emanating from the trading desks is  Wow  if they can get away with that  why would anyone put money into the gold and silver markets   Bullish sentiment for gold is 4   which is 1  higher than the all time low from 2014 

The more things change

16695,238210,FCX,Best Comeback Stocks Of 2016,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
As is the case every year  some stocks are worthy of recognition for extraordinary performance while others thoroughly disappointed investors  In this four part series  which we ll be publishing intermittently over the next few weeks  we ll take a look at how well  or not  specific groups of stocks repaid investors during 2016 
We ve borrowed our designations from the world of sports  Today s article will focus on Comeback Stocks of the year  After the Christmas holiday we ll take a look at the S P 500 MVPs  the best performing stocks on the benchmark index  Toward the end of the holiday week we ll consider the Rookies of the Year  those stocks that IPO ed most successfully in 2016  Finally  as the new year begins  we ll consider the stocks that most disappointed investors  the  draft picks  that turned out to be a bust 
When it comes to comebacks of the year  performance metrics are important  However  unlike MVPs whose rankings are based solely on performance metrics comebacks have a subjective aspect as well  For this list  presented here in ascending order  we also took into account general sentiment on the stock  sector and industry  and we applied a longer perspective if warranted  rather than just considering performance in 2015 vs 2016 

 4  Wynn Resorts
Sector  Services  Casinos
2015 Performance Range   148 59 to  69 19   53 
2016 Performance Range   69 19 to  90 12   30 

Looking just at the performance of Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN  stock last year doesn t do justice to the level of  difficulty  of this year s comeback  even though the stock lost an incredible 53  last year  Wynn s troubles go back further than that  to the beginning of 2014   when Chinese authorities decided to focus on corruption  using Macau s gaming industry as their primary example  Not surprisingly  that scared away many of China s high rollers who found other gambling destinations in Asia or the US 
During March 2014  WYNN stock peaked at a closing price of  246  after which it saw a two year decline  bottoming during October 2015 at just under  51  That s a negative return of 78  in just under two years 
Wynn s resurgence this year is being fueled by the end of revenue and earnings declines  as well as a new Macao resort  Wynn Palace  which investors are hoping will strengthen Wynn s luxurious Macao offering  The Palace opened on Aug 22 of this year  adding 1700 rooms and 350 tables to the Wynn brand in Macau 
Right now it is considered to be the most luxurious hotel in the autonomous region  sometimes referred to as the  Las Vegas of Asia   It puts Wynn in an excellent position to take advantage of Macau s comeback as the Chinese government shifts its corruption focus elsewhere 
The year ahead  Wynn stock has recovered from its lows  It closed yesterday at  89 27  Operating revenue and gross profit are on the rise  Though it s hard to see Wynn catapulting back to its  240 high anytime soon  given continued growth which looks more than possible  another year like 2016 where the share price increases by 30  seems a reasonable expectation 

 3  Best Buy
Sector  Services  Retail
2015 Performance Range   38 17 to  30 04   21 
2016 Performance Range   30 04 to  46 56   55 

The Best Buy  NYSE BBY  comeback story has been fueled by consumer sentiment more than anything else  While many think traditional bricks and mortar retail is dying and the jury is still out on whether they re wrong Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  continues to consume larger and larger portions of the retail pie even as they become less and less willing to share  For proof  check out     the company s vision of what the future of retail could look like 
Still  many analysts underestimate the ability of traditional retailers to adapt their businesses to new retail realities  Best Buy s strategy of opening specialty stores within their stores offers an excellent example of a traditional retailer fighting back 
A few years ago  in order to provide a better shopping experience for customers alongside better audience targeting  Best Buy began dedicating discreet boutiques within each store to such popular telecom and consumer electronics brands as Verizon  NYSE VZ   AT T  NYSE T   Sony  NYSE SNE  and Samsung  KS 005930   for example 
By understanding that the conceptual advantage of traditional retail outlets is in the physical shopping experience being able to see and feel the television or smartphone you want prior to purchase  while at the same time knowing there s an actual representative on hand to talk to about service  problems or simply to answer questions and delivering on the advantages often tips the scale in favor of bricks and mortar retailers versus e tailers  Enhancing and delivering on this advantage has been helping turn Best Buy around 
Indeed  for the past two straight quarters  Best Buy has posted revenue growth  something it hasn t done since 2011  Annual revenue has been shrinking every year since 2010  yet this year Best Buy has a good shot at posting their first quarter of annual growth in 6 years contingent on Q4 sales  of course  Best Buy has also strengthened its online presence by expanding its same day delivery to major metropolitan areas across the United States 
The year ahead  Best Buy  with 1431 stores across the US  192 in Canada and 23 in Mexico  is undoubtedly making the best of the cards it s been dealt so far  It s currently trading at  46 82 as of yesterday s close  its highest price since the 2008 crash  Based on market conditions  competition  and Best Buy s historically high P E ratio of 14 4 vs 5 year average of 12 for the industry  it s unlikely that BBY will soar  or even rise quickly  Rather  we expect Best Buy to continue growing at the market s pace  We see it as a slow but steady performer 

 2  Two Oil and Gas ETFs 
SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  NYSE XOP 
2015 Performance Range   47 30 to  30 22   36 
2016 Performance Range   30 22 to  42 22   39 

SPDR S P Oil   Gas Equipment   Services  NYSE XES 
2015 performance   28 10 to  17 54   37 
2016 performance   17 54 to  22 62   29 

It wouldn t be fair to single out just one company for either our  2 or  1 picks for comeback stocks of 2016  Because of low commodity prices in 2015 a broad array of oil and gas sector companies  as well as mining companies  had notable comebacks in 2016  Therefore  we re focusing on two ETFs in the oil and gas sector and one metals and mining ETF 
Outlooks and sector considerations for all of the ETFs are detailed below  We also provide a holiday bonus at the end of the post  a few notable company comeback stocks for each of these sectors 

 1  SPDR S P Metals   Mining  NYSE XME 
2015 Performance   30 74 to  14 95   51 
2016 Performance   14 95 to  31 16   108 

As different as they are  the oil and gas industry as well as the metals and mining sector all suffered from the same issue in 2015   low commodity prices  Gas hit  1 61 and oil dived to  26 05 
Some metals saw steep declines as well including copper which went as low as  1 93  Given fixed infrastructure costs  labor  and distribution agreements  low commodity prices have the capacity to do major damage to company balance sheets and income statements  Commodity prices were so detrimental in fact  that many companies in these sectors were approaching bankruptcy at one point or another 

However  the resurgence of energy commodities  rising political and economic uncertainty leading to higher gold prices during late 2015 and the middle of 2016  as well as the hope of significant future demand for steel after Trump s election victory in the U S completely turned these industries around 
The year ahead  Many variables are in play in these markets  OPEC s recent decision to cut production  even if just for a few months  is good news for oil producers  Natural gas is still struggling with a supply glut and a relatively mild winter in the US thus far 
Gold s price often moves according to market volatility and right now there s no rush to safe havens  As well  the steel rally will continue as long as major infrastructure development is plausible 
While energy markets have calmed and prices found footing at higher ranges  oil at around  50  natural gas above  3   gold is once again on the decline  These are definitely not  steady as they go  sectors and 2017 will no doubt again bring crises and opportunities that will rile the markets 
But as long as winter temperatures are lower than expected  natural gas will struggle to push upward  Oil should continue heading higher as long as no oil producers go rogue  sabotaging the current production cut agreement  As for gold  the markets handled the Trump election and Fed rate hike well  so don t expect a rebound for the yellow metal in the near term as everyone has their sites on Dow 20 000

16696,238211,FCX,SPX MVPs  The 5 Best Performing Stocks Of 2016,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
This is Part II of our four part series about how specific groups of stocks repaid investors in 2016  
Part I  Best Comeback Stocks Of 2016  was published right before the Christmas holiday  We borrowed our designations from the world of sports  Later this week we ll consider Rookies Of The Year  The 4 Most Successful IPOs Of The Year  Finally as the new year begins  we ll look at the stocks that most disappointed investors  the  draft picks  that turned out to be a bust 
What a volatile year 2016 has been for the S P 500  It started off catastrophically  with the index hitting 1810 a 52 week low on February 11  thanks to the oil plunge  From there  however  the market took off  all the way to a new all time high of 2277 just two weeks ago 
Overall  the S P managed a 10 69  return year to date  That s quite surprising given all the uncertainty we ve seen this past year  from the China market melt down to Brexit through the US elections and most recently the Italian referendum 
But our MVPs definitely didn t disappoint  each surprising investors to the upside and well above the benchmark index  Here are the top five S P 500 stocks of 2016  based on closing prices as of Friday  December 23  2016 


 5  Newmont Mining Corporation

Opening Price on January 4th   18 44
Closing Price on December 23rd   32 46
Gains    14 02   76 
Sector  Metal Mining

Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is one of the world s largest gold producers  with 11 active mines in North and South America  Africa  and Australia  Like all companies in commodities oriented sectors  the price of the stock is inextricably linked to the price of the commodity  in this case primarily gold and copper 
A number of risk events this past year including crashing oil and unexpected election results have generated market volatility which always leads to a rush for gold  As a company  Newmont has increased its gold production by about 3 3   and now produces 1 25 million ounces a year  Unfortunately  the recent decline in gold s price has caused Newmont s stock to drop 29  from its high of  45 91 in late July  making it  only  our 5th best performer of the year 
The year ahead  Within a notoriously risky industry  Newmont is one of the safer miners  The company s Debt to EBITDA ratio is 1 79 TTM  meaning the miner is not dangerously leveraged  Its all in  sustaining cost of production for one ounce of gold is steadying  currently between  900 and  1050  meaning Newmont has successfully adjusted its cost of doing business to reflect the multi year  down trend in gold price since the beginning of the decade  We believe this means they should remain in the green going into 2017 


 4  Applied Materials  Inc 

Opening Price on January 4th   18 31
Price on December 23rd   32 90
Gains    14 59   79 
Sector  Semiconductors

Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   one of the world s leading materials engineering companies  has had a remarkable year of growth  leading to terrific performance for the company s shares during 2016  The company beat EPS expectations every quarter in 2016  and grew its revenue by 13 3  and 39 2  over the past two quarters  blowing past  3 billion in revenues  to  3 297 in fact  for the first time  just this last quarter 
Profit margins are also up  and gross profits grew by 45  last quarter  Orders grew 25  year over year  and backlog  or future orders  increased by 46   AMAT s performance this year was boosted by strong demand for equipment the company makes for smartphone manufacturers including LG Electronics  KS 066570  and Samsung  OTC SSNLF   most notably displays and memory chips  a trend that is expected to continue 
The year ahead  The expectation is that growth will slow in the coming two years since leading customers  such as smartphone makers  are reportedly cutting CapEx  At the same time  new OLED technology is cannibalizing LCD screens so there s little growth expected in displays  Nevertheless  AMAT is still the market leader  Its valuation  P E 21  forward P E 14  doesn t indicate the stock is overvalued  However  after a well executed   1 9 billion share buyback program in the past year  Applied Materials has brought the process to a complete stop  This could indicate that management believes the company is now fairly valued 



 3  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  Inc 

Opening Price on January 4th   6 60
Price on December 23rd   13 81
Gains    7 21   109 
Sector  Metal Mining

At the beginning of the year it didn t actually look like Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  might make it through the year  Copper prices were down to  1 93  a seven year low  The company had over  20 billion in debt and FCX s Q4 2015 report included a net loss of over  4 billion 
The Q4 2015 report also mentioned the probability of at least a few more negative growth quarters  at least until gold prices moved higher  The company s shares which had traded in the  30 range for a number of years were  by by mid January  available for  3 52  Since that low point  the company has pledged to deleverage its balance sheet by selling assets and limiting capital expenditures 
These efforts  in conjunction with a 25  jump in copper prices this year  have pulled the company back from the brink of bankruptcy and straight to the middle of the top five best performing SPX stocks of 2016  If you d dared to open a long position on this miner at the beginning of this year  your profit would have beaten the SPX handsomely 
The year ahead  With commodity prices still low  Freeport is far from being safe bet  But we believe the worst has past for this particular company  As long as quarterly reports continue to signal FCX s commitment to the health of its balance sheet  and copper prices don t implode again  we think Freeport McMoran might be able to reach the  20 mark in 2017 



 2  ONEOK  Inc 

Opening Price on January 4th   24 66
Price on December 23rd   58 69
Gains    34 03   137 
Sector  Energy   Natural Gas

For ONEOK  NYSE OKE   a natural gas provider  the past nine months of 2016 have been the rainbow after the downpour  Much like other commodities  which have all been poor performers over the past few years  natural gas prices plummeted to  1 6 per million Btu in the first quarter of 2016 an 18 year low because of a gas glut which led to an oversupplied market 
In 2015  the company s revenue fell more than 36   and its net income took a 22  hit  leading to a disastrous year for the stock which lost just over 50   falling from  49 90 to  24 66  Since then  natural gas prices have doubled  spurring OKE growth  revenue increased by 24  during the last quarter and the company has seen two straight quarters of overall growth after seven consecutive negative quarters  An additional win  The  135  jump in the stock price seen over the past year 
The year ahead  A little more stability for gas prices would be very welcome at ONEOK  The company s dividend has a very nice 4 2  yield which  with a 75  payout ratio is relatively solid  As income continues to grow  there s also been talk of resuming dividend growth  While we believe ONEOK s very strong share price rebound is largely over  the company should prove to be a solid investment in 2017 


 1  NVIDIA Corporation

Opening Price on January 4th   32 29
Price on December 23rd   109 78
Gains    77 49   240 
Sector  Semiconductors

Sometimes  albeit rarely  lightning does strike twice  NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  appeared on our list of top performers in 2015  coming in at number 4  when its stock price grew by 65   Over the past year  NVIDIA built on that accomplishment  growing 400  over the past two years  or five times what it was worth two years ago 
In 2016  NVIDIA managed to replicate the immense success of its GTX970 with its newest series of processors  the GTX 10XX  Additionally  NVIDIA s involvement in fast growing sectors such as smart cars and the internet of things  as well as double digit growth in all aspects of its business  have catapulted the stock s price sky high  While we expected a continuation of last year s uptrend due to NVIDIA s sector leadership  the 240  return exceeded all expectations 
The year ahead  Much like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  after two straight years of incredible growth  we expect NVIDIA to give back some of its gains over the next calendar year  Of course  for savvy investors interested in jumping on the NVIDIA growth train for the longer term  this would provide a better entry point  We re serious fans of the stock and are hopeful it could correct downward by 20 25   which would offer a mid  80s entry point  A bit more risky  but probably more likely entry point would be at  95 since it might not get to the mid  80s any time soon

16697,238212,FCX,2016 Year End Review And Forward Analysis For 2017,opinion,"As always  I provide no predictions or forecasts for the future 
As a successful long term investor  I remain faithful to Warren Buffett s life long commitment in investing by observing his two rules 
Rule  1   do not lose money 
Rule  2   do not forget rule  1 
Looking back on 2016

Our long term investment model has switched back to favoring equities after placing us on the defensive in 2015  A false alarm in hindsight 

The growth sector as represented by S P 500 also switched back to a major buy signal in late 2016 

The oil and energy sector as represented by PHLX Oil Service had a major buy signal in early 2016  ending the major sell signal from 2014  The multi month consolidation after the new major buy signal provided us with excellent entries  with a 40  allocation for the long term 

The gold sector as represented by ARCA Gold BUGS had a major buy signal early in 2016  but it was a price spike and no entries could be made  and no consolidation with no trendline support established so far to set up for a long term allocation 

Copper sector also had a major buy signal in 2016  Teck Resources Ltd B  NYSE TECK  went straight up  while Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  consolidated and we entered near the bottom of the consolidation range  with a 10  allocation for the long term 
Summary
All three sectors are on major buy signals at the end of 2016 
The best opportunities were in the energy sector where we took a 40  allocation intended to be held for the long term 
These positions are up on average of 14 8  as of 12 31 
We also took a 10  long term position in FCX  a giant in the copper sector 
FCX is up 23  as of 12 31 
It was another profitable year 
Looking forward to 2017
Our long term stocks bond model switched back to favoring equities in 2016  therefore  I m looking for new opportunities to be fully invested in 2017 

The growth sector is in a super bull market with no overhead resistance 
The major breakout in 2013 after a 12 year consolidation rendered this a young bull and should have plenty of upside in coming years 
Any sharp correction with a spike in VIX will be buying opportunities in 2017 

USD remains on a major buy signal since 2011 
As long as the dollar remains in a bull market  precious metals will be under pressure overall although we may see some sharp bounces periodically 


 HUI is on a major buy signal  and we need to see a multi month consolidation  with trendline support established before considering any long term allocations 

Crude oil bottomed in 2016 and a new bull market is in progress 

OSX is on major buy signal with established trendline support 
We look for new buying opportunities in 2017 at cycle bottoms 
Summary
All three sectors are on major buy signals 
Growth sector has no overhead resistance  any sharp correction with a spike in VIX in 2017 will be buying opportunities  ideally confirmed with a cycle bottom 
Energy sector has trendline support and plenty of potential upside  looking for new buying opportunities at cycle bottoms in 2017 
Gold sector needs to establish trendline support on the monthly chart  ideally after a multi month consolidation  If so  I may consider some long term positions at a cycle bottom 
FCX is an individual stock and I am content with a 10  long term holding  However  should we see a correction to the 50 200ema in 2017  I may consider adding to positions if there is investable capital 
I will also consider some short term trading upon set ups and if risks are manageable 
Looking for new opportunities in 2017 to put the remaining capital to work to become fully invested 
Thank you for your continuous support and looking forward to another profitable year together

16704,238219,FCX,U S  and Indonesia seek to cut trade and investment barriers,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Eveline Danubrata JAKARTA  Reuters    Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U S  companies operating in Southeast Asia s largest economy  visiting U S  Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta s investment chief said   The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review  A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties   We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access   Pence said  Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia s President Joko Widodo    The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully   Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10 day Asia Pacific tour  Indonesia s investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection  insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market  Pence said  Indonesia s Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed  we still have too many regulations  too many barriers to trade  and these are bad for local and international industries    I m optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people  and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment   Lembong told Reuters   I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength   Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States   especially productivity enhancing products and services  You need imports to boost exports    10 BILLION AGREEMENTS Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late   Over the past six months  Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan  N FCX   demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua based gold and copper mine  and has demanded that  Google Inc   NASDAQ GOOGL   settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than  400 million  Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report  Pence did  however  witness the signing of more than  10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U S  companies in Indonesia on Friday  Among the 11 agreements were ones by  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina   Lockheed Martin   N LMT  to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force s F 16s  and  General Electric   N GE  to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia   We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia   Pence said  adding the agreements would  draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people   COUNTER TERRORISM COOPERATION Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime  and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism   The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack  We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples   Pence said  A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group  Indonesia  the world s largest Muslim majority nation  has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years  led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State  Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism  On Thursday  Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta  Southeast Asia s largest  and said Indonesia s moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations  Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration s proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations  That plan  however  remains stalled in courts  
Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits  They include the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines ",2017-04-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/pence-to-witness-$10-billion-in-agreements-with-u.s.-companies-in-indonesia:-white-house-official-476091,476091
16708,238223,FCX,The One Sector You Must Own In 2017,opinion,"First  please notice I said in 2017  While we are nibbling at this sector now  unlike most prognosticators  I believe we are likely to see one more downswing this year  If I m wrong  we still own a little  If I m right  we will own a lot more 
I m talking about a re entry into the natural gas and oil business  Why do I think we may be able to add to our positions at even cheaper prices 
First  because Saudi Arabia just effectively admitted they made a huge mistake trying to drive U S  and Canadian firms out of the gas and oil business  Their  400 billion mistake happened because they were looking backward  not forward  The simply didn t understand both the rate of cost cutting technological advances made in horizontal fracturing and oil sands mining  nor did they realize how tough and resourceful our wildcatters are 
As a result  they have had to roll over now and allow Iran to pump more gas and oil  and they have provided the same privilege to Nigeria and Libya  OPEC is in shambles  I wrote an article for a foreign relations venue titled  OPEC  Dead Man Walking   The energy markets are 100  about supply and demand today and no cartel can control such a force 
Right now  there is still a smidge too much supply  with more continuing to come on stream  and too little demand  globally or in the US  But as long as cartels and governments are ineffective or distracted  Adam Smith s Invisible Hand is at play in the gas and oil sector just as it is everywhere else 
The euphoria over the head fake supply constraint deal reached in Algiers  It will be forgotten as each and every OPEC member cheats on their allotment  So in the short term I see supply as greater than demand  and that is why I am only nibbling at the stocks of companies that make their living from selling gas and oil 
But over time  Again  the equation is remarkably simple  as is the case for owning gas and oil companies and their suppliers and contractors  more bodies on earth   more motor scooters  more cars  more factories  and more travel   greater demand  Greater    than the supply 
I also see bargains developing more fully as the  reserve replacement  numbers are released shortly after year end  The SEC dictates that the average of the previous year s month end prices be used when a company defines its  proven reserves   And proven reserves only count those reserves that are economically retrievable at that snapshot in time  This makes sense  Claiming a trillion barrels of oil is meaningless if it would cost  10 000 a barrel to get them out of the ground  As investors see what seems to be decreasing proven reserves  I think they will panic and drive quality gas and oil firms down one more time 
For instance  seeing a chart like the one below would make most people believe Exxon  NYSE XOM  is depleting its reserves  Not so   it s merely showing that proven reserves  those that are economical at today s prices  have declined for now  At a higher price  they will increase again 

All along  the physical resource is still there   and the cost of getting it out of the ground is coming down every year as explorers  producers  drillers  suppliers and refiners use new technologies to reduce extraction and distribution costs  To me  these reserves are like money in the bank that is tied up for some short term reason  Better technologies will allow them to be freed up once again  The gas and oil companies that lazy journalists claim     are depleting their reserves  They don t really have the reserves they said they did   will prove these Chicken Littles wrong  The gas and oil firms can t claim it in their current reporting since  at today s prices  it isn t economically viable  But it s still there  And more valuable as prices begin to stabilize based on new demand 
As an annual percentage increase  of course  demand is growing less quickly than it did before 2007 2008  But it is still growing  And it is increasing ever more quickly in India  the fastest growing country in the world  where  unlike China  we can likely trust their growth numbers   as well as in many other emerging markets  Want to grow your nation  You ll need gas and oil  For transportation  For infrastructure products  For plastics  For chemicals  For heating and air conditioning  As the world grows  gas and oil demand grow 
Energy consultant Wood McKenzie recently concluded that big elephant hunts are being replaced by what just happens to be our favorite approach  more gas than oil  more unconventional extraction like oil sands  advances in horizontal fracturing technologies and  my favorite of all since we do the hard research on up and coming gas and oil firms  via acquisitions  That s why  m looking to buy in what I think will be a valley of opportunity in the coming weeks and months  Alternatives may someday rule but today the electric vehicles that are all the rage still run on lithium or electricity  Lithium batteries  like almost every product on earth  take energy to produce  Electricity takes  mostly  gas  coal or oil to produce 
It is a good thing that people care about the flora and fauna that inhabit this earth as we strive to find cleaner sources of energy  But there are as yet no ideal solutions  only intelligent discourse  That is why I see natural gas  the cleanest of all non renewables  as the most obvious short to intermediate term investment choice 
In the real world  the poorest of nations primarily use biomass  Regrettably  burning wood  cow dung  brush and other biomass is not particularly healthy for them or the environment  Hydropower has just about reached its limits  at least using current technologies  Most major rivers in the world have been dammed for electricity and water storage  Those that remain are still open because of geopolitical disagreement and may stay that way  Nuclear is clean and efficient but terrifies too many people to be depended upon to meet future requirements  Solar and wind have stalled in numerous locations  either because of significantly higher expense or failure to provide steady energy 
So here is where we stand as of now  despite the War on Coal  it is still the most used source of energy around the globe  Oil is barely increasing in usage  but natural gas is starting to take off 

That leaves coal  oil and natural gas as the 3 biggest contributors to a world seeking more and more energy  I consider all of them to be  batteries   Nature s Batteries  if you will  They are the result of eons of birth  life and death  In that sense they  too  are biomass   in its most concentrated form  Markets will fluctuate  these three do not march in lockstep  But as long as they are relatively close to each other in price for each BTU of energy produced  I believe most rational people  and the occasional rational government  if such a thing exists  will opt for the cleanest fuel they can depend upon to be available in sufficient quantity for their use  And that fuel is natural gas  by a country mile 
Most charts you find on the Internet are outdated before they are posted  Worse  most of them are undated  even when you do the sleuthing to find where it was originally published  The one below is as close to accurate as I can determine by cross checking numerous reliable sources but  by itself  it doesn t begin to tell the whole story  For instance  you might look at the exceptionally high amount of natural gas reserves in Russia and conclude you d best rush out and buy Gazprom  MCX GAZP    OTC GZPFY  
However  what you might want to know  before you do  is that half of those reserves are located in Western Siberia and another quarter are in the Kara and Barents Seas above the Arctic Circle  I ve been to that part of the world and I can assure you it isn t going to be cheap to get that gas  Even the Russian submarine base at Murmansk is inoperable for much of the year and building more gas production facilities will not be as high a priority 
On the other hand the failure of the EU to get the Nabucco pipeline project going  with gas from Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan  may yet make Arctic and Siberian gas the only alternative for much of Europe Then of course  in considering Gazprom  one must always consider the viciousness  xenophobia or  being kinder  the capriciousness of the current Russian leadership 

Numbers 2 and 3 in reserves  Iran and Qatar  are a whole  nuther story  I count myself as one of those in the geopolitical intelligence community completely befuddled by the recent decision to lift sanctions on the world s  1 state sponsor of terrorism  The Iranian regime was on the ropes  all we had to do was let them fall  A large plurality of the Iranian people  by and large  are disgusted with the theocracy they live under and would relish the opportunity to rejoin the world community  Maybe that day will come but until it does I imagine even the canny Persians will have difficulty getting others to trust them as their first supplier of choice  Especially when Qatar  just across the gulf a few miles  has been courting Europe for years and is more accommodating by an order of magnitude 
I ve only skimmed the surface of the possible geopolitical and economic issues  there are scores more  Which is why I plan to stick  globally  with US and European gas and oil majors for whom a renege by Russia  a revolution in Iran  or a snit in Turkmenistan would only affect part of their production and earnings  And since liquid oil can be easily transported but gas must be liquefied or pipelined  I am particularly fond of US  Canadian and Mexican gas companies  As the Founding Fathers might say  we are blessed by Providence to inhabit the continent we do and have the neighbors we have 

So  for the best global exposure  I include the chart above  You ll note the smartest kids on the block  over the past 15 years  have been moving more and more into natural gas  Exxon  XOM  bought XTO for  41 billion in 2010  Shell  NYSE RDSb  bought BG Group for  70 billion in 2016  and all the other major players have been moving in the same direction 
Just as Gazprom is building Nord Stream 2 to push Russian gas to Germany and beyond  the US has approved liquefied natural gas  LNG  exports so Exxon  Chevron  NYSE CVX  and every other US major and virtually every other US gas company  can effectively compete with Gazprom by delivering gas to the newly built LNG terminals in Poland and Lithuania 
What to Buy  What to Buy
Among the global giants  my favorites are XOM  France s Total  NYSE TOT   CVX  and RDS B which  despite some dreadful decisions to pursue elephant Arctic fields as oil prices plunged  seems to have snapped back nicely  Exxon has operations on every continent but Antarctica  but more and more  they are producing oil overseas and gas in the USA  about 2 3 of its domestic reserves are now in gas 
At one time or another  all 4 of these have been in our portfolio  I don t yet have a purchase price in mind  that will depend on  a  if I m correct and there will be another retracement this year and  b  what I see at the time in the way of the best price  We want the best companies  yes  and I believe these 4 should top the list  But if they hold like a rock and Conoco  NYSE COP  or Occidental  NYSE OXY  plunge  I d have to consider them as the more attractive purchase at the time 
Now for the next tier in terms of deep pockets  the right acreage and a successful history of turning exploration into production is of utmost importance  It takes billions of dollars today to stay in this business  A company needs deep pockets to withstand the occasional run of exploratory bad luck in order to reap the rewards of successful discovery down the road  Unlike XOM  TOT  CVX and RDS B  all of which pay dividends that pay way better than CDs or money market funds and raise those dividends regularly  these firms tend to reinvest their earnings into more production 
I think the best of the best  at the right price  include our former portfolio holdings Range Resources  NYSE RRC   Encana  NYSE ECA   Cenovus  NYSE CVE   Texas Pacific Land  NYSE TPL  and Antero Resources  NYSE AR   as well as Canadian Natural Resources  NYSE CNQ   Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN  and Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   I ve already written about the ones we ve previously held in our portfolio so I ll take this opportunity to briefly discuss CNQ  APC  DVN and SWN 
Canadian Natural Resources just became the largest natural gas producer in Canada   and that means they are bigger than some very heavy hitters  They ve done so by acquiring both wells and acreage from competitors who were anxious sellers during the oil and gas summer swoon a few months ago  Including the 2000 wells they also bought from almost major ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   CNQ now has more than 53 000 wells just in Alberta 
Because of the scale of its operations  CNQ now has a production portfolio served by some 40 000 miles of pipelines from wellhead to storage and points of sale  Coincidentally  these purchases have made CNQ the largest private owner of land in all of western Canada  CNQ is sitting on a gold mine  or at least the natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil equivalent  As for value  it is currently priced for perfection  or at least as if gas and oil prices will stay the same or increase from here  I won t buy today but I ll keep it on the first page of our Watchlist  At  32 with a 2 2  yield  not yet  But at  25 I ll nibble and at  22 I ll take a nice bite 
Anadarko is one of the biggest independent gas and oil producers in the US  with additional exploration and production in Africa  South America  Asia and New Zealand  Worldwide  natural gas makes up only about half of Anadarko s reserves  but about 90  of the new wells it drilled in the US in 2015 were gas wells 
Ever opportunistic  APC announced on September 12 that it had entered into a purchase agreement with Freeport McMoRan  NYSE FCX  for a huge chunk of FCX s deepwater Gulf of Mexico holdings  This is the way it works  one company overextends itself in the good times  then sells assets for less than they paid to smarter operators in the bad times  We ll begin disciplined buying in the  42  48 range 
Devon is an independent driller that sticks mostly to properties in the US and Canada  More than 90  of Devon s U S  reserves are in natural gas  with most of that in the Barnett Shale in Texas  DVN has been among the most aggressive of all E P firms in slashing costs early  a move that has allowed them to operate profitable even with today s current low prices  If I am correct and gas and oil prices decline in the coming weeks  strong as DVN is in the Permian Basin  it too will decline  I ll be a happy buyer between  28 and  33 
Southwestern is another independent driller that focuses exclusively on natural gas  The company has operations in Arkansas  Texas  Oklahoma and Pennsylvania  with the biggest chunk of its production coming from the Fayetteville Shale  I think SWN s stock will revisit single digits in a decline  Anytime it goes below  10   which is really close right now   we ll be waiting 
Finally  for those who just can t wait  you might want to take a position in BlackRock Energy and Resources Trust  NYSE BGR   If I m correct and gas and oil prices decline once more  BGR will decline as well  But at least this closed end fund  CEF  sells at the mid range of its 52 week discount  at  8 43  
But be careful  With closed end funds  as investor sentiment fades  the discount often widens  so the CEF can have greater leverage on the downside  The opposite is true on the upside of course so if it declines I ll bite the bullet and add to my position as the discount widens  If that event never occurs  I have a portfolio  at an 8  discount  that may lose or lessen the discount and will follow the prices of a really nice gas and oil company portfolio

Commentary The relief rally continued on Tuesday and once again put on a picture perfect performance that is hard to make up  Over the last two days  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   achieved a bracketed rally  the index from a dead stop on Friday at support at its 200 day moving average  DMA  to a dead stop Tuesday at resistance at its 50DMA 

The S P 500  SPY  tapped on 50MDA resistance before closing with a 0 4  gain 
The S P 500 now faces a very critical test  The index has stayed mostly trapped below 50DMA resistance since the big support breakdown in early September 
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  did its own dance with 50DMA resistance  Accordingly  a major downtrend in my favorite technical indicator now faces a major test 

T2108 remains stuck in a primary downtrend in place since July  it peaked in February  
These are ominous tests of resistance given they occurred on the eve of results of the contentious U S  Presidential election  The volatility index  the VIX  added to the suspense  although the stock market rallied for the day  the VIX stayed exactly flat and well above the 15 35 pivot line  This positioning means the VIX remains poised to soar at the slightest provocation 

The VIX refused to budge at the close after dipping and rallying 


ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  dropped 6 7  although the VIX stayed flat  UVXY looks ready for its regularly scheduled visit with all time lows 
Despite the ominous set up  I am leaving the short term trading call at bullish  I am poised to buy the dips  including any post election sell off  Still  I sold a handful of positions that I bought to play  
Most importantly  I locked in profits on call options for Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   I kept the call spread on Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  
Freeport McMoran  FCX  soared well above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  on its way to a 7 1  gain 
Copper has been on a tear recently    This rally was another element of the bullish divergence in recent days that I actually missed  Now  I daresay copper  and FCX in particular  are getting over extended given the overall global economic environment  Still  FCX is in breakout mode  so I am prepared to buy the dips as long as 50 and 200DMA support hold 
The one market darling I failed to buy ahead of this rally was Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOG   Ironically  it is the one of the darlings that recovered from a recent breakdown 

Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   GOOG  is still down post earnings  but it has closed two days in a row above 50DMA support 
Now  having said all this  I am typing as early elections results are indicating that  at a minimum  a Hillary Clinton victory for U S  President will be a LOT closer than anyone with a poll imagined   At some point  the polling industry will have to be called so much voodoo   
Asian stock markets have sold off heavily  and futures in the U S  are dumping  My favorite currency indicator of sentiment in financial markets says it all  The Australian dollar  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   is cratering against the Japanese yen  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY    Suddenly  the 200DMA for AUD JPY looks like resistance all over again 
AUD JPY rallied in support of bullish sentiment earlier in the day  The election ruined THAT with a quickness 
With the market seemingly anticipating a Trump win  and AUD JPY trading well below its lower BB  I decided to take profits  These gains are small solace relative to the thumping my long dollar positions are taking 

EUR USD perked back up and plowed through 200DMA resistance 
Per my strategy that I have discussed on precious metals  I did start loading up on call options on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  as it retested 200DMA support on Monday  Maybe that position will at least see gains tomorrow 
As 50DMA resistance bears down on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX   the uptrending 200DMA continues to provide support  A MAJOR breakout breakdown is on its way 
As I said in the last T2108 Update  it is time to brace for surprises  Traders should step cautiously and take the action one day  one step at a time

CommentaryLast week  I pointed out the weakness of the S P 500 s bounce from near oversold levels  The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   still looks feeble as it continues to look uninterested in breaking through critical overhead resistance at its 50 day moving average  DMA   The index is effectively meandering it way into the latest earnings season 

The S P 500  SPY  remains capped by the now declining 50DMA   6 weeks and running 
Perhaps we should just expect the current trading range to stay in place until the U S  Presidential election gets resolved in two weeks 
  my favorite technical indicator  took its biggest fall in almost two weeks  it dropped from 43 2  to 37 8   T2108 also looks like it is under the spell of 50DMA resistance 

T2108 looks set to make a run at oversold conditions again after its 50DMA once again delivers stiff resistance 
As the weeks wear on  the divergence between the sagging T2108 and a stubbornly resilient S P 500 becomes ever more striking  If a selling catalyst arrives  it should deliver quite a wallop to the stock market 
The volatility index  the VIX  perked up on Tuesday  The VIX produced its first gain in six trading days  The complacency going into earnings is also quite striking 

The volatility index looks ready to defend the recent floor 
Of course  low volatility does not leave individual stocks off the hook  The most striking post earnings sell off on the day was Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   The stock lost 10 8  in what was described as   WHR s gap down confirmed a double top and the converged 50 and 200DMAs as resistance 

By closing at a new post Brexit low  WHR confirmed a double top 
This drop is full of irony  In the immediate wake of Brexit  I pointed to WHR as a shorting opportunity  I doubted that 200DMA support would hold at that time  The 200DMA did indeed break down the very next day  However  I had to back off quickly after WHR rushed to reassure investors that all was well  As a reminder   at the time 

 The Company regularly performs risk assessments as part of the operational planning cycle and has prepared for either outcome of the vote  In the past  the Company has utilized a variety of approaches to manage volatility  including financial hedging  The Company plans to execute a previously announced cost based price increase in the third quarter and expects to continue with strong ongoing cost productivity programs to lower overall costs in the EMEA region 
 As we have done in the past in all markets  we are prepared to take swift actions to offset the negative impact to our EMEA operations   Fettig added   We will continue to monitor the situation closely to determine if additional actions may be required   

The stock gapped up over 4  on this news and rallied nearly non stop right through July earnings  By that time  Brexit seemed like a distant  bad  memory  The word  Brexit  only made it ONCE in that earnings call and not until the Q A session  from   

 And as you also know the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated  but obviously particularly post Brexit  the decline has been significant and it has a significant effect on our margins  

WHR management went on multiple times to reassure investors that cost based price increases would compensate for margin impacts  The warning sign came one week after earnings when WHR s rally came to a halt right at the 2016 high made in April ahead of a poorly received earnings report  The stock sold off for a month straight and then resumed after an unfavorable ruling form the World Trade Organization  WTO   The latest earnings report indicated that WHR s price hikes failed to address the post Brexit problem of a collapsed currency  from   

 Consistent with what we ve seen since the Brexit decision  currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the UK remained soft  causing our previously announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated  

WHR named three main headwinds   all reportedly resolvable in the near future 

 There are exactly three moving pieces which we referred to  we had a temporary slowdown in U S  demand  we had a promotional environment in washers  and the Brexit related impact  We don t have any other issues going on  these three  By definition  some of that drag we expect also in Q4 even to a less extent  So we do see a slight recovery of U S  demand in Q4  not as bad as in Q3  The promotional environment in U S  it s probably going to last in Q4 but not beyond  The U K  will be less but still somewhat impact in Q4  so that s from a macro level  

Judging from the market s response  investors are not believing the relatively sanguine assessment this time around  I want to short WHR here with a tight stop on a post earnings close that exceeds Tuesday s intraday high  or even tighter above the open around  156  
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  was also in focus for its post earnings reaction  CAT initially rallied on results that included reduced 2016 guidance and news that 2017 would be little better 
I decided to play the intraday momentum with a limit order on November call options  It executed  but I soon had buyer s remorse as a swell of selling took CAT down for the count  The stock even briefly cracked its 50DMA support  With a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze building  CAT could be in for significant downside from here if support gives way 

Caterpillar is teetering on 50DMA support with an abrupt post earnings fade 
I still have my eye on Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  and its slow motion test of recent support  With the stock jumping off 200DMA support with a 3 6  post earnings gain  the stage may finally be set for FCX to travel at least to the top of its near year long trading range 
Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  has held close to a 200DMA support line that is now pointing upward  The post earnings gap up likely confirmed that this support will hold  Is a trip to  13 or higher next 
This earnings cycle  I am entirely focused on post earnings reactions as opposed to pre earnings setups  So  next up is Apple  NASDAQ AAPL

16712,238227,FCX,5 Stocks To Watch On Icahn   Paulson s Gain From Trump Win,opinion,"Major U S  benchmarks witnessed a remarkable rebound from their pre market losses on Wednesday to log gains of more than 1  after Donald Trump was declared victorious in the Presidential election  Trump s pledge of expanding infrastructure spending and promise of reducing corporate taxes played an important role in boosting investor sentiment  Banking on the rebound  popular activist investors  Carl Icahn and John Paulson emerged as one of the biggest gainers 
These two billionaires had played an active role in Trump s presidential campaign  While Icahn was one of the main supporters of Trump in the race to the Presidential election since Sep 2015  Trump included John Paulson as one of the key members in his economic advisory team 
In this scenario  it will be interesting to discuss stocks that helped these billionaire investors to reap huge returns during yesterday s trading  But before going into the discussion let s have a look at yesterday s best performing sectors as it played an important role in boosting portfolio returns of both Icahn and Paulson 
Sectors that Gained the Most on Trump s Victory
Financials
Strong gains in financial  healthcare and industrial emerged as the major catalysts in boosting the U S  equity markets yesterday  Meanwhile  a significant decline in bond demand following Trump s win led yields on treasury bills to surge to their highest levels since January  Yields on 10 year and 30 year treasury bills jumped to nearly 2 07  and 2 86   respectively  Also  10 year yield registered the biggest jump since Aug  11  2011 
This indicates that investors are confident about the fact the President Trump may succeed to fuel inflation along with economic growth during his tenure  which in turn may result in a rise in key interest rates  This had a positive impact on financial sectors  Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  and Financial Services Select Sector SPDR  XLFS  jumped 4 3  and 4 1   respectively 
Healthcare 
Hillary Clinton s defeat played an important role in boosting the healthcare sector  It was speculated that Clinton s strong intention to control high drug prices would have significantly affected the sector s performance if the election results went in her favor  The popular biotech ETF  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  jumped 8 9   witnessing the biggest one day gain since 2008  Moreover  Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV  emerged as one the biggest winners among the broader S P 500 sectors by gaining more than 3 5  
Industrials
Last but not least  it was the industrials sector  whose strong gains also played a significant role in boosting the U S  stock markets on the big day  Expectations of a significant expansion in infrastructure spending throughout the country as promised by Trump during his campaign led industrial stocks to register healthy gains 
Also  in his victory speech  Trump indicated that infrastructure will be one of the major priorities during his presidency  He said   We re going to rebuild our infrastructure  which will become  by the way  second to none  And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it   Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLI  registered 2 5  gain during yesterday s trading 
Stocks that Boosted Icahn   Paulson s Portfolios
Among others  two prominent Trump supporters  Icahn and Paulson look to have gained the most after Trump became the 45th President of the U S  While Paulson remained one of the active members in Trump s economy advisory team  it was reported that Icahn was offered the position of Treasury secretary under Trump s administration  which was however refused by the billionaire  In an interview  Ichan said   I don t think I d be the right guy to fit into Washington  you know  I m not an establishment guy  
Icahn s Gains 
His refusal of course wasn t a deterrent for the huge gains he registered yesterday  According to a report  Icahn s portfolio earned him over  700 million on the day 
CVR Energy  Inc    NYSE CVI   was the biggest winner among holdings in the portfolio  Shares of CVR Energy  which has 5 4  of the portfolio assets allocated in it  as of Aug 18  2016   jumped nearly 24 1   The surge helped Icahn s portfolio to make more than  219 million   
Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX    which takes the fifth spot in terms of asset allocation at 5 7   also registered healthy gains as prices of copper reached 52 week high levels  An 8 1  gain in shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company helped Icahn to take in around  100 million 
American International Group  Inc  s   NYSE AIG   shares also gained  boosting Icahn s portfolio  American International Group takes the second spot in the portfolio at 11 9   The Zacks Rank  3 insurer earned him nearly  65 million yesterday following its 2 4  gain  You can see 
Paulson s Winning Bets
Though Icahn s huge gain came on the back of impressive performances of stocks across multiple sectors  Paulson s gain was primarily led by well performing healthcare stocks  Paulson   Co  hedge fund took in above  463 million on Wednesday 
Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   was one of the biggest winners among Paulson s portfolio holdings  Shares of this Zacks Rank  3 company  which takes the second spot in terms of asset allocation at 8 7   as of Feb 17  2016   jumped nearly 11 5   The increase helped Paulson s portfolio to make about  100 million 
Allergan plc    NYSE AGN    which takes the first spot in the portfolio at 11 9   also gained significantly  benefiting the portfolio  An 8 7  gain in shares of this Zacks Rank  3 company helped Paulson to take in around  68 million

16714,238229,FCX,The Week Ahead  Are Stocks Ready For Stronger Economic News ,opinion,"It is  ahem  a very big week for new data  The A teams are back from their mini vacations  ready to take a fresh look at the new world  While some will continue to work the Trump Administration stock theme  it remains mostly guesswork  There is a new theme  which markets and pundits will get around to  perhaps as soon as this week  With a tone change on the economy and deficits  I expect the punditry to be asking 
Can the market embrace some good news  
Last Week
Once again  last week s light calendar of economic news was nearly all good  but not the focus of discussion 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted special attention to the Trump stimulus plan and how it might be financed  Must of the week s discussion was about possible cabinet appointments and the policy implications  but spending and taxation got plenty of attention  It was a s good a guess as any 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  He captures the continuing rally and the move to new highs 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
Personal Note
I am taking a few days off  so there will be no WTWA next week 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
This week s news was quite good  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good 
Rail traffic is improving reports   The story is even better if you remove coal and grain 
Technical indicators are strong  Our own technical models remain strongly bullish  Noted technician John Murphy  via   has this comment 

 There is little doubt that the market s trend is still higher  The fact that it s being led higher by economically sensitive stock groups like energy  materials  industrials  small caps  and transports is a sign of strength  The fact that tech stocks are starting to strengthen is also a positive sign  


Chemical activity shows continuing strength   monitors this indicator  which seems to lead industrial production 
Durable goods rebounded nicely to an increase of 4 8  
Existing home sales were strong at 5 6M SAAR  beating expectations  Calculated Risk  that the results do not reflect the recent higher mortgage rates 
Michigan sentiment beat expectations moving to 93 8  Doug Short has a  

The Bad 
New home sales fell on an annualized basis  The decline included both multi and single family residences  Calculated Risk   Please compare the measured response here and above on existing home sales 
 Mortgage rates moved above 4      
Trucking is still declining  but the rate seems lower   reviews the mixed picture 
The Ugly Beautiful 
At some point  I need to do an update on last week s  Fake News  ugly award  There is a good cyberspace discussion  but that can wait 
As I occasionally do  I want to focus on the positive for a change  Bill McBride of Calculated Risk had an encouraging Thanksgiving post    Read the whole post  but here is one that might surprise you   household debt levels 

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to Jon Krinsky of MKM Partners  with a big assist from Josh Brown  There is a consensus that countries are racing to debase currencies in  beggar thy neighbor  policies  The stronger dollar certainly reduces earnings for some companies  especially if they do not do any currency hedging  The flip side gets no attention  Josh writes  There is zero evidence of a long term correlation between stocks and the dollar  

The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have the data avalanche that we often see when the first two days of the new month are at the end of the week  This quirk of the calendar makes this the biggest week of the year for data 
The  A  List 
Employment report  F   Expectations are a little lower for the data markets see as most important 
Consumer confidence  T   A good concurrent read on spending and employment 
ISM index  Th   Still modest growth in this widely followed measure 
Auto sales  Th   Important sector  private data  and not a survey  What more could you want 
ADP private employment  W   Deserves more respect as an alternative to the  official  data 
Personal income and spending  W   Important economic growth indicator  Will strength continue 
Beige book  W   Provides descriptive color for FOMC participants  and occasionally some policy insight 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Construction spending  Th   Rebound expected in this important sector 
GDP second estimate  T   Somewhat  old news  but still the base for the ultimate measure of economic growth 
Chicago PMI  W   Most important of the regional surveys  with some predictive power for ISM 
Pending home sales  W   Less direct impact than new construction  but a good read on the housing market 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 


For those who missed it during the holiday shortened week  Fedspeak is back  We could also get big news out of the oil production talks between OPEC and non OPEC members 
Next Week s Theme
This will be a big week for news  and it might also be for stocks and bonds  For a long time  the market reaction has been entirely Fed focused  If the economy looked better  the Fed would start raising rates  If it looked worse  the Fed was expected to help  Whatever the reason  the tone has now changed  Economic data have been better  and there is more optimism  There is growing acceptance of higher interest rates  The market seems untroubled  so far  by the rate move and the strength in the dollar 
While few remarked on the tone change last week  I expect it to get more attention in the week ahead  especially if economic data remains strong  It will leave us wondering   Can the market finally celebrate good news 
This is a multi part theme prediction  We do not know that the data strength will continue  We do not know what the FedSpeak comments will be  And finally  we do not know how markets will react  We have a clue about how the political world will react  via Charles Kirk  

 I m getting a real kick out of how so many Republicans have gone from bear to bull on US economy overnight and how many Democrats have done the opposite    Patrick Chovanec

This change will be reflected in comments from the punditry this week 
As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thoughts

The increased yield on the 10 Year note has lowered the risk premium a bit  I suspect much more to come  By this I mean that the relative attractiveness of stocks and bonds will continue to narrow

Urban Camel at The Fat Pitch analyzes recession forecasts based upon the Presidential Cycle  a popular current theme  This is a great article   A Silver Bullet candidate at least   Here is a key quote 

More to the point  there are better ways to forecast the next recession than counting months on a calendar or focusing on changes in the presidency  How 


By monitoring changes in the macro data  A persistent slow down in retail sales  housing consumption  employment growth and other macro indicators will likely be a better method for indicating when a recession is becoming more likely  This is the stuff that matters most  the calendar and presidential terms are demonstrably inadequate on their own  Our regular commentary on the macro environment can be found  

This is very good advice to the recession worrywarts

Top Trading Advice 
Brett Steenbarger keeps on bringing it  day after day  His posts are a must read for traders  but often have broader scope  If you are trying to perform well at anything  Dr  Brett can help you  My  was about a movie featuring young drummers  It is often helpful to go outside of your own world  take an objective perspective  and then look for the lessons 
Adam H  Grimes has a good explanation of   I find that most people consistently over estimate volatility  perhaps goaded by the CNBC reports of  triple digit moves  and a 50 point bounce since the lows  These are both basically meaningless unless you are trading a very large short term position 
Bill Luby discusses common misperceptions about the VIX  This is a great example of those who need to use Adam Grimes  spreadsheet 

You can always tell when the crowd gets long the VIX and ends up on the wrong side of the trade   The VIX is broken   becomes an oft repeated refrain  as does  The markets are rigged   and the usual list of exhortations from those who are in denial  The current line of thinking is that the world must be much more dangerous  risky and uncertain as a result of a Trump victory  yet the VIX is actually down 31 4  since the election   ipso facto the VIX is broken 

The VIX is a market measure  not something readily rigged  If you disagree  you are simply on the wrong side of the market 
Insight for Investors 
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Michael Batnick s post    The question is the new all time highs in stocks  I know from experience that the average investor sees this as some sort of warning  Instead of interpreting prices in context  they see a chart or a range and expect mean reversion 
Michael looks at data since 1928  How many new market highs do you suppose have been made since then  How many this year  The answers are 1134 and 11  I suspect that few would come close in their guesses  18  of all months have closed at all time highs  Here is what happens after a new high 


The time after a new high is nothing special   and nothing to worry about

Value Investing 
The rebound of the value approach continues   the most recent evidence 

Watch out for  
The bond market  The Brooklyn Investor compares bonds and stocks over a long period  The analysis reveals the shortcoming in measures like the Shiller P E  which consider neither interest rates nor inflation  There are many helpful charts  but here are some examples 


I am always baffled at comments like   The market has averaged a P E ratio of 14x for the last 100 years so the stock market is 40  overvalued at 20x   
How can you compare 14x P E to the current level without discussing interest rates  And if you think stocks should trade at 14x P E today  then you should also think that interest rates should be much higher than they are now  For example  the 10 year bond rate averaged 4 6  since 1871 and 5 8  since 1950  But these periods include a time when interest rates were not set by the market 

And also this 

1955 2014 


Interest rate range average P E


4   6  23 3x 6   8  19 6x


I looked at the data from 1955 2014  adding one more year to update this isn t going to change much  to see what the average P E ratios were when interest rates were in certain ranges 
From the above  we see that the market traded at an average P E of 23 3x when interest rates were between 4  and 6   The 10 year now is at 2 3   So we have a long  long way to go for interest rates to threaten the stock market  at least in terms of the bond yield earnings yield model 

Final Thoughts 
If you want to analyze a change  you need to know when it starts  Here is part of an example from my causal modeling classes 
When does change start  
When the new Captain orders a change in course 
When the crew knows the new Captain will order a change 
When the crew knows the new Captain  but not whether he will order a change 
When the crew knows there will be new Captain who might order a change 
When the crew knows there might be a new Captain 
I am sure you get the idea  The methods that track the market under various Presidents have many problems  but the starting and ending points are especially important  There are no new Trump policies  We are all still guessing about what they might be 
And yet   there has been a definite change in tone  Economic strength has a lot to do with confidence   the willingness to invest and to spend  A divided government had many dysfunctional consequences  especially repeated issues about the debt limit and spending on crucial programs  We can expect less of that  There will also be a very different reaction to economic data  the political rhetoric that blinded investors will be reduced 
The generalized Fed theory will have less traction  Those who have been wrong about the market for years have used the   With interest rates rising and the economy improving  that story must change 
The emphasis on commodity prices as an economic indicator  most prominently by the ECRI  is also proving wrong  as is the impact of a stronger dollar 
This is not an endorsement of specific Trump policies  It is the reality of moving out of the election environment   at least for a year or so  This week s data avalanche could be the first real test of this new attitude ",2016-11-27,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-are-stocks-ready-for-stronger-economic-news-200166711,200166711

The Federal Reserve struck a somewhat dovish tone in its statement  as it reiterated the need to increase interest rates gradually while it maintained its view of three rate hikes  with the remaining two rate hikes expected later this year 
U S  equities spiked on the release of the interest rate decision  as market participants viewed the unchanged rate hike path  as a signal that the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to raise rates rapidly

16796,238311,FCX,Dow slides for 8th day as  Trump trade  takes a breather,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks closed mostly lower on Monday  as investors mulled over President Trump s ability to push through key proposals  which include tax reform  after the healthcare bill was dropped on Friday 
In what was quiet day on the economic calendar  the U S  House of Representatives  decision to withdraw a healthcare bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on Friday remained front and center 
Investors eased off the  Trumpflation trade   which had pushed U S equities to all time highs in February  based on Trump s promise to introduce pro growth policies  as worries mounted that the healthcare bill setback could weigh on the success of Trump s pro growth policies being passed 
Hospital stocks offered investors some respite  as the proposed healthcare bill to replace Obamacare was viewed as a threat to hospitals and physicians  as it would have significantly reduce the number of Americans with health insurance 
Meanwhile  President Trump moved on from the setback as he rolled back more Obama era regulations  after signing four bills that reverse rules on education  land use and federal purchasing

As a result  the volatility index  VIX  managed its first higher close above the 15 35 pivot in two months  The VIX gained 17 7  although it still faded a bit from its high of the day The volatility index  the VIX  has not closed this high since June 28th
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  dropped closer to oversold territory  20    My favorite technical indicator closed at 29 3  and dropped as low as 26 8   For reference  in the immediate aftermath of Brexit  T2108 s lowest close was at 27 5   and it traded as low as 24 5  
As a reminder  these levels are often  close enough  to the oversold level of 20   So sellers have made a convincing case to push the stock market into oversold territory  In preparation  I am giving bullish positions more serious consideration even as I still look to fade rallies  The short term trading call stays at neutral

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM  After rallying convincingly off 50DMA support to start the week  EEM gapped right back down into a 50DMA breakdown  I went ahead and used this second trip to close out my put options  With expiration on Friday  I am less interested in trying to hold out for further declines  I will be looking for future fade opportunities or go back to my more typical strangle play  calls and options  
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  is breaking down 
As I rushed to close out my bearish position on EEM  I locked in profits on several other bearish positions  I considered Tuesday s sell off as a  second chance  albeit at slightly worse prices given the time decay from Friday to Tuesday  My next question is whether any of my new bullish positions will pay off this week as I anticipate more relief rallies out of these near oversold trading conditions  I added Google  NASDAQ GOOG  call options to that mix 
Finally  I have not thrown up a chart of the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  in quite a while  AUD JPY in particular is holding recent lows  The currency pair specifically diverged from the day s selling in a potential sign of an imminent return of buyers and a  risk on  market move

16803,238318,FCX,Big Trouble For Copper  The Breakdown Of The Industry Has Begun,opinion,"The king of base metals is in big trouble as indicators point to a breakdown of the global copper industry  This goes well beyond the typical  slowdown  or  downturn  in the copper market  Instead  we are going to witness what I refer to as  Copper Industry Carnage  
While some readers may feel as if I am being a bit  doom and gloomy  here  the situation in the global copper industry is much worse than most analysts realize  This is due to the fact that many analysts are forecasting copper supply deficits in the next few years  which would push the price of copper higher 
Unfortunately  this sort of industry analysis is well behind the curve or even worse  guilty of wishful thinking  The world economy is slowing down  and this will likely pick up speed by the end of the year  Which means  demand for copper will continue to weaken  pushing prices even lower 
Today  the price of copper is down 2   impacting the copper miners  Freeport s stock price was hammered lower by over 7  today in market trading 
Low copper prices are already causing damage in the top two copper mining companies in the world  The second largest copper producer  Freeport McMoran  suffered an adjusted income loss of  214 million in the first half of 2016  Part of the loss was due to their lousy shale oil and gas investments 
For some stupid reason  many base metal mining companies jumped into the oil and gas business with both feet when the shale energy bonanza took off in the United States  For example  BHP Billiton  LON BLT  reported a hefty  7 2 billion impairment  write off  on its onshore shale oil and gas assets last year  for their year ending Q2 2016  
While that may seem like one hell of a lot of money for BHP Billiton to write off on its shale oil and gas assets  Freeport McMoRan did one even better  According to FreePort McMoRan s annual report  they reported a staggering  13 billion impairment on their oil and gas properties in 2015 on top of another  3 7 billion write off in 2014 
As they say  easy come  easy go 
So  not only are the big base metal miners suffering from low base metal prices  they are also enjoying a wonderful shale oil and gas enema from the other end  I don t mean to be harsh here  but who on earth was in charge of making these lousy shale energy investment decisions for these base metal mining companies  
And it gets even worse  I just read this jewel of an article yesterday on the Financial Times   

Five years after BHP Billiton plunged  20bn into the US shale revolution  the wait goes on for shareholders 
Even if oil prices rally by one third the fields will not generate significant free cash flow until the turn of the decade  the mining company cum oil producer revealed at investor briefings last week 
    BHP s acquisition of two US shale producers in 2011 was followed by  17bn of investment  beefing up an oil business that has long set the world s most valuable mining company apart from its peers  About one third of BHP s group earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation have come from petroleum over the past five years 
The timing of its shale bet proved ill judged  Following a savage market downturn that has seen oil prices more than halve  BHP has racked up  12bn of impairments and the US shale business is now valued at just  12 6bn  Output is expected to fall by a quarter this year  the consequence of a much reduced drilling programme 

So  the Einsteins at BHP Billiton acquired U S  shale oil and gas assets that are now only worth  12 6 billion  after they racked up  12 billion of impairment losses since 2011  Furthermore  even if the oil price increases by one third  they won t generate any significant free cash flow until 2020 
Warning to BHP Billiton shareholders    GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN 
I tell ya  it is amazing to see supposedly savvy businessmen in high dollar suits making these sort of insane investment decisions 
Okay  let s get back to the destruction of the copper mining industry 
The First Sign of the Gutting Of The Copper Mining Industry
The first sign of the gutting of the copper mining industry is taking place as Chile s mining truck purchases collapse  This is bad news as Chile is the largest copper producer in the world  Chile produced 5 7 million tons of copper in 2015  way ahead of the second ranked country  China  that mined 1 6 million tons 
According to a report by the Chilean Copper Commission  new mining truck sales fell to a low of 40 units in 2015  down from a peak of 392 in 2012  As you can see  this is not a slowdown  Rather  truck purchases have fallen off a cliff 

We have to go all the way back to 2004 to see a unit number that low  Even with the huge downturn in the global markets in 2009  Chile still imported 122 new mining trucks that year  more than triple the figure for 2015 
Why is this such a big deal  I took the total number of new trucks imported  purchased  by Chile and compared it to the annual average price of copper 

There seems to be a correlation between the copper price and new truck purchases by the Chilean Copper Industry  When the price of copper fell to  1 34 a pound in 2009  Chile still imported three times more new mining trucks that year than in 2015  when the copper price was double   2 70   Sadly  Chile s new mining truck purchases are down 90  from their peak in 2012 
Of course  there were new projects coming online to justify some of the large number of truck purchases in 2011 and 2012  However  Chile s copper production has only increased from 5 4 million tons in 2010 to 5 7 million tons in 2015  Would a 5  increase in Chile s total copper production justify the need for 322 new trucks in 2011 and 392 new units in 2012  
Regardless  demand for new mining trucks in Chile has fallen 90  from its peak just a few years ago I would imagine new truck sales in 2016 will likely be even weaker  This is not a good sign for the largest copper producer in the world 
The Top Copper Mining Companies Are Getting Hammered
As I mentioned in the beginning of the article  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  suffered a  214 million adjusted income loss in the first half of 2016  That s pretty bad because  adjusted  income removes many items  such as impairments  from the bottom line to arrive at figure that represents a more realistic day to day cost of mining copper 
For example  Freeport also suffered an additional  4 billion impairment on its shale oil and gas assets in the first half of 2016  So  if we add that to the  13 billion of shale asset impairments last year  Freeport has racked up a cool  17 billion in shale asset write downs in just a year and a half 
Maybe it would have been a good idea for the management at Freeport to stick with mining copper  rather than blowing big money on the U S  Shale Oil   Gas Black Hole 
If we look at Freeport McMoran s free cash flow for the past eight years  something is dreadfully wrong now  For a quick refresher  free cash flow comes from deducting CAPEX  capital expenditures  from their cash from operations 

Here we can see that 2010 and 2011 were good years for Freeport as they enjoyed  4 8 and  4 billion respectively in positive free cash flow  However  this took a turn for the worse in 2014 as free cash flow turned negative to the tune of  1 5 billion  then doubled in 2015 to a negative of  3 1 billion 
Even though some of that negative free cash flow can be blamed on losses from their shale oil and gas assets  liabilities  haha   the majority of Freeport s revenues are from copper and metal mining  For example  of the  15 8 billion in Freeport s net revenues in 2015  only  1 9 billion was from U S  shale oil and gas proceeds 
While the change in Freeport s balance sheet to negative free cash flow in the past two years is not a good sign  the situation is even worse when we add in their dividends  From 2013 2015  Freeport paid out nearly  5 billion in dividends  Thus  they forked out  8 8 billion more during the past three years than the cash they made from operations 
Now  if we look at the largest copper producing company in the world  their results aren t any better  In the first quarter of 2016  Chile s Codelco mining company reported a  125 million net income loss  This loss is purely on producing copper as Codelco doesn t have any U S  shale oil or gas assets 
According to Codelco s financial highlights on their website  they enjoyed a  7 4 billion pre tax profit in 2012   3 8 billion in 2013 and  3 billion in 2014  However  things turned south in 2015 as they suffered a  1 4 billion pre tax loss that year 
Coledco produced 1 9 million tons of copper in 2015  while Freeport came in second at 1 5 million tons  So  the two top mining companies that produced 3 4 million tons of copper in 2015  didn t really make any money  And it looks like 2016 will be even less fun for these large copper miners
The global copper mining industry is getting ready to face some serious hard times  Again  the falling copper price and the financial trouble taking place in the world s top copper producers is not the typical market correction awaiting a turnaround in the global economy  Rather the copper industry is heading towards a disintegration to a much smaller size 
Unfortunately  investors and analysts who continue to believe the situation will recover in the global economy  will lose a lot of fiat money holding onto these copper and base metal mining companies  Even though investors should have realized something was wrong when several base metal mining companies moved into the U S  Shale Oil   Gas Ponzi  and lost a lot of money  they will continue to hold onto these stocks as we enter into the next phase  the Copper Industry Carnage ",2016-10-14,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-trouble-for-copper:-the-breakdown-of-the-industry-has-begun-200158730,200158730
16804,238319,FCX,Technicals Overwhelm Data Fears As SPX Flirts With Oversold,opinion,"T2108 Status  30 5 T2107 Status  61 9   3 month low VIX Status  16 7General  Short term  Trading Call  neutralActive T2108 periods  Day  165 over 20   Day  21 over 30   over   Day  3 under 40   underperiod   Day  9 under 50   Day  25 under 60   Day  51 under 70 
Commentary In my last T2108 Update  I expressed reluctance to switch the short term trading call from neutral to bearish despite the darkening clouds looming over the stock market  I think Thursday s trading action validated my hesitation 
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   successfully tested support at the September low 


The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   follows through on its breakdown below support at its 50 day moving average  DMA   The tech laden index bounced back from over extended conditions below the lower Bollinger Band  BB  
The S P 500 and the NASDAQ both dropped below their respective lower Bollinger Bands  BBs  as sellers followed through on the previous day s pressure  The S P 500 retested its September low  As usual  sellers came up short  buyers were able to recover all post open losses and a little more  These moves formed a type of bottoming hammer pattern  Now the baton goes back to buyers to prove they can follow through  If they succeed  I will assume a sustainable bottom is in place especially for the S P 500 
  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  provides a good way to understand today s action  T2108 dropped as low as 25 5   The low just barely broke the September low and stopped short of the June  post Brexit  low  This action brought T2108  close enough  to oversold  20   
Similar to what I described as a possibility in the last T2108 Update  this action was  close enough  to oversold  20   to bring in a rush of buyers  The odds of a bounce were greatly increased with the major indices trading well below their lower BBs 
T2108 loses ground but manages a small victory with a sharp bounce away from the oversold threshold  Compare to the last two similar visits 
Note that buyers are not yet in the clear  The volatility index  the VIX  held onto a gain for the day and remains above the 15 35 pivot 
The volatility index is still poised for more upside despite the fade from the highs 
With T2108 dropping into the mid 20s  I grabbed a fistful of call options on QQQ and added another limit order in case T2108 managed to drop to or into oversold territory  I am saving a play on SPY call options for a play on official oversold conditions  if they occur   I locked in the profits on the QQQ calls in the middle of the bounce  I am focused on long opportunities until unless the S P 500 approaches retests 50DMA resistance 
At the start of trading  media outlets blamed the selling on rate hike fears and poor data from China  The following screen capture comes from search cache 
Headline writers went to the well to pull out some tried and true explanations for market action 
At the close  with buyers taking the baton  headlines shifted to a rise in oil as the savior of the day  For example  from CNBC     
None of these explanations made much sense given action elsewhere in the market  For example  if the market really feared the poor Chinese export import data  then the Australian dollar  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   should not have rallied going into the U S  open and throughout most of it  perhaps it was a leading indicator of the coming bounce   
Australia heavily depends on exports to China  The 15 minute chart of AUD USD shows an overnight bottom around 3am Eastern  AUD USD was off to the races from there until 2pm Eastern  As I type  AUD USD is taking off again as part of what has become another bounce off 200DMA  up trending  support 
Did someone say the Australian dollar is selling off because of poor Chinese economic data  Then buy 
Support at the 200DMA was much more important on the day than any fundamental news 
At the close of U S  trading  the odds of a rate hike in December and subsequent months DECLINED  This drop is hardly the mark of NEW rate fears that could drive more selling  According to   the odds of a December hike dropped all the way from 69 5  to 65 6  
Finally  attributing the bounce to oil is essentially attributing the bounce to the closest thing within reach that is also going up  Check out this comparison of the S P 500 and United States Oil  NYSE USO  using a 5 minute chart  I cannot tell who is following whom in this picture   not to mention USO flatlined going into the close while the S P 500 drifted a bit downward 

SPY  black line and grey body  dips at the open and rallies most of the day  USO seems content to trundle alongside except for one large momentary dip in the morning 
Sometimes it is easier to just blame the technicals 
Since China and rate fears were the presumed reason for the selling  I kept checking on commodity related names all day  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  is of increasing interest  FCX finally closed below its 200DMA for the first time since April  More importantly  the stock is teetering at the bottom of a trading range extending to about March  Once I pull the trigger on more bullish trades  FCX will be at the top of the list as a play back to at least 50DMA resistance 

Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  is undergoing a very critical test of support after breaking down below its 200DMA 
Teucrium Corn  NYSE CORN  ignored all the noise of the day and rallied solidly to reverse ALL of the previous day s gains and then some  This move almost confirmed a bottom is in place and solidified the 50DMA as support  I need to see just one more day of confirmation 

Teucrium Corn ETF  CORN  rallies hard with a 3 1  gain  It finally looks ready for launch 
Daily T2108 vs the S P 500

Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes

16805,238320,FCX,Freeport McMoRan  FCX  Q3 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Freeport McMoRan  Inc    NYSE FCX   is slated to release third quarter 2016 results ahead of the bell on Oct 25 
Last quarter  the mining company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 100   Freeport has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the four trailing quarters  while missing in two  with an average negative surprise of 20 45  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Watch For
Freeport is taking steps to manage costs and capital spending amid a challenging operating environment  It also remains focused on deleveraging its balance sheet  partly through assets sale  Further  Freeport is investing in attractive growth projects and providing cash returns to its shareholders 
Freeport remains focused on reducing debt and enhance shareholder value  in part  through divestitures and joint venture transactions  Freeport s board has been making a strategic review of its oil and gas business to assess alternatives designed to increase value to the company s shareholders  The company s fully owned subsidiary   Freeport McMoRan Oil   Gas Inc   FM O G  recently inked an agreement with Anadarko for the sale of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico  GOM  properties for  2 billion in cash  The sale of the GOM assets will aid Freeport to cut debt and allocate resources to its core copper business  The company continues to assess its portfolio for potential future actions and aims to maintain a strong financial position  with focus on reducing debt 
Freeport also recently agreed to sell its onshore California oil and gas properties to private energy company  Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC for  742 million  including contingent consideration  The transaction  which is subject to customary closing conditions  is expected to be complete in fourth quarter 2016  Freeport does not anticipate recording a material gain or loss on the transaction  It plans to use the net cash proceeds from the transaction to repay debt 
Proceeds from the stake sale in Morenci has also allowed Freeport to deleverage its balance sheet 
Freeport also remains actively focused on managing costs  Benefits of the company s ongoing cost cutting initiatives were evident in the second quarter  manifested by a year over year decline in consolidated average unit net cash costs of copper  Freeport s copper cost guidance for 2016 reflects a considerable year over year decline in consolidated unit net cash costs  In its oil and gas business  the company also reduced production cost to  15 a barrel from  19 a barrel in the last reported quarter 
However  Freeport s copper business remains affected by the sluggish global economy and supply related issues  The slowdown in China  a major market for copper  adds to the concern  The weak copper pricing environment also poses a headwind FREEPT MC COP B Price and EPS Surprise
    Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Freeport is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Freeport is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 19 cents 
Zacks Rank  Freeport carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with a 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult  Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies in the basic materials sector you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   has an Earnings ESP of  25 71  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see 
B2Gold Corp    NYSE BTG   has an Earnings ESP of  25  and a Zacks Rank  2

16826,238341,FCX,Freeport warns of arbitration as Indonesia mining dispute escalates,news,"By Fergus Jensen and Wilda Asmarini
JAKARTA  Reuters    U S  mining giant Freeport McMoRan Inc  N FCX  warned on Monday it could take the Indonesian government to arbitration and seek damages over a contractual dispute that has halted operations at the world s second biggest copper mine 
In an escalation of the dispute  Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson also said the company s local unit had made its first layoffs since negotiations started in January over a new mining permit  and it may let go more workers this week 
The row  which centers around the sanctity of Freeport s 30 year mining contract  comes as Indonesia seeks to squeeze more revenue out of its mining industry through a shake up of regulations over foreign ownership and ore processing 
 Right now we are at an impasse with the government   Adkerson told a news conference in Jakarta 
Freeport has been at loggerheads with Indonesia over the terms of a special mining permit to replace its contract of work  after halting its exports of copper concentrate due to the new mining rules 
On Friday  the miner said it could not meet contractual obligations for copper concentrate shipments from the mine following a five week export stoppage  Last week  all work was stopped at Freeport s giant Grasberg mine in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua 
Assuming the export ban continues and operations resume at a local smelter in March  Freeport estimated its first quarter sales would be reduced by around 170 million pounds of copper and 270 000 ounces of gold  That is equal to a reduction of some 17 percent in Freeport s total first quarter copper sales and 59 percent in gold sales  the company said in a statement later on Monday 
The Gresik smelter was forced to halt operations on Jan  19 because of a labor strike 
Freeport s existing contract of work is still in place based on legal advice  according to Adkerson  and the company has notified Indonesia s mining ministry of what it says are government violations of the contract  That starts a 120 day period for the two sides to settle the dispute themselves 
 At the end of that period if this dispute is not resolved we reserve the right     to commence arbitration   Adkerson said   I sincerely hope we can find a compromise  
The company also warned of  severe unfavorable consequences for all stakeholders  if no resolution is reached 
The consequences could include  the suspension of capital investments  a significant reduction in domestic purchases of goods and services  and job losses for contractors and workers as we are forced to adjust our business costs   it said 
Adkerson said about 10 percent of the expatriate workforce was laid off on Friday  and this week  we will be releasing contract workers  
Of Freeport Indonesia s 32 000 workers  only 12 000 are employees and the rest are contractors  he said 
 BUSINESS OR LAWSUIT 
 Do they want business or a lawsuit   Indonesia s mining minister  Ignasius Jonan  asked in remarks to reporters on Monday  responding to Freeport s warning that it could take the dispute to arbitration 
The government would try to reach an agreement that  doesn t break the law and that continues to honor the contract   but failing that it could also seek arbitration  he said 
Jonan said on Saturday that going to court would be a better option than  firing workers to pressure the government  
The layoffs were not a negotiating tactic  Adkerson said  but  only to keep the business financially viable  
Adkerson said Freeport was committed to staying in Indonesia  The mine is critical for Papua  with contributions from Grasberg representing around one third of the province s economy  he said 
The chief executive of Freeport s Indonesian unit  Chappy Hakim  appointed in November to navigate through the regulatory uncertainties  resigned on Saturday  Adkerson said the company was still assessing his replacement 
Under its current contract signed in 1991  Freeport has invested  12 billion in Indonesia  But it cannot make  15 billion in additional capital investment for further development without fiscal and legal guarantees from the government  Adkerson said 
How Indonesia handles the dispute is being watched from afar  he also noted 
 Millions of U S  citizens indirectly invest in Freeport with their savings accounts and their retirement plans   Adkerson said   So what happens     will be a matter of interest for the U S  government  
He said activist shareholder Carl Icahn  who holds around 7 percent of Freeport McMoRan shares  was  very concerned about what is happening  
Grasberg was expected to produce 800 000 tonnes of copper in 2017  about 3 5 percent of global supply  said Jefferies analyst Chris LaFemina ",2017-02-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/freeport-warns-of-arbitration-as-indonesia-mining-dispute-escalates-460992,460992

16904,238419,FCX,Indonesia to temporarily exempt Freeport from some new mining rules  official,news,"By Wilda Asmarini
JAKARTA  Reuters    Indonesia will temporarily exempt the local unit of Freeport McMoRan Inc from some new rules while processing its application for new mining rights  a ministry official said  potentially allowing for the resumption of copper concentrate exports 
Freeport  N FCX  has warned that the halt to its shipments since the new mining rules took effect on Jan  12 could lead to a sharp drop in output at its Grasberg mine 
 While their special mining license is not definitive  we cannot apply  these rules  fully   coal and minerals director general Bambang Gatot told Reuters on Tuesday  when asked about the fiscal and other requirements of Freeport s special mining license 
It was not immediately clear which of the new rules  which require Freeport to pay more taxes and divest a 51 percent stake  the company would be temporarily exempted from 
Mining Minister Ignasius Jonan said on Monday Freeport could be issued with a temporary permit within one or two days while the government decides on the company s application for a new special mining license 
A temporary permit would also allow Freeport to resume concentrate exports  he said 
At a media discussion last week  Jonan said Freeport would need to convert its contract of work to a new special mining license before being allowed to resume exports  as part of Indonesia s push to develop domestic industries under the new rules 
A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia on Tuesday said the company would only adopt the new mining rules after obtaining  a stability agreement providing the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under its contract of work  
  Freeport  has requested that concentrate exports be permitted while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated   he said 
Under its current contract  Freeport  is not required to pay export duties on concentrate or to conduct further divestments   Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said 
Freeport is one of Indonesia s biggest taxpayers  paying more than  16 billion in taxes  royalties  dividends and other payments between 1992 and 2015  according to company data 
Freeport is also involved in a dispute over  469 million in water taxes and penalties in Papua province dating back to 2011  and has argued that it should not be subjected to any taxes that are not specified in its 1991 contract

16988,238503,FCX,Big funds push back against activist investor settlements,news,"By Michael Flaherty  Reuters    After years of support for companies that hand board seats to activists to avoid a bruising public fight  some of the world s largest institutional investors are pushing back   BlackRock Inc  N BLK   the world s largest asset manager  and Norges Bank Investment Management  Norway s  872 billion sovereign wealth fund are among the major funds resisting  encouraging companies to consult them before responding to an activist  These investors argue that in certain cases  giving board seats to frustrated shareholders with a shorter term investment horizon could jeopardize the company s long term performance  Activist investors  which Thomson Reuters data show launched a record 511 campaigns last year  are usually hedge funds that buy up a minority stake in a company they believe is undervalued  and push publicly for changes to boost the stock   The most recent example of pushback against activist settlements involves U S  retailer Chico s FAS  N CHS  and Barington Capital  which sought to leverage its 1 6 percent stake to capture two board seats  including one for its founder   The  100 million hedge fund ended its campaign on Friday  after realizing it could not win over enough institutional investor support for its nominees  according to people familiar with the matter  In another case  BlackRock told the management team of Freeport McMoRan Inc  N FCX  that it was unhappy with its truce with billionaire investor Carl Icahn  which gave board seats to two of his young employees  the people familiar with the matter said   The resistance is putting more pressure on activist hedge fund managers  who are struggling through volatile markets after years of index beating performance   Some  institutional investors  feel that board seats should not be a bargaining chip  as this practice distorts the board s election process   said Ernst   Young in a summary of its survey of 50 large shareholders in March   Board positions give activists the most influence  which is why they launch proxy fights to have directors voted in by shareholders at annual meetings   To avoid that distraction  companies offer activists one or several board seats rather than take the battle all the way to a vote  Since 2015  activists have secured 198 board seats at companies with market values above  500 million  according to data from  Lazard Ltd   N LAZ   with most of those seats gained through settlements  That is 30 percent more than the prior two full years combined   Zach Oleksiuk  head of BlackRock s Americas corporate governance team  said companies should seek to periodically refresh their boards   That said  we remain skeptical of directors that are overly focused on a single issue or represent a subset of shareholders   Oleksiuk told Reuters  Norway s sovereign wealth fund declined to comment  but people familiar with its strategy said the fund has been voicing its concerns that quick settlements with activists could jeopardize long term strategy  BOARD INFLUENCE As of June 15 of this year  companies have settled with activists 56 times in the United States  according to financial data firm FactSet  While it remains a historically high number  it marks a 10 percent drop from the same period of 2015  In another sign that companies are getting tougher  there were 92 proxy fights so far this year  according to last month s report by proxy firm Alliance Advisors  on pace to become the highest number since 2009   Graphic    Activists still prefer settlements over proxy fights and most multi billion hedge funds are able to strike deals with companies    It takes away the cost and wasted time   Starboard Value CEO Jeffrey Smith told the Milken Institute Global Conference in May  Smith joined the board of  Yahoo Inc    O YHOO  earlier this year following a settlement with the Internet company  J C Penney Company Inc s  N JCP  relationship with Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  serves as an example of what can happen when a company adopts an activist s strategy that lacks support from the broader shareholder base   Pershing s founder  William Ackman  joined the retailer s board in 2011 as part of a settlement and played a major role in orchestrating a turnaround plan that ultimately failed as sales plunged by 25 percent the following year   Within the past year  however  activists  presence on company boards is coming under heavier scrutiny  According to people familiar with the matter  Chico s new CEO  Shelley Broader  discussed her strategy with the company s largest shareholders shortly after she took over the post in December  She spoke again with some of them after Barington arrived  at which point they signaled their support for a fight with the hedge fund  the people said   A Chico s spokeswoman declined to comment   In the case of Freeport  lack of board experience of Icahn s two young lieutenants who represented him was the reason BlackRock did not support the miner s agreement with the investor  people familiar with the matter said

17021,238536,FCX,Freeport McMoRan  FCX  Q2 Earnings  Will It Beat Estimates ,opinion,"Freeport McMoRan  Inc    NYSE FCX   is set to release second quarter 2016 results ahead of the bell on Jul 26 
Last quarter  the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20 00   Freeport has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  while missing in one  with an average positive surprise of 11 37  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Watch For
Freeport reported a loss of  3 35 per share for first quarter 2016  compared with a loss of  2 38 per share a year ago  The results include net charges of  4 billion or  3 19 per share  mainly related to the reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties  Barring that impact  adjusted net loss was  0 16 a share in the first quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 20 
Revenues declined 15 1  year over year to  3 527 million in the reported quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 667 million For 2016  Freeport expects consolidated sales to be around 5 billion pounds of copper  1 85 million ounces of gold  71 million pounds of molybdenum and 54 4 MMBOE  For second quarter 2016  the company expects 1 15 billion pounds of copper  195 000 ounces of gold  19 million pounds of molybdenum and 13 5 MMBOE 
Freeport is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts  where it currently operates  Favorable exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America as well as in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district  Freeport also continues to progress with its expansion initiatives in Latin America 
Freeport is also taking aggressive actions including assets sales and deferral of capital spending amid a challenging operating environment  The company is taking actions to manage costs and capital expenditures amidst a difficult pricing backdrop  in a bid to strengthen its balance sheet 
Moreover  Freeport s board is currently undertaking a strategic review of its oil and gas business to assess alternatives  including a potential sale of a part of its oil and gas assets  designed to increase value to the company s shareholders  Freeport continues to evaluate potential transactions for the sale of certain assets of FM O G  in an effort to cope with the still challenging commodity pricing environment  The company also continues to assess its portfolio for potential future actions and aims to maintain a strong financial position  with focus on reducing debt 
Freeport  in May 2016  wrapped up the sale of a 13  interest in its Morenci unincorporated joint venture to its Japan based partner  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co   Ltd    SMM   for  1 billion in cash  The move is part of the company s efforts to pare debt 
However  Freeport s copper business remains affected by the sluggish global economy and supply related issues  The depressed oil and copper pricing environment also remains a headwind for the company  Sluggishness in China  a major market for copper  is affecting markets  thereby hurting Freeport s core copper mining business 
 FREEPT MC COP B Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Freeport is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients   
Zacks ESP   for Freeport is  166 67  as the Most Accurate Estimate is currently at 2 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 3 cents 
Zacks Rank  Freeport holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement

 wrapped up its FOMC meeting today  As expected  they left interest rates unchanged  In a   the Fed opened the door a bit to making an interest rate increase at its next meeting in September 
A specific change in the language of the statement said   Near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished   That s a stronger hint than most analysts had expected  In the statement  Fed officials painted a picture of an improving economy   Information received since the Fed policy committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate   the Fed said 
Job gains were  strong  in June  and household spending has been growing at a brisk clip  the Fed said  Yet the central bank also noted that business investment remained  soft   At the same time  Fed officials said they would continue  to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments  
Prior to the announcement  Fed fund futures  used by investors to bet on the timing of Fed rate hikes  were pricing in only a 20  chance of a rate hike in September  The odds rise to 40  at the December meeting

The West was the only region to register a reading lower than its year ago level  down 1 3   That s likely due to extremely tight supply that s pushing prices out of reach of many buyers  The median sale price in the West was  350 800 in June 
There has been a whole bunch of news lately and maybe you haven t noticed but   Since early June  oil prices have dropped right at 20   usually the level associated with a bear market  Oil dropped to a three month low of 41 91 in New York after government data showed that U S  crude stockpiles unexpectedly climbed last week  halting the longest streak of declines on record 
Refineries reduced operating rates  which had been at the highest level of the year  U S  refiners usually don t begin to curb processing until August as the summer driving season nears its end  You should expect further inventory gains as refinery runs decline  Crude extended losses and the dollar briefly spiked after the Federal Reserve struck a more hawkish tone while leaving interest rates unchanged 
This is an important week for earnings  Last night Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  posted results that beat estimates  and the shares were up 6 8  in after hours trade  The company s total revenue dropped 14 6 percent in the third quarter ended June 25  declining for the second quarter in a row  Apple s quarterly net profit fell 27 percent to  7 8 billion  while revenue of  42 36 billion beat analyst s estimates 
Over the last nine years  Apple has sold 1 billion iPhone smartphones  the   less than a day after its third quarter earnings  That s about one iPhone for every three people on the planet with access to the internet  In that time  Apple helped to bring about a revolution in the way we communicate and share information 
Even though this was the second quarter in a row where iPhone revenue had fallen from a year earlier  the company could still boast that its line of phones had managed to sell a quantity that we tend to reserve for things like lightbulbs and McDonald s hamburgers  And one beneficiary of all those mobile devices is Facebook  NASDAQ FB  
Facebook quarterly profit and revenue blew past Wall Street estimates after the closing bell  sending its shares up 6 5 percent in after hours trading to  131 40  their highest since the company went public in 2012 
Mobile advertising revenue accounted for 84 percent of the company s total advertising revenue  compared with 76 percent a year earlier  Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries as advertisers move money away from television to the internet and mobile platforms  The company is also courting advertisers to experiment with Facebook Live  its recently launched live video feature 
Facebook still has several untapped areas for revenue opportunities  including its WhatsApp and Messenger apps  both of which have more than 1 billion users  Facebook also owns picture sharing app Instagram  which recently announced it has more than 500 million users 
Facebook reported net income attributable to stockholders rose to  2 05 billion  or 71 cents per share  compared with  715 million  or 25 cents per share  a year earlier  Total revenue rose 59 2 percent to  6 44 billion  ahead of analysts  average estimate of  6 02 billion

Coca Cola  NYSE KO  reported lower than expected quarterly revenue as higher sales in North America failed to make up for weakness in many of the company s emerging and developing markets  including China and Argentina  Coke also cut its full year organic revenue growth forecast  The company s net operating revenue fell 5 1 percent to  11 54 billion  the fifth straight quarter of decline 
Coke and smaller rival PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  have been struggling as consumers increasingly turn health conscious and cut back on fizzy drinks and opt for teas  fruit juices and smoothies  Coke has responded by building its non carbonated drinks portfolio  expanding beyond North America and cutting costs by refranchising its bottling operations 
Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  reported weaker than expected revenue for the second quarter as the price of copper plunged and gold sales tumbled  Freeport McMoRan sold 156 000 ounces of gold  less than half as much as it sold a year ago 
Meanwhile its average selling price for oil fell 18 percent compared to the second quarter of 2015  and the price of copper slumped 20 percent  The Phoenix based company disclosed a loss of  479 million  or 38 cents per share  Excluding one time items  Freeport McMoRan said it lost 2 cents per share  Its revenue dropped 15 percent to  3 33 billion

Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   the German bank which is an important part of the global financial system  announced revenue and income fell  which could add further concerns for investors made jittery by a combination of Brexit and previous issues at the bank 
Deutsche announced second quarter net income was down 98 percent from the same period in the previous year  to 20 million euros   22 million   as it exited parts of its business while revenues were down 20 percent to 7 4 billion euro  The bank  one of Germany s largest lenders  has lost around 40 percent of its market value this year as concerns mount about its capital position and  14 billion in fines over past misconduct 
State Street has agreed to pay  382 million for misleading mutual funds and other custody clients by applying hidden markups to forex trades  The settlement includes  167 million in disgorgement and penalties to the SEC  a  155 million penalty to the DOJ  and at least  60 million to ERISA plan clients in an agreement with the DOL  State Street also agreed to pay  147 million to settle private class action lawsuits filed by bank customers alleging similar misconduct 
Basically  it looks like the bank was misleading custody clients  telling some clients that it guaranteed the most competitive rates available on their foreign currency exchange trades  provided  best execution   or charged  market rates  on the transactions  State Street instead set prices largely driven by predetermined  uniform markups and made no effort to obtain the best possible prices for these clients   pocketing the difference ",2016-07-28,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed-said-200144590,200144590

Up until yesterday  it was still a play you could take as a bounce off of   Although  I didn t play it  simply because bounces off of  support usually happens quite rather and doesn t simply sit there   I wouldn t have blamed you for trying 
But lets make one more thing clear  the price action in FCX is why you use stop losses  It is why you don t trust yourself to know when to get out  but you decide it before you ever get in the trade and you follow that stop loss regardless 
On the technical analysis that I provide on FCX below  you will see that it has broken through a key support level  and while it is an important support level it isn t the critical level to watch  The most important support level lies between  10 and  10 23  If this level is broken  you have a massive double top that is formed 
If that happens  FCX could easily be heading back into  8 9 territory  or a 10 20  decline

17031,238546,FCX,6 Mining Companies To Watch As M A Heats Up,opinion,"Precious metals prices have gained momentum since the start of this year  and corporate M A activity is heating up again  Caesars Report s Thibaut Lepouttre highlights a handful of mining companies with market capitalizations attractive to larger companies looking to boost their project pipelines 
In the most recent mining merger and acquisition  M A  activity  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  acquired Kaminak Gold Corp  to get its hands on the Coffee project in Canada s Yukon Territory  and Fortuna Silver Mines Inc  TO FVI  is in the process of acquiring Goldrock Mines Corp  V GRM   whose flagship asset is the development stage Lindero heap leach project in Argentina 
As gold and silver prices seem to be holding their ground resulting in increased target prices for both precious metals it would be normal to expect more M A transactions to occur in the second half of the year  as the midtier and senior producers wouldn t want to miss out on any deals 
Of course  one should never invest in a company purely based on buyout speculation  but sometimes there are plenty of arguments to be made about why a company could be on the short list of their larger competitors 
In the past 12 24 months  companies have not only been focusing on cutting costs  but also on making a run toward  safer  assets  Higher risk projects have been sold  and practically all new deals were in regions with an acceptable geopolitical risk as companies refuse to invest hundreds of millions  or billions  in assets located in higher risk countries where the returns are only marginally higher 
Today I will focus on some logical buyout targets in the Americas 
Junior exploration companies with an existing joint venture  JV  agreement are on top of the list  Not only does the existence of a JV deal confirm the company s asset has drawn the attention of other companies  but also those larger companies usually don t want to deal with minority partners on a project basis 
An excellent example would be Nord Gold NV  LON NORDNq   which dislikes having minority partners on any of its projects  Even if there s a lot of opposition from the shareholders of the targeted company  Nordgold pushes through and usually secures 100  ownership of the asset it wants to get its hands on  That s what happened with High River Gold Mines several years ago Nordgold wanted to own the Taparko Bouroum and Bissa projects  rather than having High River Gold as a minority partner and that s what might happen to Columbus Gold Corp  TO CGT  as well 
Nordgold is earning a 50 01  stake in Columbus  Paul Isnard gold project in French Guiana  but it s not unreasonable to think Nordgold will want to own the entire asset  As the after tax NPV8  of the project is almost half a billion dollars  using a gold price of  1 300 ounce   Columbus Gold is trading at just one third of the NPV  and making a deal on Paul Isnard might create a win win situation for both parties involved 
We see a similar situation in Argentina  where Silver Standard Resources Inc  NASDAQ SSRI  is mulling over entering into a joint venture agreement with its neighbor Golden Arrow Resources Corporation  V GRG   Silver Standard needs to do  something  as the Pirquitas mine will very likely have to close in the near future  There s an agreement on the table where Silver Standard can earn a 75  stake in Golden Arrow s Chinchillas silver lead zinc deposit  but Silver Standard rarely deals with joint venture partners  and it might want to simplify the ownership structure by acquiring 100  of Chinchillas to make sure it can mine and operate both projects as efficiently as possible 
Staying in the silver sector  Southern Silver Exploration Corp   V SSV  has also undergone a true metamorphosis  This company was trading as low as  0 03 per share earlier this year  but its share price has increased sixteen fold     before catching its breath in the mid  0 30s  where it is now  Southern Silver s Cerro Las Minitas in Mexico is shaping up to be larger than originally thought as the current resource estimate already contains 113 million silver equivalent ounces  Southern Silver s official exploration target is 200 million silver equivalent ounces  but after seeing the most recent drill results  that target seems to be relatively conservative 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  was earning a stake in Cerro Las Minitas but walked away  not because Cerro Las Minitas is worthless  but because Freeport was  and still is  searching for large base metals  copper  projects and not for silver lead zinc systems  which typically attract a different crowd of companies  With the potential to discover in excess of 200 million silver equivalent ounces  of which 60 90 million are  real  silver ounces   Cerro Las Minitas has undoubtedly popped up on a lot of radar screens 
But you don t have to go to Latin America to find potential takeover targets  as Canada also has some interesting prospects  Integra Gold Corp  V ICG  is one of the first companies that come to mind as the mineralization at its Sigma Lamaque project continues to expand  An updated preliminary economic assessment  PEA  should be released after the summer  and the NPV of the project will probably at least triple  The PEA was originally expected to be released before the summer  but after encountering some exceptional drill results just a few hundred meters away from the Triangle Zone  Integra s management decided to postpone the PEA so it could potentially add the ounces from this No  4 Plug to its resource estimate and incorporate it in a mine plan 
Practically anyone could be a suitor for Integra  as the company offers an excellent combination of high grade gold mineralization in a mining friendly region  Eldorado Gold already is an important shareholder  but just any midtier and senior producer could be interested in Integra Gold  as the company is now aiming to become a 200 000 to 250 000 ounce producer 
And  of course  there s more than just precious metals in the world  and the recent uranium discoveries in the Athabasca Basin could definitely be described as world class  NexGen Energy Ltd   TO NXE  blew all expectations out of the water with a maiden resource estimate containing in excess of 200 million pounds  200 Mlb   but neighbor Fission Uranium Corp  TO FCU  is located within wheelbarrowing distance from NexGen  and both companies combined will very likely have in excess of 400 Mlb uranium 
Fission s Triple R deposit contains almost 110 Mlb uranium and this is expected to increase toward the 150 Mlb mark as Fission is now trying to connect the mineralized systems at the different target areas at an average grade of approximately 1 75  U3O8  However  there are higher grade zones located within this resource estimate and Triple R has 45 Mlb in the Indicated resource category at an average grade of 18 22  U3O8 
All of the companies I ve discussed here are buyout candidates  and their market capitalizations are still attractive for larger companies wanting to boost their project pipelines

17069,238584,FCX,Bullish Momentum Continues With A Wary Eye On Volatility,opinion,"T2108 Status  79 7   5th day of overbought conditions T2107 Status  71 4 VIX Status  12 4  11 month closing low General  Short term  Trading Call  bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  108 over 20   Day  14 over 30   Day  13 over 40   Day  12 over 50   Day  7 over 60   Day  5 over 70   overbought 
Commentary The stock market is on Day  5 of overbought conditions as the bullish momentum continues ever so slightly    the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   has yet to crack 80   but it does not need to do so to maintain bullish momentum in the market 
I have noted in previous posts on overbought conditions that T2108 s level matters little at and above 80   There is simply very little extra room for stocks to move at this point  T2108 is more important as a signal for the end of bullish conditions which occurs when T2108 falls OUT of overbought conditions 
The duration of the overbought period is also more important than the level of T2108 at this point  Once the duration goes past 20 days  the market actually gets more bullish  the chart below shows how the S P 500 s performance in the overbought period increases with overbought duration 

S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 70  Threshold
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  also becomes more important at this juncture  At 71 4   T2107 is inching along just like T2108  And like T2108  it is running out of room to move higher  At some point soon  it will be more important for it to remain aloft than for it to keep gaining 
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   is doing its part by registering new all time highs  Per plan  I used every little dip last week to load up on call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO   It was a risky move to target a Friday expiration 
However  I assumed that if the S P 500 could not maintain momentum into the end of this week  the index would likely drop into a larger pullback  I did not buy any SSO shares as originally planned 

The S P 500 closed at another  marginal  all time high 
I noted in the last T2108 Update how the high beta stocks in the S P 500 carried the entire load on that major breakout day  The divergence between the Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  and the Powershares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB  continues by the slightest of margins  I am looking for the divergence to widen and get more dramatic before warning that further momentum has become overly unbalanced 
Also in the last T2108 Update  I introduced the notion of GRAVITY  Gold ra VIX Treasuries  or NYSE TLT  Yen  GRAVITY consists of components that conventionally are supposed to weigh on the market  Ever since the big breakout day  GRAVITY has largely cooperated and lightened up  The SPDR Gold Trust  SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   has been the most resilient by managing to stay mainly flat the last three days 
On Thursday July 14  I sold the last of my put options on the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF  NYSE FXY   FXY gapped down again and was  close enough  to retesting 50DMA support 
Monday  it closed marginally below this critical support line  The volatility index  the VIX  is of greatest interest  Its cooperation with market bullishness has now pushed it to levels last seen right before the August  2015 flash crash  I remain on my toes given the VIX typically does not stay at such low levels for long 

The volatility index  the VIX  drops to a near 11 month low 

Here is a quick update on trades charts I mentioned in the last T2108 Update 
3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD   A downgrade today knocked DDD off its upward momentum  After DDD cracked 50DMA support  buyers regained enough force to close the stock above support  Trading volume was over 50  above the 90 day moving average  A lower close will confirm the end of the current bullish setup  Otherwise  I am sticking with the call 
Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN   WYNN has fought off a downgrade last week to reclaim 50DMA support  I think the stock can continue with its bullish setup from here 
United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   X is still making new marginal 52 week highs  I have not made a trade on this one 
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF   The stock s levitation has now allowed the upper Bollinger Band  BB  to drift up and away from the stock  Fresh upside potential is opening up  I have yet to make a new trade on this one  I might buy a new high OR a dip to support  like the bottom of the current uptrend channel  
Joy Global  NYSE JOY   JOY made a picture perfect bounce after a small 3 day pullback  It looks ready to run higher 
Lastly  I made a fresh trade on Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   In the past  I played the nice trading range in FCX  Last week  FCX finally broke out  I changed strategy with a hedged play  a strangle   out of the money calls and puts 
Wherever FCX is headed next should be a big move  Either 1  FCX will soon make a major breakout and move past its 2016 high  or 2  the current breakout will fail and FCX will quickly fall back to the bottom of the old trading range  I might grow this position depending upon general market conditions 

Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  broke out of a two month trading range  Can the momentum continue to a new 2016 high or will the breakout fail

HCP Inc   Health Care Property Investors  is an American real estate investor that is primarily active in the healthcare industry sector  The company acts as a self regulatory real estate investment trust and purchases  develops  rents  sells and manages property 
For three years now  this value has been in a permanent downtrend  as you can see from the trend channel  After the price was able to stabilize itself between  30 and  40  it is now showing a downtrend once again 
The last correction led the price exactly to the upper edge of the red correction zone  to then ricochet off downwards from there in a technically correct manner  The DowHow signal is now showing a nice short chance here  The target is located in the region of the lower trend channel line 

Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  NYSE ATI  
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated is a US company specialized in metal production  With its offering  the company belongs to the largest manufacturers in the country  The company produces and distributes rust free steel  nickel and titanium alloy  steel strip  steel plates  metal sheets  metal foils and tool steel 
After the price formed a new low at  7 08  the value was able to correct very strongly  but then at  18 it no longer found any more buyers  and so it started a new downward movement  Two attempts to continue the trend have failed up until now  but the DowHow signal is now showing a third possibility  Perhaps it will be successful this time  since the signs are all pointing to short 
BB T Corp  NYSE BBT  
BB T Corp  is a finance holding corporation with operative subsidiaries in all regions of the US  These subsidiaries are largely organized independently of the corporate group  and are set up communally 
The price was able to stay at a high level for a long time  but at about  42  several tops disabused the buyers of the notion that it would continue onwards there  The fall that then followed was tremendous  and led to a return down to  29 95 
The recovery proceeded by means of a subordinate uptrend and led the price directly into the red correction zone  The DowHow signals are now indicating that the correction is possibly over  and that it is time for the next movement 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  
Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  is one of the worldwide leading gold and copper producers  The company operates via the subsidiary P T  Freeport Indonesia  P T  IRJA Eastern Minerals Corporation and Atlantic Copper 
The existing trend here has already reached a certain maturity  because after all  the price was already more than three times as high once before  The last correction again led the price directly to the upper edge of the red correction zone  A surplus of sellers then caused a considerable decline and could now ring in a final downward movement  The DowHow signals  at least  are showing precisely this ",2016-06-15,Markus Gabel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-chances-with-the-dow-theory-200136039,200136039

The dollar crashed more than 1 5  versus the yen  suffering its fifth straight daily loss  to hit a fresh 17 month low at 107 69  It came as investors expressed concerns that the Bank of Japan s current negative interest rate regime might not be enough to prevent one of the world s largest economies from entering an extended period of deflation  Meanwhile  investors which borrowed cheaply in the yen months ago while capitalizing on the carry trade incurred sharp losses on Thursday  Under the strategy  the investors borrowed yen at a deep discount  then invested the proceeds in stocks and bonds in the U S  and the euro zone in an effort to capitalize on higher yields  The strategy is effective when the currencies remain constant  but can lead to significant losses when the dollar falls sharply in relative value against the yen  When the yen reverses  investors are forced to close out their positions leading to further losses

17096,238611,FCX,Go easy on deals  investors tell new Rio Tinto boss ,news,"By Sonali Paul and James Regan MELBOURNE SYDNEY  Reuters    Top investors in  Rio Tinto   L RIO   AX RIO  say they want the global miner s new boss to proceed cautiously on acquisitions  focusing on the core  cash generating iron ore business and on developing his own copper mines before looking for new assets  Jean Sebastien Jacques  who will take over from Rio s veteran boss Sam Walsh in July  was previously the head of its copper and coal business  His appointment on Thursday has been read by some as an effort to rebalance the iron ore focused miner and a pointer   given his negotiating credentials   towards deals  The front runner for the job had been iron ore boss Andrew Harding  whose division generated nearly 90 percent of the group s earnings in 2015  Jacques  copper and coal unit made up just 6 percent of the total  But shareholders said Jacques should tread with care  While the Frenchman may be taking over as more than  30 billion worth of mine comes onto the block amid the toughest mining downturn in decades  it is unlikely that many assets will be of the high quality  large  long life caliber   so called  tier one assets    they said   We don t want them to be going out and aggressively acquiring stuff   said Andy Forster  a portfolio manager at Argo Investments  the second largest Australian stakeholder in Rio  Outgoing CEO Walsh said in February the most desirable copper assets were locked in the hands of other big miners and it would take a longer period of weak copper prices before those players crack  Bankers have named mines including Cobre Panama  owned by First Quantum Minerals  TO FM   Freeport McMoRan s  N FCX  Cerro Verde in Peru and Grasberg in Indonesia  which is co owned by Rio Tinto  or Anglo American s  L AAL  Los Bronces and Collahuasi in Latin America as potential targets  Among the easier options would be taking control of Grasberg and mopping up Rio Tinto subsidiary  Turquoise Hill Resources   TO TRQ   which holds the majority stake in the massive Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia  The more ambitious  according to some bankers  could include a tilt at indebted  Anglo American   L AAL   or at least some of its assets  But Rio investors that Reuters spoke to wanted more of the old  conservative approach and less of the boom year mega deals like Rio s acquisition of Alcan aluminum group and Mozambican coal  two debacles which led to the exit of Walsh s predecessor and brought in a period of conservatism  TIGHTEN THE SCREWS While Jacques has built a reputation as a sharp negotiator  working on the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia  he is also seen as an astute salesman  having overseen the sale of the Northparkes copper mine and the Bengalla coal mine in Australia   both at higher than expected prices   We would be more impressed by what he divests  more coal  uranium  etc  than acquisitions   and how he tightens the screws on underperforming assets   said Peter O Connor  a mining analyst with Shaw   Partners in Sydney   Whilst some desire a  growth junkie   we would like a CEO who inspires the optimization of return on invested capital from every existing asset   In the meantime  shareholders say they are braced for some reshuffling at the top  Several said they would not be surprised to see iron ore chief Harding and Chief Financial Officer Chris Lynch eventually leave after missing out on the top job   Chairman Jan du Plessis too  after seven years in the job and having resolved the chief executive role  may also move on  company executives said

17097,238612,FCX,U S  small cap funds shine in first quarter but may have harder road ahead,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    The steep decline and subsequent rebound in the U S  stock market over the first three months of the year were a boon to U S  small cap managers  who took advantage of what some considered a short window of low prices to add shares in companies ranging from retailers to steel makers 
 We went on a buying spree   said Chris Towle  co manager of the Towle Deep Value fund  which is up 2 2 percent for the year to date  compared with a 3 7 percent decline in the benchmark Russell 2000   RUT 
Towle s fund added seven positions to its portfolio of 35 stocks in the first quarter  buying companies including retailers  Pier 1 Imports  Inc  N PIR   which the fund bought at  4 and closed Thursday at  6 47  and Destination Maternity Corp  O DEST   which the fund bought near  5 per share and now trades just below  7 
The quick bargain hunting enabled a majority of active small cap stock pickers to do better than their benchmark Russell 2000 index  an atypical outperformance 
Yet Towle and other fund managers who bought heavily in the first quarter now say they are already trimming back on some of their positions after small caps jumped 8 percent in February  their highest monthly return since 2011  making many stocks once again look fully valued 
The trailing price to earnings ratio of the benchmark Russell 2000 now stands at 27 2  compared with a 19 2 P E multiple for the large cap focused Standard   Poor s 500 index 
 During the first six weeks of the year you had no rhyme or reason for the way stocks were selling   said Craig Hodges  co manager of the Hodges Pure Contrarian Fund  which is up 14 6 percent for the year to date 
Hodges bought more shares of oil company Freeport McMoRan Inc  N FCX  when its shares hit  3 15 earlier this year  and has since then began trimming his position back as the shares jumped to  10 99 on March 22  Over the same time  he picked up more shares of United States Steel Corp  N X   the second largest position in his fund  when it fell to  6 15 but has been trimming since as shares jumped to  16 08 on Thursday 
With concerns that oil prices would tumble into the  20s and that U S  bond yields could turn negative  the U S  stock market fell nearly 11 percent between the start of the year and its Feb  11 low  Since then  stabilizing oil prices and signs of growth in the U S  economy have pushed the benchmark S P 500 back up 11 6 percent to near its record high 

The quick move in and out of stocks on the part of fund managers enabled them to beat their own indexes in unusually high numbers  Approximately 65 percent of small cap managers topped the Russell 2000 during the first quarter  although typically only a minority of stock pickers are able to outperform their indexes  In the first quarter  just 22 percent of large cap funds were able to beat the S P 500  according to Lipper data ",2016-04-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-small-cap-funds-shine-in-first-quarter-but-may-have-harder-road-ahead-394349,394349

17114,238629,FCX,Fear Indicators Diverge On Brexit Eve,opinion,"T2108 Status  56 7 T2107 Status  63 9 VIX Status  21 2General  Short term  Trading Call  bearishActive T2108 periods  Day  91 over 20   Day  90 over 30   Day  87 over 40   Day  2 over 50   Day  2 under 60   Day  9 under 70 
Commentary At the time of writing   on the referendum on membership in the European Union  EU   Sentiment flipped rather dramatically on  Brexit  in recent days  The week started with a lot of relief and a plunge in the volatility index  the VIX 
However  the VIX rallied off its lows and continued to increase from there  Suddenly  the VIX is right back to  elevated  levels  above 20  and at its highest close in 4 months 

The volatility index  the VIX  surges to a new 4 month closing high 


ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  rallies but greatly trails the VIX on a relative basis  UVXY still closed below its 50DMA downtrend 
This flip flop aligns relatively well with a brief fallback in Brexit sentiment via Google trends of search terms  Google Trends fell back sharply Friday and Saturday only to rally from there to yet new highs  So  the VIX and Brexit sentiment are in agreement 

Google searches on  Brexit  dipped from Thursday s previous high  now 75  to 50 as the market expressed relief  Anxiety is already back to new highs now 
While the VIX and sentiment show elevated fear and anxiety again  other potential indicators of fear are going int he exact opposite direction  I posted several days ago on the case for a blow off top in SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   After two additional days of selling  GLD sits just above 50DMA support  The follow through selling has effectively confirmed the top  but a break of 50DMA support would further solidify the case 

SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  looks to hold support at its 50DMA after hitting a likely blow off top 
Like GLD  the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT  has also stood down from a major topping pattern on June 16th  TLT is trying to hold support at its uptrending 20DMA  I am guessing it will tumble to its 50DMA before finding solid support  TLT rallied into June 16th as fears mounted in financial markets 
The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  tumbles from its recent 16 month high 
To round out this intriguing divergence in fear  the Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY   has sold off since the key turning point day of June 16th  The Japanese yen is interesting because of its conventional treatment as a  safety  currency  Against the resurgent British pound  Guggenheim CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling  NYSE FXB    the focus of Brexit of course  the Japanese yen has faded sharply along with the fades in GLD and TLT 
The British pound  FXB  versus the Japanese yen  FXY  has rebounded sharply since June 16th but can it break through 50DMA resistance through the Brexit vote 
So  the VIX s surge stands out like a sore thumb against GLD  TLT  and FXY  through GBP JPY for example   Seeing this divergence encouraged me to sell call options against my accumulated position in UVXY  The premiums are quite large for July 1st expiration 
I started this position  along with long call options  on June 16th thinking it was time to get back to going long volatility  The typical market soothing of the Federal Reserve s latest pronouncements on monetary policy had come and gone  Instead  it was a day that delivered a synchronized whiplash 
Still  through all the gyrations  my short term trading call has stayed bearish  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   is valiantly clinging to its 50DMA  but the index needs to BOTH recover overbought conditions AND punch through the all time high in order to invalidate the bearish drop out of overbought conditions  The NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   is also hanging close to its 50DMA although as resistance 
Since falling out of overbought conditions  the S P 500  SPY  has stuck to a 50DMA pivot 


The NASDAQ  QQQ  is tightly sandwiched between 50DMA resistance and 200DMA support 
The fall from overbought conditions on Friday  June 10th quickly resolved into a bottom six calendar days later  The bounce from that low also moved swiftly  In two more trading days    the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  surged as high as 65 9  before cooling off to Wednesday s close at 56 7   This second fade seems to confirm T2108 s bearish fall from overbought conditions 
There are other very telling charts out in the market  Two of the big cap tech darlings are suddenly faring poorly from a technical perspective  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  confirmed its 50DMA as resistance and looks very ready to resume a sell off that started with earnings 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc C  NASDAQ GOOG  was slammed last week with a downgrade  The stock broke 200DMA support on volume  Buyers are trying their best to keep GOOG form confirming this breakdown 

Netflix  NFLX  continues to disappoint those who bought late into the recycling of the Apple for Netflix rumor 


In April  May  and now June  Alphabet  GOOG  broke through 200DMA support  Can the stock recover quickly yet again 
While darling tech stocks falter  commodity stocks are hanging in there in general  One great example is Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   I mentioned FCX in an earlier post as a commodity stock to play through what has become a very well defined trading range 
My first trade was a fade  and it worked well  My second fade will likely not work well   in retrospect I should have waited out Brexit before trying the second round  I am positioning for the next round by Friday as long as FCX does not break out first

Commentary Voters in the United Kingdom rejected membership in the European Union  EU  in    The vote came down to 51 9  for leaving  and 48 7  for staying 
Given the contentious nature of the debate  this margin of victory should be large enough to compel the government in the UK to proceed with a divorce from the EU  Indeed  UK Prime Minister David Cameron  who launched the referendum  announced his resignation in the wake of this defeat 
This result is being described as a shock and a huge surprise in some media headlines  I think of the result as more surreal than shocking  Surely when looking at the rallies in financial markets and the retreat in many typical indicators of fear  I can excuse anyone for expecting Brexit to fail 
The rallies were an extension of the market celebrations that kicked off the week as polls showed the remain side regaining advantage  However  the polls never showed a decisive victory for either side and a large block of undecideds consistently hung out in the wings ready to swing the vote 
Under such conditions  I would have expected an abundance of caution from traders  Instead  caution was essentially tossed to the wind 
So when the volatility index  the VIX  reversed sharply form the previous day s surge  I just marveled at the trading action 
The volatility index plunges 18 5  for its lowest close since the VIX confirmed the June 10th breakout 
The VIX s plunge left sentiment as shown by Google Trends as the last piece of evidence of elevated anxiety  Searches on  Brexit  reached a new high on Wednesday  index   100  
After a brief respite  anxiety over Brexit continued to soar to new heights   Wednesday is based on partial data  
 I cannot wait to see how Brexit sentiment changes for the rest of the week  
The market has delivered one surreal day after another  Assuming that the market  knew  something I just did not understand  I did not even cover the call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  that I sold short the previous day  for details on that trade see  Fear Indicators Diverge On Brexit Eve    I started to expect a huge implosion of implied volatility following the Brexit vote  no matter the outcome  
However  I was stubborn enough to stick to my bearish trading call   even delivered a surreal confirmation of my bearishness by closing right at the edge of overbought conditions with a value of 69 99   I used two decimals to make clear that T2108 did NOT hit overbought territory at the close 

You just can t make this stuff up  T2108 closes right at the border of overbought conditions ahead of the results of the Brexit vote 
Assuming Friday delivers a gap down at the open  the market will confirm the short term bearish call with an exclamation point  As a reminder  I describe the market as bearish whenever T2108 falls from overbought conditions or reverses at the border of overbought territory   For more details  see   
Given my bearish stance  my trades were dominated by closing out more longs and initiating new shorts to fade the rally  There was plenty to fade because the major indices soared in what looked like very bullish fashion to complement the plunge in volatility 
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   jumped 1 3  in a move that confirmed 50DMA support  The bullish move was highlighted by a firm close right at the high of the day  The NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   also confirmed 50DMA support 
The S P 500 lifts out of the churn of its 50DMA pivot and challenges recent highs 


The NASDAQ  QQQ  lifts out of congestion between its 50DMA resistance and 200DMA support 
I used the rally to double down on put options on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO   I made another change in my iron ore pairs trade by locking in profits on my Rio Tinto PLC  NYSE RIO  call options and adding to my short on BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP   I doubled down on my put options on Deutsche Bank AG  DE DBKGn  NA O N   NYSE DB  
I restarted a position on iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM   with new put options  I even moved a day early and reloaded on put options on Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   For good measure I bought a single put option on CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling ETF  NYSE FXB   Of course  I wish I had loaded up on FXB put options 
Perhaps my biggest misses on the day were in failing to fade the rally in Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc C  NASDAQ GOOG    two darling stocks I pointed out were in the middle of breakdowns  GOOG was particularly interesting because at its lows  the stock confirmed the 200DMA breakdown 
The rally on the day placed the stock right back into post breakdown limbo  However  assuming the stock market remains in bearish position  GOOG s 200DMA breakdown should be played form the short side 

A confirmation of a 200DMA breakdown still looms for Alphabet  GOOG 
The trade I will probably most regret in the morning is going long Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  for a day trade  Until Brexit  the doji below the lower Bollinger Band  BB  looked ripe for a bounce  A fresh lesson against turning a day trade into a swing trade  especially when it flies against the short term trading bias 
Tesla  TSLA  looked poised to start a recovery from post buyout selling 
The currency markets are of course roiling from the Brexit vote  Even though I heard plenty of warnings about the potential depth of selling in the pound in the Brexit scenario  I am still left astounded  At one point I saw the pound trading off about 13  against the Japanese yen  JPY  and off 9  or so against the U S  dollar 
Here are the charts as I am writing  They are bound to be different by the time you read this   especially if major central banks decide to start forex and other market interventions before the weekend  Note that the pound has been putting up a valiant battle to hold the lows for the last few hours or so 

The British pound plunges in response to Brexit   the Leaves win 


The British pound plunges in response to Brexit   the Leaves win 
The British pound is not the only story  The euro  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro  NYSE FXE   is also in the crosshairs  The current sell off vindicates my long suffering short position that I have stubbornly held for many months now 
In previous commentary I noted how the euro was largely being ignored as a source of risk in a Brexit vote  I have come to appreciate the resilience of the euro and the stubbornness of euro fans  longs   so I do not expect the euro to just roll over easily from here 

The euro temporarily drops below its 200DMA against the U S  dollar
The Australian dollar is also suffered some blows as risk off is the order of the day  AUD JPY now screams bearishness with a fresh  and major  breakdown in the wake of Brexit 
There is nothing more bearish for financial markets that an Australian dollar with a fresh breakdown against the Japanese yen 
My big outstanding question now is whether I can navigate around the likely imminent interventions from the world s major central banks  In particular  the Bank of England  BoE  and the European Central Bank  ECB  have already promised to provide liquidity and support to markets in the wake of post Brexit volatility 
They will have to shoot bullets judiciously because the EU UK break up will take months and feature plenty of on going uncertainty  The restless citizens of other countries may also start to clamor for their own referendums on EU membership 
With USD JPY temporarily plunging below the magic 100 level  I have to imagine the BoJ is finally ready to give another shot at weakening the yen  I am hoping this achievement completes my strategy to accumulate USD JPY down to this presumed level of support while hedging in other positions  particularly GBP JPY and AUD JPY  
Brexit even takes down USD JPY  Did the  100 alert  reach the Bank of Japan yet 
For now  my forex strategy is fading rallies in the British pound  locking in profits as quickly as practical  and periodically riding counter rallies  This trade was a lot easier to do in the immediate wake of the Brexit results  so I think this strategy may be coming to the end of its effectiveness  Stay tuned

Commentary

That tweet best describes my response to the carnage that was June 24  2016  post Brexit Day  1  After closing out a lot my bearish trades  I realized that I had to start thinking about a potential bounce  With USD JPY trading around the 100 level  a fade on the Japanese yen  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF  NYSE FXY   seemed like one of the more  obvious  trades  Going long the British pound  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling ETF  NYSE FXB    eventually  also looks like a great risk reward trade for the longer term  see   
Sentiment on  Brexit  has  to date  performed well as a trading tool  The steady increase in the search index  outside of one day with a downward blip  kept me focused on the bearish implications of the apparent anxiety  That anxiety reached a feverish pace by Friday with Luxembourg  of all places  suddenly topping the regional list of searchers 
Note that Wednesday used to be the 100  maximum  index level for what THEN looked like a rapid acceleration of searches  Now  the index for Wednesday is only a 9  Friday hit 100  Saturday fell back to 29   The U S  is nowhere to be found in the top 10 regions or cities   I will be looking to see whether this absence starts to change if when Brexit has a larger impact on financial conditions in the U S  

Luxembourg suddenly shows up in Google  searches on Brexit as sentiment cools off from extremely high levels 
I will next look to see whether Brexit returns to its previous insignificance as a search term or whether some new and higher baseline develops  A recognizable baseline will provide a platform for planning new trades  In the meantime  there is still ol  reliable   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs  
In case you were confused about the UK s relationship with Europe 

Friday s reversal was a signature moment for T2108  Thanks to T2108 s tumble from overbought conditions on June 10th  I maintained a bearish bias  As I noted in the last T2108 Update  link above   the rally into the Brexit vote was surreal relative to my bearish bias  Given my trading rules  Thursday s rally was an irresistible opportunity to fade stocks and indices 
The rally should have also been a time to increase my bullish bet on volatility  T2108 s sharp rejection from the edge of overbought territory  69 99    underlines my standing bearish short term trading call 
T2108 tumbles hard form the border of overbought territory and re confirms the bearish tint of the market
Note that T2108 bounced from current levels twice in the past month or so  Bears will be fortunate to get another bounce from here because I strongly suspect it will be the last one from these levels before a potential trip to oversold territory  below 20   
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMAs  also made a definitive bearish move  Friday s sell off all but confirmed the post recession downtrend line  shown streaking across the top part of the screen  as fresh resistance  I now assume that the earlier breakout was a fake out 
T2107 closes at a new 1 month low and seems to have confirmed a top 
The major indices fell sharply on extremely high volume  The S P 500  via the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   is just a breath away from a 200DMA breakdown that will put the final confirmation on a freshly bearish tone of trading  For now  the latest 50DMA breakdown looks like the signature call of a top confirmed 
The S P 500  SPY  breaks down below its 50DMA in a move that looks like a topping pattern  A 200DMA breakdown will confirm a top 

The NASDAQ looks like it is breaking down   it just needs to break the May low for a confirmation 
The carnage in Europe was much greater than in the U S  The following ETF price changes are worsened by the unfavorable currency moves in the euro  via Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro ETF  NYSE FXE   and the British pound against the U S  dollar 
iShares MSCI United Kingdom  NYSE EWU   12 0   a 4 month low 
iShares MSCI Spain Capped  NYSE EWP   16 3   a 4 year low and below the 2009 low 
iShares MSCI Italy Capped  NYSE EWI   15 0   a 4 year low 
iShares MSCI France  NYSE EWQ   11 3   a 4 month low 
iShares MSCI Germany  NYSE EWG   9 8   a 4 month low 
Shares MSCI Netherlands  NYSE EWN   9 5   a 4 month low 
It is particularly interesting to see how poorly EWU has fared since 2014 as the British pound has steadily lost value relative to the U S  dollar 
The iShares MSCI United Kingdom  EWU  has steadily declined for two years now 
Compare this to EWP which is also at a 4 year low The iShares MSCI Spain Capped  EWP  looks particularly bad now 
The Volatility Index sums things all up  The VIX screamed higher for a 44  gain  Still  the VIX did NOT make a new high for the year  I strongly suspect it will before the Brexit volatility is finally behind us  not taking into account central bank interventions of course  
Note how low the VIX fell after the big gap up  gap buyers went to work immediately at the open  but their buying power proved insufficient this time to keep the market propped up 
The volatility index soars to a new 4 month high and presumably has room to run 

The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  follows the VIX with a stellar 44  gain 
I decided to stand pat on my ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures Fund  NYSE UVXY  positions  I added a few puts just in case the VIX manages to plunge right away  My short calls sold against my UVXY shares expire this Friday  They have a  15 strike so I am fine with UVXY closing anywhere above  14 or so this week  The puts have a strike of  11 
Here is a summary of my other moves on Friday  As I noted  my main focus was on locking in profits on my latest bearish positions  sold put options in Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM   Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE FCX   FXB  and ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO   and covered a short in BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP   On the intraday rally I also faded Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  with put options 
As my intro indicated  I was not 100  sour grapes on the day  I also decided to make some speculative buys as small hedges but  hopefully  very quick turn around trades 
I bought new call options on Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  to start a new iron ore   I took a flyer on call options on Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   
Talk about a flyer  Goldman Sachs  GS  closes at its low for 2016  I trade on the prospect for a quick bounceback 
I also doubled down on JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM   I have become dedicated to playing JPM from the long side and buying dips  This move violated my technical sensibilities since JPM gapped down below 50 and 200DMA support  However  it filled the post earnings gap which is a trigger point for a buy on a stock I want to accumulate  Observant traders will notice a breakdown from a head and shoulders  H S  topping pattern   gulp  
JP Morgan Chase  JPM  finally fills its post earnings gap up and breaks down from key support 
I even speculated on Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  call options  AAPL s troubles may deepen given its great dependence on global growth for its own incremental growth 
Troubles in Europe will transmit to China and both will transmit to Apple  Yet I could not resist this trade given Apple s tendency to have positive Mondays AND the now near complete reversal of the Buffett Bottom rally 
It was great while it lasted  AAPL s post Buffett rally has officially reversed 
I noted in my last T2108 Update that the currency charts might look a lot different by the time readers reviewed the post  I did not suspect the bounce form the bottoms would be AS strong as they were  
The Australian dollar  above others  The euro also bounced back against the U S  dollar quite stubbornly  If I were not already in my full position  I would be shorting the euro here hand over fist 
There is more post Brexit fallout to come for the eurozone and the market remains uninterested in properly pricing in the risks 
At one point  the euro bounced back over the 200DMA versus the U S  dollar 
The U S  dollar fared pretty well in currency trading but ended up fading from 200DMA resistance 
The U S  dollar index erased almost all of June s losses in one day  The 200DMA stands in the way of a gain for the month 
With my focus trained in on bearish opportunities  I am more actively scanning a wider range of stocks  There is still a good variety of setups and some stocks look like they are just getting started into a whole new world of trouble 
See the captions for commentary on some key charts I reviewed today 
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  closed under  700 and teeters above 50DMA support 

First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  continues to sell off from a destructive post earnings 200DMA breakdown  The stock now trades at levels last seen in early October at the beginning of the last major rally 

Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT  makes a very bearish 50 and 200DMA breakdown on high selling volume 

Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  confirmed its 200DMA breakdown with a nasty gap down on volume over twice the average  This breakdown follows high volume selling that marked the 200DMA breakdown 

Microstrategy  NASDAQ MSTR  breaks down from its 200DMA on 2x average volume 

Whirpool  NYSE WHR  has a high dependence on global growth  WHR reversed a 50DMA breakout on volume almost 3x average  The 200DMA is not likely to hold 
Finally  there are the home builders  These stocks should be relatively immune from global shockwaves  However  as cyclical stocks  home builders will get sold 
The post Brexit fallout is about to wash away the nascent bullish refresh that was growing from solid economic data from the sector  I should have an update of my Housing Market Review within a week  I also need to review critical earnings from Lennar  NYSE LEN  and KB Home  NYSE KBH  
The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  is trying to cling to 200DMA support  but it looks again like it is topping out

17118,238633,FCX,As The 2 Company Split Approaches  What s Alcoa s Fair Value ,opinion," NYSE AA  is expected to report earnings on Monday July 11th after the market close  Alcoa shares have been volatile since the company announced  on September 28  2015  its plan to split into two separately traded companies 
The split is expected to commence later this year and has attracted a lot of investor attention  It s a good time to check Alcoa s fair value range with earnings and further spin off news looming 
Aluminum production has been Alcoa s primary business since incorporating in 1888  However  the company has transformed itself into a diversified metals company that makes products for the aerospace  automotive  transportation  and building and construction markets  This new and more attractive business will be renamed as Arconic and trade under the ticker symbol ARNC 
So what s the rationale for the split  Alcoa management expects significant value creation from Arconic s individual price discovery  Alcoa is typically compared to upstream focused aluminum and metal producers such as   NASDAQ CENX     NYSE FCX     NYSE ACH     NYSE NUE  and   NYSE X   The forward EBITDA multiples of this peer group range from 6 4x to 11 3x as shown in the chart below 
The newly formed entity  Arconic  will become a downstream engineering and fabrication company  Alcoa s management hopes that Arconic will trade more in line with publicly listed competitors   NYSE ATI     NYSE B     NYSE CRS     NASDAQ KALU  and   NASDAQ WWD   The forward multiples of this peer group trade at a premium ranging from 8 0x to 20 0x Bullish investors believe that the two separately traded companies will be worth more than the combined entity  By analyzing both charts above  it s easy to see that Alcoa s valuation multiples generally trade below both peer groups implying that shares may be undervalued on a relative basis  Alcoa s stock also looks attractive on a discounted cash flow  DCF  basis for the combined entity 
Using the street s consensus forecast implies that Alcoa may be undervalued by over 25   Note that I use a 7 0x EBITDA exit multiple at the midpoint to calculate a terminal value which is the company s forward multiple 

Investors will have to wait to see what valuation multiples the two separate entities will ultimately trade at  However  long term holders should enjoy knowing that the company currently trades below both the upstream and downstream peer groups 
It s also worth noting that institutional investors are betting that the split will add value for shareholders  Eight of the ten top institutional investors have  since the split was announced  May be worth adding shares as the stock currently trades below pre split prices ",2016-07-06,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/price-tag-check-on-alcoa-200140303,200140303
17119,238634,FCX,Freeport McMoRan Stock  You Shouldn t Be Worried About Today s Dip,opinion,"Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX 
The current market conditions have made finding a strong investment more challenging  However  any time markets are uncertain  there are always opportunities  I ve been digging around and one of the opportunities I ve found is Freeport McMoRan  At the end of the day  the company is in the right market at the right time  Today  we ll talk about why FCX is likely to skyrocket moving forward 
Copper Will Send FCX Skyrocketing
To understand what direction a stock is likely headed in  it s important to understand what the company the stock represents does  When it comes to Freeport McMoRan  the company is in the business of mining basic materials  The flagship product from the company is copper  In fact  the metal makes up over 60  of the company s total revenue  This is a key fact to consider when trading or investing in the stock 
Knowing that FCX largely depends on copper  we now know where to look when determining where the price of the stock is headed  At the moment copper is a great product  Let s face it  it s a hot commodity  In fact  there are three reasons why copper is likely headed up  and when this happens  FCX will realize larger profits on the commodity 
Reason  1  Renewable Energy
The first reason that I m expecting to see big gains in the price of copper  and  therefore  Freeport McMoRan stock  is the global view on energy  In the past  burning fossil fuels seemed like the best way to go  After all  the action was highly productive  So  entire nations did so for years and years 
However  over time we ve seen how the burning of fossil fuels harms the environment  As a result  we re seeing a global shift toward renewable energy  These days we re seeing increased demand for solar  wind  and hydro power  We re even seeing entire solar and wind power farms being constructed around the world  Believe it nor not this is great for FCX 
At the end of the day  if you re going to build anything that has to do with the cultivation and transfer of energy  you re going to need copper   a lot of it  With so much going on in the energy sector around the world  we re seeing ever increasing demand for the metal  As the law of supply and demand tells us  this must send the price of copper upward  So  due to this shift in the energy sector  copper prices will likely continue to rise  increasing profits for FCX 
Reason  2  Asian Interest Rate Expectations Could Support Further Growth
China is the world s second largest economy and largest consumer of basic materials  With that said  if you plan on trading Freeport McMoRan  it s going to be important to watch economic conditions in the region  Most recently  investors have started to expect that the People s Bank of China will reduce its interest rate  As a result  risk appetites among investors in the region will grow  This will likely lead to higher metals prices in the country that consumes the most copper  So naturally  this should send the price of the metal upward 
In a statement  Mitchell Hugers  Commodities Strategist at BMI Research  had the following to offer 

 Easing rates will likely support metals prices in the short term as it will boost risk appetite for investors    

Reason  3  Weakening USD
For some time  the US dollar was seeing massive gains against other currencies  However  throughout the year 2016  we ve seen something very different  The value of the currency has seen declines  Because copper is priced using the USD  this will generally lead to gains  which in turn will help FCX 
Because copper is priced using the USD  when the value of the currency rises  it makes the metal more expensive in nations outside of the United States  However  when the USD falls  copper becomes less expensive around the world  Because of this  the metal becomes more accessible  increasing demand  This sends the price of the metal upward  At the end of the day  as the USD declines in value  profits realized at FCX will climb ",2016-07-19,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freeport-mcmoran-(fcx)-stock:-you-shouldn’t-be-worried-about-today’s-dip-200142603,200142603

T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 day moving averages  DMA   suffered a huge blow as it tumbled from overbought territory and closed at 61 6  on Friday  This move ended four days in overbought status  My T2108 trading rules dictate a bearish trading call whenever T2108 ends overbought status or confirms a failure to enter overbought status  Recent history alone shows how swiftly selling can unfold after such moments 

T2108 takes a big dive out of overbought territory 
This moment is particularly ominous because T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMAs  JUST broke out from a post recession downtrend  Now  that breakout may turn out to be a fake out 
The immediate damage on the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   is mixed  The index lost less than 1   but it did close marginally lower than the day of the jobs report  The drip drip in the upward trending channel through the upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  is over  The uptrending 20 and 50DMAs await opportunities to provide support 
A quick roundtrip through overbought conditions leaves the S P 500  SPY  in limbo between a broken uptrend and nearby support 
Our local friendly Federal Reserve updates monetary policy on June 15th and could provide the timely assistance the market seeks  While there is a zero chance the Fed will hike rates at this meeting  the tension should still be high  Economic fears are running high again since the poor May U S  jobs report  Futures have pushed the next rate hike out to December and bond yields are plunging all over again    Negative territory seems very likely 
The irony here could not get thicker  If the Fed continues to expresses enough confidence in the economy to affirm earlier hawkish commentary  the market will likely continue its sell off  If the Fed once again gives in to the market s fears  reassured traders and investors will express their relief by getting back to business buying all the  bargains  that recent selling has created 

Expectations for the next rate hike are suddenly falling fast  2016 is barely hanging there 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE TLT  has not closed at these levels since February  2015  TLT now marginally exceeds its level when Yellen  inadvertently  suggested rate hikes were off the table for now 
The ironies abound to see how TLT has RALLIED since the Fed implemented its first rate hike  It is as if the market is saying that one rate hike has put the entire economy in peril  Note that I sold my latest TLT call options on Thursday thinking that the small fade from highs indicated another  gap and crap  move 
Volatility is suddenly soaring into the Fed meeting  The VIX gained a whopping 16 3   I am honestly astounded by my good fortune on the timing of my recent purchase of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  
As a reminder  here is what I said to justify the purchase even though my short term trading call at the time was  cautiously bullish  

 I do not have to turn bearish to see this picture and wonder aloud whether this complacency is far too high  the VIX far too low   It is definitely possible that the market is under pricing risk because it now expects the Fed to leave rates alone until at best the end of the year  Yet  time and again  the VIX has failed to stay at these levels for long  The risk reward balance has shifted toward betting on an increase in volatility even if the S P 500 maintains its generally bullish stance by holding support at its 50DMA or even holding the low of the current trading range  


The volatility index  the VIX  jumps to a 3 month closing high 


UVXY shares in the fun with a 18  surge  but its 20DMA remains intact as defining the latest downtrend 
My UVXY call options do not expire until September  but I will very likely lock in the profits on Monday where I expect another gap up in volatility  I have two trading rules working against holding the call options for much longer  1  I tend to sell options if I get at least a double within days of purchase  2  the Fed meetings generally soothe markets and work against volatility  Given  2  I am keen to initiate my anti volatilty pre Fed trade  I will put this trade on either near Tuesday s close or first thing Wednesday morning right before the Fed s announcement  Recall that conventional practice sets 20 on the VIX as the threshold to indicate elevated market fear 
The rise in volatility and drop in interest rates has accompanied a recovery for the U S  dollar index  DXY0   I think the recent bounce confirms the dollar s bottom in May as the rise in fear makes the greenback look better relative to a lot of currency alternatives  It is too early to speculate on whether the dollar can gain enough momentum to breach the last high  The Fed may be the ultimate wildcard on that 

The U S  dollar index has rallied sharply for the past 2 days 
The Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  is still in a bearish position  A fresh low would confirm a bearish trading call for financial markets 

AUD JPY is weak but still holding its trading rage in place since May 
In total  this trading action convinced me I do not need to append  cautiously  to my shift to a bearish trading stance  I think the tone is now set for the summer  Even if markets churn for the rest of the way  I think risk reward will favor fading rallies rather than buying dips  The shift from bullish to bearish will be rough 
As an example  Friday was a telling mix of trades  I started with some bullish moves which could  should   be my last for a while  I finished my plan to get back on the home builder trade with call options on iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  
I thought I was taking advantage of an opportune dip  I also got into my trade on call options for Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  to play what I hope to be a continued pivot around its 50DMA  I even finished building a long position on Verifone Systems Inc  NYSE PAY  which is a play for a presumed imminent post earnings recovery at least back to the lower BB  In coming days  and maybe weeks  I will be looking to unwind almost all my bullish trading positions 
As the bearish case unfolded for the day  I decided to hold onto all my bearish trades except one  the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM   EEM sank 2 5  and closed right on top of converged support at its 2011 low and its 50DMA  The profits on my out sized put position well exceeded the cost of the call options  so I felt comfortable taking this position off the table even though I lined up the trade for July expiration 
Moreover  I still have EEM put options at a  32 50 strike expiring this coming Friday  These are left over from a rare  solo  purchase at the end of May  These puts could at least go breakeven if EEM continues to sell off in the coming week  Needless to say  I will be ready to fade any and all subsequent rallies in EEM 
The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  EEM  ends its latest rally in dramatic fashion 
I will not spend too much more time on other stock charts until we get through the Fed meeting   already include plenty of good bearish trade ideas that still apply now  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is one chart I have not examined in a while that deserves close monitoring no matter what happens with the Fed this week  FB s chart shows a definitive topping pattern 
FB printed an impressive gap up after its last earnings but has failed to sustain any further momentum  The last brief rally failed to generate a new all time high  Friday s selling makes a 50DMA breach look imminent  Also note how trading volume has fallen off a cliff ever since earnings  FB is a market darling  so a failure to sustain momentum is a warning sign  A breakdown that confirms a topping pattern would be a loud alarm bell 

Facebook  FB  is starting to sag

On Friday  crude futures settled above  32 a barrel after surging by more than 8  on the session  The bounce off near 12 year lows took place amid heavy short covering from traders  as prominent energy officials from OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela offered strong hints that the global economy may be unable to absorb oil prices at their current level 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 210 83 or 1 33  to close at 16 093 51  while the NASDAQ Composite index surged 119 12 or 2 66  to 4 591 18  as Apple Inc  O AAPL  provided a boost to both indices  Despite Friday s rally  the Dow remains down by more than 7  on the new year while the NASDAQ has fallen approximately 11  over the last six months  The S P 500 Composite index  meanwhile  gained 37 91 or 2 03  to 1 906 90  as all 10 sectors closed in the green  Stocks in the Energy  Telecommunications and Technology industries led  each rising by more than 2

17127,238642,FCX,China Outflanks Freeport To Further Consolidate The Lithium Ion Battery ,opinion,"Earlier this week  the deal in which China Molybdenum Luoyang Co  HK 3993  agreed to pay Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   2 65 billion for FCX s African copper assets reaffirms our view that asset shedding from the FCX project portfolio will continue  see the press release   
FCX  with a  13B market capitalization  made a bad bet in diversifying into the oil business at the cyclical peak  and now must reckon with roughly  20B in debt on their balance sheet  The debt maturity profile of the company is shown below 

While it s a shame to have to part with such high quality assets  what really caught our eye was the fact that FCX has agreed to negotiate exclusively with China Moly on the FCX cobalt assets  including the Kokkola Cobalt Refinery in Finland 
The potential cash inflow for FCX  forecast at  100 million  clouds the more significant issue of cobalt supply chain control  China is already the world s leading producer of refined cobalt and  should the deal for the Kokkola refinery go through  will acquire another 15 000 tons per year of refined cobalt capacity  as well as 870 million contained pounds of cobalt    in top tier assets in Africa 
Though we don t believe the narrative that there is a cobalt crisis  we do see higher looming cobalt prices as China plays the  long game  to dominate the cobalt supply chain  This makes sound strategic sense when you consider the plan for increased lithium ion battery capacity in China 
One of the greatest misunderstandings about the lithium ion battery space is that Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA  is the only game in town  This couldn t be further from the truth  While TSLA sucks all the oxygen out of the room with the plans for the Gigafactory  similar build outs are happening in Asia   specifically China  Our friends at  have estimated that at least 12 lithium ion  megafactories  are forecast to come online by 2020  with 7 of them located in China 
It is for this reason that we think you ll see higher cobalt prices in the intermediate term  as refined cobalt chemical production will not match the anticipated demand from the battery sector 
Ultimately  we see a great deal of tension in the lithium ion battery space  This is exciting  as it creates disruptive discovery opportunities  TSLA s plan to accelerate production to 500 000 cars per year by 2018 and 1 000 000 per year by 2020  however absurd  is one example 
The friendly take out of lithium ion battery producer SAFT Group by French oil and gas giant Total SA  PA TOTF  for  950 million is a much more significant move  as it shows Big Oil coming to grips with lower oil prices and the need to diversify an existing business model into new markets 
Though we ve mentioned this before  the  200 million raised by lithium exploration and development companies year to date in 2016 is impressive for an oligopolistic industry that only generated slightly over  1 billion in revenues in 2015 
One of the reasons we ve liked the cobalt and lithium stories is that the supply chains aren t  owned  by China in the same way rare earths are  As the dust settles on the FCX China Moly deal  the significance of this latest move should not be lost on us 
China s  top down  strategy of acquiring assets with a vision of controlling the production of ore and higher margin goods along the supply chain is still alive and well  despite the country s economic challenges

17128,238643,FCX,FCX Long Term Reversal  What s Next ,opinion,"Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  is a premier U S  based natural resource company with an industry leading global portfolio of mineral assets  significant oil and gas resources  The company has come into focus this year as it rallied 60  YTD after a multi year downtrend 
 Weekly Chart
Two key takeaways from the 10 year weekly chart  logarithmic scale  
1  The stock is prone to fast moves  Check the velocity of the downtrend in 2008 and 2014 2015 and the uptrend in 2009 and 2016 
2  The stock has a strong history of reacting at support resistance levels  
There was a double top in 2008 and 2011 just above  50  See the 2012 2015 channel between support at  24 and resistance at  37 50  which broke down in late 2014 and got a re test in 2015  Latest example is resistance at  14 
Daily Chart
Zooming in  the daily chart shows the resistance line that got hit on April 29th  Price may be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern with left shoulder at last summer lows  head at January lows and right shoulder about to be made  
A slight pullback to the summer of 2015 low area would shake out a lot of hot money that is currently in the stock and replace it with stronger holders  A minor bottom in that area would make a higher low against the January low and provide a great entry point 
The Trade
There are two options for a bullish trade 
The first one relies on a higher low that would go in line with the head and shoulders pattern  Wait for a minor low to be made and go long against it in anticipation of a breakout above  14 
The second option implies waiting for the resistance line to be broken  This is the textbook version that can still work great  particularly if the stock does not break it while extended on momentum oscillators

17130,238645,FCX,3 Reasons Icahn Is Betting On Freeport McMoRan Inc ,opinion,"Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  is one of the stocks affected by the steep drop in commodity prices  The stock is down about 45  from its one year peak price  However  the stock is up more than 50  in the current year triggering interest in the stock among the investors  Billionaire and activist investor  Carl Icahn  has added further color to it by betting big on it though he could not do much with the commodity price and force the company to do what he wants  However  he could do what is best for the company by forcing actions as the stock is gaining traction for one or other reasons  Let s look at three reasons that Icahn is betting on the company s stock 
 Asset Sales Help Balance Sheet
One of the options available before Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  was the divestment of some of its assets when the market is not going in the expected direction and the outlook is also not so bright  The other thing is to cut down the capital expenditures when the existing facilities did not provide the expected yield  When the market is down  the price realization for such divestment is also bound to be weak only  However  that helps the company in more than one way to cleanse the balance sheet  The maintaining of such assets could itself be a herculean task as there would be only fewer buyers during the crisis time or when the market is trending downwards 
In the current year alone  Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  divested assets worth  4 2 billion  This included the divestment of the Tenke copper Mine for over  2 65 billion in Africa  That does not mean that macro risks have vanished  It is still there and the selling made some of the analysts to be more positive on the stock now than they were earlier in the current year  One of the reasons for it was making accretive asset sales  Also  the sale of assets meant that it returns to the period of a strong free cash flow probably for the first time after the steep drop in the commodity prices  The lower capex and costs also contributed to the favorable sentiments  Last year  the company burnt about  3 1 billion and the expectation for the current year is that it might close with positive cash flow of  1 billion 
 Managing the Debt
It is quite natural that companies like Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  would think about divesting assets only when they don t make profit overall to offset any weakness in any of the divisions  Therefore  there is nothing surprise that the company has suffered a loss of  12 30 a share in the trailing twelve month period  There is little hope that the company might turn to profit anytime soon  Sale of assets resorted by enterprises mainly to cut down their debts  The company has close to  20 8 billion of debt whereas its market cap is only approximately  14 24 billion  The current year selling of assets represented about 20  of its total debt 
Carl Icahn might not remain silent on this and would force Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  to come out with a clear cut plan to reduce the debt and the associated interest costs  Its debt exploded because of McMoRan and Plains buyouts due to the bad timing  While there could be no immediate solution to the debt problem  servicing of it would be a main focus  The company might gain from cost cutting measures  as well as  capex reductions to manage its debt and servicing of it  As the biggest miner  it would stand to gain from any improvements in the copper  gold  and oil prices  There has been a sense of belief that the prices of these commodities have bottomed out and the time is now for stabilization  Also  there is less fear of a downfall in the prices  which should help the company  One of the reasons for it is that the sector is witnessing recovery in prices as the market would shift to deficit later in the current decade  Also  the company stands to gain in Peru  Indonesia  and China despite political risk 
 Growth At The Cost Of Shrinking
Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  s move to sell assets meant that it would have to grow at the cost of shrinking  The company had no alternatives but to follow its rivals like Glenscore to sell assets to raise cash  Now that the billionaire investor  Icahn  entered the scene  certain things would not be easy for its board  Currently  Icahn owns 9  and was activist since August last year  He played a big role in getting the founder removed  It is also quite likely that his role could have been there in getting FCX to look into selling assets to pay down debt  This included its plan to IPO the oil and gas business  which was later shelved  It is not clear whether it is temporary decision or a permanent one  In a nutshell  the company is settling for growth even as their business would shrink 
For Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX   the oil and gas unit was an overhand because it overpaid for McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration four years ago  Therefore  poorly timed IPOs  as well as  asset sales could be detrimental  There is every chance that the abandoned IPO could be revived once the market improves to realize better value  Following the asset sales and the cancellation of the IPO  some of the analysts have boosted their price target to  15 from around  12 
Conclusion
There is no alternative for Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  but to resort to divestment of assets  which were welcomed by investors and analysts  Now that Icahn entered the scene  there would be more progress on reducing the costs  He has representation on the board to ensure that there would be favorable results for investors to cheer

17132,238647,FCX,China Set To Control Crucial Metal For Tesla s Electric Cars,opinion,"Investors are still salivating at the prospects for Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ TSLA  s electric cars   particularly the Model 3 
But is all the anticipated hype really warranted 
There may  in fact  be a bumpy road ahead for the commodity sector and Tesla s future 
Tesla s electric cars require lithium ion batteries to maintain power  These batteries are  in turn  supplied by Tesla s Gigafactory   which remains under construction 
The key components in a lithium ion battery are lithium  graphite  and cobalt  And while Tesla has been reassuring investors that the Gigafactory has  adequate supplies or sources of availability  of these materials  the claim itself seems questionable since Tesla has no definitive offtake agreements with any miners for any of these necessary supplies 
And this is just the tip of the iceberg   the story for Tesla and electric vehicle makers gets even more interesting 
China  which controls the rare earth materials market with roughly 90  share of production  is looking to cut supplies of one of these crucial materials 
China s Cobalt Caper
The material in question is cobalt 
Not only is cobalt a critical element in lithium ion batteries  but it s also used extensively in the manufacturing of smartphones  jet engines  and wind turbines 
In May  China Molybdenum Luoyang Co Ltd  HK 3993    also known as China Moly   announced a  2 65 billion deal with troubled mining company Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  to purchase three crucial cobalt properties 
One such property is Kokkola Cobalt Refinery in Finland  in which China Moly acquired a 56  controlling interest  This refinery supplied over 10  of the world s refined cobalt last year 
But much more importantly  China Moly acquired a 56  controlling interest in the Tenke Fungurume cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  The Tenke mine alone supplies 13  of the world s mined cobalt supply  and holds 25 years of cobalt reserves in its possession 
The Tenke mine also contains one of the world s most extensive copper deposits  In addition to their stake in more than half of the Tenke mine  China Moly also acquired 100  interest in the neighboring Kisanfu copper and cobalt exploration project 
The Congo accounts for about half the world s supplies of cobalt and provides about 93  of China s import of the mineral 
If the deal closes  China will control 62  of global refined cobalt production next year  As Edward Spencer of the metals consultancy CRU explained to the Financial Times   The majority of the cobalt is headed to China  Their global hold is huge  
China Likely to Stay in Control
It s easy to see the motivation for China s interest in cobalt 
Asian battery companies are behind the bulk of the world s current production of lithium ion batteries  And China accounts for more than 90  of lithium ion battery projects in the pipeline 
The single major exception  Tesla s Gigafactory 
Can anything stop China s bold move to control cobalt 
Canada s Lundin Mining Corporation  TO LUN  owns 24  of the Tenke mine and the Kobbalt refinery  It also has the right of first refusal to buy those assets and has hired the Bank of Montreal to help consider its options 
The question remains as to whether a small company like Lundin   with a  3 billion market cap   can swing such a large deal to acquire those cobalt assets  It seems unlikely  unless a partner with deeper pockets steps in to give Lundin the necessary boost 
Thus  the cobalt industry gets even more interesting 
Cobalt Cliff
China s soon to be hold on cobalt is crucial  because the demand for cobalt is expected to soar 62  over the next decade   thanks primarily to increased demand from the battery makers  industry  which has increased demand at an annual rate of 16  over the past decade 
That demand was met so far via increased supplies of cobalt from miners 
But now  those supplies are under pressure 
This is due to the fact that cobalt is often found and mined in conjunction with copper or nickel  With the prices of these base metals plunging  thanks to lower demand from China  cobalt   a by product   will be mined even less 
In fact  the likelihood is high that cobalt supplies in 2016 will be 15  to 25  below this year s demand 
Where are the battery makers like Tesla going to get their cobalt  The situation is drastic enough that it led John Petersen at InvestorIntel to call it a    
Petersen is a lawyer  CPA  consultant  and a thought leader on energy issues  His years of experience in corporate finance  natural resources development  and advanced battery technologies give him a unique perspective 
I wanted to tap some of that knowledge  so I called him to discuss the matter further 
He explained to me that half of global cobalt supplies are used in industries that absolutely must have the metal  Think General Electric  NYSE GE  and its jet engines 
Luckily for companies like GE  cobalt makes up a very small part of costs  So they will be willing to pay whatever the price is for cobalt  The news is not as good for companies like Tesla  where cobalt costs are a higher percentage of production costs 
The effects of the  cobalt cliff   Peterson explained  will be felt most by lithium ion battery makers that are trying to buy the metal in a dwindling market 
Sellers will give priority to long time customers like GE  rather than new kids on the block like Tesla 
Petersen believes supplies of the metal to the battery industry will fall 30  to 50  over the next year  This is not good news for all those eagerly awaiting their Model 3s 
Based on the apparent problems with global cobalt supply and China s growing control over it  it s hard to understand Tesla s complacency 
Maybe Elon Musk believes in miracles  Nothing short of one will ensure that Tesla gets all the cobalt it needs to hold on to its footing in the automotive world ",2016-06-06,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-set-to-control-crucial-metal-for-electric-cars-200134129,200134129

	Oil prices rebounded yesterday after disruptions in Nigeria and Canada reduced crude oversupply worries to a significant extent  A series of militant attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria last week had reduced its crude production to 1 69 million barrels per day  bpd   hitting its lowest level in 22 years  Further  the wildfire that broke out in Fort McMurray  Canada dragged crude output at 1 6 million bpd 

	Moreover  in a monthly report issued yesterday  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  raised its guidance for crude prices as well as production for 2017  According to the report  WTI oil price is expected to increase from previous estimate of  40 58 a barrel to  50 65 per barrel  Both the WTI crude and Brent crude rose 2 7  and 4 2  to  44 66 per barrel and  45 52 a barrel  respectively  The EIA raised its U S  crude oil production forecast from previous estimate of 8 04 million barrels to 8 19 million barrels

17151,238666,FCX,A Close Call For Equities,opinion,"T2108 Status  71 8   overbought T2107 Status  68 2   below post recession downtrend again VIX Status  14 6General  Short term  Trading Call  cautiously bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  82 over 20   Day  81 over 30   Day  78 over 40   Day  12 over 50   Day  11 over 60   Day  4 over 70   overbought 

Thursday was a close call  T2108 closed at 71 8   just barely recovering from a breach of the overbought threshold at 70   A close below this level would have flipped my short term trading bias to bearish per my T2108 trading rules  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 68 2   just below the big post recession downtrend line that gave way just yesterday  I celebrated the big breakout  with caution of course  in the last T2108 Update 
Sellers once again proved unable to muster enough motivation to follow through on an initial advantage  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   made a shallow dip to the bottom of its current uptrend channel   defined by the upper Bollinger Bands  BB    and then neatly bounced back for a minute 0 2  loss on the day 
The S P 500 maintains its upward trending channel 
While sellers fail on the indices  the traditional gauge of fear  the VIX  continued its gains off the bottom of the recent trading range  I am watching closely but will not get concerned until the VIX closes above the 15 35 pivot 
Even then  the VIX needs to break out above the current range  above 17 50 or 18 or so  before fear concern makes a point worth noting  My purchase of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  turned out to be well timed but the gains are minimal so far 
Once again the volatility index  the VIX  cannot rest long at the lows of the recent range  So far  the stock market has not reacted much 
The VIX probably made such a big move relative to the S P 500 because roiling under the surface of the market were some significant downward moves on the day in key sectors and stocks  I even had to open fresh bearish positions because of them  when I am cautiously bullish I allow myself some select bearish trades  
The SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  lost 1 5  as it appeared to fail just below 50DMA resistance  A limit order for put options executed  I am targeting around  40  I do not expect that level to break unless the entire market turns bearish  I have followed this sector more closely ever since one retailer after another produced major stinkers this past earnings cycle 

The near non stop rally from the last low is over SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  has not been the same ever since someone recycled rumors about Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  s  interest in buying the company  That gap up took the stock right to resistance at its 200DMA and now NFLX trades below 50DMA support  If not for the unimpressive selling volume and the steeply upward trending 20DMA  I would be aggressively shorting NFLX here  Still  the 50DMA breakdown IS a bearish signal 

Netflix  NFLX  continues to sell off after the last recycled rumor of Apple s interest in buying the company  Although volume has fallen off a cliff  the close below 50DMA support confirms a newly bearish bias on the stock 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  added to the red on the day with a 1 8  loss  I never got a chance to swing during the run up form the last low  and I waited for the market s reaction to  before deciding to enter  The market s reaction was to buy on the way in and sell on the way out 

The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  decided to sell off on the ASCO news  plus some inopportune earnings news   IBB slammed right into 50DMA support  It is starting to look like an extended trading range is the best traders can expect for now 
Bad economic data from China was blamed for broad based selling in related plays  The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  gapped down for a 1 2  loss that seemed to end a steady run up from the May low   Hmmmm   starting to notice that the sell in May and go away crowd must be getting a bit anxious at this point   I neglected to note in the last T2108 Update that I pulled the trigger on a fresh strangle position on EEM  out of the money call and put options  
The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  EEM  finally runs into a wall  gaps down  and has likely topped out for now 
Copper is the main driver for Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   A nasty plunge in copper helped pushed FCX close to a year 2000 and all time low  Since then  the stock has increased an incredible 3x  That run up ended with April 
In its place is churn around 50DMA support  After watching this a while  I am thinking of how best to play the range  I am getting ready to buy call options  on top of an existing position of shares bought a while ago  as my first attempt  As part of the China driven pullback  FCX lost 5 9  on a gap down 


I am taking a fresh interest in trading Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX   The stock is carefully pivoting around its 50DMA ever since May took the steam out of its recovery from prices last seen at the all time lows in November  2000 
Iron ore plays also took a beating on the day  BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP  gapped down and ended the day with a 5 6  loss  Like FCX  BHP is pivoting around its 50DMA  However  I think BHP is setting up for a fresh breakdown 
Since April s high  selling volume has overwhelmed buying volume  The volume on Thursday s gap down was particularly large  and it left behind a small abandoned baby top  As part of my dynamic pairs trade strategy  I faded BHP on the latest rally and now hold a substantial short paired with call options on Rio Tinto  LON RIO  and now hedged with call options on BHP 

BHP Billiton Limited  BHP  gapped down 5 6  on heavy selling volume  The stock continues to pivot around its 50DMA and now its 200DMA 
RIO did not lose as much as BHP  Its 3 9  loss did not come with out sized selling volume  However  RIO is struggling to overcome 50DMA resistance  With the 200DMA now bearing down  RIO looks headed for a fresh sell off  On the flip side  a breakout above the double resistance could be a lot more sustainable than the last one 
So I REALLY like buying call options on RIO as part of the pairs trade with BHP as it sets up a combination with a lot of upside potential on either a fresh sell off or a big breakout 
Rio Tinto  RIO  is not quite as fortunate as FCX or BHP as April s high bled into a 50DMA breakdown that continues to hold

17179,238694,FCX,3 Stocks To Watch  ABX  CPXX  INGN,opinion,"It was an interesting day on Wall Street on Wednesday  We were up  we were down  and then we took off after the FOMC meeting  Be careful Thursday and Friday  because oftentimes we see a reversal take place as the market goes in the opposite direction  That may be  but when I pour over hundreds of thousands of charts  I see a lot of charts with major bottoming type patterns  I think the market is going to get pretty full and the shorts are going to get squeezed  and then they could be off to the races  I m not discounting the fact that we are a little extended 
Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  is an example of the gold stocks  A base  breakout  a big run up  resistance up in that zone  and on Wednesday  it blew right through that after consolidating  up 99 cents to 15 18  or 7   on 30 million shares  This looks like the channel up  I think we could see 16 17  maybe even 18  short term  Keep an eye on this on Thursday as it could run 
Celator Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ CPXX  had two consecutive big days with a breakaway gap on Tuesday  it followed through on Wednesday  and then backed off  up 44 cents to 9 38  or 5   on 21 million shares  Going forward the targets are 15 16 on this stock 
Inogen  Inc   NASDAQ INGN  is doing well  up 18 cents to 41 53  on 397 600 shares traded  The big pop we highlighted on Tuesday  exploded on big drug news  and then had an inside day on Wednesday  When you have an inside day like this stock had  it s very positive  I think this stock will make more progress in the 36  and then 39 zones

17180,238695,FCX,Time To Long Term Hedge Oil,opinion,"Crude oil prices are finding some support on the possibility that the oil supply will start to tighten in the future  Not only is the market speculating that we will see OPEC and non OPEC nations agree to freeze output  but the reality that large oil companies are not replacing their reserves 
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that   The world s biggest oil companies are draining their petroleum reserves faster than they are replacing them   a symptom of how a deep oil price decline is reshaping the energy industry s priorities   The Journal reports   in 2015  the seven biggest publicly traded Western energy companies  including Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   replaced just 75  of the oil and natural gas they pumped  on average  according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of company data  It was the biggest combined drop in inventory that companies have reported in at least a decade   For Exxon  2015 marked the first time in more than two decades it didn t fully replace production with new reserves  according to the company  It reported replacing 67  of its 2015 output  
The Journal story is disturbing because it seems that the movement by big oil to not replace reserves means that we are laying the groundwork for a price spike in the future  When oil companies fail to replace reserves  they almost always over compensate for short term drop in oil prices  What is more  it is beginning to look more likely that in the foreseeable future we will see an even larger drop in oil company s reserves  The drain game has begun and more than likely it will continue 
USA Today reported that   the depletion of old oil wells is expected to surpass new sources of supply in 2016  as the ongoing oil price slump puts a long list of oil projects on the shelf  Bloomberg flagged new data from the Norwegian consultancy firm Rystad Energy  which predicts that legacy production will tip the supply balance into the negative in 2016 for the first time in years   The production from an average conventional oil field typically ramps up in the early years  plateaus and then enters a period of decline  Depletion rates vary wildly from field to field  but a rule of thumb for conventional oil fields   which make up the bulk of total global supply   is that they decline something like 6 percent per year on average  Again  those depletion rates can differ depending on location  levels of investment  etc   but one thing that is clear is that the oil industry needs to bring new oil fields online every year in order to merely keep production flat  
Energy estimates that the crash in oil prices has cut into upstream investment so severely that natural depletion rates will overwhelm the paltry new sources of supply in 2016  Existing fields will lose about 3 3 million barrels per day  mb d  in production this year  while new fields brought online will only add 3 mb d  This does not take into account rising oil demand  which will soak up most of the excess supply by the end of the year 
But the 3 mb d of new supply in 2016 will mostly come from large offshore projects that were planned years ago  investments that were made before oil prices started crashing  The EIA sees four offshore projects starting up in 2016   projects from Shell  Noble Energy  NYSE NBL   Anadarko  NYSE APC  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX    plus two more in 2017  The industry completed eight projects in the Gulf in 2015  U S  Gulf of Mexico production will climb from 1 63 mb d in 2016 to 1 91 mb d by the end of 2017 
This comes as the U S  rig count resumes its plunge  Baker Hughes reported that the oil rig count fell 15 to 372 this week the lowest total since the week of November 13  2009  Oil last week fell after Baker Hughes report that we broke the 13 week of lower rigs  Now the big drop is another sign that U S  oil output will slow 
Long term there is a seismic change in the future production outlook  Historically this has always led to higher prices down the road  This is the time to put on long term hedges and lock in what could be close to the lowest prices we may see for decades ",2016-03-28,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-03-28-2016-200123028,200123028

17207,238722,FCX,Freeport  FCX   What s in Store this Earnings Season ,opinion,"Freeport McMoRan Inc    NYSE FCX   is set to release first quarter 2016 results ahead of the bell on Apr 26 
Last quarter  the mining company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85 71   Freeport has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  while missing in the other two with an average negative surprise of 6 13  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Watch For
Freeport reported a loss of  3 47 per share for fourth quarter 2015  compared with a loss of  2 75 a year ago  The results include net charges of  4 1 billion or  3 45 per share mainly related to the reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties  Barring that impact  adjusted net loss was 2 cents a share in the fourth quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 14 cents 
For 2016  Freeport expects consolidated sales to be around 5 1 billion pounds of copper  1 8 million ounces of gold  73 million pounds of molybdenum and 57 6 barrels of oil equivalent  MMBOE   For the first quarter of 2016  the company expects 1 1 billion pounds of copper  200 000 ounces of gold  19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12 4 MMBOE 
Freeport is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts  where it currently operates  Favorable exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America  and in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district 
Freeport continues to progress with its expansion initiatives in Latin America  At Cerro Verde  Peru  a large scale concentrator expansion project started operations in Sep 2015  The  4 6 billion project would provide incremental annual production of around 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning 2016 
Freeport is taking aggressive actions  including assets sales and deferral of capital spending amid a challenging operating environment  The company is actively managing costs and capital expenditures in a bid to strengthen its balance sheet 
Moreover  Freeport s board is currently undertaking a strategic review of its oil and gas business to assess alternatives designed to enhance value for the company s shareholders  A depressed oil price environment is hurting Freeport s oil and gas business  The company is also taking actions to increase its debt reduction plans and enhance shareholder value through asset sales and joint venture transactions 
However  Freeport s copper business remains affected by the sluggish global economy and supply related issues  The difficult market conditions in Europe are still affecting copper markets 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Freeport is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients   
Zacks ESP   for Freeport is  6 25  as the Most Accurate Estimate is currently at a loss of 15 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 16 cents 
Zacks Rank  Freeport holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement   
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies in the basic materials sector you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Barrick Gold Corp    NYSE ABX   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd    NYSE AEM   has an Earnings ESP of  50  and a Zacks Rank  3 Air Products and Chemicals  Inc    NYSE APD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 56  and a Zacks Rank  2

17224,238739,FCX,U S  stocks close week broadly lower  amid vague August jobs report,news,"Investing com    U S  stocks fell sharply on Friday as an inconclusive August jobs report provided investors with two more weeks of uncertainty before the Federal Reserve decides whether it will raise short term interest rates later this month 
A strong jobs figure in Friday s report from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics may have convinced the Federal Open Market Committee that conditions were ripe for its first interest rate hike since 2006  But U S  non farm payrolls for August only ticked up by 173 000  far below consensus estimates of a 223 000 gain  Still  a September rate hike likely remains on the table after the U S  employment rate fell to 5 1   its lowest level since April  2008 
The possibility of an imminent rate hike pushed stocks lower  as the major indices erased most of the gains from its previous two sessions  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 272 38 or 1 66  to 16 102 38  ending the week lower while the NASDAQ Composite index lost 49 58 or 1 05   closing lower for the fourth time in five sessions  All three major indices remained in negative territory for the year 
The S P 500 Composite index  meanwhile  dipped 29 91 or 1 53  to 1 921 22  as all 10 sectors closed in the red  Stocks in the Basic Materials  Financials and Energy industries lagged  each closing by at least 1 75  on the session 
The top performer on the Dow was Boeing Company  NYSE BA   which lost 0 74 or 0 56  to close at 130 28  All 30 components on the Dow closed in the red  Shares in Boeing  NYSE BA  are relatively flat for the year  The worst performer on the Dow was EI du Pont de Nemours and Company  NYSE DD   which fell 1 56 or 3 09  to 49 00

Top oil officials from Russia  Saudi Arabia  Qatar  and Venezuela met in Doha and have agreed to freeze crude output at January levels  targeting a supply glut that s sent prices to 13 year lows  According to the International Energy Agency  Saudi Arabia produced 10 2 million barrels per day last month  below its most recent peak of 10 5 million barrels per day set in June 2015  Russia produced nearly 10 9 million barrels per day in January  a post Soviet record 
To be clear  the idea is to freeze production at those levels  not cut production  January levels of oil output would most likely keep global supplies running faster than demand for months to come  if not longer  There really wasn t much incremental production expected from Russia  Qatar and Venezuela for the rest of this year  given these countries are already stretching their production limits 
Iran was absent from the Doha meeting  and no surprise why  The Islamic Republic is planning to ramp up shipments as it looks to regain market share lost after years of international sanctions  Over the weekend  Tehran sent its first cargo of oil to Europe since the end of sanctions last month  and announced plans to boost production and exports by 1 million barrels per day in 2016 
Oil prices jumped up at news of the meeting  which was seen as an effort to stem the oversupply that has been driving down crude oil prices and shaking world commodity and stock markets  But those gains were largely erased later after word that the four nations had agreed only to freeze output rather than cut it

Bad loans at Chinese banks are at their highest level in nearly a decade  Nonperforming loans at Chinese banks surged 51  year over year to  1 2 trillion  hitting their highest level since June 2006  McKinsey Global Institute reports half of all loans are linked  directly or indirectly  to China s overheated real estate market  unregulated shadow banking accounts for nearly half of new lending  and the debt of many local governments is probably unsustainable 
The Bank of Korea kept policy on hold  South Korea s central bank held its key interest rate at 1 50   as expected  The Bank of Korea said the economies of both the US and the Eurozone appeared to have  weakened somewhat  and the Chinese economy continued to slow 
This was one of those days when bad news was good news  The thinking goes as follows  If the Japanese economy shrank by 0 4  in the final three months of 2015 and Chinese exports fell by more than 11   policymakers will sit up and take notice  Central banks will stimulate activity by cutting interest rates  even when they are already negative  and by expanding their quantitative easing  QE  programs 
Right on cue  Mario Draghi popped up before the European parliament to administer a bit of his own soothing balm  ECB President Mario Draghi says the European Central Bank  will not hesitate to act  to boost its stimulus in March if it believes recent financial market turmoil or lower oil prices could weigh further on consumer prices 
Most analysts now expect the ECB to cut its already negative deposit rate   charged to banks for storing funds at the central bank   by at least another 0 1 percentage points in March  to minus 0 4   and to accelerate its bond purchase program  which is currently running at  60 billion a month

How much did VW managers know about the company s emissions scandal and when did they know it  Reuters reports that a high ranking employee warned senior Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  managers in May 2014 that U S  regulators might examine car engine software as part of an investigation into pollution levels  The notice came in the form of a letter  which was sent more than a year before the German automaker s public admission that its cars had been equipped with software to manipulate emission test results 
Freeport McMoran  N FCX  has agreed to sell an additional 13  stake in its Morenci mine to Sumitomo Metal Mining  OTC SMMYY   Japan s second biggest copper producer  for  1 billion in cash  The deal will take Sumitomo s share in the Arizona based open pit copper mining complex to 28  from 15  
Freeport expects to record a gain of about  550 million on the transaction and expects it to close in mid 2016  Morenci is Freeport s biggest mine by production and the largest copper mine in North America  In short  Morenci is Freeport s crown jewel asset with the biggest copper reserves and the longest mine life 
Mining companies have had a hard time lately  and copper prices have taken a big hit  but if you are trying to figure out what went wrong at Freeport McMoRan  look no further than the oil market  It wasn t too long ago that Freeport was a miner  But in 2013  when oil prices were high  it bought McMoRan Exploration Co  and Plains Exploration for roughly  9 billion  In the end  the deal led to an explosion in Freeport s debt  which stood at nearly  20 billion at the end of 2015 
Before the big oil deal  debt was only about  3 5 billion  Putting some perspective on those two numbers  debt as a percentage of the capital structure was 15  before the acquisitions and over 60  at the end last year  The stock is down over 80  since the start of 2013  Rounding  to keep the math easy  Freeport went from a  40 billion market cap company to around a  7 billion cap  That s more than  30 billion lost 
In the press release  Freeport McMoRan stated   This transaction represents an important initial step toward our objective to accelerate debt reduction and restore our balance sheet   So  while most investors were thinking about whether Freeport McMoRan will be able to sell its oil and gas assets  the company came up with a deal to sell a part of its key copper asset 
Freeport McMoRan itself stated multiple times that good copper assets are very hard to find  but now the company is selling its copper assets to get rid of the debt created by the oil asset purchase  And what happens to Freeport McMoran if oil prices stay low for longer than expected  Will they end up selling off all of their valuable copper assets to pay for their bets on oil

Apollo Global Management is part of a consortium of private equity investors who have bid on Apollo Education Group  the parent company of University of Phoenix  but it might not be a done deal  Schroders Plc  L SDR   Apollo Education Group s largest shareholder  plans to vote against a  1 1 billion takeover 
The U K  firm  which spoke to Apollo Education s management last week  said that based on the limited information it has access to  a price tag of  9 50 per share  significantly undervalued  the company s assets  First Pacific Advisors LLC  the second biggest investor in Apollo Education  with a holding of about 7 percent  told its clients that a deal valued at  1 billion  would be unquestionably rejected  by the firm 
According to a new 13F filing  Alibaba  N BABA  owned 33 million shares of Groupon  O GRPN  at the end of the fourth quarter  a stake valued at  95 million  While the disclosure fuels speculation that Alibaba could try to acquire Groupon  it should be noted the company has taken stakes in many American firms without fully acquiring them 
HSBC has decided to keep its headquarters in Britain  rejecting the option of moving back to its main profit generating hub in Hong Kong following a 10 month review  The unanimous decision by the bank s board gives a boost to London s status as a global financial center  which has faced challenges from tougher regulation since the financial crisis  Analysts had estimated the cost of moving out of London at up to  2 5 billion 
Stock repurchase plans have exploded over the last few years  thanks to cheap money following the Fed s zero interest rate policy of the last few years  According to data from FactSet  over the 12 month period ending last September   566 billion was spent on share repurchases  nearly 65  of net income 
In the trailing 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2015  130 companies had a buyback to net income ratio that exceeded 100   And that begs the question of how those companies are investing for future growth  It also begs the question of how individual investors can value earnings per share growth 
Buybacks can paint a deceptive picture of corporate growth because it shrinks share count and makes earnings per share look stronger than they really are  For example  if a company s net income is  10 million and shrinks its outstanding shares by 5 percent to 19 million from 20 million shares  its reported EPS jumps to  0 53 from what would have been  0 50  yielding EPS that is 6 percent higher even though net income hasn t changed at all

Today  Kashkari made his debut speech as Minneapolis Fed President and he said   While significant progress has been made to strengthen our financial system  I believe the  Dodd Frank  Act did not go far enough   adding that the nation s biggest banks remain too big to fail and pose significant risk to the economy  Kashkari said that policymakers must give serious consideration to breaking up banks  Another idea is to turn large banks into public utilities  by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can t fail  
Another idea is to tax leverage throughout the financial system  to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie   he said   Large banks must be able to make mistakes  even very big mistakes  without requiring taxpayer bailouts and without triggering widespread economic damage   Kashkari says the Minneapolis Fed will develop a plan to end too big to fail banks and make it public by the end of the year 
Goldman Sachs Asset Management says the worst of the credit market selloff is probably over and it s now waiting for a sign that the situation has stabilized so it can plow cash back into U S  junk bonds and other corporate debt  Credit went into meltdown this year as questions mounted around the efficacy of central bank policies and the ability of China s government to stem capital outflows while maintaining economic growth 
The selloff pushed spreads on high grade and junk rated company bonds in the U S  to levels unseen in at least 3 1 2 years  Goldman s research suggests that once sentiment becomes less negative  the  magnetism  of the yields on offer will draw investors back  We ve been through the worst of the adjustment and you should start looking for things to buy 
They re not quite sure when you should start buying  maybe a month  maybe a little longer  Given that they ve gotten 5 of their 6 beginning of year calls wrong so far  Goldman s credibility isn t great  But in 2007  there was a bounce in subprime from March to May  and in 2008  the self congratulatory  Mission Accomplished  post Bear phase  which lasted till about July  So near term moves are anyone s guess  What we do know is that Goldman is happy to sell  so their message is buy

Copper is edging up for several days already  China increased its import to 440 thousand tonnes in January which is 5 3  above the level of the same month last year  Another positive factor for most nonferrous metals is the general rebound in the global stock markets which started on Friday on the improved retail sales in USA  Will the copper prices continue rising 
China accounts for 45  of the global copper production so its economic data have significant influence on the copper prices  China s bank lending soared to the record 2 51trn yuan in January  the data came out on Tuesday  This is far above the forecasted increase of 1 9trn yuan  Money supply rose 14  year on year which is also above the expected increase of 13 5   Market participants assume the Bank of China may continue giving monetary stimulus to the economy  Finally  this may support the economy s expansion and the demand for copper  However  the major British bank Standard Chartered  L STAN  claimed on Tuesday it was expecting the contracted imports of this metal to China  In fact  the price growth halted on this news that day  Among the positive factors are the plans of Glencore  L GLEN   Antofagasta  L ANTO   Freeport McMoran  N FCX  to limit the copper smelting volumes due to the low commodities prices 

On the daily chart Copper  D1 is moving sideways and is retracing from the 7 year low hit in mid January 2016  The Parabolic indicator is still giving sell signal  MACD has formed no signals as its histogram bars are too low  RSI is on the rise and above 50 having formed the positive divergence  The Bollinger bands  have contracted a lot which means lower volatility  The bullish momentum may develop in case the copper surpasses the last fractal high  the Bollinger band and the Parabolic signal at 2 138  This level may serve the point of entry  The most risk averse traders may wait for the prices to surpass the 1st Fibonacci retracement and the upper bpunday of the ascending channel at 2 178  The initial risk limit may be placed below the 7 year low at 1 938  Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals  Thus  we are changing the probable profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  The most risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop loss level at 1 938 without reaching the order at 2 138 or 2 178  we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account 
Position Buy Buy stop above 2 138 or 2 178 Stop loss below 1 938",2016-02-17,IFC Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/technical-analysis-c-copper-:-2016-02-17-200118588,200118588

Japan s January trade figures were woeful with a 12 9  decline in exports and an 18  collapse in imports  This is more fodder for those who think Japan s economy is a disaster waiting to happen  The Nikkei 225 has come off the day s highs  but the focus from Japanese trader s remains on the CNY fix  which was fixed at 6 5152  85 pips weaker  today  as well as the likelihood of monetary easing from the Bank of Japan in March  Betting on further easing in March is a 50 50 outcome  but if they don t ease in March  they will in April 
Chinese inflation eased on both the consumer and producer prints and this is a positive as it lowers real lending rates in China for businesses  The mainland equity markets continue to be well bid with a key focus on fiscal measures and talk around infrastructure investment rising 15

17244,238759,FCX,After Its Surprise Dividend Cut  What s Next For BHP Billiton ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
In yet another sign of the ongoing carnage that s been following in the wake of the continuing commodities slump  yesterday  BHP Billiton  N BHP   the world s largest mining company  reported a loss of  5 7B for the first half of its financial year  down from a profit of  4 3B last year over the same period  That s a  10B slip in profitability 
BHP operates a coal and metals division as well as a petroleum division which produces more than 250 million barrels of oil a year  Its total value currently stands at over  63B on the NYSE  The existing company is a result of the merger of UK listed Billiton and Australia based BHP back in 2001 
In response to the profits slide  BHP announced yesterday it will cut its interim dividend by 74   from  0 62 to just  0 16  something it had recently said   While this move may seem drastic  particularly given what Australia s  calls  the company s  progressive  dividend policy  which guaranteed dividends would never fall  had been abandoned   we believe it s a wise decision 

The pressure on the company to address its dividend policy has been mounting over the past months  BHP hasn t reduced its dividend since 2001 and indeed  has been regularly increasing it  apart from a brief  stagnant period during the financial crisis of 2008 
However  the prolonged metals slump  combined with the recent oil collapse forced their hand  Last month  Standard   Poor s downgraded the company s rating from  A   to  A   citing the current state of commodity prices  Additionally  the ratings firm acknowledged it would consider downgrading the company yet again if it fails to satisfactorily cut back on its dividend 
Analysts were expecting a cut of about 50   which makes the actual dividend slash an even more prudent management decision  According to the   company representatives said   The move would safeguard its balance sheet during what it expects will be a  prolonged  period of low commodity prices  
Although this measure appears harsh  the company stated it strongly remains committed to cash returns to shareholders  and that the current cut in the dividend merely reflects the hardship the miner has gone through over the past few months  Cutting the dividend allows BHP to distribute a cash return totaling  858 million  covered by its free cash flow of  1 2B and maintain much needed flexibility going forward 
The dividend reduction shows that the company is willing to admit that contrary to earlier expectations  BHP has been more seriously effected by commodity prices than initially thought  It also shows that the company remains focused on the long term health of its balance sheet and its business in general 
So what happens after this type of public  body blow   In its  announcing the cut  BHP stated that the current environment should create opportunities going forward  and that the company is in a position of strength  ready to take advantage of ongoing conditions 
This position of strength could mean the company is well situated to acquire struggling competitors  should their stock prices and market caps continue to fall over the coming months  Indeed  BHP s Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said that 

     acquisitions  would clearly get preference relative to organic investments that could wait  

Investors have reacted to the bad news  The company s shares are currently down 3 4  in pre market US trading  and as of this writing  down 4 3  in the UK  where it trades under the ticker  L BLT    currently pricing the stock at  24 44 and  760 6p  respectively 

The future of the commodity industry is uncertain given recent market conditions  but a few key acquisitions perhaps copper and gold miner Freeport McMoran  N FCX   according to market speculation could cement BHP s place as an industry leader ",2016-02-23,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-its-surprise-dividend-cut,-what's-next-for-bhp-billiton-200119200",200119200

17247,238762,FCX,5 Stocks With Short Squeeze Potential,opinion,"Short Selling Has Beaten Down These Stocks
Short selling provides a counterbalance to the integrity of the stock market  but sometimes  when the selling is too extreme  it also works to provide an anchor for the long side to help drive up stocks 
As a trader  it is a lot easier to turn a good trade from the long end than short end  especially as the stock market bias becomes bullish 
In the previous visit  I discussed the bearish situation with heavily shorted Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  after a short was placed on the stock by well known short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research  who made a nice gain 
Yet at the same time  Valeant could easily surge if the company can convince investors they have it wrong  If this happens  the short sellers will be rushing for the exits  pushing up the share price 
Heavily shorted stocks are worth a look for traders due to the upside potential if the stock market has it wrong on the company 
Five Heavily Shorted Stocks
Look at the trading action of massively shorted copper and oil play Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   The heavily indebted materials stock surged from  3 52 on January 20 to  10 50 on March 4  up close to 200  in two weeks as the shorts rushed to cover 
As of January 29  there was a staggering 222 71 million shorted shares of FCX representing 21 75  of the float  In a one month period  45 million short positions were added  In this case  it was not that the stock market got it wrong on   rather  it was that the shorts got squeezed by a rally in oil and copper prices  The company is a dud that is laden with massive debt and overpriced assets  but the shorts make it an intriguing trade  especially if oil and copper prices can resume their rise 


In the energy patch  I recently talked about Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE NYSE CHK   which has skyrocketed more than 200  in a month on massive short covering 
As I said in the article  Chesapeake is hemorrhaging for air  It is surging not because there is optimism for its future  but because oil has rallied and there was an astounding 224 8 million shorted shares as of January 29  representing a massive 43 84  of the float  Further rises in oil prices will make life difficult for short sellers  but they will put a smile on those brave enough to trade from the long side either via the stock or call options 
Another prospect for a short squeeze that has yet to materialize is troubled Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc  NYSE LL   which is facing massive short selling after findings revealed high levels of cancer causing chemicals in its Chinese made laminate 
Hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson just re entered into a new short position on LL stock and said there was 50 50 chance of a bankruptcy 
LL stock is trading at  11 89  just north of its low of  10 01 on February 29 and well down from its 52 week high of  37 78 in March 2015  Now  if the company can address and rectify the concerns including what could be massive lawsuits which may be a long shot the share price could surge  based on 8 74 million shorted shares  or 45 09  of the float  as of January 29  


For those with an inclination for risk and who are leaning toward the stock rebounding  you could consider playing a stock like LL via call options that extend from March to January 2018  For instance  if you believe in the long term survival of LL  the January 2018  10 call is available at  5 20  This means that if LL recovers and bounces back to above  15 20 by January 2018  you would be inline for some potentially nice gains 
Finally  there s gourmet hamburger operator Shake Shack Inc  NYSE SHAK   which I suggested was way overvalued in a commentary last year when the stock was trading at around  70 00  The stock is now languishing at  36 00 after disappointing metrics  Even with the selling  I still feel Shake Shack is overvalued and vulnerable to more selling 
Of course  if I m wrong or if the momentum traders emerge  Shake Shack could surge  as 67 06  of the float was shorted as of January 29  


The bottom line is that there are always overpriced stocks at play that are intriguing as shorts  However  investors need to be aware that the massive short positions make them prone to price surges  Due diligence is key here ",2016-03-11,George Leong,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-with-short-squeeze-potential-200121242,200121242

Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc  NASDAQ BUFF  is a swing trade that was put on Monday because of the way it is setting up  It popped and pulled back at the end of the day  It looks like it did want to take off and go  It was up 59 cents to 24 00  or 2 5   on nearly a million shares  It popped right at the close  That may be a signal that something is on for Tuesday  Resistance is at the 24 30 level  So  we ll be watching 24 30  50  If it can get through that  this stock may be a runner  It looks very strong 
3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  had a very good day on huge volume  It was up a whopping 2 90 to 14 45  or 25   on 17 2 million shares  There is resistance in the 14 97 zone  We are expecting a follow through  If it gets one  the targets are 17  and then 21  With 9 4 days to cover this could accelerate 
Himax Technologies Inc  NASDAQ HIMX  has a swing trade that is acting well  I like when it broke out of the base and pulled back  Now it s moving forward  It was up 41 cents to 10 97  or 3 88   on 4 4 million shares  on Monday  closing just 2 cents off the high  Targets going forward are 11 3 4  and 13  On a longer term basis it could see 16  so keep an eye on this one

The top performer on the S P 500 was Marathon Petroleum Corporation  NYSE MPC   which added 2 60 or 4 85  to 55 86  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  finished as the worst performer after plunging more than 12 25  to 10 22  as the China sell off crushed commodities during Tuesday s session  Shares in Freeport  one of the world s largest producers of gold and copper  are down nearly 70  over the last 52 weeks

17305,238820,FCX,U S  Q3 Earnings  Winners  Losers  Lessons For Q4 And 2016,opinion,"By Jesse Cohen
As Q3 2015 earnings season winds down  and with investor awareness mostly focused elsewhere for the duration  on global growth concerns and prospects of a Fed rate hike this third quarter earnings season appears to have slipped somewhat under the radar 
But for those paying attention  there were some notable surprises and disappointments  and perhaps a few growing signs of specific industry and economic paradigm shifts 
So who were the biggest winners and losers of the season  And what were some of the key themes that influenced corporate balance sheets 
Bleak Overall Picture
In total  1 522 of the companies on Wall Street beat earnings expectations in the third quarter  a 59 3  beat rate That sounds pretty impressive  till you consider this additional fact  785 stocks missed estimates this season  a 30 6  miss rate  Plus  260 companies reported earnings that simply met expectations 
In comparison  during the same period last year  a whopping  were able to surpass estimates 
Source  Bespoke Investment Group
All told  that makes this third quarter earnings season  
According to Leigh Drogan of Estimize  a financial estimates platform that aggregates the fundamental performance estimates of independent buy  and sell side analysts  at the start of this earnings season  the Estimize community expected  earnings per share  EPS  to decrease 2 2  for the quarter and revenues to decline 1 7   
With the bulk of results now announced  year over year  growth in earnings per share of S P 500 companies was about minus 2 5   with revenue down 3 1   the second straight quarter of negative earnings growth  which is otherwise known as an  earnings recession  

Providing another cause for concern  the number of companies which downgraded their future earnings outlook during the third quarter rose by a hefty 30  compared to the same period a year earlier  meaning that corporate earnings next year will be even less impressive 
On the flip side  only 6  of Wall Street companies guided higher  compared to the year ago period 

The bleak performance came as U S  corporations faced significant headwinds from a stronger dollar  slumping oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the global growth outlook  especially in China and Europe 

Biggest Disappointments  Energy  Basic Materials
The bulk of the earnings declines came from the energy and basic materials sectors as oil and metal prices tumbled to multi year lows  The biggest losers in the energy space were Chevron  N CVX   Chesapeake Energy  N CHK   NRG Energy  N NRG   Consol Energy  N CNX   while Freeport McMoran  N FCX  and Joy Global  N JOY  were basic materials laggards 
In terms of downside surprises  quarterly results from  and  fell significantly short of analyst expectations  due mostly to the depressed commodity price environment  while  on the back of depressed copper and silver prices  which have lost 29  and 17  respectively on the year 
Energy and materials may be a better story next quarter since expectations are now so low  but weak commodity prices will continue to weigh on shares in these sectors 
Retail Sector Paradigm Shift
The retail sector saw some pretty dismal earning reports as well  alongside a brewing shift away from brick and mortar retailers in favor of the growing e commerce juggernaut  Mall based retailers experienced a slowdown in sales  especially now that the strong dollar limits the spending power of international customers 
Macy s  N M   Nordstrom  N JWN   Gap  N GPS  and Urban Outfitters  O URBN  were some of the big name disappointments this quarter  Walmart  N WMT   which has struggled mightily this year due to increasing competition from Amazon O AMZN   surprised with an earnings beat 
However  this was after Wall Street lowered expectations for the retailer s results  Indeed  the company s most recent guidance calls for no sales growth and profit per store falling by 12  next year due to increased costs 
One of the more prevalent themes of the Q3 earnings season was the diverging performance between the brick and mortar retailers and the online retailers  such as Amazon and Alibaba  N BABA   which both reported robust earnings growth 
The trend is likely to continue into the all important Q4 holiday shopping season  as online shoppers outnumbered brick and mortar counterparts over the Black Friday weekend  According to the   more than 103 million people shopped online over the four day weekend  compared with fewer than 102 million who ventured into traditional stores 
Adding to the potential for additional brick and mortar pain  high inventory levels and excessive markdowns are expected to keep the pressure on traditional retailers  fourth quarter gross margins 
Technology Triumphs
Elsewhere  many big name technology companies reported stellar quarterly numbers for the June September period  Apple  O AAPL   Google parent Alphabet  O GOOGL   Microsoft  O MSFT  and Facebook  O FB  are just a few to report blowout results 
Apple s results were boosted by soaring demand for its iPhone in China  Alphabet shares hit an all time high thanks to strong growth in its mobile search business  Microsoft climbed due to upbeat results at its cloud based business  while Facebook rallied on the back of robust video ad revenue 
This follows the already year long uptrend in the tech sector  specifically among the    Facebook Amazon Netflix Google   Apple  a double entry within this acronym  is often swapped out with Amazon in the  A  portion of the phrase 
Perhaps one of the biggest surprises in the tech space was eBay  O EBAY   which   after reporting third quarter profit and sales that topped expectations  The online shopping marketplace  which recently spun off its PayPal  O PYPL  division  also raised its full year outlook and bought back  599 million of its own stock 
Q4 Outlook  Headwinds But Nothing Alarming
Looking forward  the outlook for the fourth quarter earnings season is rather bleak  Market analysts expect another quarter of negative earnings growth  which would be the third in a row 
Still  says Brian Gilmartin  all is not as dismal as it may seem   Investors should expect 5  7  core earnings growth ex Energy and ex Apple in Q4  15  Financials will likely have a decent quarter  with Thomson Reuters expecting 12  growth and Factset expecting 10  growth  
Corporate results will continue to face headwinds from a stronger U S  dollar  The currency could strengthen even further in the year ahead if the Fed does indeed raise interest rates in mid December as expected  Goldman Sachs predicts the dollar and euro will soon hit parity  falling from  1 09 today 
In addition  feeble global growth prospects will further weigh on earnings  especially for multinational corporations which do the bulk of their business abroad  Companies with less exposure to foreign sales will continue to do better through year end and into 2016 

Q4 And Beyond  Potential Winners and Losers
For the fourth quarter of 2015  I expect earnings of consumer discretionary stocks and consumer staples  such as Amazon  Home Depot  N HD   Nike  N NKE  and Starbucks  O SBUX   to outperform  while industrials which are sensitive to the global growth outlook  like Caterpillar  N CAT  and Deere  N DE  will underperform 
Looking further ahead into 2016  current projections point to yet another quarter of negative earnings growth  before stabilizing and turning higher in Q2 of next year 

U S  Indices  SPX   Exhausted Bull  NDX   Relentless Uptrend
A technical examination of the S P 500 vs  the NASDAQ 100 charts suggests that the technology sector may outperform in Q4 in comparison to the rest of the market 

On the S P 500 Index monthly chart  above  a doji candle has formed just below a fresh supply zone  and the big drop we witnessed this past August indicates that there are still many sellers around the 2100 level 
At the time we went to press  it seems that the yearly candle for 2015 will look like a doji cross  purple in the chart below 

This candle formation after a long uptrend could signal the end of the seven good years the market has experienced since the 2008 crisis 
If Q4 reports disappoint as many analysts expect  or merely signal that the moment has come to pull out and wait for better times  we may see the S P index testing the demand zone again  after having tested it earlier this year  in August and September   A break below 1820  the base of the weekly demand zone  will open the way for further losses with the first target around 1560  where a resistance area has turned to support 

If Q4 reports surprise to the upside  and offer hope for better results in 2016  and if the interest rate is kept low enough  the S P 500 Index may breach the aforementioned supply zone around 2135  which then  again  opens the way for new  never before explored  highs 
However  the current sideways movement  which has been a hallmark of market activity during the fall  alongside lower volume and a 7 year long uptrend  all increase the chances of a coming corrective move 

The story is a bit different for the NASDAQ 100  The index has consumed the seller s area between 4700 and 4200  and it relentlessly continues its uptrend around the highs of March 2000  4780 4800   above  At the moment it s strongly possible that it will close above these highs  but unless a firm demand zone is formed  new highs could be a mere  false break  
Around these historical levels  investors are advised to keep an eye on the weekly and monthly charts for warning signs in the form of reversal candles and patterns 

At the moment  it looks like the yearly candle is about to close as a bullish hammer  unless price drops through month end   which by itself inside an uptrend means nothing but continuation 
The decreasing volume could signal some weakness  but it hasn t stopped the NASDAQ 100 from going all the way back up  Therefore  we still expect the technology sector to show strong reports for Q4 and perhaps even into Q1  16 ",2015-12-14,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/hold-q3-earnings-season:-winners,-losers,-lessons-for-q4-and-2016-375624",375624
17306,238821,FCX,Santa Rally  But With New Year Hangover ,opinion,"Equity markets look keen to have a good Christmas break and deal with the hangover of ongoing systemic issues in the New Year 
An unexpected drop in oil inventories and some positives in the US PCE data helped keep US markets in the green  The market is also still steadily digesting the good news from China s Central Economic Work Conference  CEWC  
The CEWC committed China to further fiscal and monetary easing  which has driven consistent gains in a number of commodity prices this week  But of course  when one sees the energy and materials sectors being the best performing sectors in the FTSE and the S P 500 overnight  one does have to draw the conclusion that this bounce is only ephemeral  the ongoing issues for these industries are far from solved 
Nonetheless  these developments do set the S P ASX up to have a great Christmas Eve session  The ASX is expected to open above 5200 and a close above 5228 would see its highest close since 2 December  There is some very consistent resistance for the index around the 5275 level  but that looks likely to be more of a New Year s hangover issue 
  Metals prices and major materials companies are slowly playing catch up to the implications of China s CEWC and its commitment to further stimulus  All the major diversified miners had a strong performance overnight  with Freeport McMoran  N FCX  rallying 16 5   Anglo American  L AAL   9 1   Glencore  L GLEN  8 5   BHP  N BHP  and Rio s  N RIO  London listings returning 6 5  and 5 6   respectively  BHP s ADR is pointing to a further 3  gain on the ASX today  after its 6 5  
  US nominal personal income growth surprised to the upside in November  expanding 0 3  month on month  MoM   This was yet another data point that further underlines the improving employment situation with the increase being driven by a 0 5  increase in wage and salary compensation  The headline core PCE inflation stayed steady at 1 3  year on year  still below the Fed s 2  target  Durable goods were unchanged MoM  performing better than the expected 0 6  decline  However  the US dollar strength s impact on manufacturing was clear  with declines seen in electrical equipment  machinery and primary metals 
  Judging by the moves in oil overnight  one could be forgiven for thinking that Santa s sleigh runs on Light Sweet Cushing  Oklahoma Crude  The unexpected drop in the weekly EIA oil inventories data helped spur a 3 7  gain in WTI  Inventories declined by 5 8 million barrels against expectations for a 1 3 million increase  The Baker Hughes  N BHI  crude oil drill rig count also declined by a further 3 rigs  All of this was seen as a positive by markets and helped ease concerns in the high yield bond markets  The two major high yield ETFs   N HYG  and  N JNK   both gained 0 6  and 0 5   respectively  Of course  this looks like a temporary bounce in oil prices with plenty of potential for further declines next year when Iran begins exporting oil again  The current bounce looks like a great opportunity for short positions

17307,238822,FCX,China Quelling CNY Volatility,opinion,"After another heavy selloff yesterday driven by China concerns means there is the potential for a short term bounce today  Markets are looking heavily sold on a range of market internal indicators with only 22  of stocks on the S P 500 trading above their 200 day moving average  And there has been a bit of rally coming into US markets just before the close  The big question is whether this is only a  dead cat bounce  and traders may just be looking to sell into the rally  A lot of the long term concerns around China have still not dissipated  Although even if there looks to be a bit of buying early in the Asian session today  the CNY fix and Mainland cash market open still have plenty of potential to derail such moves 
China appears to be taking a firm hand to quelling CNH volatility  Heavy buying of the offshore Renminbi CNH yesterday saw the CNH HIBOR interbank overnight lending rate spike up to 13 4   One aspect of this is to strengthen the CNH by direct buying  but these actions have also significantly raised borrowing costs for those looking to short the currency  Not only did this see the CNH strengthen 1 4   but it is quite likely that the elevated borrowing costs may force a lot of FX short sellers to close out their positions as they become too expensive  The onshore CNY also strengthened 0 4   and its close is generally meant to be a rough indicator for where the CNY midpoint fix should be set today at 12 15 AEDT 

In addition to this  the People s Bank of China  PBoC  research bureau chief economist Ma Jun published a statement last night stating that the PBoC is targeting forming a mechanism that will  appropriately limit  daily CNY USD volatility  Certainly  the moves in the HIBOR and CNH yesterday look focussed on achieving that task  Alongside this  Ma emphasised that the CNY exchange rate was in a period of transition from a direct USD peg to a currency basket  He stated that there will be better communication and accessibility to data to improve the market s understanding of the PBoC s interventions 
The key question for trade today is what will happen in Chinese equity markets  Despite the stability in the CNY fix yesterday  the dramatic selloff in Mainland equities still drove selling in global markets  If we see heavy state intervention in the Mainland equity markets alongside these new moves to prop up the CNY  then this could be the jump start needed to see a bit of buying come back into global equities   in the short term 
The ASX is looking to open slightly down from its close yesterday at around 4925  but importantly above the 4910 support level from August and September  It is looking to be another nasty session for materials and energy stocks with dramatic falls in commodities overnight  US copper producer Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX  lost 20 3  overnight  and currently BHP s   AX BHP  ADR is pointing to the stock opening down 1 6   On the more positive end  CBA s  AX CBA  ADR is pointing to a 0 9  gain and if we do start to see buying come back into the banks  the index could close in positive territory today  Of course  where the ASX closes will be very dependent on how the Chinese CNY and equity markets perform ",2016-01-12,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-quelling-cny-volatility-379629,379629
17308,238823,FCX,The Bulls Regain Composure,opinion,"Generally I am one to follow the money flow and ride the trend  but the market internals in the S P 500 and other developed markets had become so oversold that the risk to reward trade off had become quite compelling 
This view seems to be playing out and one questions whether the  sell everything  call marks the low point in risks assets  Note to the bears  your time will come again 
On a positive note we ve seen the S P 500 futures print the first higher high this year  so this has thrown some backing to my short term bullish call  It s hard to be bullish with any real conviction though in this market  as that really requires commodities to rally  Until this ferocious speculative attack abates and the leveraged funds start covering short positions  then one of the key pieces of the bullish puzzle is missing 
This speculative attack is unlikely to unwind  specifically in the oil market  until these funds get a sniff that supply will be reduced and that doesn t look likely even at current levels  WTI and Brent futures are being sold on any rally and the broader Bloomberg Commodity Index  a basket of 26 actively traded commodity futures  is being guided lower by the five day average 
In a strong downtrend you will see markets respect this average and  until oil can break above the five day average  the blue line on the chart below   those calling for  20 oil should still be optimistic  Personally  I want to put my contrarian hat on in suggesting we could see a move into  32 50 to  33 a barrel  which seems to be more aligned with IG s client base  79  of our client base are long oil   Obviously  if we see a lower low today and a break into the 20s I would be wrong 

Keep in mind WTI has been below the 200 day moving average for 366 sessions   31  above the next longest run below this longer term average  which started in August 1993 
The stress in the materials space has also been savage and much focus has been placed on the rampant moves higher in Credit Default Swaps  CDS  in a number of key corporates  Yes  remember them  They are back in vogue and showing an elevated default risk in the credit space  Take Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX   for example  the equity has fallen 71  since October  However  some of their outstanding debt is trading at distressed levels and not investment grade 
Asia markets are starting to sense that a short term upside move could be on the cards and the S P ASX 200 has certainly seen better buyers  Even the energy sector has found buyers and the daily chart of the sector looks to be trying to put in some sort of bottom  The daily CNY  fix  provided some inspiration to traders today as well  The  fixing  rate has effectively been set in a 20 point range for the last five days and was effectively unchanged for a fourth day  so stability is the name of the game and that s good enough for traders  Good trade data from China has also caused a second wave of buying  so watch copper prices through European trade to give some real backbone to the equity rally 
 Strong volume increase in iron ore imports   AUD supportive 

The Chinese authorities have gone to great lengths to reduce CNH  offshore yuan  liquidity  in turn driving up funding costs to unbelievable levels and making speculation  at least shorting  on the yuan neigh on impossible  What counts is the fact Chinese authorities have achieved their goal of converging the onshore and offshore yuan  with stability in the  fix  and they have even seen a positive session in the equity markets  It s just a shame they had to go to such lengths to achieve this  The question is what asset class will be the next target for the speculators 
With US futures starting to find buyers given the positive flows in Japan  Australia  Hong Kong and Korea  the open of the European market looks quite upbeat  We ve even seen buying in sterling  although AUD JPY has been the star of the show today in the FX market  The CAC 40 looks set to reclaim the 4400 level  with the FTSE 100 eyeing a retest of yesterday s cash market high of 5985  and once again we ve seen the market defending the 5870 area  in a similar manner as September and December  A close above 5985 should bring out further buying activity from the technically minded traders 
EUR CNY is 0 4  lower so my preference remains for longs in the DAX  I would be holding for a move into the 10 250 to 10 300 in the short term  trimming back on a move back through 10 000 ",2016-01-13,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-bulls-regain-composure-379801,379801
17309,238824,FCX,4 Beneficiaries Of The Current China Meltdown,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Once again  China is making headlines  Its equity markets keep melting down  the yuan continues to lose value  and the country s economic slowdown is expected to worsen  Now that China s GDP makes up about 16  of the world s combined GDP  the consequences could potentially be disastrous for global markets  Indeed  there s already been quite a bit of fall out  a falling stock market in China  an increasingly fragile US stock market  fresh 12 year lows in crude oil prices  and of course  uncertainty and fear regarding what happens next 
But even as investors holding long positions are indeed suffering losses  some market participants and sectors could be and are able to take advantage of recent conditions  Here are 4 potential beneficiaries of the recent Chinese turmoil 

1  Short Sellers
Outside of the hardcore trading world this practice is little known  and even less understood  Briefly  short selling is the practice of selling securities that you do not currently own  but which you expect will fall  In a short sale the security is  borrowed  from a broker  with the promise that the short seller will purchase the security later  at an agreed upon lower price  Profit is made from the difference in the original price and the ensuing drop in value 
As with any financial instrument  there is  of course  a risk  and losses would occur in the case of a rise in the price of the shorted security  rather than a drop  The S P 500 has lost 7 4  since the end of January 2015  Freeport McMoran  N FCX   the world s largest producer of copper  gold and other minerals  has been hit by a slump in copper prices the worst commodity performer of the year so far suffering an astonishing loss in value of minus 36  since the beginning of the year  Oil companies have also fared badly  with Marathon Oil  N MRO  and Anadarko Petroleum  N APC  both losing over 20  in the past 8 days  Not every security is shortable  but if you d bet on any of the above  there were handsome profits to be made 

2  Volatility Traders
Volatility trading is the term used to describe trading the size of a stock s price movement  rather than trading the shares themselves  The profit driver here is not whether the price of the instrument rises or falls  but rather the likelihood of the size and strength movement of the instrument 
Volatility is created when shares shooting up  or crashing down  Trading volatility is done by speculating on the future volatility of an instrument using either options or ETFs  either by being short volatility speculating that volatility will be low or long volatility  betting on higher future volatility  The most popular volatility index is the VIX  which tracks the implied volatility of the S P 500 index options 
The chart below shows the VIX response to the past year s moves on the Shanghai Composite  It clearly illustrates that the VIX has been inversely mirroring the Shanghai s price movements  When Shanghai drops the VIX soars  and vice versa 

ETFs that trade volatility include the iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  N VXX   ProShares VIX Short Term Futures  N VIXY  and VelocityShares VIX Short Term Fut Exp 4 Dec 2030  O VIIX   Periods of turmoil are especially beneficial for long volatility trades  as the odds of drastic movement in instruments are higher than in a steady  soothing market  The chart below of VXX s price  grey line   in reaction to Shanghai s movements  blue line  displays the correlation 


3  US Importers and Retailers
Because of current conditions in the Chinese economy  the PBoC has let the yuan slide versus the dollar  Part of the rationale for this could be an attempt by Chinese officials to aid struggling local exporters  But for every exporter there s an importer somewhere  and a stronger dollar would allow US importers to buy more merchandise for the same amount of dollars  efficiently cutting back importers  and retailers  cost of sold goods  For example  Wal Mart  N WMT   the largest US bricks and mortars retailer  could now lower its costs and improve its profits  at least until a recession hits the US  Even then  a decline in the wealth and disposable income in the US could bring more customers to the low cost world of Wal Mart  The same  of course  is true for other major discounters such as Costco  O COST  and Target  N TGT  

4  US Real Estate
The volatility and risk in Chinese market could signal good news for the US real estate market  As Spencer Levy  CBRE s head of research for the Americas says   global instability often leads to more foreign capital flows to the safe havens  notably London and the U S  
The love affair between Chinese investors and US real estate has grown stronger over the past year  reaching  8 6 billion in purchases of commercial real estate assets  quadrupling the 2014 number  As the stock markets both Chinese and American grow weaker  investors will look to return to basic  physical investments 
Gold is generally known as the safe haven in times of trouble  but in China  US real estate is the investment of choice during risk off periods  This sector should therefore become popular should the instability continue ",2016-01-13,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-beneficiaries-of-the-current-china-meltdown-379777,379777
17310,238825,FCX,2016  Not The Start We Expected,opinion,"The S P 500 fell 2 5  yesterday  and is down 5  in the last week 
With the S P 500 down about 7 5  YTD already  needless to say  this wasn t the start expected to 2016 
At a Chicago CFA Society luncheon yesterday  Jason Trennert  the managing partner of Strategas Research Partners  noted he thought the S P 500 would be up 10  in 2016  exactly what I was thinking here in mid to late December  15 
With JP Morgan  N JPM  and Intel  O INTC  set to report this today  finally  Q4  15 earnings and  16 guidance aren t just a guess 
So what s been a surprise so far in 2016  

Freeport  N FCX  looks like it is going bankrupt  the way it is trading  Jason Trennert mentioned yesterday we might see one major energy sector bankruptcy before this correction ends  Chesapeake  N CHK   Freeport  Peabody  N BTU    All my suggestions  not Jason s  
Neither Value nor Growth is working this year  The FANG stocks have gotten crushed  Amazon  O AMZN  is down  100 from its all time  late December  15  high  The stock is testing its upward sloping trendline off the  15 low  It needs to hold here 
Back in the bull market of the 1990 s  there used to be a graph or chart that circulated that showed that bear market bottoms were put in usually when a big Financial blew up  Continental Bank in the mid 80 s  Drexel Burnham in 1990  Orange County and the Mexico devaluation in late 1994 may not have been bear market finales but they typically marked the end of major corrections  Could be something like that is looming today  in another sector 
The dollar index closed at 98 94 yesterday  Hasn t changed much as all and in fact is still under its March  15 multi year high near 100  A steady dollar or a lower dollar is still   net net  a positive in my opinion 
Banks and Financials have gotten just hammered YTD  possibly due to the flatter yield curve  I do think Financials offer good value here  Corporate loan growth should be decent  When we hear from JP Morgan  Wells Fargo  N WFC   Citigroup  N C   and US Bancorp  N USB   it will give us a good look at the consumer and corporate loan books

17319,238834,FCX,Rumbling From The Bond Market Grows Louder,opinion,"Even if your focus is squarely on equities  understanding what s taking place in other markets is an important factor when it comes to managing a portfolio  It s often said that the bond market leads stocks and the first moves to a major change in trend  whether it s the trend in markets or economic growth often begins with fixed income  Credit markets have been garnering much more attention in the last 6 12 months   At least judging by how much those I speak with have been talking about them  
One such piece of evidence comes from Jeff Bahl  the former head fixed income trader at Goldman Sachs   who now manages his own fund  covers the story  h t to Jesse Felder for sharing the story on Twitter   The article quotes from Bahl s most recent investor letter  I wanted to share a few points Bahl makes 

Historically  there has been a clear correlation between well capitalized companies outperforming their weaker counterparts during periods of rising corporate leverage  However  that relationship has not held since 2011 as the market has rewarded higher leverage  indicated in the exhibit below   As a result of the positive feedback loop  debt on corporate balance sheets is now at levels not seen since the financial crisis 


Balh makes a good point that  high yield  bonds should not be categorized as such based on their credit rating  since history has shown credit agencies don t always get things right 
Rather  they should be viewed as  high yield based on their actual yield   novel idea    He goes on to give two examples of this  using Freeport McMoran  N FCX  and Sprint  N S  
He ends  with 

While history does not repeat  it certainly rhymes  This time it is not different  Corporations that have depended on the depth of the capital markets for their expansion are firmly in the crosshairs  As opposed to the past six years  a  V shaped  recovery in credit spreads is not coming  Similar to the unwind of prior credit booms  this deleveraging cycle will be longer and deeper than market expectations  With a contracting credit market  further access to capital will be at progressively more punitive terms 

I m not overly concerned about the  why  for the markets  current circumstances  there s plenty of opinion that can point you in a million different directions  any of which will surely fit your personal bias  whether it be oil  the dollar  China  or Donald Trump  What s important in my view is understanding that the winds are changing in the fixed income arena  There s a hell of a lot more money at stake in credit markets  and when it moves it can have massive ripple effects

17328,238843,FCX,Even Production Cuts Can t Save Copper,opinion,"While copper slid to a new six year low last week  there is some discussion about exactly why 
Everyone can agree the market is oversupplied  demand has slowed in China  consumer of over 40  of the world s copper and for Barclays  L BARC  believes China is partially responsible for the latest fall 
Barclay s Note
Chinese demand is a big part of the problem  The  printed  last week  comments from the bank s most recent note to investors   There s over a million tons of additional supply coming online next year and the year after during a time when demand is seeming to stall   said Dane Davis  a metals analyst with Barclays in New York 
 Not only are prices going to be lower  they will be lower for a sustained period   Global copper output is expected to reach a record 22 89 million metric tons this year  while demand is expected at 22 4 mmt  according to Barclays  that s some half a million tons of overcapacity  Production cutbacks by the likes of Glencore  L GLEN  and Freeport McMoran  N FCX   however  should balance that excess but it is the extent to which this new capacity comes on stream that worries Barclays  Certainly  China s consumer price inflation decelerated in October  according to data released on Tuesday suggesting growth will continue to slow unless some currently unexpected stimulus measures are announced

However  others disagree  saying the current weakness in the copper price has more to do with a bounce in the strength of the dollar  The dollar appreciated to its strongest level since April this week versus the euro and its highest in more than two months versus the yen after a Labor Department report showed US employers added 271 000 workers in October  the most this year  Good jobs data increases the likelihood of a December rise in Federal Reserve interest rates and the US dollar responded accordingly  A stronger dollar makes all dollar priced commodities more expensive for non dollar economies suppressing demand and  hence  prices

17329,238844,FCX,Copper  6 Year Bear Market  And How To Profit From It ,opinion,"Peaking February 2011  Copper prices have been declining for years
Source  Short Side of Long
Copper prices are making six year lows and the bears are back  Peaking all the way back in February 2011  at a very high price of  4 65 per pound  high grade Copper prices have now been declining half a decade without a strong rebound  According to the recent Commitment of Traders report published on Friday  hedge funds and other speculators are once again pressing short bets against the metal 
They have been doing this quite consistently since early 2013  Furthermore  according to SentimenTrader  the optimism index has declined below 20  for the first time in almost 15 years  One has to be reminded that its perfectly normal and very common for sentiment to be bearish during a downtrend  however it is at major selling climaxes that sentiment becomes overwhelmingly one sided and the pendulum swings  reversing the trend 
Will Copper be able to establish support on an important trend line 
Source  Short Side of Long
So are we witnessing a selling climax in the price of high grade Copper  It is difficult to say 
Bulls could argue that the downtrend is now accelerating rather rapidly  which means investors are panicking and liquidating the metal together with the baby and the bathwater  as already confirmed by the sentiment discussed above   Moreover  bulls could also argue that the price has fallen on to an important decade long trend line  which could prove to be a strong support  see the chart above  
On the other hand  bears would argue that overcapacity in the overall industrial metals space is set to continue  Add to that mix Fed s intention to rise interest rates  which should strengthen the US dollar in longer run  and it s hard to see Copper or for that matter any metal rising on a sustainable basis 
Contrarians and smart money are betting on companies such as Freeport

Contrarians and smart money investors   have taken bullish bets on companies such as Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold  N FCX  with a view toward future Copper price rebounding and a total overhaul of the company s capex  salary structure and cutting of high cost production  Freeport shares are approaching a major historical floor  buying zone  which should be a great entry point for the next bull market rally 
Moreover  the recent rise in trading volume  which holds similarities to the panic of 2008  indicates that retail investors  dumb money  are liquidating shares  while smart money  Mr Ichan  is accumulating at bargain prices  Personally  I am still sitting on the sidelines and watching  but I do have Freeport McMoRan shares in my watchlist ",2015-11-23,Tiho Brkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-at-copper’s-bear-market-272157,272157
17330,238845,FCX,Rising USD  Falling Commodities And The Deflationary Spiral,opinion,"About a month ago  I started posting regularly on the possible inflection point I was seeing with regard to the deflationary trend that has been ongoing since 2011  As readers know  stocks move from a reversal or consolidation pattern in an impulse move  This is much different than a sideways chopping action of a reversal or consolidation pattern 
Impulse moves are the stored up energy that is released once a reversal or consolidation pattern is finished doing its job  About four weeks ago it looked like the most recent consolidation phase was coming to an end  which would then leave the door open to an impulse move 
When I first wrote about this possible inflection point  the US dollar was still trading within the confines of its possible bullish falling wedge  which I viewed as a consolidation pattern to the upside  Shortly after that first post on the possible inflection point  the US dollar broke out of its bullish falling wedge and is now approaching its previous high just above 100 or so  The US dollar is the key driver for this deflationary spiral that has been in place for over four years now  with no light at the end of the tunnel for the commodities complex  At least not yet 
You re probably getting tired of all the posts on the US dollar but this is where the truth resides  particularly with regard to the falling commodities complex  Without a rising US dollar the deflationary scenario would not have a chance of playing out  Some of the more important commodities have now started their next impulse move lower  This could very well be the capitulation phase where the baby is thrown out with the bathwater  If this is the beginning of the capitulation phase  it should be relentless in nature  so much so that investors just throw up their hands in disgust and exit their positions at any price 
The first chart  below  is a short term  one year daily chart for the US dollar that shows the bullish falling wedge in detail  The breakout was just a tad on the sloppy side but the top rail of the blue rectangle that formed out toward the apex  held support which has led to the current move higher  As you can see  the price action is approaching the high made back in March of this year  which the US dollar will need to take out to confirm that the next impulse move higher is truly underway  So far so good 

The longer term  two year daily chart for the US dollar  below  shows the previous impulse move up out of the five point blue rectangle reversal pattern in 2014  That impulse move created three smaller red consolidation patterns which is what one likes to see during a strong impulse move 

Below is a daily line chart which shows the previous impulse move up with a nice clean breakout and backtest of the bullish falling wedge  Again  you can see the three smaller blue consolidation patterns that formed in that strong impulse move up 

This next chart is a 30 year monthly bar chart  I ve shown it many times once the top rail of the blue bullish falling wedge was broken to the upside  This chart is important to understanding the longer outlook  Note the breakout and backtest to the top rail of the 30 year bullish falling wedge  which shows the small red bullish falling wedge that is the same falling wedge we just looked at on the daily charts above  Pieces of the puzzle 

This next chart is a weekly combo chart which has the US dollar on top and gold on the bottom  Note how close the US dollar is to testing its recent high while gold is testing its recent low  If the US dollar is getting ready to break out to a new high  then it stands to reason that gold will break to new lows as the inverse correlation comes into play 

If the US dollar can close out the month of November right where it s now  it will be at a 13 year high on the long term monthly line chart and a new high for its bull market 

Let s look at one last chart of the US dollar  the monthly candlestick chart  This chart clearly shows that when the US dollar is in a strong impulse move up it will produce a string of white candlesticks  and when it s in a strong impulse move down it will form a string of black candlesticks  The previous impulse move up created nine white monthly candlesticks in a row 

If the US dollar is breaking out of a bullish falling wedge  then there is a good chance that the euro  XEU  is breaking out of a similar pattern  only in the opposite direction  The long term monthly chart for the XEU shows this to be true 

The long term monthly chart for the XEU shows a different pattern  one that has the same implications as the chart above   if it breaks below the black dashed down slopping trendline  which would be showing us this latest impulse move down is just halfway finished 

If the US dollar is showing strength in here  then we should see some weakness in some of the commodities indexes  The daily chart for the CRB Index shows it has broken down out of the blue bearish rising wedge  complete with a backtest 

The monthly chart for the CRB Index shows it has broken down below the brown shaded S R zone with a backtest to the underside  currently testing its bear market lows 

The very long term 60 year quarterly chart for the CRB Index now shows how close it is to breaking below the brown shaded support and resistance zone going all the way back to the early 1970s  That s pretty incredible when put it into perspective 

After breaking out from a five point black triangle reversal pattern as its bear market top  the GNX has created one consolidation pattern below the next  showing us its bear market is still intact 

The PowerShares DB Commodity TrackingFund  N DBC  is probably the most actively traded commodities index to track  It too built out a black 5 point triangle reversal pattern as its bear market top  After breaking below the 2008 crash low  the DBC then built out the red rectangle just below that very important support zone  This has recently broken out to the downside  making new all time lows 

Let s now look at the most important commodity on the planet  WTIC crude oil  The daily chart below shows a possible blue bearish falling wedge   H S consolidation pattern forming  Last week oil was backtesting the neckline of a small H S top that is possibly forming the right shoulder 

Below is a daily chart for oil which shows the possible stand alone H S consolidation pattern 

I used this daily chart for oil previously  to take our first short position when the price action rallied up into the top rail of the falling wedge and the bottom blue rail of the bearish rising wedge 

Below is a weekly chart which is showing two wedges  There is the smaller blue bearish rising wedge forming inside of the possible very large black bearish falling wedge 

The 20 year monthly chart for oil shows how the larger falling wedge fits into the bigger picture as a possible halfway pattern to the downside  within a possible downtrend channel 

Natural gas is another commodity that has taken it on the chin recently  The weekly chart shows a multi H S topping pattern with a recent breakdown of the third neckline and a backtest to the underside last week 

The 10 year chart for natural gas shows a H S top with a huge breakout black candlestick  signaling the H S top was completed  You can see how the red diamond pattern is forming as a possible halfway pattern 

The very long term  25 year monthly chart for NATGAS shows how the smaller H S top  on the weekly chart above  fits into the big picture  As you can see  it s just part of a massive topping pattern that actually topped out in 2005 or so 

Next let s look at several more important commodity charts  This should give us a feel for how long this deflationary episode may play out  at a minimum  The long term weekly chart for copper shows a massive seven point blue triangle reversal pattern that is the head portion of an even bigger H S top  The backtest to the neckline formed the small red triangle consolidation pattern  which just broke down two weeks ago  It looks like the next impulse move down has begun 

The 20 year monthly chart for copper shows how the breakout from the six year H S top is really just getting underway to the downside  after completing the backtest 

The 40 year quarterly chart for copper shows us a possible low on top of the massive black flat top triangle around the 1 47 area  As this is a quarterly chart  you can see there is still some considerable time left for the 1 47 price objective to be reached 

The monthly chart for Market Vectors Coal  N KOL   the coal ETF  shows it has really declined sharply since topping out in 2011 with a huge H S top  It s now trading below its 2008 crash low 

There are a couple of long term charts I would like to show now that relate to commodities being in a weakened state  The monthly chart for BHP Billiton Ltd  N BHP  shows it s in a well entrenched impulse move down 

Rio Tinto  N RIO  looks like it s finishing up with the breakout and backtesting process of a massive H S top formation  During the bull market years it formed a parabolic uptrend which came to an abrupt halt  leading into the 2008 crash lows 

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan  N POT  is another stock that looks like it s completing a massive H S top that has broken below its neckline 

United States Steel Corporation  N X shows it s closing in on its 2003 low 

I ve been positing this long term chart for Freeport McMoran  N FCX  since the second right shoulder was building out on the unbalanced H S top 

The last chart will be a long term monthly chart for gold  which formed a bearish expanding rising wedge formation as its bull market  We still have another week of trading  but you can see the last bar on this chart is currently making an ever so slightly new low for this bear market 

What these charts suggest to me is that there is still plenty of room to move lower in the commodities complex before we see a significant turnaround  Nothing goes straight up or down but as many of the charts above show  most have massive topping patterns followed by downside breakouts that are  in some cases  just getting started  It s going to be interesting  to say the least ",2015-11-23,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekend-report…the-chartology-of-deflation-272159,272159

17341,238856,FCX,Hedge Funds See Steady Combined Inflows  But Lots Of Action,opinion,"The combined inflows of equity  bond  and hybrid hedge funds have been remarkably steady over the last 10 years  according to research newly released by Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  Global Prime Finance  in its Monthly Hedge Fund Trends newsletter  into equity  bond and asset allocation  hybrid  funds running around  325 billion a year for the last 10 years 
Yes  as one might expect  total flow did slow for a bit through the world financial crisis  specifically between June 2008 and March 2009  with investors re allocating to money market funds  that is  effectively  to cash  But after the great Bottoming of March  volatility subsided a bit  and the steady rate of inflow into the threesome listed above resumed  The report calls this steadiness  an empirical regularity  
The mathematical implication of such regularity is that any growth above that average for one region or asset class will represent a decline to a below average rate elsewhere  Indeed  rotations have taken place along many axes  bond fund inflows fluctuate greatly vis a vis equity funds  emerging markets versus developed markets  different developed markets against one another  etc 
The DB Prime researchers highlighted the multi year outflows from EM to DM as one such rotation  EM equity inflows reached a peak in early 2011  But EM bond inflows didn t peak until the 2013 taper  Since then EM equities have seen an outflow which has benefitted primarily Europe and Japan within the developed world 
Recent years have also seen a very large outflow from US equities into the same two places  Europe and Japan 

DB Mavens on EU and the ECB
In a separate section of the report that may shed some light on that last point  the DB Prime researchers also look at recent developments in ECB monetary and EU fiscal policy  They expect the European Central Bank to cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points in December  They also expect that the U S  Federal Reserve will be heading in the opposite direction at that time  which will amplify the effects of the ECB move 
The point is that ECB monetary policy can still be effective  so it doesn t have to be supplemented on the fiscal side  There is little pressure right now for an easing of fiscal policy   Only in a serious escalation of crisis  and if confidence in ECB policy were lost  might the fiscal rules be strongly revised  
The rules in question limit the size of the total government debt of member states  and their budget deficits  as a percentage of GDP  As an enforcement mechanism the rules create an  excessive deficit procedure   countries in violation become subject to surveillance and fiscal penalties  All this creates what the DB report calls a  veneer of control over fiscal risk  

Much of the newsletter provides a straightforward region by region and sometimes country by country breakdown of hedge fund performance in October 2015  and year to date for 2015 through October  The charts reflecting the YTD data  for the Americas and Europe  have been adapted above

17342,238857,FCX,China And The Fed Hitting EMs Far Harder Than DMs,opinion,"Volatility is rising as flows are starting to pick up around expectations for a rate hike by the Fed next week  US dollar long positions looked to be coming out of the markets at a rapid clip over the past 24 hours  Market participants seem to be reaching the conclusion that much of the US dollar strength around a December rate rise is already in the price and there is minimal further upside  Hence  the rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  RBNZ  and Australia s strong employment figures proved to be major catalysts for these currencies surging in a weakening US dollar environment 
The DXY dollar index lost 1 1  over the past 24 hours  which helped provide a fillip to some commodities prices including iron ore and copper  Although the massive selloff in commodities does look to be claiming a few scalps with Anglo American  L AAL  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX  cutting their dividends and small ASX iron ore miner  BC Iron Ltd  AX BCI   announcing the closure of its Nullagine Joint Venture with Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  AX FMG  
But the steady weakening of the renminbi is continuing to make waves  The midpoint for the CNY was weakened a further 0 15  today to a level not seen since mid 2011 
The fact that the CNY is being weakened ahead of the Fed meeting is no surprise  It was precisely because expectations were so high for a September rate hike by the Fed that the People s Bank of China  PBoC  decided to weaken the currency in August due to the CNY s de facto US dollar peg  In August  we saw the CNY midpoint weaken 4 6  in a matter of days  Since 2 November we have seen the CNY midpoint weaken 1 7  and the pressing question of the moment is how far the PBoC will weaken the currency on this occasion  Of course  trying to second guess the notoriously opaque PBoC is akin to playing Russian roulette whilst tied up in a hessian sack  Nonetheless  it does seem a fairly safe bet that the CNY will continue to weaken at least into the 16 December Fed meeting and arguably a midpoint fix in the CNY 6 45 6 5 region by the end of the year would not be entirely out of the question 
Although it is fairly clear that this current Fed and China induced selloff is weighing far heavier on emerging market equities than developed markets 

Australia
The Australian employment data does raise some important questions  Problems with the seasonally adjusted monthly change in employment have been well noted  but even if you were to halve the 71 400 jobs reputedly added in November  the number would have been well above the consensus expectations for a 10 000 job decline  The number did not completely come out of thin air  the ANZ job ads data for the month also showed a strong 1 3  month on month  MoM  increase 
The big question is how much momentum is behind these numbers  Whether you take the exact figures at face value or not  it is pretty clear we are seeing some velocity in the numbers that indicate employment is picking up at the fastest rates in four years  Employment growth expanded at 2 9  year on year  which ties for the peak monthly employment growth seen in the previous cycle in November 2010  Otherwise  we are at pre GFC levels of employment  But even the slower moving 12 month total growth rate is at 1 8   its highest level since November 2011 
In any case  this saw the Aussie dollar jump 1 3  on the data release as the prospects for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  look to be dead in the water  The bond market is currently implying that the likelihood of an RBA rate cut in February stands at 9 3   At the current juncture  it looks difficult to see the Aussie dollar even dipping below US 0 70 in the near term  and if the domestic data continues to hold up into 2016 calls for the Aussie to drop to US 0 65 or below look increasingly unlikely 


ASX
The ASX dropped down to its lowest level since 16 November as concerns about the Fed and potential CNY devaluation wracked global markets  The index broke through the key 5050 level  but did seem to bounce off the 5000 mark   a level it rarely closed below even during the depths of the August September selloff 
The strong employment figures and the elimination of a potential rate cut by the RBA looked to be taken as a negative for the banks  The lack of further easing and the slowdown in the housing loans data yesterday spells the end of the highly profitable home loan growth for the banks  Financials lost 2  with all the Big Four losing 2  or more 
The slight easing in the US dollar provided a fillip for the materials sector  This helped the two big miners  BHP and RIO  stay in positive territory despite the massive selloff seen throughout the index ",2015-12-10,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-and-the-fed-hitting-ems-far-harder-than-dms-375196,375196
17343,238858,FCX,Will The Commodities   Energy Horror Show Continue In 2016 ,opinion,"The above chart is from     a blog run by Doug McKay and Gary Morrow 
When I first looked at the chart  my initial thought was  NASDAQ in March of 2000  but the chart actually shows the relative performance of stocks  via the S P 500  versus commodities  via the CRB Index 
That is an eye opening chart 
The fundamental story to Basic Materials and Commodities  Sticking with the discussion of expected earnings growth for 2016  here is the trend in the Basic Materials sector  which includes commodity firms like Alcoa  N AA   Freeport  N FCX  and US Steel  N X  
Basic Materials 2016 projected sector earnings growth

For the Basic Materials sector  the real damage has been to the commodity companies like those noted above  but Monsanto  N MON   and DuPont  N DD  are the heavier earnings weights in the sector 
Here is a look at the history of Basic Materials earnings and revenue growth  going back a few years 
The sector generates little year over year revenue growth  and yet the  earnings delta  is formidable 
Tuesday s reversal in crude was important in my opinion  It is hard to conceive how Commodities and Energy names will produce the same fundamental horror show next year that they did in 2015 
Steel is an important commodity since it is tied to both the Energy sector and China  I have clients who are scrap steel dealers  At this point in 2015  they feel like I did at this time in 2008  head on the desk  whiskey bottles littering the floor  a 2 week old beard  and lounging around in the robe and underwear 
At this time last year  according to Thomson Reuters data  Basic Materials were expected to grow earnings 19  in 2015  but today the sector is scheduled to grow earnings just 3 3   and a lot of that 3 3  growth is not commodity related 
The commodity stocks will bottom before the earnings estimates turn

Stocks started the day in positive territory but then slipped  and the decline coincided with a drop in oil prices  which also went from positive to negative  Oil prices have buckled following the breakdown of OPEC talks last week  We have a price war breaking out between Saudi Arabia and Iran and US shale producers  At the same time  we have Russia  Venezuela  and Brazil all desperate for oil revenues 
But it s not just oil  iron ore is moving in lockstep with oil  dropping to a 10 year low  Codelco  the Saudi Arabia of copper is refusing to cut output  betting it can outlast rivals and win market share  The major commodity indices have dropped to lows last seen in 1998  While plummeting commodity prices can be a warning sign that the world economy is heading into recession  the latest sell off has a different character  The slump is chiefly due to excess production  and amounts to a positive supply shock that should boost global recovery 
Dow Chemical Company  N DOW  and DuPont  N DD  are in   in what would be one of the largest deals of the year  Each company has a market value of about  60 billion and the combination would create the second biggest chemical company in the world  after BASF  with more than  92 billion in annual sales  They are also talking about breaking up the merged company into three businesses   agricultural chemicals  specialty products  and materials like plastics  For the past year  both companies have been pressured by activist investors unhappy with their financial performance 
Yahoo  its  31 billion stake in Alibaba  N BABA   Instead it will look at other options  like selling its core operations or spinning off its stake in Yahoo  O YHOO  Japan  The decision is a repudiation of the strategy taken by Marissa Mayer  who was hired to turn the internet company around  She had planned to spin off the 15 percent stake in Alibaba and focus on the core business of selling advertising  But investors  led by the hedge fund Starboard Value  argued that the risk of capital gains tax was too great 
General Electric  N GE  is in  to buy the drill bits and drilling services divisions of Halliburton  N HAL   which is divesting assets to win antitrust approval for its takeover of Baker Hughes  N BHI   GE is also exploring bids for other assets that Halliburton is seeking to unload  including parts of Baker Hughes  operations 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX  said it will suspend its dividend and further reduce its capital spending  Freeport McMoRan  the U S  s biggest miner and a major copper producer  said ending its annual dividend of 20 cents a share would save  240 million a year  The moves come as the company has been in turmoil as falling energy prices have exposed a disastrous investment in oil and gas drilling  A number of other miners have recently cut their dividends in a bid to improve liquidity 
As widely expected  Kinder Morgan  N KMI  has cut its 2016 quarterly dividend to  0 125 share from the current  0 51  marking the company s first ever dividend cut  The company said the move will enable it to use a significant portion of its cash flow to fund the equity portion of its expansion capital requirements  eliminate any need to access the equity market for the foreseeable future  and maintain a solid investment grade credit rating 
China cut the yuan s reference rate to the weakest since 2011  fueling speculation that the central bank is trying to release pent up depreciation pressure before a potential rate increase by the Federal Reserve  There are signs that the People s Bank of China has started guiding the yuan lower before the Fed acts  An index of emerging market currencies dropped to a record low yesterday on fears a Fed rate hike will spur capital outflows  Traders now put the odds of a Fed liftoff next week at 80 percent 
Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla is visiting Washington today to again ask for help as the U S  commonwealth seeks to recover from a nearly decade long recession  While the U S  Treasury and some lawmakers have supported legislative fixes for Puerto Rico  the efforts have not gained momentum

The bill for last month s catastrophic Samarco dam failure in Brazil could be growing by the day  as the joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton  L BLT  struggles to formulate an emergency plan demanded by local prosecutors in case of additional accidents  The disaster unleashed an avalanche of mud that killed at least 15 people  destroyed villages downstream  and polluted hundreds of miles of waterways in the Rio Doce basin 
Some of the world s largest companies  including Unilever  L ULVR   Total  Bank of America  N BAC   Patagonia and Ikea  announced their commitment on Tuesday to cutting carbon emissions and participating in practices that would support sustainable energy  The pledges came at The New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference  being held in concurrence with the international climate talks outside Paris

Apple  O AAPL  has suspended plans to offer an online TV service  and will focus for now on helping media companies directly sell content via the App Store  Apple isn t completely giving up on providing a live TV service  but notes its original plan to sell skinny bundles  or packages of about channels for  30  40 month has  run into resistance from media companies that want more money for their programming   or were unwillingly to un bundle content 
For Apple  the idea was to create TV programming similar to iTunes  where you just buy the songs you want  not the entire album  If Apple gets its way  it means the traditional pay TV package  which averages around 100 channels  will get shrunk by nearly 80 percent  And while TV executives will say that they understand that consumers don t want to pay for channels they don t watch  all of them will argue that their channels are must haves 
A class action lawsuit in California that has the potential undermine Uber just got a whole lot bigger  The case was certified as class action in September but today a 9th circuit judge expanded the scope of that class action  The suit challenges whether Uber drivers are independent contractors  as the company claims  or employees  which would entitle them to a host of benefits such as health insurance and require Uber to pay on the job expenses like gas and maintenance that drivers currently pay themselves 
Today s ruling says that Uber drivers can take part in the California class action over their employment status even if they didn t opt out of Uber s arbitration clause  Chen also ruled that drivers in the class will be able to pursue expense reimbursement claims  Basically  that means the case is going to be much bigger

When you are young  it is common to be involved in activity which is extreme  eating  drinking  use your imagination   Your body deals with the excess the day after  or hours after  depending on what the situation may be  The consequences can be difficult on the body  brain  or both  Been here  done that  thank you  I am sure you probably have experienced something similar  Anyway  the same way your body needs time to mend from excess  businesses and economies do as well  The circumstance of extreme overcapacity and the lingering hangover is what the global economy is grappling with  The difference is the binge in a China led global expansion took place over ten years or so  which makes the downside a bit difficult 
Case in point number one would be Anglo American  L AAL   the large conglomerate with exposure to nearly every kind of commodity one could think  and also the owner of diamond monopoly DeBeers  it s crown jewel  A few months ago  the leadership at Anglo told markets they needed to downside to the tune of fifty thousand employees  Not so fast  The cherry on top came this week with even larger write downs and the job cuts will total 85 000 across the globe  Example number two and three are Kinder Morgan  N KMI  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX   Kinder is the largest pipeline company in North America  and they chopped the dividend after months of saying it was money good  Freeport is a large miner of commodities  bought an oil group at the top of the market  and this week the leadership declared there will be no more dividend for the near future  Large commodity trader Glencore  L GLEN  also decided to sell assets to pay down debt from global expansion  With every global commodity under severe pricing pressure  these kinds of events are ramping up quite quickly  which means you need to get used to the unpleasantness  What a nice holiday present 
Nowhere can the pain be more prominent than in the oil patch  With oil nearing the 35  per barrel level  the ramifications all across energy companies are imminent  Carl Icahn warned about the bubble in high yield debt  and sure enough  two bond funds decided to shut down because of lack of liquidity among these credits  One is from highly regarded family Third Avenue Value Fund  Marty Whitman   As the year closes  tax loss selling and leverage is certainly a part of the equation  Things probably will not change much over the last three weeks as there are plenty of losses to be taken  Still  losing 4  on the indexes for the week and 10  in oil is a bit much  So what do you do if you have exposure to capital markets 
Clearly  each situation is different  but if you want to own oil  or want more oil exposure  selling losers and buying them back in 31 days is a good strategy  If you want no part of energy  selling it for tax losses or to be tax efficient to offset gains is another solid tactic  If you have cash  using the next six months or year to dollar cost average into the assets you want also makes sense  With respect to high yield and other global commodities  picking bottoms is difficult  but agriculture and fertilizers are intriguing to me as well 
In other developments in the market  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was acquired at a big premium by a private equity group  Dow Chemical Company  N DOW  and Dupont Fabros Technology Inc  N DFT  decided to create a global chemical giant in a merger of equals  Closer to home  Harry Reid is battling fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren on the rights of minority creditors in prospective legislation which could dramatically affect thousands of employees of Caesars Gaming  Mr  Reid knows where the bread is buttered and wants to try spare as many jobs as possible from the debt laden gambling concern  Mr  Reid has big juice  but it may not be enough 
In my little world  Yahoo  O YHOO  decided to scrap it s plan for the Alibaba  N BABA  spinoff and instead will spinoff the core search and advertising businesses  A while back I wrote about how Marissa Meyer should have lunch with John Malone and discuss the situation  Yahoo hired McKinsey  who Malone worked for many years ago  to get another opinion on what to do  For the money she paid McKinsey  Malone would have come up with a much better solution than what they decided on  Still  the bottom line is the core has to improve  and releasing it to the public markets will give it value  Something is better than nothing  or in this case  less than nothing 
On the macroeconomic front  if you are a member of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee  the persistent chopping in the price of every product in the commodity complex makes the idea of  normal  inflation questionable  at the very least  If the premise of raising interest rates is based on targeting inflation and unemployment  and only the latter is trending towards typical  also a stretch  you might say raising interest rates  even 25 basis points  is not a brilliant policy decision  The quandary is the committee has essentially told markets for months  lift off is here  So  after three days of market sell offs  we will see what happens on Wednesday  Your move Janet

Thomas Carlyle
Many people follow trends or adopt similar points of view as other well known individuals who they may admire  How many times do you go to a get together and hear someone make a point based on what they heard from so and so  In my little neck of the woods  it happens all the time  It would not be a shock if you had a similar experience  Humans have a tendency to flock to common thoughts or ideas  In like fashion  the general mood of the populace  or a smaller group of the broader population  does shift based on recent trends  In viewing the current status of the investment climate  what we saw this week was a shift in mood  We all know the investor class is a fickle fellow  and over the last few months a sour demeanor settled in as China was terrible and had no hope of getting better 
Of course  that is  until the Federal Reserve Board decided not to raise interest rates  We learned this week they were not close to doing the deed  and many believe lift off will not happen until 2016  Another friendly data point arrived on Monday as the U S  Energy Administration revealed global oil demand would grow to 95 2 million barrels a day  with supply coming in at a shade under 96 million  bbl d   Guess what country will have stronger than expected demand  Yup  the big C  The fact that China also is averaging about 20 million cars being sold per year  above the 18 million per year for the U S   has to help the oil cause  Kinda proves the old saw the best cure for low oil prices  is  ta da  low oil prices  Still  it may take another six months or so to work off the overhang of supply 
With the weakness in the dollar  the entire commodity complex was dramatically helped as prices rose across the board  In Europe  the largest commodity trader Glencore  LONDON GLEN  saw a lift when it announced it would cut production for a broad group of it s items  including zinc  copper  coal  platinum  and cobalt  Clearly  the pain in the commodity world is having an affect  One need only also look at the price of Anglo American  LONDON AAL  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  for confirmation of that as well 
In the corporate world  merger and acquisition activity continued unabated  Skyworks Solutions Inc  NASDAQ SWKS  announced it will buy PMC   Sierra Inc  NASDAQ PMCS  for  2 billion smackers  Dell is reported to be looking at buying EMC  NYSE EMC  in a private equity transaction worth nearly  50 billion  Much of the capital will be debt so this one is not a done deal  Across the pond  neither is a possible take out of SABMiller  LONDON SAB  for over  100 billion  Clearly  investment bankers across the world are a little busy these days  so forgive them if they don t return your call  I know it makes you anxious when they forget 
In earnings news  both YUM brands and Domino s pizza gave their investors a little indigestion with results which were below previous expectations  For Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM   China was a huge problem as what was supposed to be 10  growth came in at 2  and the investor base was not pleased  Naturally  the stock got crushed the next day to the tune of 20   Domino s  NYSE DPZ  was not nearly as bad but when results are light  stocks go down  and the pepperoni with cheese and onions was off about 5 bucks  Alcoa  NYSE AA  also announced a tough quarter and ditto  the stock sells off slightly  See a similar a pattern  Next week  JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  kicks off the earnings parade on Tuesday and for the next month  results will roll in non stop  Wall Street is expecting a slight decline for most of the largest corporations  especially those with large exposure to emerging markets  Should be interesting

On the opposite side of the spectrum  Marco Rubio was here in Vegas  as was Donald Trump  Didn t run into either of them  but if I do  will make sure I said hello  especially after they ask you for a contribution  yet again  Apparently the Koch brothers are starting to narrow down who they might give their billion bucks of support to  and it looks like the choices are Carly  Jeb  and Marco  You never know how a mood shift might change where their big dough winds up  Thanks for reading the blog this week

17399,238914,FCX,Copper Signaling Bottom Could Be At Hand  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Anxiety is a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind  If encouraged  it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained    Arthur Somers RocheOnce upon a time  in the good old days  before QE changed everything  any signs of strength from copper could be construed as a sign that the economy was on the mend  After QE  this story came to an end  and a new reality came into play  The Fed manipulated the markets in favour of short term gains  a policy that has maintained an ultra low interest rate environment that favours speculators and punishes savers 
In the past  the financial markets would have marched more or less to the same drumbeat as copper  The chart below illustrates that this no longer holds true  Instead of crashing with copper  the financial markets soared to new highs  
One wonders  what will unfold when copper does finally put in a bottom  Will the financial markets rally in unison once again with Doctor Copper  or diverge as they have done for the past several years  Copper is issuing rather strong signs that a bottom could be close at hand 
Our trend indicator has not turned bullish yet  but it is dangerously close to issuing a bullish signal  There are  however  several technical indicators flashing positive divergence signals  and this could be construed as a bullish development 
Technical outlook for Dr  Copper

Failure to hold above 2 40 will most likely result in a test of the 2 20 ranges  The ideal setup would be for copper to trade to new lows  and trigger a buy signal in the process 
Generally speaking  the elite players love to create the illusion that the market is ready to break out  This ploy is known as a head fake  a move set to fool regular market technicians and the masses into thinking a bottom is in place  If you take the time to look at long term charts  you will see how splendidly this ruse has worked over the decades 
The market in question does initially rally  but then it breaks down  The early bulls panic and dump everything  This usually triggers a fast move to new lows and then the smart money rushes in and starts to buy  which then ushers in a more sustainable bottom 
Based on this premise  one could argue that this trick was employed in February of 2015  The markets rallied into May and then broke down again 
If you look at the above chart  you will notice that this has occurred before  so one cannot put faith on this factor alone  Other factors have to come into play as well  and it looks like those other factors could be coming into play now  we will mention them below 
Our goal has never been to predict the exact bottom in any market which is an endeavour we feel is best left to fools with an inordinate appetite for pain  We wait for the market to issue strong signals that a bottom is in or is close at hand  Sometimes this means getting in a bit early and sometimes it means getting in a bit later  The idea should be to catch the main move and not obsess about trying to get in at the exact bottom  A monthly close above 2 50 would be a strong signal that a bottom is in place and that copper is attempting to mount a strong rally 
Other factors that could be viewed as bullish developments  

Copper prices are trading in the extremely oversold ranges  for the past decade copper has traded above 2 40  The only exception was the financial crisis of 2008 
Freeport McMoran  N FCX  has stated it s going to suspend operations at several of its North American mines  It will suspend operations at its Miami mine In Arizona  reduce production by 50  at its Tyrone mine in New Mexico and adjust productions at other U S  sites 
Glencore PLC  L GLEN   a major copper producer  shocked the markets by stating it would suspend production at two locations for 18 months  Two mines  the Katanga and the Mopani mines  are located in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia  These two mines account for roughly 1 9   2  of the global output of copper 
Chile s state owned Codelco has gone on record stating that they will  cut costs to the bone   They have also delayed many expansion projects  Two notable expansion projects that have been delayed are at the Chuquicamata and Andina complex 
Numerous key technical indicators are trading in extremely oversold ranges and many have triggered positive divergence signals which could be construed as a bullish development 
The mantra out there for a while has been that China is in deep trouble  Thus  it must have come as a shock to many bearish analysts that China imported 350 000 metric tons of copper  up 4   from the same period last year  This is something to pay attention to as it could be the beginning of a new trend  China accounts for roughly 45  of the total copper demand  Analysts are now offering diverging stories  with some reversing course and stating that there could be a copper deficit this year  while others continue to stick with their predictions that there will be an oversupply of copper until 2016  Regardless of the outcome  diverging opinions are a good sign as it indicates that the experts really know nothing  Knowing nothing is usually a signal that some sort of turnaround is in the works 
Additionally  while Chinese imports of refined and semi refined copper products were flat in August  its imports of concentrates surged approximately 20  from a year ago  and over 18  from the previous month  Could this be the beginning of a new trend 

 So what s next for Dr  Copper 
A plethora of factors such as power outages  extremely bad weather  planned cuts by many of the largest mines in the world  strikes  etc   could potentially push this market into a deficit earlier than many experts assert  This would pave the way for price gains much earlier than expected  Experts are notorious for coming to the party late and leaving way too early  While the action in the copper markets looks promising  copper is still not out of the woods  a monthly close above 2 50 would serve as the first strong bullish confirmation that copper is getting ready to mount a sustainable rally  Our trend indicator has not turned bullish yet  but it is dangerously close to doing so  Once it turns bullish  we will start to look at this sector in a more aggressive manner 
Four copper stocks and ETFs to consider 
As the market is extremely oversold and there are signs of a potential reversal  it would make sense to look at some of the stronger plays in this sector  Southern Copper Corporation  N SCCO  and FXC are examples of two decent plays in this sector  One could also go long via Global X Copper Miners ETF  N COPX  and iPath DJ UBS Copper  N JJC   For disclosure purposes we would like to add that our subscribers are long FXC for an average entry price of 9 00  If the sector continues to show signs of strength  we will look to add to our position and deploy additional funds into new stocks in this sector 
History clearly illustrates that when an asset is cheap and sentiment is negative that the time to buy is close at hand  Mass psychology dictates that you should be wary when the masses are joyous and overjoyed when they are not  The crowd is decidedly negative and so an opportunity could be in the air 
Indecision is debilitating  it feeds upon itself  it is  one might almost say  habit forming  Not only that  but it is contagious  it transmits itself to other    H  A  Hopf",2015-10-12,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dr-copper-back-from-the-dead--is-it-time-to-buy-267828,267828
17400,238915,FCX,The Terrible Tale Of Two Commodity Catch 22s,opinion,"How the mighty have fallen  Last week  one of the world s commodities giants  Glencore  L GLEN   experienced a major blow 
On September 28  its stock collapsed by 30   The reason  The company s very heavy debt load in the face of  
The former commodities trading giant went public in a  60 billion stock market flotation four years ago  At the time  its traders transacted 60  of the world s zinc  50  of the copper  and 45  of the lead 
It became a physical commodities powerhouse when its head  Ivan Glasenberg  forced a merger with one of the world s biggest miners  Xstrata  in 2013 
But now  its shares are down more than 80  from the issue price  And worries persist in the market that Glencore may be the next Lehman Brothers 
A Back Breaking Debt Load
That particular fear may be overblown 
You see  Lehman Brothers may have had up to a trillion dollars in derivatives exposure 
Glencore does have about  100 billion in liabilities including  30 billion in net debt  Not good when your market capitalization is down to less than  20 billion  And the debt is 2 7 times annual earnings 
However  Glencore s derivatives exposure is more limited than Lehman Brothers   It s believed to have a bit over  10 billion in derivative assets and close to  12 billion in derivative liabilities  Scary  but not Lehman  It may have had up to a trillion dollars in gross over the counter derivatives trades 
Its real problem is how to service that  30 billion in debt while commodities tumble  In effect  with each slide in commodities  Glencore s leverage grows as its assets shrink  sinking the company further into quicksand 
Glencore is in a quagmire of its own doing  Most in the industry point to the  60 billion  including debt  acquisition of Xstrata as the turning point  Glencore took on a lot of debt for assets that weren t all that great  Most of Glencore s other mining assets are in the high cost  low quality variety 
In the two years following the deal  two of the key components   copper and coal   fell sharply in price  They were down 30  and 41   respectively 
Trying to Dig Out
So now  Glencore is trying to dig out from under that huge debt pile 
It has taken the easy steps  like eliminating its dividend and issuing new shares for a total of  5 billion  Now the company faces the tough part  It s going to have to try to sell some assets into a very depressed commodities market 
Unfortunately for Glencore  it may have to sell a stake in one of its remaining jewels   the agricultural division  This division was beefed up by the 2012 acquisition of Viterra  a grain handler based in Canada 
Overall  its agricultural arm contributed  856 million in earnings last year  That was about a third of the company s marketing division profits 
It s also likely Glencore will do a streaming deal for its gold and silver properties  This involves getting cash upfront in exchange for royalties on future sales of its gold and silver 
The Effect on Physical Commodities
But here s where things get interesting  Its trading division is sitting on vast inventories of physical commodities 
Glencore itself admits it s holding about  17 billion worth  It says about two thirds of that is oil related  The remainder is in various metals  And it s likely that zinc was among the metals  Glencore is one of the largest miners and traders of zinc in the world  Zinc had been a strong outperformer  based on mine closures and dwindling supplies 
But then zinc collapsed to a five year low in September as massive supplies began showing up at London Metal Exchange warehouses in New Orleans  Glencore s warehouse business  Pacorini Metals  dominates the storage market in New Orleans 
But on October 9 we saw the biggest one day intraday jump  up 12   in zinc since 1989 
The reason is Glencore is cutting one third of its global zinc production  which is about 500 000 metric tons  But any rally cannot be sustained without further cuts by other miners 
But don t think for a moment Glencore is done liquidating commodities inventories  such as copper  It s desperate to stay afloat  But this maneuver will only push commodity prices even lower   a real catch 22 
A Coppery Future
Speaking of copper  the company s whole future may rest on it  Mining copper accounts for about a third of its core earnings  But that hasn t been a good business  as prices have fallen to a six year low on excess supplies 
Glencore has suspended operations at copper mines in Zambia  which will take 400 000 metric tons out of the market  And another troubled miner  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX   is cutting about 75 000 tons worth of production 
But much more is needed to balance supply and demand  Perhaps another 500 000 tons  That will only happen if copper continues to fall  Another catch 22 for Glencore 
It looks as if Emperor Glasenberg has no clothes

Nowhere is this more true than in the world of high dividend stocks  A generation ago  investors looked to the bond market for income  That made sense when you could get a safe yield of 8  or higher  But at today s puny yields  bonds aren t going to cut it for most retirees  The 10 Year Treasury yields about 2 1  as I m writing this  That means you d need to have  3 6 million invested just to generate an income of  75 000 per year 
Well  that s a problem  Most retired investors don t have  3 6 million  In fact  most don t have one tenth of that  So they ve been committing that cardinal sin of investing  They re chasing yield in high dividend paying stocks 
Let s say that you find a stock yielding a fat 10  in dividends  You can generate that same  75 000 with just  750 000 invested  Now  that s still a lot of money  of course  But it s a lot less than  3 6 million 
But there is a problem with this  Remember  bond interest is a contractual obligation  If the bondholder doesn t pay you  you can sue them  And if they fall into bankruptcy  you are first in line to get paid 
Not so with dividends  A company can cut its dividend at any time at the discretion of the board of directors  And as an investor  there s not a thing you can do about it 
Dividends get slashed all the time  According to Street Insider  837 companies have cut or eliminated their dividend in this year alone  including large players like Freeport McMoran  N FCX   As recently as August  Freeport McMoran was yielding nearly 10   Well  that was before they slashed the quarterly payout to just  0 05 per share  Earlier this year  the payout was  0 313 per share 
I m not going to tell you to dump all of your dividend paying stocks  But I am going to give you some advice on how to better think about dividends 
To start  longevity and growth are far more important than current yield  The longer a stock has paid a dividend  the less likely it is that that dividend will be cut  There can always be a crisis that comes out of the blue   think the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill that clobbered BP  N BP    but if a company has managed to pay and grow its dividend for multiple consecutive decades  this is a company that can likely survive a zombie apocalypse 
The next point to remember is the payout ratio  This can be defined differently for different types of stocks  for example  REITs and MLPs use different accounting terminology   but the concept is the same  A healthy company should be paying out considerably less in dividends than it takes in as earnings and cash flow  It s not sustainable for a company to pay out more than it takes in  Yet I never cease to be amazed by how investors routinely get suckered into yield traps like these 
So  if you want a durable income portfolio to tide you over in retirement  repeat after me 

Don t chase yield 
Dividends are riskier than bond interest
A company can t pay out more than it takes in forever

17403,238918,FCX,Copper  Global Production Will Inevitably Contract,opinion,"For the last year  copper and zinc prices have fallen by more than a quarter  Some days ago  the major commodities trader Glencore  L GLEN  decided to sell its two copper mines that provide 2  of global copper supply and to cut its zinc production by 4  of global zinc supply  Thus  the company expects to support the global base metals prices and to settle some of its debts  On the other hand  the concerns around the economic slowdown in China  the major copper importer  are rising  Where can we see the copper and zinc prices the coming month and will commodities companies place further pressure upon base metals pricing 
The Swiss Glencore is selling some of its assets  which does not surprise us  The company s stocks have slumped 60  since the start of the year  Its current capitalization is  26 2bln  which is far below the net debt of  30bln  The main metallurgical asset that Glencore is depriving of to lower the credit burden is the nickel field Araguaia in Brazil estimated in about  8bln  Moreover  two rather small copper fields in Chile and Australia will be realized at about  0 5 0 6bln  They provided Glencore with about 15  of its gross copper production  so the move is unlikely to influence the global markets significantly  Nevertheless  driven by low prices  the company cut its gross copper production in the first half year by 3   or 26 4 thousand tones  Early in September  Glencore said it was planning to freeze production on its mines in Congo and Zambia  The move will deprive the global market of 400 tones of copper  This news has not influenced copper prices significantly  But later too  other companies  Freeport McMoran  N FCX  and KGHM  L 0O8D   announced production cuts  This week they were accompanied by another mining giant Rio Tinto  L RIO  that is planning to reduce copper production this year by 11 17   which accounts for about 70 thousand tonnes 
Despite all this news  global markets do not look enthusiastic  The production cuts are scheduled only for the future  while the copper stockpiles in Shanghai Futures Exchange depots have shown a weekly rise of 11 4  due to the slowing China s economy  The Chinese GDP is forecasted to slow down to 6 5  next year from 6 8  expected this year  For this reason  the market participants expect the global copper glut to reach the volume of 349 thousand tones  This is much more than their forecast of excessive 194 thousand tones three month ago  The consensus forecast predicts the contraction of copper surplus to 177 thousand tones next year but it barely supports the prices 
We believe that the main copper producers have already had their say on the matter and the global production will inevitably contract  It partly makes the market more predictable  In our opinion  now it will better response to the macroeconomic data from China and U S  For instance  the significant copper price movements are possible after the release of the Chinese GDP for the 3rd quarter  September industrial production and retail sales on Monday morning ",2015-10-23,IFC Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/copper:-chinese-factor-269046,269046
17404,238919,FCX,SPX Closes At 2 Month High Due To Positive Quarterly Reports,opinion,"On Thursday  US stocks quotes rose  The S P 500 index closed at 2 month high  This was mainly due to the publication of McDonald s  N MCD  good quarterly corporate report  shares climbed 8 1    eBay  O EBAY    13 9   and Dow Chemical  N DOW    5 1    After the market closure  more positive news appeared  Alphabet shares  former Google  O GOOGL   price increased 9 6   Microsoft  O MSFT    7 2   and Amazon  O AMZN    by 10 6   Macroeconomic data were also positive  The number of unemployed in the US increased less than expected last week  Home sales in the secondary housing market in September exceeded forecasts and reached 5 55 million  which is close to the maximum since 2007  This has contributed to a significant strengthening of the US dollar  US stock market turnover was 11  higher than the average for the 20 sessions and has reached 8 billion shares  Manufacturing PMI index for October calculated by Markit will be published today at 15 45 in the US 
European stock indices also increased yesterday  Besides the positive dynamics in the United States  the ECB meeting contributed to this as well  The ECB president Mario Draghi noted that the ECB may revise its monetary policy in order to fight against low inflation in December  The emission will be proceeded in the amount of 60 billion Euros per month in order to purchase the assets and may be extended after the planned completion in September 2016  The European Central Bank inflation targeting level is 2   while it was 0 1  in September  European stock markets are still increasing today as positive PMI data published  No significant EU statistics is expected  The euro quote decreased due to a possible increase in the emission of the ECB 
Nikkei increased for the third day in a row  along with other world stock indices  Shares of food producer Snack food company Calbee  T 2229  climbed 9 6  and soft drinks producer Megmilk Snow Brand  T 2270    by 10 5  due to the forecast of their positive financial April September reports published in the Nikkei business daily  Regular Japan macroeconomic data will be released next Wednesday morning 
Copper quotes rose after the announcement of further 100 million pounds reducing its production by US company Freeport McMoran  N FCX   It was reduced by 150 million pounds earlier and now the company intends to realize 4 1 million pounds of copper in 2015 and 5 2 million pounds of copper in 2016  Company s copper sales amounted to 4 2 million pounds last year  There is another factor that influences its growth  copper import to China reached 351 thousand tons in September  This is the highest record since January 2014  Copper delivery to China amounted 2 55 million tons for the last 9 months  which is only 3 6  below last year s level  Market participants do not exclude that the slowdown of the Chinese economy may not reduce the demand for copper  though it was expected by many of them  Investment company Antaike published a forecast concerning demand increasing for the metal in China about 4 4 5  next year  and about 5 3  increasing this year  Gold is increasing in price today  despite the strengthening of the US dollar  This is due to the demand increase in India  Dussehra  the festival which starts in November  raises the demand for gold jewelry  which is a custom gift during the festival  Jewelry products provide two thirds of gold demand in India

17419,238934,FCX,Copper MMI Unable To Rally Despite Shutdowns  Small Gain,opinion,"Our copper MMI index rose by just 1 point in November to 66 from 65 in October 
Like other base metals  copper prices have been more stable over the past three months  After the metal plummeted during the summer  prices recovered from six year lows on the back of supply cuts by major producers  However  we still see a lot of price weakness across the board and the fact that prices are not able to fully rally on supply cuts may be indicative of the fact that we have yet to see a floor for copper prices 

In early November  Glencore  L GLEN  announced that it would reduce its copper production more than expected  The company is now aiming to cut output by 455 000 metric tons by the end of 2017  14  up from its previously announced figures  Glencore s cuts and another recently announced pullback in production from Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  N FCX  could raise hopes of more shutdowns  however  other major producers have indicated that they don t have any intention of cutting production 
Low Prices  Lower Costs
Despite low prices  many copper producers are still earning decent profits thanks to lower operating costs  BHP Billiton  L BLT  and Rio Tinto Group  L RIO  are ramping up their copper production 
In fact  BHP says that its mines are still generating cash  The company is confident that its well diversified and low cost portfolio will keep generating profits in spite of falling prices  Meanwhile  Rio Tinto announced no intentions to cut its production and lose market share  Thanks to its low cost assets  the company sees an opportunity to actually increase its market share by expanding its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia 
Given that 45  of copper demand comes from China  the slowdown in the Chinese economy offset the boost from production cuts on copper prices  So far  mine shutdowns have been unsuccessful in triggering a bull run  It seems that production cuts are only giving support to falling copper prices but it remains unclear if these shutdowns would hold prices against more disappointing macroeconomic releases coming from China 
What This Means For Metal Buyers
Copper is not giving buyers any reason to panic on mine shutdowns  While we have a strong dollar  weak Chinese demand and a still bearish commodity environment it will be hard to see copper making significant upside moves 
Price Trends
Prices worldwide were pretty stable this month  The biggest gains were in Japanese copper primary cash with a 4  increase to  5 395 per mt and a 6  increase in Korean copper strip prices to  7 48 per kilogram  On the downside  The price of US copper producer grade 102  110 and 122 all saw a small 1  decrease this month

17423,238938,FCX,Behind Indonesia mining deal  newly minted minister and U S  mining legend,news,"By Randy Fabi  Fergus Jensen and Michael Taylor
JAKARTA  Reuters    As negotiations to resolve an increasingly bitter dispute over Indonesian mining rules teetered on the brink of collapse  the chairman of Freeport McMoRan Inc James  Jim Bob  Moffett flew to Jakarta for last ditch talks 
Indonesia s chief economics minister  Chairul Tanjung  said he had got to a point where he felt only talking directly to the 76 year old U S  mining legend might break a deadlock in the six month row  which had already cost Southeast Asia s top economy more than  1 billion and put thousands of jobs at risk 
In less than two hours the two men had reached an agreement  setting the stage to resume exports and restore badly needed government revenue to the world s fourth most populous nation 
 I just convinced him that this was the maximum the government can give   Tanjung said in an interview   He believed me  I believed him and we shook hands  Very simple  
Tanjung  one of Indonesia s richest businessmen  was appointed minister in May and made reaching a deal to get mining exports going again a priority to revive an economy suffering its sharpest slowdown since the global financial crisis 
But a looming presidential election had made it even harder to reach a politically unpopular compromise with foreign miners 
Aside from any chemistry between the two successful businessmen  the breakthrough came because Moffett had taken a more flexible approach  said Tanjung 
The dispute with Freeport had centered on its refusal to pay an escalating mineral concentrate export tax and its bid to extend its mining contract  The meeting was only attended by a small number of Indonesian officials and Freeport  and according to Tanjung the solution was to focus on what the two could agree on to get exports restarted and set other issues aside for now 
Freeport agreed to a  115 million downpayment for a smelter  to pay higher royalties and divest more of its Indonesian unit 
Indonesia in return substantially cut the concentrate export tax for Freeport and other miners building smelters 
Moffett is a likeable and larger than life Louisiana businessman  known for his Elvis impersonations during lighter moments  but also a shrewd deal maker 
Starting his career as a wildcat prospector in Louisiana  Moffett founded McMoRan Oil   Gas Co with two of his partners in 1969 and put together the merger with Freeport 12 years later 
With a 47 year history in Indonesia  Freeport s fortunes were transformed by the discovery of the Grasberg mine in Papua  one of the world s biggest deposits of gold and copper 
Helped by Moffett s ties to late autocratic President Suharto  Freeport won the right in 1988 to mine Grasberg  which has been a lightning rod for grievances over its impact on the environment  security arrangements and revenue sharing 
The recent talks did not touch on Freeport s controversial links to the Suharto family or environmental issues  said Sukhyar  director general for coal and minerals at the ministry  who played a role in the negotiations 
HIGH STAKES
In January  Indonesia introduced a mineral ore export ban and the escalating tax on metal concentrate shipments in a bid to force miners to process raw materials to lift their value 
But the tough measures in some cases backfired as miners such as Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp said the rules breached their contracts and exports stopped 
The stakes were high on both sides 
The Grasberg complex in Papua provided around a fifth of Freeport s global revenue last year 
In Indonesia  the company employs 24 000 including contractors  and is one of the country s largest tax payers 
Freeport believed the new mining rules  particularly the export tax  violated its contract  The company refused to pay the tax and invest in a copper smelter unless the government provided assurances it would be allowed to continue operating after its contract expires in 2021 
Freeport wanted certainty to spend more than  15 billion to build what would be the world s biggest underground mine  while the government said it could not renegotiate until 2019  two years before the contract expired 
Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto said the breakthrough came when the new minister arrived with a business background 
 He understood that it is impossible for a company to continue such huge investments if there are no legal guarantees for the long term continuation and fiscal certainty  
A trained dentist  Tanjung  52  was ranked as Indonesia s fifth richest man by Forbes with a net wealth of  4 billion  His company CT Corp now operates two of the country s top five TV stations and has retail and banking interests 
DENGUE FEVER
Freeport had sent its chief executive  Richard Adkerson  to Jakarta in June to focus on negotiating a deal 
Despite weeks of talks  which included meeting at a Jakarta hospital after a senior negotiator fell ill with dengue fever  the two sides remained deadlocked 
 Adkerson was here for a month  He was running from pillar to post and nothing was happening   said a senior industry official with knowledge of the negotiations  who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue 
According to the minister  Adkerson  an accountant by training  wanted to stick very closely to the terms of Freeport s contract 
 He wanted to continue their Contract of Work  He wanted to keep paying the same royalties   the old rate   Tanjung said 
Freeport s Soetjipto said Adkerson s contribution in reaching a deal was  very important  
Requests for comment from Moffett and Adkerson sought via a spokesman at Freeport s head office in Phoenix were declined 
An emailed statement said   the Company and its executives have sought to engage in constructive discussions and to maintain good relations with Indonesian officials including the President  Ministers  Parliamentary representatives  and local officials of each respective administration  
 BIGGER PICTURE 
By the end of June  talks were at a breaking point and some were questioning whether Freeport had a future in Indonesia 
 I told them   If they want to continue business here I don t want to discuss it with Adkerson any more    Tanjung said   I want to talk with the chairman  
At the same time  negotiations with Indonesia s second biggest copper producer Newmont also reached an impasse and the U S  miner decided to file for international arbitration 
The move soured relations and the government threatened to terminate Newmont s contract if the company did not withdraw its legal challenge 
Freeport chose a different path and decided instead to keep negotiating  with Moffett flying to Jakarta 
At the private meeting in Jakarta in early July  Tanjung and Moffett agreed to leave the most contentious issues over contract renegotiations to the next government and instead focus on getting exports restarted 
Tanjung told Reuters he felt he needed to bring Moffett in because  as a chairman you can see a bigger picture  
A memorandum of understanding that was initially 90 pages long was whittled down to just 10 pages  the bare bones of what the two sides could agree on  said an industry official with knowledge of the matter  who declined to be named 
The government also agreed to a framework valid for at least six months that could be used to renegotiate the contract under the next administration 
The final step left was for the cabinet and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to approve the MOU  though the unfolding presidential election delayed ratification and there were concerns the deal could still fall through 

But finally drawing a line under the near seven month dispute  a shipment of 10 000 tonnes of copper concentrate left Indonesia for China on Aug  8

17442,238957,FCX,A Roller Coaster Week On Wall Street,opinion," There s something about a roller coaster that triggers strong feelings  maybe because most of us associate them with childhood  They re inherently cinematic  the very shape of a coaster  all hills and valleys and sickening helices  evokes a human emotional response  
 Diablo Cody

As Labor Day fast approaches  the end of the summer is in sight  Many families go on summer vacation for one last bonding experience  One place many people visit is an amusement park and for those who like the joy of fast rides  anything with huge roller coasters works quite nicely  Global financial markets endured their own version of thrills and spills this week  as it certainly was historic by any measure  In fact  you might accurately say there were far more death defying drops and recoveries in U S  equity markets than nearly any five day period in our countries history  Even for those of us who have endured plenty of volatility over the last twenty years  this week certainly was  well  an up and down experience 
On Sunday night  I was coming back from a trip to Del Mar in San Diego with my family when I checked U S  equity futures  I knew they would probably be down a bit after last Friday s poor session  but when I saw China down nearly 8   the fact that our markets would open up down over 500 was  shall we say  eye opening  Monday morning started with a massive 1100 point drop  and some huge companies traded down in a big way  As an example  General Electric  NYSE GE  is a 250 billion dollar entity and it s stock price opened down 20   According to my simple math  that is a loss of 50 billion on paper  There were other companies which suffered in a similar fashion  The rational investor has to ask themselves  is GE worth 50 billion less today than it was on Friday  With 150 billion in sales  and nearly 30 billion in cash flow  I suspect the simple answer is no  Markets rallied back  but finished down 560 that day and another 200 on Tuesday after being up the entire time  except the last half hour  Stocks were helped by a strong durable goods number on Wednesday and a 3 7  2nd quarter revised GDP number on Thursday  beating the expected 3 2  figure   All in all  the market ended up over 1  on the week  Still  the crucial question has to be asked  What  prey tell  is happening in our markets 
The answer lies in the evolution of our markets into digital domains where every global entity is interconnected  This week  the rule of 48 was adopted three times in the United States  It is a little known and obscure rule the major exchanges use to supposedly help mitigate extreme volatility in order to open trading in an orderly fashion  Clearly  the repercussions of China s trading sessions are clicking through to our shores  In combination with the huge leverage offered in commodity and foreign exchange trading  you can begin to picture margin calls were part of the equation this week  After reading in the Wall Street Journal about how large banks were placing the same message to investors who used equity lines of credit backed by stocks  it becomes clear what took place  Adding further to the confusion  there were large exchange traded funds which had troubles calculating their net asset values because of software glitches  Finally  it was revealed that in August  49  of all the volume traded in equity markets came through high frequency trading  Lovely  Just lovely 
After the flash crash a few years ago  this week s events will not inspire confidence for the Average Joe in terms of trusting capital markets  You can see how people now equate investing with gambling  or even video games  Fortunately  that is not the case  Investing always involves the fluctuation of prices  which is why there is risk and opportunity  As someone responsible for handling client  friends and family capital  it is critical for me to make thoughtful decisions about what assets we want to own in these stressed environment  It requires sober analysis  and perhaps even more important  steady nerves  In most cases  time is on your side  especially when you own high quality businesses  Which is why when they go on sale  the best and the brightest swoop in to take advantage 
In thinking about that subject  highly regarded oil services firm Schlumberger NV  NYSE SLB  acquired Cameron International  NYSE CAM  for  12 7 billion  Friday  we learned our friend Mr  Buffett bought 10  of oil refiner ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Carl Icahn acquired almost as much of Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  in another high profile purchase  All of these transactions are in the oil and commodity complex  which clearly has attracted interested parties  The logical conclusion for investors is pretty self evident  Good luck in your efforts 
Turning to financial results from specific companies  Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  and Dollar General  NYSE DG  released earnings which generally disappointed investors  Tiffany was hurt by the strong dollar and Dollar General missed on the top line and in comparable store sales figure  They also offered shaky guidance for the rest of the year  Next week s big event is the August jobs number on Friday  It will help determine whether the FOMC decides to raise interest rates in September or keep it constant  In the mean time  enjoy  the ride  this week as it should be pretty interesting ",2015-08-30,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/welcome-to-wall-street's-roller-coaster-week!-263406,263406
17443,238958,FCX,The Real Threat From China s Stock Market Crash,opinion,"Conventional wisdom at the moment says that China s coming unglued and that the country s stock markets pose a grave danger to global investors  It s communist  it s a Ponzi scheme  it s ruled by insiders  it s leveraged up to its eyeballs  ghost cities  all the usual tired old arguments are being rolled out as if they re somehow new again 
In reality  the real risk isn t being reported  In fact  it s not even being talked about 
I want to focus on this disconnect today  because the China bashing crowd is right about one thing   that country s current challenges definitely affect your money  Just not the way most people think 
Here s what you need to know about China to properly  and profitably  position your portfolio 
The Great Fall of China  or the End of the Bling Dynasty 
The ongoing media narrative about China is as brutal as it gets  with legions of talking heads and mainstream pundits whipping up story after story about how the world s second largest economy is coming unglued 
For example  author and China expert Gordon Chang  best known for his 2001 book  The Coming Collapse of China   noted on CNN recently that  China could be in the world s greatest depression and they would still report 7    He s alluding to the fact that  everybody  knows Chinese economic data is manipulated 
The implication  of course  is that ours isn t   which is a lesson in irony if I ve ever seen one   considering what our government s done to everything from employment figures to manufacturing input 
Meanwhile  well known China bears like Jim Chanos have returned anew with cataclysmic warnings about why the Chinese market meltdown will mean the end of the financial universe as we know it   Whatever you might think  it s worse   he told CNBC s  Fast Money  last August 
Never mind that he s an avowed short seller   and a good one at that   or the fact that people have been saying exactly the same thing about U S  markets since March 2009  right before the S P 500 took off on a generational 186  run 
A little perspective is clearly in order 
First  if China s market were really the global colossus the media s made it out to be  you can bet that our markets would have taken that into account years ago and shifted to the Far East accordingly 
But they didn t  and they won t for a long time to come 
Look at the following map  which depicts national boundaries commensurate with stock market size  It pretty much tells the story 

 But  but  they re really volatile   goes the thinking  The argument states that investors have no business setting their sights on the Red Dragon because our own markets are more stable 
Uh huh  on the heels of the wild 1 000  point drop in the Dow seen on Aug  24 and the following Wednesday s 619 point rocket ride higher  ask yourself if you really believe that  I don t 
No doubt Chinese stock markets can give investors a roller coaster ride  In fact  they re the most volatile on the planet at the moment  after Greece 
But here s the thing  Chinese markets were still 30  less volatile than the maximum volatility achieved in the world s six major market crashes since 1929  according to Bloomberg 

Let me break this down another way 
The Chinese stock market meltdown that supposedly is so critical to U S  markets is a drop in the bucket compared to the 78  implosion when the dot bomb bubble burst here in 2000  and the 84  shellacking in Russia after that country defaulted in 1998 
Keep in mind that the U S  economy has absorbed far bigger shock waves from overseas economic implosions before  It will again 
China s Bureaucracy Could Be Your Best Buffer Against Market Turmoil
With the exception of the NASDAQ collapse in 2000  every other major crash in the chart I ve just shared with you was caused by a breakdown that was either banking or debt related  China s stock market  disaster  is merely an internal adjustment that s bringing prices back down from nosebleed levels  Keep in mind  between June 2014 and June 2015  China s Shanghai Composite Index rose by 150  
That  too  is normal for China  where individual investors having little or no experience investing account for an estimated 70  of all stock market transactions  Some 67  of the tens of millions of investors there have less than a high school education  according to a survey reported by The Guardian  So  like our markets at the beginning of the last century  they re totally ill equipped to handle the ups and downs that Western investors take for granted as a fundamental part of capitalism  But they will anyway  as part of the inevitable maturation process that all capital markets undergo over time 
Further  Chinese A shares   meaning those traded on mainland exchanges   are largely blocked from foreign investors  That means Chinese investors can bid them up to their hearts  content almost in complete isolation and without the institutional selling that would otherwise balance that out 
Things are so bad that investing has quite literally become a spectator sport  with tens of thousands of brokerage houses in cities all over China providing theater like seating so customers can chart the rise and fall of their investments 
I ve been to more than a few of them over the years  and you d be hard pressed not to think you were in Vegas at the craps tables because of the way emotions flow through the crowd 
This picture  for example  shows a brokerage house in Beijing on a good day  All the red you see actually means that the Chinese markets were having a great day  The few green lines are actually stocks headed lower   In China  red is up and green is down  
Here in the United States  roughly 70  of trading volume is generated by institutions  That gives our markets a pronounced stability that most investors either take for granted or have never thought about before  Further  U S  markets are open to millions of participants around the world  resulting in a constant stream of buying and selling rather than unidirectional  manic buying or selling 
And finally  many Chinese bears are concerned that money will flee China and suck the lifeblood out of the world s global growth engine  This isn t really the big deal they make it out to be either 
According to the World Bank  only 7  of Chinese households have invested in Chinese markets  allocating an average of 9  of their wealth  according to Beijing  Either way  that implies that more than 90  of Chinese households haven t invested in their country s stock market  yet  To use a very American stock market expression  there s still plenty of money on the sidelines 
In reality  money leaving China would be great for one simple reason  the vast majority of it would head straight for the most sophisticated and stable stock market on the planet  which is ours 
China s Markets Aren t China s Economy
Pundits tend to wrongly equate the direction of a country s markets with the trajectory of its GDP  That s a loose correlation at best because the former is a financial instrument while the latter is an economic one  Even if growth has slowed from 7  to merely 4   that s not the disaster everybody thinks  especially when you consider how central banks in Europe  the United States  and Japan have spent trillions and have very little to show for their efforts 
The real risk here is something nobody s talking about   that Beijing uses current market conditions as an excuse to slam down on the economic reforms that have gotten it this far 
If you think things have been wild now  imagine what happens if Beijing actually cuts off trade and reverts to Soviet style communism rather than the capitalist version they ve adopted 
So how do you build an investment strategy to prepare for this threat 
No doubt the situation in China is serious  but it s all about psychology  not economic reality  That means you probably want to confine investments in China to very small slivers of your portfolio  just as you would any speculative investment 
Investing because of China is another matter entirely  That s because China is the world s last true growth market  It will remain volatile  but as such  also filled with opportunity 
Your best bets will be Western companies traded on Western exchanges tapped into the huge wealth creation  It s not for nothing  for example  that Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  is focused on China  The same is true for The Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO   Starbucks Corp  NASDAQ SBUX   and Ford Motor Co   NYSE F   Even Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP  announced a joint venture in China 
Of course  resource companies like BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  work  too  They re major commodities players that will tap into the underlying production that quite literally makes China go  They ve both been beaten down severely as China s growth rate has slowed and Westerners have predictably panicked  Yet they re ideally positioned to surge on an inevitable rebound for vital raw materials 
In closing  the real risk to China is one nobody s talking about  at least not that I m aware of 
So sit back and enjoy the entertainment as others squabble over what every squiggle in China s markets may or may not mean  The louder the Chinese doomsayers become  the more likely they are to be wrong yet again 
Growth there may slow  but it won t grind to a halt  barring a complete policy reversal from Beijing  and that s something 1 367 billion consumers will make sure never happens ",2015-09-06,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-real-threat-from-china's-stock-market-crash-264152,264152
17444,238959,FCX,Oil Slides On US Supply  Gold Down As JOLTS Bolsters Rate Rise,opinion,"Talking Points
Light risk demand in Asia followed heavy sell off in US 
Oil plunged below 44 to week s low  after sliding on swelling stockpiles per API 
Copper edged up on tumbling inventories and output cuts 
Gold at month s low as US job openings data bolstered case for rate rise 
Risk sell off during the US and early Asian sessions was as violent as the prior day s rally  until the Shanghai Composite saved the day  again  As it steadily edged up after the open  regional stock indices and commodity currencies bounced back  notwithstanding AUD s climb on high job data  
Nevertheless  commodities have detached from swings in asset market today as fundamental factors re surfaced and investors seemed extremely sensitive to price action 
Oil crashed below  44 to the lowest this week at 43 36 at mid morning Asia  perhaps as stops were tripped after it flirted with the 44 support level all morning  Downside support is weak after oil prices passed 23 6  Fibo on both the daily and weekly charts  and came close to a technical support at 43 21 
Oil also experienced high volatility overnight and gave back gains from Tuesday s rally after delayed report by the American Petroleum Institute outlined an unexpected stockpile increase of 2 1 million barrels  The EIA s Short Term Energy Outlook was less of a driver as its forecast of a drop in daily consumption met with 1 5 percent drop in daily output for 2016  The agency will release much waited weekly inventory report today 
Copper gradually edged up since the close of NYSE and so far seemed oblivious to swings in Shanghai shares or other commodities  Prices fell from a seven week high at 2 4755 yesterday  along with other metals and US stocks  Producer prices in China extended a 42 month decline  underlining slow factory growth 
However copper prices look to gather support from China s tumbling bonded warehouse inventories  estimated by Bloomberg  and collective output cuts by large producers including Glencore  OTC GLNCY   Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   Asarco and Ok Tedi 
Gold s recurring daily drop was exacerbated after a record high US Job openings triggered its plunge to 1101 43  a new monthly low  The JOLTS number indicated labour market is tightening and strengthened the case for the Fed to raise rates by year end 
GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
Gold swung around in the Asian session after falling to 1101 43 below a previous support level at 1101 72  This daily low will likely be a floor to intraday prices today  Prices also dropped past 23 6  Fibo and there is no other technical levels to keep trace of on the downside until 1079 9  the bottom of July August trough  Moving averages have lined up to form downtrend signal thus this week s focus will be on the downside 

COPPER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Yesterday copper halted the climb ahead of 38 2  Fibo at 2 4899 and it may respect this resistance level today  However  an uptrend signal is forming and there seems to be no hindrance on the way up apart from the Fibo level  Only repeated failures to break resistance would better indicate a correction or even reversal in copper 

CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
WTI oil quickly bounced back after it crashed to 43 36 today  Intraday momentum is poised to a reversal from the upper bound so oil will likely get stuck in sideways moves later in the session before EIA data release  The quick recovery from the monthly low may indicate that there is still sufficient demand at dips below the  40 mark and high volatility could be expected around this level ",2015-09-10,Dailyfx,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-slides-on-us-supply;-gold-down-as-jobs-data-bolsters-rate-rise-264644,264644

The average S P 500 stock is down quite a bit since this correction began   19  per Detrick    so expect the market to create more value for you in coming weeks  if you are a disciplined  longer term investor  before we see the typical  year end rally 
By the numbers  
The forward 4 quarter estimate for the S P 500 as of Friday  September 18th  2015 is  122 98  versus last week s  123 39 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate is 16 2 x  
The PEG ratio remains negative 
The S P 500 earnings yield as of Friday  September 18th  2015 was 6 25   versus last week s 6 29  
The y y growth rate on the forward estimate slid to  1 91  last week  versus the prior weeks  1 82   Although the y y growth rate has shown little deterioration  it has been negative for 21 straight weeks 
Analysis   conclusion 
Factset had an interesting line in their latest  Earnings Overview  section of the weekly  Earnings Insight  published every Friday afternoon 

  estimated earnings for the 3rd quarter  have fallen by 2 8   since June 30  This percentage decline is smaller than the trailing 5 year and 10 year averages at this point in time in the quarter  

There are a couple of different ways we can interpret this 
1   Q3  15 earnings are depressed already  as Q2  15 earnings are substantially completed  so there is little need for negative revisions 
2   There is some underlying strength in some sectors that are causing less downward pressure on sector earnings 
Personally  I think it is more the former than the latter  With Q3  15 and really Q4  15  we start to lap much easier Energy and US dollar comparisons  thus it would take additional significant declines in the Energy sector or dollar strength to move the earnings needle significantly   Here is where it gets particularly nuanced for readers to understand  using Thomson Reuters data  current  expected  sector growth estimates for Energy for Q3  15  Q4  15  and Q1  16  are  64    60  and  17 5  respectively  The point is  to move the overall S P 500 needle move significantly downward  given energy s 7  approximate market cap and earnings  weight in the S P 500  you would need sharply lower growth rates than above  The dollar s impact is much tougher to gauge or quantify within the S P 500  but its impact is more translational than operational in terms of financial reporting

In its ruling  the court said that the Safe Harbor agreement was flawed because it allowed American government authorities to gain routine access to Europeans  online information  Such access infringes on Europeans  rights to privacy  The ruling follows revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about the Prism program that allowed U S  authorities to harvest private information directly from big tech companies such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  
Yesterday we reported that 11 countries had reached agreement on the Trans Pacific Partnership  a trade pact that would cut trade barriers on a bloc that includes 40  of world economic output  and that it was pretty much a done deal  Well  not exactly  The negotiations were wrapped up over the weekend  the actual deal  whatever it is  must still be ratified by the leaders of each country and ratified by their legislatures  where support for the deal is not universal 
In the US  expect a tough fight to push it through Congress next year  And even though negotiators came to some sort of agreement  they have not presented the text of the agreement to the public  and negotiators say it will take at least a month to prepare the text  So  it really isn t a done deal  in large part because almost nobody knows what the deal is 
Corelogic reports home prices rose 1 2  in August to extend the 12 month gain to 6 9   CoreLogic forecasts home price growth to slow to 4 3  in the 12 months through Aug  2016  due to higher mortgage rates and more housing starts  Arizona is still suffering from the housing downturn  home prices are down 25 3  from the peak to current levels 
SABMiller  LONDON SAB  has rejected an informal takeover bid from Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   stating the offer was too low  An initial proposal made last week was worth slightly over 40 pounds a share  but the British firm s executives and some shareholders regard a deal closer to 45 pounds as fair value  At the higher price  a deal would value SABMiller  110 billion  and would result in the largest merger this year 
Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS  has agreed to buy PMC Sierra  NASDAQ PMCS  for  2 billion in cash  PMC shareholders will get  10 50 per share  representing a 37  premium to the stock s closing price on Monday  Semiconductor deal making has already reached more than  80 billion in 2015  surpassing every full year on record except 2000  when M A in the sector hit  115 billion 
Microsoft s held a big event in New York City to showcase their devices that run across the tech giant s new  flagship operating system  Windows 10  What s on tap  Two new versions of Lumia smartphones  a fitness band  an updated Surface Pro tablet to do battle with the Macbook Pro  and more details regarding HoloLens   an augmented reality headset  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  also announced its first retail store in New York  scheduled to open in about 3 weeks 
Microsoft has less than 3  of the smartphone market  but their Windows 10 operating system is on over 100 million devices  So  the challenge is to get their operating system on mobile devices before mobile operating systems take over the desktop and laptop world  The trick is to make systems and apps that flow seamlessly from mobile to desktop  and whoever wins that battle will control operating systems for the near future 
The value of BP s  NYSE BP  settlement with the U S  government and five Gulf states over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has been confirmed at  20 8 billion  a  2 billion increase from an agreement reached this past July  The agreement is  the largest settlement with a single entity in American history   U S  Attorney General Loretta Lynch declared  The deal takes BP s total budget for the spill to more than  54 billion but resolves all federal and state claims against the company for the accident 
Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  is considering spinning off its oil and gas business and other strategic alternative to focus on its copper mining business  The Phoenix based company produces oil and natural gas around the country  Energy companies have been hurt by falling oil prices and weaker demand  Many have cut spending as a result  Earlier this year  Freeport McMoRan slashed its quarterly dividend 84 percent because of falling oil prices  And in August  Freeport McMoRan announced a cost cutting plan due to falling copper prices and soft economic conditions 
Alcoa  NYSE AA  will unofficially kick off the earnings reporting season on Thursday 
We are already seeing some earnings numbers  PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  reported a better than expected quarterly profit as its commodity costs fell and demand for its snacks and non carbonated beverages rose in North America 
Yum Brands  NYSE YUM  missed Wall Street s earnings and revenue estimates  Same store sales in China  where it generates more than half of its operating profit  rose just 2 percent  The parent company for KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell dropped 18  in after hours trade  The biggest embarrassment for Yum Brands may be this nugget   Year to date through October 5  2015  we repurchased 4 5 million shares totaling  370 million at an average price of  82   When you consider the response today  that means they paid a 20  premium because they were too stupid to spend the money on building their business 
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  is now serving breakfast all day  It only took 43 years  In 1972  a franchisee in California introduced Ray Kroc to a breakfast sandwich with Canadian bacon  egg  and cheese on an English muffin  The wife of a McDonald s executive came up with the name  Egg McMuffin  The all day breakfast menu is still a bit limited  you can t get all breakfast items all day  and there are some quirks  you can t get Egg McMuffins in the South   they sell biscuits down there  The whole idea is still a bit of a gamble because the breakfast menu has lower profit margins than the regular burger centric menu 
The World Bank reports the number of people living in extreme poverty is likely to fall for the first time below 10  of the world s population in 2015  World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said   This is the best story in the world today  These projections show us that we are the first generation in human history that can end extreme poverty  
Extreme poverty has long been defined as living on or below  1 25 a day  but the World Bank s adjustment now sets the poverty line at  1 90 a day  The Bank said the change reflects new data on differences in the cost of living across countries  while preserving the real purchasing power of the previous yardstick  Using the new benchmark  the World Bank projects 702 million people or 9 6  of the world s population will be living in extreme poverty in 2015  down from 902 million people or 12 8  of the global population in 2012 
The World Bank first introduced a global poverty line in 1990  setting it at  1 a day  It was adjusted last in 2008  when the group raised it to  1 25 a day  Basically that  1 90 today buys about the same as  1 00 in 1990  Across the planet  the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half since 1990  when 1 9 billion people lived in extreme poverty ",2015-10-07,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-best-story-267364,267364
17448,238963,FCX,4 Stocks To Watch  COP  DY  STO  TASR,opinion,"I thought the market had an excellent day on Wednesday  Considering the sharp pullback in the morning  the market came back nicely  and closed at the intraday  afternoon rally highs going away  It was a very decent close  That s three out of four excellent days in a row that it was up  Technicals were great  A lot of stocks seem to be breaking out of their declining topsline and moving averages  and things of that nature  Let s take a look at some of them 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  is an excellent large cap oil stock  with a very strong surge now seven days in a row  It was up another 13 cents to 55 77  on 13 7 million shares  At this point  it looks like it could pull back  settle in here  and consolidate  which I would love to see because this is set up for a swing trade  Targets are 60  and then 64 
Dycom Industries Inc   NYSE DY  is looking very good  up 3 80 to 77 79  or 5   on nearly a million shares  This stock has very strong relative strength  probably 99  It s holding as well as it can  The recent market pullback did give it a little dip to the 50 day moving average  but it went right back up to resistance  The target is 95 going forward  It would make a good swing trade if there s follow through on Thursday 
Statoil ASA  NYSE STO  had a very good day on Wednesday  up 62 cents to 17 37  or 3 7   on 5 1 million shares  This stock has gone from 13 00 all the way up to Wednesday s high at 17 60  running up seven days in a row  with gaps every day  There s some resistance  I would love to see a pullback  The moving averages are turning over  rolling over  crossing over  and the declining topsline has been taken out with a thrust  Any pullback here may be a buying opportunity  in my opinion  Target is 19 1 2 3 4  and maybe as high as 21 1 2 3 4

17489,239004,FCX, 8 Trillion Alternative Energy Boom A Win for Copper,opinion,Here s a bit of energizing news  In 2014  for the first time in four decades  the global economy grew along with energy demand without an increase in global carbon emissions  That s according to energy policy group REN21 s just released Renewables 2015 Global Status Report  which attributes this stabilization to  increased penetration of renewable energy and to improvements in energy efficiency   What this means is that as the world s population continues to grow  and as more people in developing and emerging countries gain access to electricity  the role alternative energy sources such as wind  solar and geothermal play should skyrocket  Between now and 2040  a massive  8 trillion will be spent globally on renewables  about two thirds of all energy spending  according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance  Solar power alone is expected to draw  3 7 trillion  This is good news indeed for copper  which is necessary for the conduction of electricity in all energy technologies  whether they be traditional or alternative  The use of some carbon emitting fossil fuels coal  for instance will likely drop off over the years  but copper will remain an irreplaceable component in our ever expanding energy needs  Global copper consumption is poised to increase not just because electricity demand is growing  New energy technologies typically require more of the red metal than traditional sources  Each megawatt of wind power capacity  for instance  uses an average of 3 6 tonnes of copper  Electric trolleys  buses and subway cars use about 2 300 pounds of copper apiece  Where we ll see the most significant growth  though  is in the production of hybrid and electric cars  which use two to three times more copper than internal combustion engines  Leading the way in electric vehicle technologies  of course  is billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk s Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA   whose  5 billion Gigafactory is currently under construction in Reno  Nevada  When production begins on its lithium ion batteries  it will consume biblical amounts of base metals and other raw materials so much  in fact  that some analysts question whether world supply can meet demand  Besides needing a constant stream of lithium and nickel  the factory will consume a staggering 17 million tonnes of copper  7 000 tonnes of cobalt  today  worldwide supply is 110 000 tonnes   25 000 tonnes of lithium  about a fifth of worldwide supply   and 126 000 tonnes of raw graphite  a little over a third of global supply   To keep up with such demand  nine new graphite mines will reportedly need to be opened  This should come as welcome news for industry leading base metals mining companies Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Lundin Mining Corporation  OTC LUNMF  and Glencore  LONDON GLEN  PLC  OTC GLCNF  Airlines Stocks Could Climb as High as 50 PercentAutomobiles aren t the only types of transportation that are looking to renewables  The world s first circumnavigation of the globe by an aircraft powered entirely by the sun is in its third month  The wings of Solar Impulse 2  whose span comes slightly under that of an Airbus A380  is covered by over 11 600 photovoltaic cells  Next year  Alaska Airlines  NYSE ALK  plans to demonstrate a flight using only renewable jet fuel made from forest residues  As for the entire airline industry  a recent  announces that within 12 months  shares of the nation s top four carriers could rise as much as 50 percent  Among the changes that  have left the industry in the best financial shape in decades   according to Barron s  are  consolidation  cost cuts and fee hikes   not to mention cheaper fuel  Manufacturing in China Declining  but Eurozone Could Pick Up the Slack To be sure  copper and other base metals face some strong headwinds right now  not least of which is the strong US dollar  As you can see  the red metal and the greenback have an inverse relationship  The Thomson Reuters GFMS Survey estimates that the incentive price for new copper production is  3 50 per pound  a level unseen since March 2013  Although global copper mine production increased around 1 5 percent year over year in the first quarter of 2015  we might see a copper supply deficit in the next 10 years  Many base metals  copper especially  rely heavily on orders from China  the top purchaser of the red metal  The world s second biggest economy accounts for 40 percent of all copper consumption  but this figure might be threatened the longer its manufacturing sector remains at lukewarm levels  Although the preliminary purchasing manager s index  PMI  reading rose slightly in June to 49 6  it s still below the important expansion threshold of 50  About 60 percent of the copper China purchases goes toward the property sector  an area that s finally starting to show signs of life after almost a year of falling prices  A bright spot for copper demand  however  is the eurozone  whose own flash PMI hit a 49 month high of 54 1  The expansion was led by Germany and France  which saw output rising at its sharpest rate since August 2011  Copper Keeping It Cool for Billions Around the World In the coming years  more and more people all over the globe will gain access to electricity  a growing percentage of which we will derive from renewable sources  In an interview with  my friend Gianni Kovacevic whose 2014 book   is an indispensable and entertaining resource on this topic reminds us that by 2035  nearly two billion people will have an electricity bill for the first time  Think about the impact that will have on all of our resources  Many of these people live close to the equator  When they begin to have more wealth  they live in more comfort  One of the first things they acquire is an air conditioning unit  or a refrigerator as they eat a protein based diet  However  whether it s a need or a want  the backbone of their future consumption footprint is energy  and  more specifically  electricity  And along for the ride  whether in fossil fuel power plants or wind turbines  will be copper  Disclosure  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries  the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries  The Purchasing Manager s Index is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector  The PMI index is based on five major indicators  new orders  inventory levels  production  supplier deliveries and the employment environment The HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI is published a week ahead of the final HSBC China PMI every month  It analyzes 85 90 percent of the responses to the Final PMI from purchasing executives in more than 400 small  medium and large manufacturers  both state owned and private enterprises  The Markit Flash Eurozone PMI is typically based on approximately 85  90  of total PMI

17490,239005,FCX,Commodity Company Returns  Stick With Pure Play ETFs,opinion,"In 2014 I managed to avoid the Energy sector for clients almost entirely  by owning no Energy  crude oil or natural gas  companies and selling Halliburton  NYSE HAL  near  70 during the summer of 2014 
Unfortunately  like a golfer that eagles one hole  and then takes a 9 on a par 3  our Basic Materials holdings for clients coming into and out of the summer of 2014 were 
a   Alcoa  NYSE AA   aluminum 
b   US Steel  NYSE X  steel 
c   Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   Copper and Energy 
d   Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU   for the granddaddy of all disasters  coal 
 is what piqued my interest in the group and kept me long the names for so long 

Although I haven t owned gold for clients since late 2011  Commodities and Gold have been at the bottom of the  asset class return  table for three years running  i e  2012  through 2014  and managed to move up one slot through the first 6 months of 2015 Today  gold is getting killed again 
When I think of the  reversion to the mean  trade currently  the old saying  timing is everything  still matters too 
1   The dollar is stronger once again over the past few weeks  breaking the downtrend line in place since mid March  15  which is a negative for gold and commodities 
2   China is a mess both insofar as producing a LOT of its commodities and given the supposed slower growth  which means they re likely consuming less too 
3   I ve always felt that the commodity complex and the emerging markets  given their commodity based economies  seemed to be closely correlated  and right now the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  looks ready to roll over again and trade down to  35 
We were long some of the base metals companies for clients  waiting for a  return to global growth  theme  and the trade didn t work 
Looking at the past 35 years  from 1980 through 2015  the only time these stocks worked for a decent period of time was during the early 2000s through 2007  when China was growing 15  per year 
US Steel traded up to  180 by mid 2008 and promptly came right back down 
Peabody Energy traded up to  82 and is now  1 50 per share 
Freeport Copper traded as high as  62 in mid 2008 
Basic Materials  of which Chemicals is the largest weighting at 70    75  of the sector  is just 3  of the S P 500 by market cap and earnings weight  so these base metals companies are a pretty small component of the overall index 
Next time  I do think we will eliminate the operating risk of commodity companies  and stick with pure play commodity ETFs  like we did with SPDR Gold Shares Fund  ARCA GLD   In the early 2000s  when gold bottomed right when the tech and growth stock bubble peaked  the only way investors could get exposure to gold was to buy Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  or other gold miners  When the GLD ETF was launched in late 2005  it was a much better way  in my opinion  to play gold than the operating companies 
If readers have a favorite commodity ETF that you think is worth mentioning  please note it in the comments and I ll give it a look 
Given the asset class returns table  above and in the link provided    relative  investors can t ignore the commodity complex ",2015-07-21,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodity-returns:-so-much-for-the-“reversion-to-the-mean”-trade-258913,258913
17491,239006,FCX,Ignore Commodity Message At Your Peril,opinion,"TheThompson Reuters Jefferies CRB Index CRB is back down to the panic lows of early 2009  For those who think the CRB Index says nothing about global growth invest accordingly at your own peril 

If you believe this commodity crunch is all about some temporary oil supply glut  think again  There are 19 commodities that make up the CRB Index  Aluminum  Cocoa  Coffee  Copper  Corn  Cotton  Crude Oil  Gold  Heating Oil  Lean Hogs  Live Cattle  Natural Gas  Nickel  Orange Juice  Silver  Soybeans  Sugar  Unleaded Gas and Wheat  The value of the weighted average of these commodities is screaming one thing loudly  the rate of global growth is plummeting just as it was at the height of the Great Recession 
This is mainly because the synthetic economy of China  which once sucked up the natural resources of the globe in order to create the world s greatest fixed asset bubble in history  is now in free fall  And it is driving down the price of commodities as global growth grinds to a halt 
For those who think the U S  and the rest of the world will be somehow immune to a China slowdown should note that foreign sales accounts for about one third of aggregate revenue for the S P 500  For years China had been a huge growth market for multi national companies  However  its recent rut is affecting both domestic and international companies around the globe that once provided China with natural resources during its empty city building bonanza 
These companies and countries who benefitted from China s success are now reeling from its collapse  For example  U S  multinationals such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM   Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  have been negatively affected by the slowdown in China  just to name a few  And then we have Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   whose stock is down 14  in the past few weeks because investors are now realizing Chinese consumers are not going to buy the volume of iWatches that have been predicted 
Strong demand from China had also been a boom to the Eurozone  Germany s auto industry  France and Italy s luxury goods  Dutch and Finnish chemicals  were all beneficiaries from China s huge growth  In fact  around 8  of Germany s exports go directly to China 
Sweden s Volvo  OTC VOLVY  is also reducing growth expectations in the region and issued a warning to investors that it would have to take a 650 million Swedish Crown   75 million  charge for expected credit losses 
Expanding credit risks are now prompting some Western banks to rethink their exposure to China  Swiss based UBS Group AG  NYSE UBS  has stopped lending money to onshore clients in the communist nation 
But perhaps we see the largest effect of China in the Asia Pacific region  China s three major trading partners Taiwan  Korea and Malaysia have seen a significant slowdown  For instance  Taiwan Q2 GDP growth of just 0 64  was the weakest in the past three years 
Australia is known as  China s quarry  and had enjoyed a decade long boom selling iron ore  BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  and Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  have spent billions of dollars to double iron ore production over the past five years to meet China s insatiable demand  But now the good times appear to be over  Australia s July PMI dropped to a 5 month low of 50  While the Markit PMI plunged to 47 8  which was the worst in two years 
And to prove that China s slowdown spans the entire globe we can also evidence South America  Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world  producing steel  cement  petroleum  lubricants  propane gas and a wide range of petrochemicals  Brazil was also a huge beneficiary of the Chinese real estate bubble 
But their government recently lowered the country s growth output from a small gain to a contraction of 1 5   Standard   Poor s has downgraded Brazil s debt outlook to  negative  from  stable  a signal they are preparing to drop its credit rating  which now sits just one notch above junk  Brazil s currency  the real  is the weakest in 12 years against the dollar and the stock market is at a 6 year low 
And this slowdown in South America is also being felt worldwide  Agribusiness multi national Bunge  NYSE BG  said its edible oil business was lower due to lower margins and volumes in Brazil  Owens Illinois  NYSE OI   one of the world s biggest makers of glass bottles  reported a drop in volume stemming from a sharp drop in beer sales in Brazil  Goodyear Tire  NASDAQ GT  reported that sales in Latin America were down 20  compared to last year  Industrial gas manufacturer Praxair  NYSE PX  also suffered a sales decline year over year due to weaker industrial activity in Brazil and China  Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   which gets 16  of its revenues from Brazil  said sales were down 22 percent year over year  And finally  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  is getting crushed from the commodities rout and reported sales in Latin America were down 26  
Given the huge global economic risk China and all its related trading partners present you would imagine the Fed would have this looming global recession firmly on their radar  Yet  just recently Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said he feels confident the economy is ready for a rate hike  After all  when has the Fed ever gotten any economic prediction wrong 
It s important to understand that in its history  the Fed has never undergone a  one and done  rate hiking campaign  In fact  the current median dot plot from the FOMC assumes a 1 5  Fed funds rate at the end of 2016  Therefore  after the first rate hike takes place  it would be natural to assume the Fed will hold true to its avowed trajectory  unless and until the U S  economy falls into a recession 
However  with the U S  economy barely growing at 1 5  for the first half of 2015  it won t take much more of a slowdown to bring growth into negative territory  Nevertheless  the Fed s intentions are to slowly begin hike rates in September  But central bankers don t realize the dystopias they have created   200 trillion worth of debt disabled and asset bubble ridden economies that have become totally addicted to money printing in order to avoid a deflationary collapse  Once the artificial support is removed these bubbles begin to crater  Therefore  it shouldn t take long before the Fed inverts the yield curve and money supply growth gets chocked off  When that happens the economy will be in the middle of another 2008 variety collapse 
What is clear is that the CRB index is foreboding a clear message of the danger that lies ahead  Still  U S  stock values are near record nominal highs and are outlandishly valued in relation to GDP  For those who claim that we are an island economy and don t care if the rest of the world falls apart  I d like to know what will happen to U S  multi national companies  earnings as global trade evaporates and the Fed sends the U S  dollar even higher 
According to FactSet  Q2 S P 500 revenue growth is already at a negative 3 3  and earnings declined by 1 3   Into this malaise we will have to add cascading global growth and a Fed that seems committed to commencing an interest rate hiking cycle  With the U S  averages at such lofty levels it seems prudent to heed the warning declared by cratering commodity prices  If you doubt that conclusion just recall how wise it was not to ignore the same commodity message broadcast to investors beginning in the summer of 2008

Since mid July  the Dow Industrial Average has dropped from a high of 18 137  including a 5 session losing streak  in late July  the Dow dropped below its 200 day moving average  indicating a downtrend  it bounced up to touch the 200 day moving average  but could not break through  after that  we started August with a 6 session losing streak  Yesterday  the Dow bounced 241 points  and that is looking like a dead cat bounce today 
China s central bank devalued the yuan in an effort to help jump start its stalling economy  The central bank cut its daily reference rate by 1 9 percent  triggering the yuan s biggest one day drop since China ended a dual currency system  For background  the yuan s peg to the dollar had been in place since 2006  The People s Bank of China  their central bank  would buy or sell yuan to keep the currency near a certain value against the dollar  The dollar s been strong since 2011  And so  the peg made the yuan strong too 
The People s Bank of China called the change a one time adjustment and said its fixing will become more aligned with supply and demand  Outside China  it smells of a currency war  The PBOC said a strong yuan puts pressure on exports and cited a high effective exchange rate as a factor behind the devaluation  July s export slump was deeper than economists predicted  This devaluation is a form of economic stimulus that promotes Chinese exports and makes imports from abroad more expensive  However  the risk is that depreciation triggers capital flight  dealing a blow to the stability of China s financial system 
In trade weighted terms  the yuan has been strengthening lately  The rising dollar has pulled it higher against the yen  euro and other currencies  Tempting as it may be for politicians to deplore the opening of fresh economic hostilities  this is a long way short of currency war  The decision is expected to add further momentum to the strong dollar  which has already been boosted this year on prospects for higher US interest rates  This could have a deflationary effect in the US  The dollar s strength against major global currencies has taken a toll on US exports in recent quarters  and the Fed is closely watching the effects on the economy as it debates whether to raise interest rates  a move that could make the dollar even stronger 
Any macro benefits must be weighed against costs  These mainly fall on China s domestic companies  the devaluation hits Chinese airlines  which carry a large debt load  which will now be harder to service  this will also likely hit European luxury goods  China is the EU s largest trading partner  and banks in China and the rest of Asia  that have dollar denominated debt and face the prospect of paying them back with a weakening yuan or rand  kiwi  Aussie dollar or won 
And don t forget the  9 trillion in emerging market dollar denominated debt  It s a ticking time bomb  Today  the selloff took the MSCI Emerging Markets Index s decline from a peak last September to 20 percent  the threshold for a bear market  And Moody s Investors Service lowered Brazil s rating to the cusp of junk in the second downgrade since President Dilma Rousseff came to office  Brazil s grade was cut by one notch to Baa3  with a stable outlook  Brazil is rated BBB  by S P  And as this strong dollar dynamic continues  you can expect more debt defaults from foreign corporations  Dollar denominated commodities are down amid speculation the weaker currency will make imports to China more expensive and slow demand 
OPEC pumped the most crude last month in more than three years as Iran returned output to the highest level since international sanctions were strengthened in 2012  The 12 member group  responsible for 40  of world oil supplies  raised output in July by 100 700 barrels a day to 31 5M  The increase came even as Saudi Arabia  which often curbs output toward the end of the summer  told OPEC it cut production by the most in almost a year 
Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  has announced a major corporate restructuring  Google will become a subsidiary of a new holding company called Alphabet  Google co founder Larry Page will serve as Alphabet s CEO  with fellow Google co founder Sergey Brin as president  Google s current vice president of products Sundar Pichai is taking over as CEO of Google  Google said it would split into two reporting companies under the new holding company  Page said he s restructuring Google so that all units outside its main Web businesses like search  advertising  YouTube and mobile software will be broken off and run independently  All those ventures will now come under the new Alphabet 
The restructuring should allow for greater transparency  but beyond that   why change  And the reason might be that Google wants to be like Warren  or at least like Warren Buffett s holding company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Page and Brin are big Buffett fans  A hallmark of Buffett s approach has been to let management teams run their units independently  Under Page s structure for the newly created Alphabet  Pichai takes over as CEO of Google  former Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  executive Tony Fadell leads Nest  and former Genentech CEO Art Levinson is leading Calico  The new structure allows Page to offload some of the day to day operational responsibilities of running the company  while remaining in charge of overseeing the allocation of resources to the different businesses  just like Buffett runs Berkshire 
Under the new structure  Alphabet will still get almost all its revenue and profit from Google  The company has been using the cash from the business to fund its other investments  Unlike Berkshire  which typically buys well established companies with steady cash flow  Page must manage a conglomerate tasked with creating new technology products 
Greece and its international lenders have clinched a bailout agreement after night long talks in Athens  although a couple of minor issues still have to be resolved  The pact is expected to be worth up to  86 billion euro  Greek officials anticipate the accord to be ratified by parliament on Wednesday or Thursday and vetted by Eurozone finance ministers on Friday  clearing the way to aid disbursements by Aug  20   the day a  3 2 billion euro debt payment falls due to the ECB 
Productivity in the second quarter of 2015 rose 1 3  after two straight negative quarters  But it is only up an anemic 0 3  from a year earlier  The Labor Department also said the average annual rate of productivity growth from 2007 to 2014 was revised down to 1 3  per year from the prior estimate of 1 4   This is well below the long term rate of 2 2  per year from 1947 to 2014  Productivity measures how much an employee produces in an hour of work  Higher productivity is regarded as the key to a rising standard of living over time because it tends to lead to higher pay for workers and larger profits for companies 
The National Association of Realtors reports the median existing single family home price rose 8 2  in the second quarter  compared to the second quarter of 2014 to  229 400 
Wholesale inventories jumped a seasonally adjusted 0 9  in June  though May levels were revised lower by 0 2  to show a 0 6  gain  The gain in inventories during June was led by motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and supplies  and offset by a fall in computer and computer peripheral equipment and software

You ve heard the phrase   Necessity is the mother of invention   We know that California and the Southwest is suffering through a drought  We know that much of the water in the Southwest is stored in reservoirs and we lose an enormous amount of water to evaporation  Enter Sydney Chase  president of a startup company called XavierC  The company thinks they have a solution and it is called a shade ball  A shade ball is a 4 inch hollow orb made of polyethylene  it has just a little water inside to serve as ballast  so it won t blow away in a strong wind  but it is sealed airtight and it is designed to float on the surface of a reservoir
Los Angeles has just released 96 million shade balls into local reservoirs  where they will effectively serve as a cover to reduce evaporation  also blocking sunlight to reduce algae growth and hazardous reactions with the chlorine and bromide in the water  The shade balls can also be used on tailing ponds where miners store contaminated water  to keep birds away from toxic agents  and in waste water treatment facilities  to keep odors at bay 
Do shade balls work  It s probably too soon to say for sure  but there are now 96 million of them floating in LA reservoirs  and if they do work  there might be shade balls coming to a waterway near you ",2015-08-13,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dead-cats-and-shade-balls-261491,261491
17493,239008,FCX, It s A Risk Adverse World Out There,opinion,"Investors have been pulling back on the risk handle for some time now and shedding areas of their portfolio that may be susceptible to heightened volatility  Virtually anything connected to the energy or materials sectors has been torched this year  That extends to emerging market countries and high yield bonds  which have also felt the effects of the commodity crash 
One of the more creative ways to view this trend is to look at the disconnect between high beta stocks and low volatility names  The PPowershares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB  and Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  are two excellent indexes for this task 
These two ETFs invest in a basket of 100 stocks within the S P 500 universe that are showing the highest and lowest sensitivity to the benchmark over the last 12 months  Each stock within the portfolio is given an equal share  1   of the asset allocation and the underlying holdings are evaluated and rebalanced on a quarterly basis 
As you can see on the chart below  the divergence between the two has really accelerated over the last three months  SPLV is now trading within close proximity to all time highs  while SPHB is quite near its 2015 lows 

The interesting thing about the high beta index is that it contains some very big winners this year  Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  are both in the top 10 holdings of this fund and continue to show relative strength  Nevertheless  over one third of the portfolio is made up of energy and industrial companies that have seen their share prices crater  Two of the worst have been Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  and Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK  
By contrast  the low volatility sectors in SPLV are primarily geared towards financial and consumer staples names  Many of these stocks have either moved sideways in a plodding fashion or continued to buck the overall market malaise by heading higher  This has created a wide chasm between the so called  safe stocks  and  aggressive stocks  
On a year to date basis  SPHB is down  7 50  versus a 2 90  gain in SPLV  For comparison purposes  the benchmark SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is up just 2 00  so far this year 
While it s easy to dismiss this divergence as simply a difference in index construction  I believe it also represents an excellent example of   High beta stocks are known to experience very rapid rallies during favorable market environments  but that also translates into quick breakdowns when the tide turns  Much of this fundamental risk versus reward has been forgotten or dismissed over the last several years as stocks march higher with very little in the way of volatility or fear 
Earlier in the year  I  in my Strategic Income portfolio to the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility  NYSE USMV   This fund takes a similar tact as SPLV by selecting a subset of stocks with lower overall price fluctuations than the broader market  These indexes are designed for more conservative investors that still want to participate in the upside of the market with less downside risk 

One drawback to owning this fund in an income portfolio is that I am sacrificing some short term yield by not owning a strict dividend focused index  In addition  I could potentially miss out on a big rally in high yield or beaten down stocks  Yet based on the current market environment  I feel that this strategy is prudent to lower the beta of the portfolio and focus on total return 
The Bottom Line
In a true bear market or crisis situation  there is no such thing as a  safe stock   Even low volatility indexes are going to experience sizeable declines as risk aversion sets in  However  that same risk is also rewarded during periods of cyclical strength in equities  By being proactive with your asset allocation and security selection  you can  and take advantage of new opportunities when they fit your criteria

17494,239009,FCX,Crude Continues Crash  Implications Spreading,opinion,"As warned  crude oil prices continue to falter and briefly broke  40 per barrel on Friday  Prices have weakened as the outlook for a global slowdown continues to spread  Despite evidence of weak demand and increasing rig counts  E Ps are still pumping near all time levels  which is not beneficial for higher prices 
The price action in commodities over the last year have been nothing short of a bloodbath as insidious speculation unwinds  This is having profound impact and spreading through other markets  Commodity based companies are watching their odds of debt default skyrocket due to this great unwinding of commodity prices  Credit spreads from Asia s largest commodity trader  Noble Group  OTC NOBGY   are widening to 2009 highs  Glencore  LONDON GLEN   sensitive to prices in base and precious metals  as well as crude  is seeing credit risk explode higher 
Commodity based stocks have been monkey hammered lower  For instance  copper and gold producer Freeport McMoran s  NYSE FCX  common shares were sitting at  36 a year ago  and as of Friday s close traded under  10 
Even if one takes the energy sector as a whole  credit spreads have widened to an all time high by pushing through 1 100 bps 
In my article  The XLE Broke Significant Support on Crude Price Woes   the divergence of industry health and Wall Street s need to  buy on the dip  was evident  The energy based ETF was primarily gobbled up do to being  battered   and it serves as a dividend play 
Personally  I cannot count the number of times Wall Street  pros  have called for a bottom  while spouting the  transitory  nature of lower crude prices  Nevertheless  I pointed out that it was about to get much more battered  The price action supported the idea that it was technically broken  after breaking key support levels  On August 16  I tweeted that  either credit conditions improve or energy stocks will crash   By the end of the week  there was near capitulation in the energy space 

The collapse in oil  and other commodity prices  is wrecking havoc within commodity based economies  which is causing implications in the foreign exchange markets  Commodity based currencies have plunged anywhere from 15 to 35 percent since 2014  All are seeing severe threats to their economic growth 

Canada has probably been the worst hit out of all developed economies  Crude is the nation s leading export  and the collapse of crude prices caused the collapse of the Canadian dollar  which hit an 11 year low against the dollar 
As one can see  the Canadian dollar has been highly correlated to crude future prices 
Due to lower crude prices  the Conference Board of Canada has issued their worst growth forecast since 2009   We expect the numbers to show economic growth tracking close to zero in the second quarter  as the economy flirts with recession  But even if Canada slips into mild recession  we expect it to be small and short lived   according to the associate director of national forecast  Matthew Stewart 
Of course they expect it to be short lived  Nobody wants a recession to be indefinite  but the disconnect still remains that this is not just an isolated problem  the entire world is slowing down  Canada pumps 2 2 million barrels per day and most of their oil sands are losing money 
Everyone expects this huge rebound in oil prices  Why  For what reason  It is unfathomable that oil can remain lower for longer  but considering everything as a whole  it just may 
Western Canadian Select crude  the nation s heavy benchmark  is trading under  25 per barrel 
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  Global Research  demand factors are playing a huge role in the latest oil collapse 

Global trade has been stagnating  and with China s economy heading into the doldrums  it s about to get worse  Without demand  higher inflation  or extreme shortage  seems to be the only logical support for oil prices  Inflation forecasts are being heavily cut as five year inflation break even have hit five year lows 
Oil production  globally  has surpassed 80 million barrels per day  The point to where expectations meet reality is fast approaching  Since this is a bubble of debt expansion  Austrian Economist Ludwig von Mises said 

 There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion  The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion  or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved  ",2015-08-23,Chris Lemieux,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-continues-to-crash-with-implications-spreading-262600,262600

Commentary
The buyers finally showed up yesterday  and stood victorious at the close  T2108 rushed upward to 9 7  from 6 1    I forgot to note yesterday that T2108 just missed the intra day low of 5 9  from the historic March  2009 low    The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   ended a 6 day losing streak and FINALLY closed above its lower Bollinger  Band  BB  for the first time in 5 days  This produced a 3 9  gain on the index 
Buyers finally take the baton from the persistent sellers on the S P 500  SPY 
Surprisingly  the volatility index  the VIX  failed to close below the low of the last major upward surge  This bear bull line just happens to coincide with the intraday high from 2012 s market sell off 
The volatility index remains above the old 2012 intraday high and thus stays in the  dangerzone 
Why do I think the VIX is still in the dangerzone  Check out these stats from VIX expert Bill Luby 

So  I had to ask is the term structure of the VIX in contango  futures at a higher level than current  spot  levels  or in backwardation  futures at a lower level than current  spot  levels  

Typically  people have more fear about the future than the present because the future is unknown  The current backwardation means there is a LOT more fear about the current day than the future 
I culled Bill Luby s blog  VIX and More  for a good post on backwardation  A post from October 2012 titled  The 2012 VIX Futures Term Structure as an Outlier  includes a graph that I reprint below showing the  typical  contango pattern for the VIX  The year 2008 is the only year in the sample at that time to produce significant backwardation 

Normalized VIX Futures Term Structure from 2004 to 2012
You should read the article for more background  The bottom line is that while fear about the present is running so much higher than fear about the future  we should expect wild swings in the market as over sensitized traders and investors react and over react and respond to every signal 
Special reports like the ones CNBC runs every night  structured like an emergency response center broadcast  likely add an extra element of anxiety  The GOOD news for those with strong stomachs and good risk management  betting AGAINST the current high levels of the VIX will most likely pay off  and pay off well in these particularly extreme days   if you plan out a strategy that you can sustain over the course of weeks  or months if the current panic REALLY gets extreme  
I forgot to note  on Monday the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index  OVX  broke out  The rangebound trade I made a month ago on United States Oil  NYSE USO  is of course not working out well with volatility soaring like this  However  I am getting ready to make a fresh bet if volatility reaches the earlier highs 
My first trade was like dipping my toe in the water  The next one will be the serious bet  Stay tuned 

Volatility on USO  aka OVX  breaks out  Will it reach earlier highs 
The Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   and Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY   combination  aka AUD JPY  threw the market a bone by holding the previous day s low and making a comeback  This was a small positive  but only a renewed rise gets the market out of the dangerzone 
A break of the major low from Monday would mark a disastrous breakdown and fresh wave of bearishness  I hope to write another piece soon explaining again why I think of AUD JPY as such an important tell 

The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen holds the line for now 
I was watching AUD JPY yesterday when I was asked a question about buying ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY  on StockTwits

I was hesitant because I sold Tuesday s fortuitous grab of SVXY shares right at the open  SVXY faded from there and even traded under  50 for a spell  It SEEMED like a great moment to get back in  However  my trading rules were ringing in my head  so I left it alone and instead placed a low ball limit order close to Monday s low 
As time wore on  I am talking minutes    I noticed that the Japanese yen was continuing to weaken  I decided to speculate that the strengthening indicated buying returning to the market  in line with my trading rule on AUD JPY   so I bought a single put option on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   These options are VERY expensive right now  so I do not want to load up on them as I normally would do  As a reminder  I prefer to speculate with options because they automatically limit my downside to a small amount 
Sure enough  the yen continued to weaken  AUD JPY rose strongly into the close  and I sold the put for a tidy gain  The buying on the market yesterday was strong enough for me to lock in a double on my ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  call options that triggered near Tuesday s close 
Going back to the standard T2108 rules  the rangebound VIX did not trigger any fresh trades  I have chosen the aggressive path  so I ll load up again on T2108 trades if the VIX breaks the high for the current cycle 
If this happens  I will try to wait for an additional 5 to 10  rise above recent highs  Less aggressive traders investors should keep waiting for the low of the last major surge to break  Again  the intraday 2012 high conveniently marks this dividing line 
For good measure  I got back into a  small  hedge using Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  put options  This move is VERY early 
However  with this oversold period now in its fourth day and T2108 still in single digits  I do not want to stay as  naked  as I have been since closing out most of my remaining short positions on Tuesday  August 25th   The relative weakness in copper miner Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE FCX  triggered my interest in CAT puts  Yesterday  FCX closed right at its historic low from late 2008   a level that was last seen in late 2002  Yikes 

Someone forgot to tell Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  about the yesterday s rally 
Buckle up and brace for more drama 
 In after hours news  Workday  NYSE WDAY  managed to disappoint and closed down about 7   That ruins one of the call options I bought during Friday s sell off into oversold conditions

17499,239014,FCX,Can Icahn Fix Freeport ,opinion,"One of the most successful investors in history  Carl Icahn  has taken a roughly 8 5  stake in copper gold mining giant Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   Shares of FCX have been battered in recent months  dropping nearly 70  since early May 

Icahn is most well known for his timely investments in fallen angels  Most notably  he recently cashed in a massive   2 billion gain from an investment he made in  NASDAQ NFLX  during 2012 when the stock was extremely out of favor

Icahn s FCX investment is definitely an eyebrow raiser and yet another sign that the mining bear market is maturing  While exact cost basis information wasn t immediately available  it seems likely that Icahn amassed most of his position in the  10  12 range  FCX shares closed Friday up 3 04  at  10 50 ",2015-08-28,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/icahn-takes-large-stake-in-freeport-–-sign-of-mature-mining-bear-263235,263235

E Commerce China Dangdang Inc  NYSE DANG   along with some of the other Chinese stocks  is doing well  It went down in a five wave decline and formed a little intra inverse head and shoulders  with a rounded bottom type pattern  The neckline was taken out on Monday  slightly  and it closed right on it  up 57 cents to 9 70  or 6 1 4   on 2 million shares  The short ratio is 2 85 to 1  If it extends here  it could run up to 11  then 12  and possibly 13 1 2  Keep an eye on this stock going forward 
Travelzoo Inc  NASDAQ TZOO   after the big pop two weeks ago  and then a week s consolidation  it popped out on Monday  up 1 07 to 13 96  or 8 3   on 800 100 shares traded  This pattern looks like it may take it into the 15 1 2 16 range  maybe even 16 1 2 short term 
Youku Tudou Inc  NYSE YOKU  had a nice move on Monday  up 1 87 to 18 90  or 11   on 9 1 million shares  It s acting well  The downtrend looks like it may have ended  Lateral resistance was taken out  Look for a move to 22 1 2 23 as the next targets

Basic Energy Services  NYSE BAS   which we ve taken a look at several times  has broken out of a base  and looks like it wants to go higher  On Tuesday  it closed at 9 35  up another 49 cents  or 5 5   on 4 6 million shares  At this point  it looks like a 12 dollar stock  That s the next target 
Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  had a coiling base  it broke out  retested the moving averages  while they turned around and moved up  and then on Tuesday  it finally broke through the 21 90 resistance level  closing at 22 68  up 86 cents  or 2   on 3 2 million shares  It may very well test 23 89 90  before it pulls back  if it pulls back  Momentum could take this to 27 00  the swing trade target

17524,239039,FCX,Mining  Commodity Stocks Show Bullish Momentum,opinion,"With the CRB index now rebasing and base commodities starting to recover  mining and mining related stocks are now also reflecting the general uptrend  with four in particular now looking increasingly bullish on the longer term timeframe 
Starting with Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  and the weekly chart  the initial stopping volume for the stock appeared initially in late January with the wide spread down candle associated with ultra high volume  and a degree of buying evidenced with the wick to the underside of the candle  The stock then continued lower to test the  16 20 level before duly building a platform of support in this region  However  the initial rally in February was weak  with the stock price rising on falling volume and narrowing price spreads  evidence the bearish sentiment had not been fully absorbed  This in turn resulted in a second phase of  mopping up  with the candle of late March then sending a clear and unequivocal signal of buying on very high volume and a narrow spread  and duly reinforced with a pivot low  The platform of support at  18 then held with last week s price action closing with a wide spread up candle on rising volume and confirming the bullish sentiment for the stock  The next resistance level now awaits at  24 and should this be breached then the stock price should continue to rise further  with a solid platform of support now in place  with the next logical target now the resistance in place at  29 50  so some way to go yet 

Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO  also reflects the broad trend for commodities  re basing in the  40 50 region over the last few months and now preparing to attack the resistance region in the  46 50 area  This is a region that has been tested twice in April  with last week s price action the most recent  before closing at  45 87 ahead of the market open today  The deep wick to the underside of the candle suggests further buying of the stock  and provided we see a close above the  47 area this week  then the stock is likely to rise further and on towards the psychological  50 price level in due course 

BHP Billiton  LONDON BLT  too is now preparing to breakout  having built a strong platform of support in the  44 per share price region  and moving firmly higher over the last three weeks to close on Friday at  51 92 on good volume  With little ahead in the way of price congestion or resistance  a run toward  56 now seems increasingly likely and provided the stock price moves firmly through the  52 50 region  then the current bullish tone should continue in the longer term 

Finally to more speculative stock and Canadian Oil Sands Ltd   COSWF  and one quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSE   Certainly a more volatile stock and one which is highly speculative  but from a technical perspective an interesting chart  Alternative energy sources have certainly hit the headlines in the last few months  with oil prices falling dramatically as the squeeze on the alternative energy providers taking its toll  but with the US increasing production  and with oil prices now rising once again the weekly chart looks interesting  with the share price having based around  6 50 and holding above the  9 90 region  With little resistance now ahead   14 looks an achievable target  and provided volumes continue to rise in line with prices  this may follow the general trend for commodities higher and yield some nice returns in due course ",2015-05-04,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mining-and-commodity-stocks-reflecting-bullish-momentum-250539,250539
17525,239040,FCX,CRB Index Now Testing Key Level,opinion,"For commodities  and in particular some of the  premier league  stars such as oil and copper  the last twelve months have seen sustained falls with prices moving ever lower on increasing momentum  This long term trend is neatly encapsulated on the weekly chart for the Jeffries CRB Commodity Index  starting before the new year and finally signalling a pause point and potential bottom within the past two months 
This journey south for the CRB saw the index fall from the high of 313 18 in June 2014 to a low of 206 81 in early March this year  before rallying to close last week at 227 95 as it now prepares to test the 230 region once again  This is a key level and one that saw a failure in early February with a consequent breakdown in the bullish rally  For any continuation of the current bullish momentum for base commodity prices in particular oil and copper this level must now be breached  This break will then provide the platform for the next leg for a further move higher 
Whilst not strictly a double bottom on this time frame  the index is certainly building a base at this level  However  should the index fail to break above the 230 region  then we may see a further phase of price congestion at this level  and as always  once we begin a phase of sideways price action  the trend will follow and it is simply a question of time and patience  This bullish momentum has also been reflected in some of the primary mining and related stocks with several such as Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Bhp Billiton  NYSE BBL  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  all now looking bullish on the longer term time frames ",2015-05-04,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crb-index-now-testing-key-level-250551,250551
17527,239042,FCX,Is ES Finally Breaking Out ,opinion,"Here we are again  Another moment of truth for the e SPM bulls  who are pushing up against a series of prior highs starting with  The High  at 2119 25  which runs through the vicinity of 2111 50 
If hurdled and sustained  the potential is there for a powerful  vertical upside continuation that rockets the e SPM quickly to 2130 2150 and  perhaps  considerably higher  which is why I am positioned long in Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ   Alibaba Group  NYSE BABA   Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  and Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   to hopefully participate in the thrust  
Then again  the majority of my intermediate term work is warning that a forthcoming breakout likely will represent the final upleg off of the Oct  2011 low 
If that proves to be true  then I m bracing for a sharp  vertical upmove that is relatively short lived  which will be followed by an equally sharp  vertical decline  and is the reason why I want to try to be protected or hedged via the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  ",2015-05-14,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-es-finally-breaking-out-251822,251822

Copper Market Commentary  The Word on the Street
Mining projects have hit the shelves for copper  and many other metals  as miners have turned to cutting costs and improving productivity of existing mines  From a fundamentals perspective  copper prices have struggled to gain any real price strength on the back of poor Chinese demand  Despite bullish sentiment from miners such as Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO   Rio recently claimed copper prices will recover faster than expected and outstrip supply within two years   it s hard to see a demand scenario overtaking supply to create a deficit needed to send copper rallying 
Copper Producers
Don t mistake the slope of the price chart for positive stock performance  With the exception of Global Brass and Copper with a 6  stock price improvement from a year ago  the other producers have turned in dismal performances   BHP Billiton  LONDON BLT  down 22  and Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  down a whopping 40  from one year ago 

The Outlook
Three month copper closed the month of May at  6 018 mt  down nearly  300 mt from last month  Copper prices have rallied since February  though have fallen during the month of May  and in the short term  may continue to do so  However  copper remains in a long term bearish market and the recent strength of the dollar could keep copper in its downtrend

Commentary
Friday s perfect pause for the S P 500  SPY has definitively given way to another breakdown of the 50 day moving average 

The S P 500 sliped under its 50DMA yet again  With T2108 closing essentially flat in a perfect stalemate for the day  I would have concluded nothing of concern from the S P 500 s latest failure to hold 50DMA support  Yesterday even featured a positive sign with the index breaking ABOVE its 50DMA at one time  However  the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  ARCA FXY    AUD JPY  delivered a fresh warning with a 200DMA breakdown during the trading day 
That warning is ringing all the louder at the time of typing as AUD JPY continued to sink quick  fast  and in a hurry  The tell tale currency pair has now broken below December s low and seems like a lock to retest October s low  I cannot imagine this retest happening without dragging the S P 500 down as well  Thus  I have definitively changed my trading call to bearish for the first time in a long time 

A very bearish breakdown for the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  The palpable cause for concern was the sudden plunge in copper prices yesterday in the early hours of Asian trading  This chart was posted on stocktwits yesterday when I was trying to find out the catalyst for the sudden plunge in the Australian dollar across all major currencies 

 Source  StockTwits post 
This augurs very poorly for trading as so many assume that so goes copper  so goes the global economy  With the on going collapse in commodities  this fresh plunge in copper is like the next shoe to drop  Indeed  during U S  trading Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX  crumbled 7 6   At first blush  I somehow thought going ex dividend had something to do with the drop  In retrospect  the plunge had to be more than a dividend payout  FCX is now back to December s low 

I think this is enough said for the prospects of trading on Wednesday  January 14th  The only caveat I can muster is that AUD JPY has already extended well below its lower Bollinger Band  so some kind of snapback should be expected  But all things considered  I have to assume such a bounce will be as temporary as the last one 
Volatility is also hanging tough  I am now on alert for a major run up and spike higher  I will be waiting for T2108 to drop at least below 30  before I consider adding to my volatility fade  I will sell my small position in ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures   ARCA SVXY  if I get another shot at a small profit before this presumed run up 

I think the odds of T2108 trading down to oversold conditions before the end of this month just shot up considerably  As usual  I will look to buy on such a turn of events  Given my assumption of on going chop in the market  I am still avoiding over reacting to any one day s movement  Instead  my bearish bias just green lights fading rallies and playing follow through from breakdowns 
I end with a chart on Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA  I last pointed out TSLA a month ago when it generated a bearish follow through to a 50 200DMA breakdown  The Santa Claus rally helped it to recover only to hit and fail at resistance that has also led to more bearish follow through  I mention this because TSLA plunged below its December low in after hours trading after Elon Musk mentioned disappointing sales in China  He later tried to clarify the situation as temporary and based on misperceptions about Tesla s charging capabilities  The market may not have anticipated such a hiccup but this was certainly a bad time to make such statements with the stock setup like a classic short  And now general market weakness will work further against a rapid recovery from the latest swoosh lower

17570,239085,FCX,Week In Review  The Great 2015 Sell Off,opinion,"Just 2 short weeks into 2015 the metals are experiencing major losses  mostly because of the continuing fall in the price of oil  Copper and steel were the biggest victims but aluminum  stainless and the other metals took a hit  too 
Copper s 5 Year Low
Copper fell from  6 100 metric ton last Friday to  5 400 mt on Wednesday  an 11  drop in only 3 trading days  Copper recovered a little yesterday  but it s still mired in a 5 year low  Why the big drop  No other commodity metals fell as quickly and precipitously as copper  and we don t hear that much about Floridian thieves accidentally electrocuting themselves stealing aluminum or hot rolled coil  Why copper 
Well  right now copper is as available as a Kardashian between husbands  There s a surplus out there and  according Morningstar  it s going to be there for some time  The low prices are dragging down the stock of miners like Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   too  and mine closures could be the next shoe to drop 
The silver lining to this cloud of copper sadness  Dr  Copper got his PhD revoked  so it means nothing for the economy as a whole or even that much for the construction market  It just means that copper is in surplus  Dr  Copper is now more like Mr  Pibb 
Back to the  80s  Not So Tubular 
Remember six months ago when oil country tubular goods  OCTG  were all the rage  U S  Steel  Vallourec  PARIS VLLP  and Timkensteel  NYSE TMST  were all setting up new facilities to make the steel tubes for oil and gas drilling  Well  that was before oil prices fell below  50 a barrel  Tubular is also a funny word that was used as a synonym for cool and rad back in the  8s and  90s  You don t know about rad  It was short for radical  Youngsters 
Having OCTG and tubular around made the MetalMiner Week In Reviewer feel young and reminded him of good times with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles before Michael Bay and Megan Fox strip mined the source material the same way they did with Transformers  They turned happy childhood memories into really big explosions 
But I digress  Anyway  OCTG is no longer the hot and cool new market sector  It s going away  U S  Steel has already shut down 2 plants  While the low price war between OPEC   particularly Saudi Arabia   and Canada is forcing oil prices lower and lower  most consumers are celebrating as gas dips below  2 a gallon  If you re a shale oil producer  though  Yeah  it s not a good time  Totally not tubular

The Markets 

Stocks jumped on Friday as investors covered negative bets ahead of the three day long weekend in the US  The S P 500 Index closed higher on the day by 1 34   still not enough to recoup the pronounced losses accumulated throughout the week The large cap benchmark ended down for the week by 1 24   Looking at the weekly chart  the S P 500 Index is testing its 20 week moving average  a level that has supported the long term trend over the past two years 
Major weekly moving averages  including the 20  50  and 200 week  continue to point higher  suggesting a long term positive trend  Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish  although negative divergences suggest upside exhaustion  A catalyst may be required to reinvigorate upside momentum  Seasonally  the market remains in this sluggish period as stocks gyrate through the fourth quarter earnings season 











Shares of energy companies led the equity market performance on Friday following a 5  rebound in the price of Oil  Investors are showing signs of nibbling away at beaten down energy names in hopes for quick gains that would potentially result from a rebound rally  The Energy Sector ETF  ARCA XLE  is hinting of a short term double bottom around  72  potentially bringing upon a pause of the longer term trend of lower highs and lower lows 
The Energy Exploration and Production ETF  NYSE XOP  and the iShares Canadian S P TSX Capped Energy Index Fund  TO XEG  are showing similar short term bottoming patterns  Positive momentum divergences on the charts of the sector ETFs suggest waning downside pressures as energy companies get set to report earnings  Halliburton and Baker Hughes will report today before the opening bell  providing further insight as to the impact of lower oil prices  Seasonally  the energy sector is entering the time frame when stocks start to trend higher  rebounding from a seasonal low that is typically realized in December January  The positive pattern for the sector concludes closer to the end of spring as energy commodities peak ahead of the start of the summer season 























While markets in the US were closed for Martin Luther King day  the Shanghai Composite recorded steep losses as regulators charged top brokers with illegal activities in margin trading  The benchmark plunged 7 7   falling below the the 20 day moving average for the first time since October 
The Shanghai Composite has charted a parabolic move higher since breaking above resistance around 2500 last November  quickly becoming significantly overbought and leaving the benchmark vulnerable to swift corrective declines  such as what occurred on Monday  The next level of variable support below the 20 day moving average can be found at the 50 day  currently at 2891  As long as the breakout above 2500 holds  a trend of higher highs and higher lows over the intermediate term can be expected  The Shanghai equity benchmark remains seasonally strong through to May  outperforming benchmarks back here in North America 











Sentiment on Friday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 91  The average true range of the ratio continues to trend higher  suggesting ongoing investor uncertainty  potentially leading to further equity market volatility

17573,239088,FCX,Potential Copper Rally  Dual Support At Hand,opinion,"Doc Copper has been under the weather the past few years  After hitting the  4 50 level back in 2011  it has proceeded to lose around 40  of its value over the past four years 
Three Interesting Situations
First  the large multi year decline now has Doc Copper testing a 12 year support channel 
Secondly   Copper now finds itself at the 50  Fibonacci support level  based up the 1999 low 2011 highs
Third Copper bulls are not easy to find  only 24  at this time  see below 

The rising channel  top chart  is formed off the lows in 2002 and 2009  As you can see above  sentiment is very near where it was at those key lows 
I shared the chart below on   which reflected that Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  looked very appealing from a Power of the Pattern perspective    FCX was hitting a cluster of support and might have been making a bullish inverse head   shoulders pattern at  1  below 

Two weeks ago  at the time of the post  FCX was trading at  19 47  As of last night s close  FCX has broken above falling channel resistance and has rallied a little over 10   Looking OK so far  from a Power of the Pattern perspective 
Full Disclosure  Premium Members are Long FCX  with a purchase price of  19 01 
Should Doc Copper hold at support start pushing higher  could it be sending a message that economic conditions are improving  It is to soon to make that call at this time  Humbly  I do feel Copper would send a concerning global message should it breakdown below these support points ",2015-02-26,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/copper-rally-potential:-dual-support-at-hand-243243,243243

17587,239102,FCX,Where Can You Start Trusting A Yield ,opinion,"If you look at a list of stocks with the highest nominal dividend yields  you ll see that many of them are arithmetic freaks 
Some stocks paid a special dividend last year and won t do so again  Others are  or are paying dividends out of capital rather than income 
It s only as you go down the dividend list that you begin to find stocks in which a sensible person would invest   and that leads us to a crucial question  Is there such a thing as a yield  cutoff  
That is  can we define a specific yield below which dividends can usually be trusted and above which they can t 
In today s low yield  inflated markets  that cutoff may be lower than you think 
In fact  it s about 6   That s a pretty low threshold  especially considering that the front runners on Nasdaq s list of the highest dividend payers all have indicated yields above 40  
Of course  while such yields look exciting  the dividends of these small firms merely represent a return of capital 
The top one  UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  MLP Ex Energy ETN     is currently paying monthly dividends of  0 90  effectively cannibalizing itself  The second  New Germany Fund  Inc  is a closed end fund paying out large capital gains  and the third  Swiss Helvetia Fund  Inc  is a Swiss closed end fund that s also paying out its large 2014 capital gains 
Now  there s nothing wrong with an investment that makes you a 40  return in a year  even if you have to pay taxes on the distribution  But in these cases  the distribution is capital gains  not income  and the outcome is highly unlikely to be repeated in years to come 
Similarly  fallen angels often have very high nominal dividend yields that aren t likely to last 
SandRidge Permian Trust  for example  is an oil and gas MLP that has fallen on hard times and has seen its share price halved since last August  Since its latest dividend was based on the fourth quarter of 2014   and reflects the high earnings from having sold oil forward at high prices   its dividend yield is currently a tidy 38   Alas  that dividend is unlikely to continue once its hedges run out 
Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust  NYSE CHKR  similarly yields 29   but it won t once the new earnings come in 
Slim Pickings for Yield
At the 12  level  you get entities like Eagle Point Cred  NYSE ECC   an investment company that buys equity and junior debt in collateralized loan obligation packages  ECC has announced that it will pay a  0 60 per quarter dividend  giving it a 12  yield on its October IPO price of  20  or about 11 5  on its current price 
As you can imagine  the problem here is that these junior tranches carry a much higher credit risk than the loans themselves  so at some point  ECC is likely to get in trouble and destroy at least part of its capital 
Another risky dividend is Resource Capital Corp  NYSE RSO   though there s still a chance you ll receive the distribution  RSO invests in commercial mortgages and pays a steady dividend of  0 20 per quarter for a yield of 17  at today s price  Its dividend is uncovered by net income  but unlike mortgage real estate investment trusts  REITs   which have huge interest rate risk  its balance sheet is only moderately vulnerable to a rise in interest rates  RSO is also trading at 63  of book value  so there s a solid backing if things go wrong  At the same time  you wouldn t want to put your retirement funds in it 
A more equivocal case is Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX FCX had bought oil assets at an excessive price two years ago  but was gallantly paying out  1 25 per annum to give a yield of 6 8  on its current price of around  19 
Alas  last week  FCX cut its annual dividend to  0 20  The overall business continued to be profitable  but even a dividend yield of less than 7  proved unreliable   The shares  on the other hand  have not dropped much further and may be a reasonable investment at these levels  depending on what precious metals and copper prices do  
Perhaps the best combination of safety and yield I ve seen recently is a  I mentioned a few weeks ago  TAL International Group Inc  NYSE TAL   TAL is a container leasing company that yields 7 1   with its dividend well covered by earnings  It s an unglamorous  no growth business with a generous management   the sweet spot for attractive dividend yields 
Yet even at just over 7   such opportunities are few and far between  Early in this bull market  in 2009 to 2010  you could find plenty of yields in the 10  to 12  range that had a good chance of being sustained   but that s no longer the case  Stock prices have risen too high  and income investors have combed through the listings

17601,239116,FCX,Guacamole Dilemma   Dip Buyers Must Be Aware Of Too Much Dip,opinion,"So  when the markets drop 2 3   which we have seen can happen within a week s time   then is it right to buy that dip   If you look at the chart below dating back a year the answer is a resounding YES  But we are talking about drops corrections in price and not time  What makes many uncomfortable are the sharp drops in a few days that used to take a few weeks to occur  We could blame that increase of speed on any ol  reason   algorithmic traders  high frequency trading  hedgers  etfs  or just a more informed and reactionary investor trader  Gone are the days of buy and hold  which often turns into hope and pray mode   
Whatever the reason  we should look for patterns and trends that play out regularly  find confidence and go with the flow  That gets us back to the dip question and how should we interpret what is a sufficient drop and whether it is appropriate to step in  I have found over the past year plus these dips tend to be accompanied by very sharp changes in sentiment  We ll see a VIX spike as we had on July 17 and reversal   one of many that has occurred since 2012  The McClellan Oscillator will show an extreme reading  with the NASDAQ and NYSE oscillators ticking down under  100  very oversold   Put calls often zoom past 1 in these instances and the the polls show fewer bulls  traders getting more fearful  such as the AAII and II have lately   When these all line up congruently I have found the best odds are buying that dip But each dip could be the last one  faking everyone out   right   Sure  but is that likely with so much liquidity in this market  low interest rates and strong corporate profits   not to mention a very dovish Fed that will continue to provide accomodation   I side with recent history Money moves very FAST in this market and if you re not positioned right you can be trampled  Discipline trumps conviction in most cases and we must be willing to take profits and losses and move on  As option traders  we do not have the luxury of time if we are buyers  With low volatility in this market it means options are priced cheap  a great condition if the trend continues  But market trends are not necessarily stock trends  For instance  the markets were hammered on Friday yet some stocks performed well  While we know Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was clobbered down 10   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  was up nearly 13   Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  was up 1   Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  was up  6  but Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  was down 1   My point is this   We continue to live in a non correlated market  a stockpicker s delight  The best friend of a stockpicker is usually the chart and technicals  which gets us back to the dip dilemma  Do we trust each dip to buy  or is the next dip the  sucker move   the one that takes stocks down for that massive 10 20  correction that EVERYONE expects    You can sit around and wait for that  and much like a broken clock you ll be right some day   but how much time have you wasted in waiting for it   Let the market tell you what to do  Currently  the market is consolidating recent gains  heck  from Feb 1 June 30 the SPX was up 12 7    entitled to a break    In July the SPX is up a scant amount  the Dow Industrials and Nasdaq are up solid while the Russell 2K is down an ugly 5   What s to come for August and September   I won t guess the move  but certainly buying dips has been the right play   it will continue to be  until it s not  At some point the pattern changes  and if that happens we may not have something left for our chips to dip ",2014-07-27,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/guacamole-dilemma:--dip-buyers-must-be-aware-of-too-much-dip-220713,220713
17602,239117,FCX,Consolidation Amongst Miners Picks Up As Growth Slows,opinion,"It s interesting to note that on the same day the International Monetary Fund released their annual  which lowered expectations for global growth in 2015 to 3 8  from 4   that several potentially large mining deals were either launched or mooted 
While the talk of the potential deal for a merger between Glencore  LONDON GLEN  and Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  dominated the headlines  two  relatively  smaller deals were also announced 
Anglo American  LONDON AAL  will reportedly  of up to  1 billion worth of copper assets in Chile including the Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde mines  along with AAL s 50 1 percent stakes in the El Soldado mine and Chagres smelter according to Bloomberg  These assets are small relative to others in AAL s portfolio  but a willingness to part with them says a great deal about the company s thoughts on the need to generate returns in the current macroeconomic environment 
With approximately 69 assets in the company portfolio and 31 delivering just 2  of EBITDA  it s not hard to argue that AAL has overextended itself   
EBITDA serves as a prime measure of operational performance  Therefore  one can see why AAL is intent on shrinking its asset base to improve its balance sheet   low yielding properties act as a drag on company performance  This decision to consolidate should help the company in an era of reduced returns and should be applauded 


Second  Lundin Mining  TO LUN    Freeport McMoRan s  NYSE FCX  80  ownership in the Candelaria copper mine and its Ojos del Salado operation in Chile for  1 8 billion  This deal is seemingly predicated upon FCX s desire to decrease its gigantic debt load  as high as  20 billion  down to a paltry  12 billion by 2016 
These deals are a sign of the slow and continuous change now engulfing the mining industry  It would appear that the relentless fall in most commodity prices finally has the attention of the entire industry and CEOs are intent on fixing bloated balance sheets and positioning for any positive macroeconomic momentum  I continue to maintain that the mining industry has reached a cyclical bottom  based on metals prices   but that doesn t mean returns will increase without cost controls in place 
Shown below are the prices of gold  in white   silver  in orange   iron ore  in yellow   and copper  in green  between 2010 and 2014  It would appear that prices have done a  round tripper  while costs have surely risen  Yes  it s true that these commodity prices are high on a historical basis  but most of the mining companies have demonstrated an inability to take advantage of this and produce returns which beat their benchmarks 

Takeaways
I mentioned above that the IMF released its World Economic Outlook and has downgraded growth expectations based on Japan  the Euro Zone  and most Emerging Markets slowing while the pace of growth in the United States is generally positive  but questionable as Quantitative Easing is set to end  This tightening of monetary conditions may be occurring at just the wrong time 
The good news is that the global economy is growing   just unevenly  Because of this  my preference for lowest cost producers remains with a bias towards the Energy Metals  Demand for most of these metals is growing much faster than global GDP and this offers a cushion against sluggish overall growth  although this thesis offers a higher risk profile   It would appear that there is more  blood in the streets  to come as a frothy equity market meets a slowing growth profile as we head into earnings season 
I ll be elaborating on this topic next week in Hong Kong at the  on October 15th and 16th  If you are in Hong Kong and would like to attend or would like to meet after the conference  please let me know  Hope to see you there ",2014-10-12,Chris Berry,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consolidation-amongst-miners-picks-up-as-growth-slows-228733,228733

17604,239119,FCX,6 Small Cap Miners That Freeport McMoRan Could Acquire,opinion,As a global mining giant and the world s largest publicly traded copper producer  Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE FCX  is well positioned to make an acquisition or two  especially since it was sitting on nearly  658 million in cash as of September 30  2014  and recently received  1 8 billion from an asset sale  Possibly holding Freeport back  though  is its debt level    17 5 billion at the end of the second quarter  much of that due to the  9 billion acquisitions of Plains Exploration   Production and McMoRan Exploration in 2012  At the end of last quarter  Freeport s debt to equity ratio stood at 0 82  compared with Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  at 0 65  Although the company has been recently diversifying into oil and gas  its bread and butter so to speak is still copper and  to a lesser extent  gold  molybdenum  and cobalt  It could make sense  then  to acquire a company at this stage of the resource cycle  especially if it s strategically located near Freeport s other operations  With the gold price slumping of late  copper could be set to shine  Commodities trading house and miner Glencore PLC  in fact  recently provided an optimistic outlook for the copper market  forecasting strong demand from both China and the West in the second half of 2014  The following small cap companies could be on Freeport McMoRan s radar  Rio Alto Mining  NYSE RIO   After striking a deal to buy Sulliden Gold  TSX  SUE   the hunter could be the hunted  The newly merged company operating out of Peru is expected to produce about 300 000 ounces of gold annually within the next couple of years  Rio Alto forecasts its all in sustaining costs of US 824 to  911 per ounce in 2014  and recently announced second quarter net income  15 2 million  Rio Alto expects its cash flow to continue to grow into the future  Freeport McMoRan already has its Cerro Verde copper and molybdenum mine in Peru  Trevali Mining Corporation  TO TV   Although primarily a zinc play  Trevali has poly metallic projects in Canada and a producing zinc  lead silver mine in Peru  where Freeport also has operations  Much of Trevali s upside will come from its Caribou mine and mill in New Brunswick  which is expected to begin production in 2015  Glencore  which owns about 6  about Trevali  may have something to say though if another company takes a run at it  Taseko Mines Limited  TO TKO   Taseko is the 75  owner and operator of the Gibraltar Mine  the second largest open pit copper molybdenum mine in Canada  as well as owner of the New Prosperity Project in British Columbia  one of the largest undeveloped gold copper deposits in the world  Taseko s stock price has taken a hit recently after the Canadian government rejected its development proposal for New Prosperity  saying it would damage the environment and nearby aboriginal communities  Taseko Mines  however  announced recently an all stock deal to acquire Curis Resources Ltd   TO CUV   which is developing the 2 4 billion pound reserve Florence Copper project in Arizona  The Curis deal makes Taseko more appealing to Freeport McMoRan as Freeport is headquartered in Arizona and has five operating mines in that state  in addition to two in neighbouring New Mexico   Ivanhoe Mines  \TO IVN   Ivanhoe boasts that it has the world s largest undeveloped  high grade copper deposit in its Kamoa Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC   It also has a 68  stake in the Kipushi copper zinc germanium lead mine in that country  Freeport already has a 56  interest in the Tenke Fungurume copper cobalt mine in DRC  Further upside to Ivanhoe Mines  share price could come from its 64  ownership in the Platreef platinum group elements project in South Africa  Billionaire mine developer Robert Friedland owns about 25  of Ivanhoe Mines and Ontario Teachers  Pension Plan has an 11  stake in the company  Nevada Copper Corp   TO NCU   The company is developing its advanced stage Pumpkin Hollow copper project in the mining friendly state of Nevada  Pumpkin Hollow contains 5 22 billion pounds of Proven and Probable copper in which its reserves  according to the company  are currently valued by the market at just 3 4 cents per pound  The property is also thought to contain 989 000 ounces of gold and 32 9 million ounces of silver  Nevada Copper is currently sitting on about  18 million in cash  The project has good infrastructure and is expected to begin production in 2016  It is appealing due to its proximity to Freeport s Arizona operations  Barisan Gold Corporation  TO BG   This would be a longshot but the  7 million market cap Indonesia gold projects developer would be pocket change for a company such as Freeport McMoRan  which is already mining copper and gold at its Grasberg operations in that country  According to newsletter writer Bob Moriarty  Barisan will be  the owner of a billion dollar project down the road   While other companies could have been included in this list  these six were chosen based on one or more of the following factors that include  assets in politically secure jurisdictions  reserve resource size  low production costs or estimated production costs  as well as having mines and or development projects located near existing Freeport McMoRan interests  which could result in potential

The sun sets on the oil patch
Source  Business Insider    AFP File Karen Bleier

  howardlindzon  Never seen an energy sea of red like this in Stocktwits trending    USO  oil  

A sea of red for energy related stocks


This post on StockTwits says it all for the a holiday shortened day of trading in the U S 

 it is trapped into continuing to produce oil into a declining price environment  and the results in the oil patch were dramatic  The impact was far reaching as it seems the entire commodities related complex went into a freefall on the day  So  I can excuse T2108 from backing off over bought conditions as it tumbled 4 percentage points to 63 5  despite the S P 500 barely budging to the downside 

The S P 500 does not even show a hint of the carnage extending throughout the world of commodities
The strategy I outlined for trading overbought conditions dictates sending up a definitive red flag warning of a potential top in the market  However  the tension here is that falling energy prices are also good for consumption of a whole host of other goods  Indeed  the IMF  that each  10 plunge in oil prices adds about 0 2 percentage points to global GDP growth  So  it is very possible that the stock market continues its rally but at a much slower pace as energy related stocks continue to weigh on the index 

My tune will get bearish if the S P 500 follows through with more selling next week that produces a close below 2052 or so  This would close the gap up from the surprise Chinese rate cut  It would also end the nice uptrend through the channel creates by the first and second Bollinger Bands   BB  

There was also an interesting dichotomy in the two main resource related currencies  the Canadian dollar  Rydex CurrencyShares CAD Trust  NYSE FXC   and the Australian dollar  Rydex CurrencyShares AUD Trust  NYSE FXA   

Canada delivered great GDP growth results for the previous quarter  but it was not enough to slow down the commodities train wreck 

The Canadian dollar weakens despite a strong GDP print   selling in the oil patch dominates trading
Given this move  I would expect the Australian dollar to get absolutely hammered  Quite the opposite  AUD USD actually RALLIED and ended the day with a gain despite a late pullback  Most important for trading purposes  the Australian dollar held firm against the Japanese yen  AUD JPY   This made my buy of the dip earlier in the week even more fortuitous  I thanked my lucky stars and snatched my profits 

The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen holds firm against otherwise bearish signals taking root elsewhere
Despite my hasty exit from the long AUD JPY position  I still consider this current stability a strong signal that invalidates any bearish misgivings I may otherwise harvest  I just did not want to leave these profits on the table over the weekend  Regardless  you can bet that I am watching AUD JPY even more closely now 

There is SO much I would love to write about the oil patch and the collapse in commodities in general  I hope to dribble these out over time  For one thing  it is definitely time to update and upgrade my old Commodities Crash Playbook from 2011    Preparing for Profits in a Resource Constrained World  and Profiting from Physical Assets in a Resource Constrained World   Rules and Picks    For now  I turn your attention to Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   and PowerShares DB Oil ETF  NYSE DBO 

Readers may recall my fortuitous short of XLE that was interrupted by the Halliburton Company  HAL  deal to acquire energy services competitor Baker Hughes Incorporated  BHI   As luck would have it  I could have held that short position even if it meant watching my profits melt away before hitting the real jackpot 

With only a half day of trading available  traders rushed for the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE  exits with particular speed and alacrity
This breakdown in XLE is a classic follow through of a bearish break of the 50DMA just two trading days ago  Technically  I should have been all over that move  My only defense is that I had little interest in trying to out guess the politicizing and strategizing surrounding the OPEC meeting 

Now that the cat is out of the bag   and perhaps we are witnessing the beginning of the end of OPEC as we have come to know and love   trading opportunities abound  The FIRST thing that came to my mind is that HAL may have to back down out of its deal for BHI  The collapse in its stock price back to June  2013 levels means that the deal for BHI has gotten ever more expensive  HAL is handing over 1 12 HAL shares and  19 in cash for every share of BHI  Those shares are now worth a lot less  Perhaps BHI will still be grateful for its savior and accept the same price  Perhaps this on going plunge in oil prices does not change a thing  Maybe it even makes the deal MORE attractive because of supposed cost synergies  But just in case the odds of a deal collapse just got higher  I had no problem rushing in to buy April call options on HAL against April put options on BHI  Moreover  I think the out sized beating being delivered to HAL is an expression of growing displeasure with the deal 

Traders rush for the exits from HAL in a massive display of force  An 11  loss in just one day 


BHI is on its way to losing even the rumor driven premium from the HAL deal
This trade should pay off if the deal collapses and HAL regains whatever premium it lost and BHI rushes downward to catch up to the rest of its cousins in the oil patch  It should also pay pay off if oil somehow finds a bottom and starts rallying again at some point soon  However  the gap down in DBO suggests that the latter is NOT the likely scenario 

A massive gap down for DBO as it loses 8 8  in one day
Heck  if oil completely collapses going forward  this trade could even come out at least even as HAL and BHI tumble together   Late addendum  someone on stocktwits informed me that HAL has to pay BHI a  3 5B termination fee if the deal falls through  So the bar for a collapse in this deal is VERY high  

In the meantime  we have a BUNCH of stocks in the oil patch and commodities in general that look over extended below their lower Bollinger Bands   I will not be surprised to see buyers rush in on Monday on the presumption that the low liquidity of shortened holiday trading exacerbated the downward action  This relief bounce should be very fade able as the negative feedback loop is now firmly entrenched in the oil patch 

Just so you understand that the sell off had far reaching impact in the commodities space  I conclude with charts of Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE FCX   BHP Billiton Limited  BHP   and Rio Tinto plc  RIO  

FCX has some amount of oil related assets but is mainly known for its copper mining  BHP is a very diversified miner with oil related assets  RIO is much more a pure play on iron ore  I recently bought FCX as part of a desire to start scaling into the commodity collapse while the getting is good  I started with copper because it does not have the negative fedback loops working against it like iron ore and oil  I am still VERY bearish on iron ore  and I recently re established a  hedged  bearish position in RIO  The prices in the chart for RIO show the approximate spot price of iron ore on that day  I left BHP alone because of its diversified position  I did not even think for a hot minute that a collapse in the oil patch could take BHP down so dramatically  I show weekly charts for FCX and BHP to show the seriousness of the breakdowns 

As a reminder  the QE2 and QE3 reference price marks where the given stock traded at the time the U S  Federal Reserve announced its quantitative easing programs  So much for money printing supporting and propping up asset prices in commodities 

The collapse in BHP Billiton Limited  BHP  is well underway as major multi year support gives way


Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  flirts with a major multi year breakdown


No fresh multi year low for RIO  yet  Perhaps the hopes of a Glencore savior is keeping the stock aloft 
Finally  I cannot conclude this post without showing the pounding Catepillar  NYSE CAT  took today  THIS chart gives me pause  and I am very happy to have a hedge riding on the back of CAT  If it breaks its 50DMA  look out below  Note how volume surged DESPITE the shortened trading day  Yikes 


Caterpillar reverses and invalidates the bullish breakout  Only the 50DMA sits between here and a bearish breakdown

17606,239121,FCX,Copper Points To Big S P 500 Fall,opinion,"Over the years Copper has been viewed as a leading global indicator for economic conditions and often stock market performance  The chart below takes a peek at year to date performance of Copper ETF  NYSE JJC   Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX  and the S P 500  showing weak performance in the Copper sector  with the opposite happening in the S P 500  
So far in 2014  ole Doc Copper IS NOT a very good leading indicator for the S P 500 

The top chart reflects that Copper looks to have formed a  Bearish Descending Triangle   Two thirds of the time  such patterns suggest a decline in prices will take place  with the decline  B  being the height of the pattern  A   If that happens  the pattern suggests Copper will fall at least to the  2 zone    about 30  below current prices 
In my humble opinion  the most important issue at hand is that Copper is testing long term support at  1  and support is support until broken  Line  1  is based upon the lows in 2002 and 2009  Keep in mind  these dates represent times when the S P was also at near lows 
What Copper does at  1  should have a large impact on the future prices of Copper and if it does break support  it could impact the S P 500 too 
Stay tuned  what Copper does here could have a big impact on the broad markets and portfolio construction ",2014-12-01,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/copper-points-to-big-s-p-500-fall-234289,234289

17611,239126,FCX,Why Income Investing Beats Value Investing,opinion,"When it comes to stocks  income investors are mostly interested in dividends 
Earnings and valuation don t matter much  unless they impact the sustainability of a company s dividend  For instance  an income stock that cuts its dividend is a killer to our portfolio value 
Value investors often sneer at us  claiming that dividends are irrelevant to the true long term valuation of their investments  Yet in a world of funny accounting and high P E ratios  the solid virtue of our income streams may give us the last laugh 
Funny Accounting and Spurious Profits
Value investors traditionally look for companies selling at low P E ratios and discounts to their net asset values  Unfortunately  modern derivatives techniques and accounting conventions make this approach much less useful than in days past 
This is especially true for natural resource companies  You see  technically speaking  these companies should hedge their product sales price forward  The problem is that  unless the hedges all expire each quarter  a period of declining prices could produce an immense  and spurious  profit that reflects nothing in cash and occurs even as the company s value has declined 
The oil production master limited partnership  MLP   Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE   for example  showed a huge profit in the final quarter of 1988  even though the value of its reserves had declined with the price of oil  A similar outcome is likely in the first quarter of 2015 
In reality  declining oil prices are very damaging to LINE s business   so much so that the company recently slashed its dividend payout from a forecast  2 90 per unit to just  1 25 in 2015  Of course  Wall Street Daily readers weren t surprised  as my colleague  Alan Gula  had predicted the dividend cut in his  
Finally  it s the dividend cut   not the company s quarterly earnings   that will be the best indicator of LINE s fortunes  The quarterly earnings report will likely only reflect the success of LINE s price hedging  Meanwhile  the stock has halved in the last six months  which mirrors the declining value of the company s oil reserves 
The Problem With Net Asset Values
Net asset values are an ever worse indicator of a company s true economic value 
As shareholders in Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  discovered early last year  the net asset value of a mining company is a very uncertain statistic  If market conditions are poor or  as in Barrick s case  if bureaucratic delays hold up an  8 5 billion gold mine  the accountants can arbitrarily force the company to write off billions of dollars of irreplaceable assets 
Since mineral prices fluctuate widely  mining companies will often suffer huge write offs of assets they ve only recently developed  making their net asset values artificially low  In those cases  value investors may miss companies that  on an operating basis  are highly attractive  simply because phony write offs have given them the appearance of low  or even negative  shareholder equity 
Barrick s tangible book value declined from  12 7 billion to  7 4 billion in 2013  knocking the company s leverage ratios and causing a  10 billion reported loss   yet the company continues reporting a modest profit on an operating basis  even at today s lower mineral prices 
As in the derivatives cases  silly accounting has distorted the true picture 
Rely on Sustainable Dividends
Of course  dividends can be deceptive  too   particularly companies with very high dividend yields  whose managements sometimes pay out dividends that exceed earnings 
In fact  LINE has done this for several years  though it would argue that an energy MLP has large non cash charges of depletion and depreciation that don t affect cash flow  allowing it to safely pay more than it earns  Still  this week s announcement that LINE cut its dividend and halved its exploration budget suggests that this approach is dangerous 
Even more dangerous is the possibility that the dividends are being paid out of cash flow from an asset with limited life  Unfortunately  this is a real issue for many MLPs that don t replenish their asset bases  Great Northern Iron Ore Properties  GNI   for example  has a concession in the Mesabi Iron Range that expires in June  Hence  its seemingly magnificent dividend yield  46 8   doesn t actually represent a useful opportunity 
Still  even in the beleaguered mining sector  there s a certain comfort that comes from a steady dividend  After all  a sustainable dividend signals management s long term commitment to the business 
A more attractive long term investment for income seekers is copper and gold miner  Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   FCX rewards shareholders with a  0 3125 quarterly dividend  giving the stock a current yield of 5 2   Still  there s one caveat  FCX hasn t had any big asset write offs yet  and I wouldn t be at all surprised if it had one this quarter  since it recently bought a substantial oil producer 
Thus  I d wait to buy until either the fourth quarter earnings statement or the next dividend announcement  which is due in early March 
Here s the bottom line  Dividends represent real cash  and  if they re sustainable  can provide money to live and rely on  at least for the medium term  That s a lot more useful than possibly distorted  value investment  earnings  which  when it comes down to it  may pay the company s bills but won t pay yours

17613,239128,FCX,Have Metals Finally Bottomed ,opinion,"I completely understand that you might think I am crazy for trying to call a bottom in the metals and mining sector  I probably am  Furthermore  I understand the  China slowdown  mindset very well  After all  the interesting fact has been how strong Chinese growth has been and how the country hasn t experienced one simple recession yet  similar to Australia  where we have not had a technical recession in over 20 years   Quite an amazing feat to be honest  but eventually we will have a mean reversion  in both countries  
Personally  I have been expecting the negative surprise and even a potential recession to occur since late 2010  I rightfully warned my business partners against expanding the mining exploration company back in those days  My view was that the Chinese slowdown  which hardly anyone believed would happen at the time  could depress metal prices and send the mining industry into a downturn 
Chart 1 and 2  Any asset linked to the Chinese economy is under owned

 
Source  Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey  edited by Short Side of Long 
Fast forward more than three years later  How the conditions have changed  These days  pessimism on anything China0 related is such a strong prevailing thought pattern in investors  minds  that a simple comment like the headline of this article is surely bound to resolve in some sort of an argument  where I get called an idiot  sometimes words used aren t that polite either  
If we refer to Chart 1 and 2 we can see that the majority of global fund managers are now underweight commodities  back in those days extremely overweight  and their number one worry is a Chinese economic hard landing or a financial crisis  Some even say that China is about to go through Lehman 2 0  while others call China  Dubai on steroids   One thing is true  the Red Dragon s economy has been slowing and metal prices have experienced a very powerful bear market over the last three years or so 
But markets are a discount mechanism  They anticipate the future because the past and the present are already in the price  So now the question has to be  what comes next  More negativity  Or has the bear market worked its magic  My grandfather taught me very well that whatever goes up  must go down  But he failed to teach me that whatever goes down  eventually might also go back up  He wasn t an investor  you see  So today s article is all about those assets that went down a lot and their potential for a recovery 
Chart 3  Metal commodities have been basing for a year  Break out next 

Source  Short Side of Long
We have seen ongoing negativity towards the metals sector in the media as of late  Whether it s missing Copper used as collateral funding  fraudulent activities with Gold imports  oversupply of inventory at the LME warehouses  slowing Chinese commodity imports and so forth  And yet it seems that the metals and minion sector is refusing to make new lows  even as bad news circles around like a bad smell  It was early in my learning process that I came across the wisdom of Marc Faber  who frequently states that 

 When the price of an asset fails to make a new low on unfavourable news  it could be starting to price in more favourable conditions  The inverse is also true for an asset that fails to make a new high  under very favourable conditions  

If we observe Chart 3  we should be able to notice that the Rogers Metals Index  NYSE RJZ  has been basing since June 2013 and has failed to make new lows for a year now  As a matter of fact  recently the index has started to rally and is now challenging the downtrend line  In the coming weeks  it might even possibly attempt a breakout 
The reason I like using this index as a barometer of metal prices is because its weighting is by far the most balanced  Most important components are Copper  19    Aluminium  19    Gold  14 2    Silver  9 5    Lead  9 5    Zinc  9 5   and Platinum  8 5    with other metals holding lower weighting  To get a better understanding of the overall sector  let us look at the breadth of the index and what some of the individual metal prices are currently doing 
Chart 4  Copper has now broken out  despite being disliked and disowned
 
Source  Short Side of Long
First  we have some positive developments with Copper  After a prolonged bear market  which has been in place since February 2011  the price of Copper finally staged a breakout this past week  It remains to be seen how constructive this bullish movement will be  but one thing is worth noting for sure  hedge funds and other speculators have been heavily shorting this metal throughout 2013 and 2014  If the metal now bottoms and stages a decent rally  hedge funds will once again prove their value in being  dumb money  
Next  focusing our attention on Aluminium in the chart below  we can see just how severe and painful the bear market has been  From its peak in 2011  the metal was down as much as 50   if not more  Apply the contango to the total return of the metal and the recent lows seen in February of 2014 are actually even lower then the bottoming trough in March 2009  This is truly one depressed asset and it won t take much to create an upside surprise 
Technically speaking  we have some positive developments as of late  The price has finally broken above its downtrend line  which has been in place for years  Moreover  the metal is now also trading above the 200 day moving average  Momentum is finally turning positive and a break above  20 in the ETF could signal an uptrend  Remember that both Copper and Aluminium make up almost 40  of the index  so keep your eye on both of these metals 
Chart 5  Aluminium has been basing for 6 months  Is it soon to join the rally 
 
Source  Stock Charts  edited by Short Side of Long 
While most readers are quite familiar with Gold  I would rather investors focus on Silver right now  Silver is without a doubt the most oversold major asset over the last 3 years  even beating Aluminium   It has tanked by more then 60  from its May 2011 peak near  50 per ounce  Even though this article might prove to be wrong and the metal might not yet be at a final low  nevertheless it still offers tremendous value even now  in both nominal and relative terms  
Interestingly  just like Copper  it has also recently staged a breakout from its 3 year downtrend line  This is a bullish development so far  as long as the rally doesn t fizzle out once again  the way it has during previous attempts  In similar fashion to other components within the index  Silver s lowest low was registered in June 2013 exactly one year ago 
Despite unfavourable conditions  since we are constantly reminded that the QE program is ending via Fed s taper  the price has refused to make lower lows and so far seems to be building a basing pattern  A break above  22 at first  followed by  25 later  would signal that the uptrend has once again returned  If accomplished in coming months and quarters  by definition the precious metal would be making higher highs and higher lows 
Chart 6  Most oversold metal in the last 3 years was Silver  down 60  
 
Source  Short Side of Long
Copper  Silver and Aluminium are the most depressed metals on a three year rolling performance  However  other metals within the index are also staging favourable price action developments  Consider the fact that Platinum  for a while now and is attempting a breakout as I write this  despite constant negativity towards it  Nickel has already  this year  while Palladium is currently in progress of  as it moves above the 2011 level 
As important  it is not only the metals that are moving up on the upside  The mining sector is once again showing signs of life  In the chart below  I have constructed a grid of Copper Miners  upper left   NYSE COPX    Coal miners  lower left   ARCA KOL    global junior mining companies  upper right   NYSE JUNR   and global gold mining companies  lower right   NYSE GGGG    All of these sectors  and many others such as Steel  are either breaking out from their prolonged downtrends or are attempting to do so right now  Big miners such as   NYSE BHP     NYSE RIO     NYSE FCX  and   LONDON AAL  have all been moving on the upside in recent months 
The final point I would like to make is that it seems the majority of these inflationary metal assets and global mining companies bottomed out in December 2013  just as Christine Lagarde  the world s leaders and policy about deflation  How ironic  maybe it is inflation that they should be worried about

I have to admit  this is a very hard call to make and can easily be wrong  it happens to anyone as markets are a great humbling teacher   It has to be said that I am not the most experienced market investor and making huge calls on a major asset class  equities  bonds or in this case metal commodities  is not that easy  But I am courageously sticking my neck out here and stating that we have most likely seen the lows for the broad metals and mining sector  Once again  I leave you all with wise words from Mr Faber who recently stated 

My experience has been that in successful businesses and fund management companies  which performed well over the long term  some courageous decisions were taken  Courageous fund managers reduce their positions when markets become frothy and accumulate equities when economic and social conditions are dire 
They avoid the most popular sectors  which are therefore over valued  and invest in neglected sectors because being neglected by investors they are by definition inexpensive  The point is that it is very hard and that it takes a lot of courage for a fund manager to avoid the most popular sectors and stocks and to invest in unloved assets

The Gold Report  Most of the companies you cover either mine Gold or Copper  What s GMP Securities  forecast for each 
Ian Parkinson  We re using  1 350 per ounce   1 350 oz  gold  flatlined  On the copper side  we have a  2 85 pound   2 85 lb  long term copper price  but this year and next we re forecasting  3 30 lb  We see the copper price being range bound above  3 lb and then trending down to  2 85 lb  which is probably toward the bottom of the Street s consensus 
TGR  What are your thoughts on recent copper consumption data from China 
IP  It s not as robust as we would like  but London Metals Exchange  LME  data suggests copper inventory levels are being drawn down almost daily  LME warehouses in June and July 2013 had well over 600 000 tons  600 Kt  they are now below 200 Kt  There isn t a huge stockpile of copper available to disrupt the market  We re seeing cash to three month spreads tighten  which means nearby copper is being priced higher than three month material  Without any major changes in China  we see this being the price range for the next year or two 
TGR  Can the companies that you cover make money at current gold and copper prices 
IP  Yes  I have a positive outlook on most of the base metal names that I cover using a long term copper price that s below today s spot price  But those companies need to be prudent 
TGR  What s the average margin with the companies you cover in the base metals space 
IP  On a cash cost basis  low costs would be in the  1 30 1 40 lb range  and then higher costs would be around  2 lb  That would be only the site costs  Adding offsite costs transportation  etc  could raise costs to  2 30 2 40 lb  Today s copper price is sustainable for most producers  At  3 15 lb copper  even a non best in class copper producer is going to generate  0 50 0 60 lb margin  The real question is  Is the current copper price substantial enough to overcome the lofty capital expenses developers face 
TGR  What type of margin are companies typically generating at  1 300 oz gold 
IP  It varies  Some companies I cover have cash costs in the  600 700 oz range  but when we factor in everything else  we quickly get to all in sustaining costs of  1 000 1 050 oz  That s the rationale for the all in sustaining cost reporting so people can more easily determine the margin  We are seeing all in sustaining costs around  1 000 oz for a lot of producers 
TGR  You believe mining equity investors will see an onset of  macrocentric  merger and acquisition  M A  activity in the sector in 2014  Would you please elaborate 
IP  I believe that we will definitely continue to see M A  but there may be some debate as to whether it s purely macrocentric  I think it s the right time for M A  If we go back several years  there was growth for the sake of growth  I see things being more opportunistic now  We ve seen it already with Goldcorp Inc  s  NYSE GG  takeover bid  and subsequent bids  for Osisko Mining Corp   NYSE OSK  
TGR  What types of companies will drive this kind of M A 
IP  I think it s going to be a marriage between a balance sheet and a project  perhaps from state owned enterprises  the typical Chinese buyer or large multinationals seeking growth  Pre cash flow projects can be thought of as cheap exploration  There are a substantial number of junior mining companies with market caps that are smaller than what they have sunk into the ground  The market is not giving much value to these development or explorer stories because the opportunity to raise development capital in the junior market is not there  except for something special  It s an opportunity for the large  Western  publicly traded mining companies or state owned enterprises with decent balance sheets and a focus on growth to step in and say   We will take that off your hands  
TGR  Do you cover any names you believe could be M A targets 
IP  I could make an argument for a takeover of the vast majority of companies I cover 
On the base metals side  my coverage focuses on copper  Copper is strategically important and the fundamentals look solid it s a 22 million ton market  There will be continued desire to grow the copper portion of a mining company s portfolio  On the gold side  I cover some quality companies that have the scale and the right political risk  When we re talking about M A  it s not simply about the commodity or the cost structure  it s also about political jurisdictional risk 
TGR  Large companies want large scale  low cost  long life projects in relatively safe jurisdictions  What fits the bill 
IP  I look at a name like Nevada Copper Corp   TO NCU   The company is building phase one of the Pumpkin Hollow mine in Nevada  It checks all the boxes  It s in a mining friendly jurisdiction in the U S  with road access and an able bodied work force  It s a project that has the right scale if we look at the big picture  Phase one is the underground portion of Pumpkin Hollow but the bigger prize is the as yet unpermitted open pit mine that would move the needle for any suitor  The permitting timeline is less problematic for a larger company  If permitting takes 6  12 or 18 months  it s less of an issue in a broader portfolio of assets 
TGR  Do you have a permitting update on phase two 
IP  The Lyon County Land Bill has been entered into the calendar of the U S  Senate  Subject to scheduling among other Senate business  the bill could be heard at any time  so I am optimistic  If the bill passes  we could be talking about having all the boxes checked by the end of the year 
TGR  Does that account for the overhang on the stock 
IP  Yes  mostly  Phase one is not 100  financed so there is a financing overhang  but I think it s quite minor  I think the company can overcome it  This is an example of a big disconnect in the market  Nevada Copper is trading at 0 41x our estimated net asset value  NAV   But its producing peers are trading at much higher valuations  Capstone Mining Corp   TO CS  is trading at 0 59x NAV  Lundin Mining Corp   TO LUN  at 0 86x NAV and First Quantum Minerals Ltd   TO FM  at 0 95x NAV  You could argue that Nevada Copper is trading like a junior that s not as advanced 
TGR  What s another name that ticks off all the boxes for a larger company 
IP  I think there are opportunities with single asset companies  Another one that comes to mind is Copper Mountain Mining Corp   CUM TSX   It runs the Copper Mountain copper gold silver mine in south central British Columbia  It would move the needle for another midtier copper producer  The company tends to lag the valuations of more senior players  In our numbers  Copper Mountain trades at 0 69x NAV  larger names are trading at 0 85 0 95x NAV in today s market 
TGR  What s your target price on Copper Mountain 
IP  I have a  3 20 target based on 1x our NAV10 estimate 
TGR  Copper Mountain is up about 35  this year  It s noteworthy that you re ranked No  1 in the Bloomberg Absolute Return Rank  BARR  for your call on Copper Mountain 
IP  Thank you  I didn t realize that 
TGR  Copper Mountain and Lundin Mining  both of which are under coverage  are performing  What are some common denominators in their success 
IP  They re base metal focused  I have a stronger view on the base metal pricing structure versus bulk commodities like iron ore  If we go up market and start playing in the realm of BHP Billiton Ltd   NYSE BHP  and Rio Tinto Plc  NYSE RIO   we are taking on more of that bulk commodity exposure  Investors have to come down to these smaller names to get that pure exposure to base metals 
The valuation of Copper Mountain and Lundin  as well as other companies that I cover  are all driven by the same inputs  Our price targets are all 1x NAV share  using the same price deck for all companies 
TGR  Where is the best value 
IP  Capstone Mining is a valuation call  I think there s a catch up to be made in that name  I can t explain why it is lagging the group  It recently acquired the Pinto Valley asset from BHP Billiton and that asset is running well  The cash costs were a bit higher than it originally guided  but they are trending in the right direction  All things are looking solid at Pinto Valley  Capstone s other assets are Minto in the Yukon and Cozamin in Mexico  My price target is  4 50 
TGR  Lundin s best asset is a 24  stake in Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  s  NYSE FCX  Tenke Fungurume copper mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC   How does that asset compare to others in its peer group 
IP  It s a staggering asset in terms of grade and scale  We are dealing with a mine that s moving material that s 10 times the grade of other mines in my coverage universe  What holds back the deposit is that it s located in the DRC a difficult place to do business due to limited power  infrastructure and the overall work environment  If that deposit were anywhere else in the world  it would have been mined much earlier and be much bigger than it is 
TGR  How does Lundin balance the DRC risk 
IP  Lundin has become increasingly diversified  The Eagle nickel copper mine  its main growth asset  is under construction in Michigan s Upper Peninsula the polar opposite of the DRC in political risk  There s also the Zinkgruvan zinc copper lead mine in Sweden  and the Neves Corvo copper zinc mine in Portugal  Its political risk is broadly diversified  I have a  6 75 target on Lundin 
TGR  Most of the gold companies you cover have been given a rough ride in 2014  Among the underperformers year to date  which ones are poised to post a stronger H2 14 
IP  Probably Argonaut Gold Inc   TO AR  and AuRico Gold Inc   NYSE AUQ   for different reasons  Argonaut has two producing mines  El Castillo and La Colorada  El Castillo in Durango  Mexico  had a pretty rough finish in 2013  The mine schedule at El Castillo saw it mining transitional ore for longer than expected and that impacted recoveries and production into Q1 14  That s over  but I think the market probably needs to see it deliver  The recent pullback with the name is really based on that short term operating scenario  We should see Argonaut revert to where the name was trading not that long ago 
TGR  Scotia Bank recently revised Argonaut s target to  6 50 from  8  Yours remains at  8 50  Why 
IP  I still have a positive view on its growth assets  We just talked about El Castillo and La Colorada  Argonaut has two other growth assets  San Antonio in Mexico and Magino in northern Ontario  I carry value for essentially all five parts of the story  the two operating mines El Castillo and La Colorada San Antonio  Magino and then San Agustin  which it recently acquired from Silver Standard Resources Inc   NASDAQ SSRI  and is now drilling  The first set of drill results looks very encouraging 
TGR  San Antonio has had some permitting issues  Do you believe Argonaut can work those out and get that asset into production 
IP  With San Antonio it s a matter of time  The asset has value  and I think it will go into production 
TGR  And AuRico 
IP  It s a  show me  year with AuRico  because it is transitioning from an open pit mine at Young Davidson in northern Ontario to underground mining at higher grades  More ore is coming from the underground portion but it s still ramping up and that s skewing the financial numbers  By the time Q3 14 rolls around  the open pit should be completely shut down and the numbers should be clearer  The higher grade should move its mining costs in the right direction 
TGR  You have a  2 50 target on Timmins Gold Corp   AMEX TGD   After a brief rally earlier this year  the share price hovers around  1 50 despite better than expected earnings and cash flow per share in Q1 14  What s going to move that name 
IP  Timmins is a single asset story and that may help explain the underappreciation of the name  It has solid cash flow  solid earnings per share but not a great deal of growth beyond the San Francisco mine in Mexico  Having said that  in a higher gold price environment the company s land package has some exploration upside 
TGR  The mill is operating pretty much at nameplate capacity  isn t it 
IP  Timmins added crushing capacity last year and made incremental improvements on the ground without spending a lot of capital  Timmins is a solid operating group doing what it said it was going to do  exceeding expectations the first part of the year and operating in a very safe part of the world 
TGR  AuRico took a close look at Timmins a few years ago  Would a takeover make sense 
IP  I regularly field that question  AuRico s El Chanate mine is geologically similar to Timmins  and not too far away  If you re looking for consolidation stories  it makes a lot of sense 
TGR  Please leave us with a thought or two to buoy the spirits of disheartened gold investors 
IP  I m encouraged that the industry is focusing on economics  Growth for the sake of growth is no longer the preeminent mantra  Assets are being shelved  sold or put on care and maintenance as companies focus on assets that make money  Management teams are being forced to be prudent  The industry is in better shape today than it was a year and a half ago

17675,239190,FCX,Markets Tumble On Chinese Slowdown  Goldman Slashes Growth Forecasts,opinion,Markets tumbled overnight on fears that China s slowdown will produce the much dreaded hard landing as economists at Goldman Sachs cut the growth forecasts for the emerging market economy  Chinese shares fell over 5 percent while copper tumbled to a new 2013 low on global growth fears Slowing EconomyChina s economy has been slowing since the global financial crisis shook developed markets and limited China s export growth  A massive fiscal stimulus in 2009 helped to boost the economy back to high growth levels through 2010 however increased credit levels in the economy have put a strain on any further fiscal boost while export growth continues to sag As Jonathon Laing wrote in this weekend s cover story for Barron s   The primary fault line in the Chinese economy that worries many has been the explosion in the credit to GDP ratio since the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis and economic slowdown  as China sought to stimulate its economy in the face of a lag in its longtime growth engine  exports  This total societal debt load has followed a similar growth trajectory to that of the U S  and British economies in the six years leading up to the 2008 crisis  Japan s credit orgy from 1985 to 1990  a prelude to two decades of stagnant growth punctuated by bouts of deflation  or Korea prior to the Asian financial crisis   According to a report from analysts at Fitch  China s recent credit bubble has topped them all with total debt rising from 130  of GDP in 2007 to 210  in the first quarter of this year  In Japan  by comparison  during the fateful six year credit bubble  the jump in the ratio was just 45 percentage points  from about 150  to just over 195   Turning Off the SpigotRather than step in to ease monetary conditions and prevent a banking crisis  the People s Bank of China  PBOC  has actually been withdrawing liquidity from the interbank market  Two short term note sales in early June withdrew much needed capital from the interbank market after a national banking holiday had already seen a large outflow of deposits from banks  The timing also coincided with companies withdrawing money to pay taxes The PBOC did purchase some bills late last week in an effort to ease interbank strains  Overnight lending rates  measured by the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate  SHIBOR   have eased substantially following the sharp spike late last week  The overnight lending rate has declined to 6 489 percent after peaking well over 10 percent last week  The past five years has seen the explosion of China s shadow banking system that largely operates in a regulatory realm outside the direct control of Beijing  and yet last year was estimated to have accounted for more than 45  of China s credit creation   writes Laing   This burgeoning nonbank channel comprises a crazy quilt of institutions and investing instruments that extends from off balance sheet offerings of wealth management products from traditional banks to the credit wares of brokerage houses  pawn shops  and credit guarantee loan paper  Even the fast growing Chinese bond market can be chaotic  with four regulators  poor disclosure  and credit rating inflation  Estimates CutAs if the extremely negative assessment in the ever popular Barron s this weekend wasn t enough to affect markets  the economics team at Goldman Sachs lowered its growth forecasts for the Chinese economy over the weekend  Goldman is just the latest bank to cut forecasts for the Chinese economy Goldman now forecasts an annualized second quarter growth rate of 7 5 percent for China  down from the previous estimate of 7 8 percent  For the full year 2013  they expect growth of 7 4 percent vs  the prior estimate of 7 8 percent and also lowered 2014 s growth forecast 7 7 percent from 8 4 percent However  Laing says that China has weapons left in its arsenal to avoid a collapse and keep the economy chugging along    The PBOC  could unleash some of the CNY19 trillion that its central bank holds as loan reserves  or deploy the  3 38 trillion  CNY20 7 trillion  in foreign currency reserves  though much of that has already been committed   Beijing also could sell part of its interests in its state owned enterprises  though Chu reasons that the central government would be reluctant to dump such assets at  fire sale prices   As a last resort  China could also print money  adding to the rapid monetary growth of recent years  Markets TumbleMarkets tumbled on the outlook cut and on general fears that China will not be able to avoid the much dreaded hard landing in China  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 5 29 percent while the CSI Index of the 300 largest companies dropped a whopping 6 31 percent  Most major European indices traded down nearly 2 percent while S P 500 futures fell 16 3 points to 1 567 80 Industrial metals were crushed as copper fell to a new 3 year low  Copper futures fell 2 63 percent to  301 85 after posting a new low earlier  Meanwhile  the Australia dollar  a proxy for industrial commodity demand  fell 0 46 percent against the U S  dollar and made a new multi year low as well Materials and commodity price sensitive stocks in the U S  plunged pre market on lower metals prices and weaker demand outlooks  U S  Steel  X  fell 2 69 percent pre market while Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold  FCX  shares fell 2 34 percent and Deere and Company  DE  declined 2 55 percent  Overall  investors sold

17676,239191,FCX,How George Topping Is Profiting from Copper Price Volatility ,opinion,Everything you thought you knew about copper is wrong  Is it an economic barometer  Nope  Do copper warehouses decrease volatility  Hardly  Can investors play small cap base metals producers for profit  You bet  These are the conclusions Analyst George Topping shared with us in his interview with The Metals Report  Find out why Doctor Copper just might be stripped of its credentials and whether you should trade in your gold for platinum group metals  The Metals Report  George  what do Doctor Copper and other indicators tell you about global economic performance over the medium term  George Topping  You can t take the value of any commodity as a true indicator of physical demand these days  For example  a fortnight ago  copper prices shot up 6  from  3 per pound   3 lb  to  3 19 lb in a heartbeat  That resulted from financial players pushing the copper price around  It represents what the financial markets think of the world economy  The indicator has some value in that it reflects a collective body of knowledge  but the underlying physical market is not as bad as the financial players would have you think  Copper consumption will start to pick up  I expect the price of copper will increase because the number of dollars in circulation has tripled in the past five to six years  There s been an incredible printing of currencies and currency debasement in the U S   Japan  Europe and Great Britain  The U S  adjusted monetary base is now over  3 trillion  up from  800 billion   800B   Another important angle on the physical copper market involves warehouses  Copper consumers are learning that we may look like we re well supplied from the London Metal Exchange  but while it s easy to put copper in  it s not easy to get it out  There are restrictions on the amount of copper that can come out of warehouses on a particular day  Warehouses are supposed to restrict volatility and make it less of a tradable commodity  but it can make it more volatile to the upside because when you want your copper  the companies that control the warehouses can take their time  causing premiums to rise  TMR  Do you believe that volatility could provide investors with entry points  GT  Absolutely  Pullbacks  like when the copper price came down closer to  3 lb this year  are an excellent entry point  When prices fall  it s a good time to stock up  It s human nature  TMR  What is your thesis for small cap base metal equities  GT  Small cap equities are out of favor  which makes them more attractive to larger companies that have the cash to move in and acquire them  There s a surplus of assets for sale right now  The major companies like BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP   Rio Tinto Plc  RIO  and Barrick Gold Corp   ABX  are selling off their noncore assets  TMR  What do these companies look for in an asset  GT  They re looking for quick cash flow  The market has moved away from the  we ll build this  and in five years we ll see some cash flow  model  Until we work our way through this period of oversupply of producing assets  these juniors will trade at very cheap prices  TMR  How long will it take to wash the surplus assets out of the system  GT  It depends on metal prices  The push to sell lower quality assets is on  but a lot of those assets will be taken off the table if base metal prices run higher  Juniors like Foran Mining Corporation  FOM TSX V  are trading at very low prices compared to the worth of their deposits  Smarter  more long term oriented companies can buy these smaller assets and tuck them away for later development  TMR  What s your rating and target for Foran right now  GT  We have a Buy rating on Foran  The target price is  1 50  A few months ago the stock was trading at  0 55  It s now down to  0 38  The management is a cut above the rest  President and CEO Patrick Soares  the chap who sold Hammond Reef to Osisko Mining Corp   OSK TSX   has a track record of selling assets at a premium  Chairman Darren Morcombe is connected and has done very well  He sold a gold refinery to Newmont Mining Corp   NEM  for a good profit  Franco Nevada Corp   FNV  Chairman Pierre Lassonde owns about 11  of the company  That s an endorsement  if you ask me  TMR  What s next for Foran in terms of development  GT  It s advancing engineering studies and met testing  so it can quickly put together an economic study  TMR  What other development stage base metal projects are you following  GT  Lumina Copper Corp   LCC TSX  in Argentina  Its Taca Taca project is trading at a deep discount due to Argentine risk  but we ll get a view on that in October when we see the legislature elections  TMR  Where is Taca Taca along the development curve  GT  Lumina has delineated the deposit and done the economics  but it s waiting for a bit  In any other country  it would ve been taken out at three times the current share price  It s a waiting game  TMR  What s your rating and target  GT  I have a Buy rating on it  The target is  15  I also recommend Duluth Metals Ltd   DM TSX  in Minnesota  TMR  It s on a big belt there  GT  You got it  That belt continues up into Canada  It s a massive deposit  Polymet Mining Corp   PLM  is also there  TMR  But Polymet has all kinds of trouble  What makes the thesis better at Duluth  GT  Duluth has a contract with Antofagasta Plc  ANTO LSE   which owns 40  of the joint venture  Once the bankable feasibility study is completed  probably in two years  Antofagasta has the option to buy 25  of the Maturi project for a pro rata share of 1 0x net asset value  NAV   which will be determined by the bankable feasibility study  We ve modeled it at a NAV 10  discount rate   2 80 copper  and we get a value of over  2B for the deposit  That s  500 million   500M  for the 25   but Duluth is trading only at a couple of hundred million market cap  If I m Antofagasta  I m just going to buy Duluth  and then I get 60  for less than I can buy the 25  for  What I like most is that there s a catalyst that encourages Antofagasta buy Duluth much sooner  My target is  5  TMR  Can you talk about a couple of the producers you cover  GT  We re recommending First Quantum Minerals Ltd   FM TSX   It s the go to name for copper exposure in North America since its competitor  Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX   bought into oil and gas  TMR  Where is the growth coming from  GT  It has a lot of growth projects  maybe too many at one time  actually  It s got expansion at its existing mine  Kansanshi  in Zambia  It s building a smelter  which will supply Kansanshi and also handle production from Sentinel  another huge project in Zambia  It s building the Enterprise nickel deposit in Zambia  The completion date for the next phase of expansion at Kansanshi is 2015  Sentinel should be commissioned in mid 2014  TMR  Is it overleveraged in terms of development projects  GT  There is a delivery risk  but it is better than most at delivering  That s the only concern  If you re not fazed by quarterly hits and misses and can look at it as a trend  you ll be fine  TMR  Is there another copper producer in your book  GT  Capstone Mining Corp   CS TSX   obviously  Its acquisition of BHP s Pinto Valley mine changes everything  Its copper production will be up more than 130   Ironically  it may become more of a target because of that  It s always been seen as a small mine in the Yukon that was good quality  but didn t move the needle  But now it s got Pinto  TMR  Did you see the Pinto acquisition coming  GT  Yes  it was well signaled  The rumors in the market are that Capstone was not the highest bidder but was paying cash  whereas the others were saying   Here  take our shares   TMR  Let s shift to zinc  What s your price forecast for the remainder of the year  GT  We re going to see metal taken off the visible inventories  For this year   0 94 lb is the average  Next year  we expect it to spike up to  1 26 lb  We don t know when the cycle s going to turn  but when it does  it ll be rapid  TMR  This is based on supply levels and a lack of a growing supply of zinc  GT  At these price levels  companies are starting to shut down  The silver price has fallen significantly  and silver and zinc occur together  China is the major zinc supplier  but labor costs in China have been rising at 15  a year  meaning access to cheap labor to mine these deposits has dried up  On a currency basis  the Chinese yuan is fairly strong  so they re not getting a benefit from their currency  TMR  Do escalating labor costs in China help raise the share price of a junior like Foran  given the amount of zinc at McIlvenna Bay  GT  Absolutely  Companies like Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX   HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM  and Foran should benefit tremendously  Foran especially  given its 25 million ton McIlvenna resource  Indicated and Inferred  and proximity to Hudbay s Flin Flon zinc smelter  Very few zinc companies are left given the bear market we ve had since 2007  Six years later  there s hardly anything available to invest in  These polymetallic companies are the only

17680,239195,FCX,SP 500 Earnings  Forward 4 Quarter Estimate Reaches New Record High,opinion,As we talked about last week  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate for the SP 500 reached a new record high this week of  116 67  The p e ratio on the forward estimate is 13 99 x   The  earnings yield  on the SP 500 is now 7 15   which has been climbing  still indicates stocks are very cheap  The year over year growth of the forward 4 quarter estimate slipped a little from last week s 5 21  to this week s 4 91   I would like to see that move back towards 6  before long  To be frank about the  forward estimate   given that we did not see as much slippage between early April and late June  I thought the forward estimate as we moved into July  13  would be up above  117 range  That being said  the forward estimate of  116 67 is at a new record high  while the SP 500 sits below its old high of 1 687 18 of May 22nd  2013  Something will have to give between the two  and the last few years  it means the SP 500 will likely trade to a new record high in the next few months      SP 500 2nd quarter  2013 earnings expectations   2nd  quarter  2013  earnings start this coming week with Alcoa  AA  on Monday night  July 8th  while JP Morgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  both report before the bell on Friday  July 12th  Per ThomsonReuters  current analyst consensus is looking for  2 9  year over year growth in the SP 500 as a whole  with expected revenue growth of 1 6   By mid August  when the majority of the SP 500 will have reported their 2nd quarter s  we expect SP 500 earnings growth to be between 5    7   typical of the last two quarters  For full year 2013  current analyst consensus is looking for 7 3  SP 500 earnings growth for the full year as of July 5th  Here is the current

one of our sector overweights  with Financials showing some of the best absolute and relative earnings growth within the SP 500  for both the 2nd quarter  2013 and full year 2013  It will be interesting to hear on the conference calls the impact of higher rates on the Financial sector in general  but we do NOT think that higher rates will have the negative impact  or correlelation  that we saw in the 1980 s and 1990 s  In fact higher rates could very much be a positive for Financials  and not just from a  net interest margin  perspective  Loan growth  credit growth  and capital markets growth  both credit and equity underwriting   will help drive revenue growth as the sector heals itself   Our largest single stock positions within Financials are CME  GS  and JPM  as well as Schwab  SCHW   Long all 4   The Financial sector s revenue growth of 5  is also better than prior quarter s expectations  Off the 2009 market low  given Dodd Frank and the anti proprietary trading  and anti wealth and  the banker as she devil  environment that has permeated Washington and the general public  Financials have had a tough time generating revenue growth  The sector saw just 1    2  year over year revenue growth from late 2009 through the present  I do think revenue growth will continue to improve  Certainly housing and mortgage lending should contribute  although with the interest rate rise  refinancings will start to dry up  Full year 2013 earnings growth expectations for Financials are currently  18   and have moved steadily higher over the last 5 quarters  5  expected revenue growth for Finnacials for q2  13 is pretty decent  relative to the SP 500 s 1 6   Telecom  note the earnings growth  We aren t long any Telco but continue to model and track Verizon and AT T  The telecom sector was part and parcel to the dividend trade and  bond proxy  trade  which is why the stocks have gotten hammered  We are going to give them more time  We like Verizon near  45 and AT T closer to  30  Finally  what was interesting about the SP 500 s reaction on Friday to 2 72  10 year Treasury yield  was that after correcting following the strong market open  the SP 500 gained strength all day and finished the day near the highs of the day  That is a good sign  despite a sharp rise in interest rates  The SP 500 wants to go higher   that is undeniable  Some think we are on track for a 25  year ala  1995  I ll take it  as will clients           Basic Materials  Interesting action in US Steel  X  this week  The sentiment around the group  of which we are long Alcoa  AA   US Steel  X  and Freeport  FCX  is absolutely horrid  which I personally believe is a function of the drop in gold  The cacophony and commentary around gold and the GLD is just amazing  I look at it as just another precious metal  The sentiment could be getting too negative around the sector  which is just 3  of the SP 500 as it is  Earnings estimates have been taken out and shot for the sector  We are keeping a toe in the water within the sector  given the negative sentiment  To play a turnaround like Basic Materials requires a lot of patience  We are hoping for some reason to continueb to hold the shares as we see individual earnings reports  Interest rates  We think 2 90    3  is the near term high for the 10 year Treasury yield  We are still long the TBF  in fact it is one of our largest positions  but to be honest  we ve been trading the TBF since March   April  2010  and were finally right on the Inverse Treasury ETF  TBF   this year  We took a beating on the position in client bond and balanced accounts in 2010 and 2011  losing as much as 20   but making it up with a credit and high yield overweight  What is puzzling to me is the weakness in high yield as payroll growth improves and corporate earnings improve  I wonder if it is just mass retail dumping of anything fixed income or bond related    High yield ETF s  The HYG and the JNK were down 1 8  and 1 6  respectively this past week  even with Friday s strong jobs number  Anything fixed income related is getting trashed  Remember  the old investing adage   price determines value   and the selloff in bond land is creating longer term values  I would think there is wholesale dumping of mutual funds  given their lack of defined maturity  Frankly I d rather use closed end funds and ETF s as well as individual bonds in the next few years  to manage interest rate risk  than expose clients to open ended  undefined interest rate risk in a mutual fund  Thanks to   not just for carrying our blog work  but selecting one of our blog posts for the Editor s Pick in June   13  Here is the blog post that made Investing com s Editor s Pick  Ryan Detrick  a Cincinnati pal and an XU alum  is simply

Xavier graduate  Ryan is all over CNBC  Bloomberg  etc  with his forecasts  Another interesting post from Norm Conley   JAG Norm  about  As of June 28th  the date of the post   the 10 year had moved 3 standard deviations above its 20 day moving average  This was prior to Friday s move as well  I now wonder if the rate move is getting overdone  From the St  Louis Fed s website    which bodes well for bank earnings  My own opinion is that with consumer balance sheets vastly improved  loan growth will continue  and likely at a more prudent pace then from 2000 to 2007  John Butters from FactSet has a good take on q2  13 earnings  I have talked to John a few times via email  when he was with ThomsonReuters  When you listen to the video  I do think he is too negative on the SP 500 earnings picture as a whole  This sentiment has enveloped earnings season for the last year now  only to be proved incorrect  Good comments on technology s earnings  vis a vis Apple s earnings trends   long AAPL   Also I am not certain of the difference between Factset s expectation for q2  13 SP 500 earnings growth of just 0 3  and ThomsonReuter s  2 9   That deserves more attention  Jeff Miller  of is always a good read  There is an interesting link to an article by Vince Foster of Minyanville in Jeff s June 26th article or post  Vince talks about the Eurodollar market  That is a big volume driver behind CME s stock price of late   GarySMorrow is a former CME trader and told me that Euro volume exploded after Bernanke s speech  The CME also has 99  market share of the Treasury futures market  They are winning both ways with the interest rate spike last fall and then earlier in 2013  There is one last potential driver for CME volume  and that is the Credit Default Swap  CDS  market  Jeff Miller and I had lunch this week  and we talked about how most people probably do not understand how moving the CDS market from  over the counter  to the exchanges will greatly help mitigate and reduce systemic risk  We ll have an article forthcoming shortly on this topic  It is a big deal  Read the February 4th  Seeking Alpha story for a better take on the issue  Great sale of our homebuilder stocks   Wish I could do that every time  Dan Fitzpatrick over on  talks about the ugly charts in homebuilders this weekend  We ve done a far better job trimming winners this year  as well as managing interest rate risk and mitigating portfolio risk  with the exception of Apple in January and April   13  There is always one that shoots you in the foot  We still like Facebook  FB

17681,239196,FCX,Watching For S P 500 Breakout As Forward Earnings Confirmation,opinion,A quick thanks to CNBC Asia  Elly Whitaker  and Joanne Wong  for the  on CNBC Asia Monday night  We talked Alcoa  AA  earnings and S P 500 expected earnings for Q2  13  Hopefully the CNBC anchors  Oriel Morrison and Adam Bakhtiar found the discussion worthwhile and insightful  Again  thank you CNBC for the invite  We were fortunate enough to do a  a few months ago with Courtney Regan and Aaron Task  too  It is always a compliment when someone in the media asks for your opinion  It is a bigger compliment when they keep asking Per ThomReuter s This Week in Earnings  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500 rose a smidge this week to  116 81  from last week s  116 67  and a continued record high for the S P 500 forward earnings estimate The P E ratio on the forward estimate as of Friday s close was 14 4 x  The  earnings yield  on the forward estimate has slipped back under 7  to 6 95  The year over year growth of the forward estimate also slipped for the 2nd consecutive week to 4 22  from last week s 4 91  I would like to see that forward estimate start to increase again on a year over year  y y  percentage basis  and move past the March 1 high of 6 10    This is the key metric to watch  By the end of next week  about 100 S P 500 companies will have reported Q2  13 earnings  Current expectations are for  2 4  earnings growth  y y  and  1 4  revenue growth Q2  13 Earnings growth by Sector  ranked Highest to Lowest Financials   17 5 Cons Disc   6 0 Telco   5 3

the year over year earnings growth of the Telecom Sector fell from 18 7  to 5 3  just since July 1  Full year  13 data was revised lower as well   Let me check that and get back to readers this week    Telecom is just 3  of the S P 500 by market cap  Relative to the index  it is a small piece of the pie Financial sector earnings growth is the clear winner for Q2  13  and for 2013 as a whole In Q4  13  the Financial sector is expected to generate 25  y y earnings growth   that is pretty good growth when 2013 is only looking for 7  for the full year for the S P 500 in its entirety The flip side to this is virtually every guru and CNBC   Bloomberg guest is now bulling Financials It is a statement heard often through the years  particularly the 1990 s  but a stock market led by Financials  is not a bad market  in fact it is the sign of a healthy stock market Two things we look for as our holdings report earnings each quarter 1   How do leadership stocks respond to good news  2   Will there be some catalyst for our laggards or value holdings to start to close what we perceive is the valuation gap between market price and intrinsic value  Wells Fargo  WFC  and JP Morgan  JPM  responded OK to what were pretty decent  albeit probably already discounted earnings reports  Both stocks are at or near all time highs  JPM traded above its May 2007 of  53 in May  13  and WFC is still about  1 50    2 short of its 2007 high  Both these stocks are in an economy and capital market environment that is a tail wind now  versus a head wind in 2010  2011  and 2012 Alcoa  AA  is trading a little better  but there was nothing about it s earnings report that looked like the world has changed  There is still pressure on alumina pricing and FORWARD revenue and EPS estimates were revised downward  However  AA finished up 3 71  for the week  a good sign given the earnings report  Remember  the stock will always move before you see a change in fundamentals We think AA is worth at least  15 per share  while Morningstar has a  19 fair value on the stock  Alcoa earned close to  3 in 2007   it may only print  0 50 per share in 2013  if that Other laggards we are watching are Caterpillar  CAT   John Deere  DE   General Electric  GE   and the Basic Materials stocks like Freeport  FCX  and US Steel  X  If you like to play the long shot at the track  Basic Materials is your sector  On October 1  2012  the expectation for Basic Mat was that Q2  13 sector earnings growth would be  23 8   Today that same number is  7 7   That is a whopping 3 000 basis point negative revision in just 9 months But here is the catch  full year 2013 Basic Mat sector earnings growth is still looking for  5 7   Q3  13 expectations are for 14  currently  expect that number to come down   which we won t start hearing about until October 10th or so The sentiment and the numbers are lining up so that the sector could bottom this summer  Look at the action in gold  This was the best week for the Gold ETF  GLD  since 2011 per a headline on Marketwatch At just 3  of the S P 500  Basic Mat isn t like Financials  17  of S P 500 by market cap  or Technology  18  of S P 500 by market cap   However  you can get a lot of outperformance if you overweight at the right time Conclusion  the next iteration in terms of earnings is the  return to global growth theme   which should break S P 500 earnings and revenues out of this 5  and 1  growth range these two metrics have been locked into for some time  Basic Materials could benefit  as will Industrials and Technology  100  Domestic companies have outperperformed Internationals for some time  More on this below  but I suspect this dynamic will change over the next few years  Watch and see if the S P 500 trades again to an all time high  Earnings should follow  We expect Q2  13 earnings growth to wind up between  5  to  7   Ryan Detrick  a fellow Xavier alum and simply one of the best market prognosticators in the media  which includes frequent CNBC and Bloomberg interviews  out with the Schaeffer s Investment Research this weekend  Like Josh Brown  Ryan is now a  must read  every day on Twitter   RyanDetrick   Josh is found at  ReformedBroker  The negative sentiment bias is  I think  a huge plus for this market  Ryan alerted me to the consolidation and eventual breakout the last few months in the Russell 2000 too  Amazon  AMZN  and Google  GOOG  had good week s too in terms of price action  The S P 500 now needs to close above the May 22nd  2013  1687 18  all time high print to confirm the RUT and other break outs Ryan Detrick  the potential for the S P 500 to trade to 2 000 from a July 11th post From Norm Conley   JAG Norm  Twitter feed  the hedge fund article by   My own opinion is that hedge funds did work well from March  2000 through March  09  since a hedge fund is an absolute return vehicle  They couldn t get much attention in the late 1990 s generating 5    6  steady returns  when the S P 500 had 5 years in a row with annual returns of 20  per year  The cycle has now returned to long only guys  and more importantly  instruments like Inverse ETF s allow small advisors like me to short sectors and short entire asset classes  like Treasuries  with great ease  and be  hedge fund like  for small Schwab accounts that historicallly don t interest anybody but small advisors  Personally  and this is just my opinion  but the inverse ETF s and knowing how to use them has made me far more effective as an advisor  Our largest position as of June 30th  was the TBF  unlevered Inverse Treasury ETF  which we had unfortunately been long  and wrong  for too long  but allowed me to hedge client s intermediate bond risk and duration risk and get client s absolute return in their bond accounts in May and June of this year Another good Tweet from Norm Conley on tech s  Financials and Technology are our two largest sector overweights  We split our technology weightings between value Technology like Intel  and IBM  and then growth Technology like Amazon and Google   Long all 4 stocks   Corporate high yield or the junk bond market had a good week this week  with the HYG and the JNK ETFs up 3  respectively  The TLT is now resting against it s 200 week moving average  and is the most oversold as it was in early  2010  Ultimately  my own opinion is that the 10 year Treasury puts in an intermediate peak near 3 90    4  this year Jon Najarian  gold miners with the Street s Joe Deaux  Jon made a nice call on gold  and we are watching the Basic Materials earnings for some clue of a bottowing  Certainly sentiment and technical action are starting to line up  We aren t long any gold yet  but will be interested in Freeport  FCX  and US Steel  X  in terms of earnings  Gold seems to have its own particular fascination and weird  cult  following  The constant cacophony in terms of the infomercials  and the advertising around the precious metal is more noise than substance  US Steel earned  18 per share in 2008  and traded as high as  196 in June  08  before falling to  21 in November  2008  We went long some X near  17 and change this spring  The chart is very interesting for X   will be out with a post on it this week  People said tech stocks in the 1990 s were volatile   wait till you see the chart of US Steel   Long AA  X  FCX In Barron s this weekend  Kopin Tan s Streetwise column talks about Financial stocks being 50  below their 2007 peak  without once mentioning shareholder DILUTION  I will never buy Citigroup  C  or AIG ever again  simply because the dilution and then the reverse stock split was pathetic  Citi has 4 x  as many fully diluted shares outstanding today as in 2007  so that means operating income or pre tax  pre provision operating profit must be at least 4 x  s higher to get the same EPS than in 2007  and it could be worse  Actually looking at ThomsonReuter s Datastream  to which we subscribe  here is the fully diluted shares outstanding for Citigroup starting with 2008 2012  3 015 billion  fully diluted shares outstanding 2011  2 999 billion2010  2 968 billion2009  1 157 billion2008  526 millionYes  I was wrong  it is actually 6 x  more shares outstanding than 2008  Both Citi  C  and AIG  AIG  have completely crapped on the shareholder  Some of it government forced  most self inflicted TheStreet doing theiron Apple

 As of the end of June  the outperformance differential was 310 bp s  My own opinion is that this differential will continue to narrow as international economies recover  Industrials  Technology  maybe even Basic Materials will perform better On the Alcoa conference call  the comments were that the European auto business is still quite bad  That obviously could impact Ford  F   The  2 billion European loss that Ford guided to this year is  0 50 per share  Can t believe they would guide to a bigger loss  but there may not be the  positive body language  some were expecting on the 2nd

18 months  Japan and economic news out of Europe will be key  Dont care much about the Emerging Markets  thinking more of major developed economies like the US  China  Japan and Europe  first How the Financial sector reacts to Q2  13 earnings results is key  However the plan  as of today  is to remain overweight the group for 2013 given how the sector earnings estimates have tracked for the last 9 months  and given the stability of the q4  13 Financial estimates We remain overweight equities in the majority of client accounts  versus the standard 60    40  asset allocation portfolio We remain overweight credit risk and high yield  as well as the Inverse Treasury in the fixed income portion of client accounts  although the 10 year Treasury has reached price support at its 200 week moving average  Our thought is the 10 year Treasury yield gets to 3 90    4  by year end ,2013-07-14,Brian

17682,239197,FCX,S P 500  Q1  14 Should Be Low Water Point For Year,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuters   This Week in Earnings  the forward 4 quarter estimate for the S P 500 fell  0 08 last week to  118 81 from  118 89 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate is now 15 71 x   and the PEG ratio is 2 57 x  
The  earnings yield  is 6 37  
More importantly  the year over year growth of the forward estimate fell slightly last week to 6 12   from 6 19  
Analysis Conclusion  the fact is  week in and week out  sometimes there isn t much to add in the way of commentary to S P 500 earnings numbers 
Here is a spreadsheet just cooked up to show the progression of earnings growth by quarter over the last few years  
You can see how strong earnings growth was in 2011  led mainly be Energy  but the S P 500 only returned 2    3  in that calendar year  thanks to the EU  Greece and the threat of a US recession  In 2012  the year started off strong and then faded as we neared the 2012 Presidential election  Apple Inc s  NASDAQ AAPL  earnings peaked in September  2012 too  The two primary large cap market leaders   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  and Apple   peaked in late 2012 in terms of their stocks prices  2013 started off weaker and then Q4  13 was particularly robust   Long IBM  AAPL 
Now we are looking at 2014  and while I suspect Q1  14 will come in with at least 5  y y EPS growth for the key benchmark  the initial growth rates for the rest of the year by quarter  indicate that 2014 should see stronger growth in the final two quarters of the year  than the first two quarters 
How do you invest off this info 
I truly think the S P 500 could tread water through the first 6 months of 2014  which would track the 2 year Presidential Cycle meme we heard about so much in January  14  However  the trend in S P 500 remains positive and moving  northeast  in nature  I have to explain to readers too  earnings growth can be deceptive  look at 2011  and then 1994  In 1994  when Alan Greenspan raised rates 6 times  the S P 500 saw earnings grow 19  that year  but the index was only 1  that year  and most of that gain came in November and December  94 
With 496 of the 500 S P companies reporting  the y y earnings growth for Q4  13 is  9 6   That is a good number  Q1  14 is currently estimated at  2 1   which should decline over the next few weeks  but expect the quarter to end up in the  5  neighborhood  by the time we get to mid to late May  14  I do expect q1  14 to be the  low water  point for the year in terms of earnings growth 
In terms of sectors  we are still leaning towards commodities and Basic Materials  as we referenced in mid 2013     I still very much like Alcoa Inc  NYSE AA   and United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   although I was hoping X would trade down to its 200 day moving average  We added to some Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX  in small quantities on Friday  3 21 14  Coal is looking very interesting too ",2014-03-23,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/s-p-500:-q1-’14-should-be-low-water-point-for-year-206944,206944

17684,239199,FCX,When Equities Crash  Michael Berry Will Take Refuge,opinion,"An overinflated equities market could be good news for metals and mining stocks  In this interview with The Gold Report  Morning Notes Publisher Michael Berry shares two scenarios that could follow an imminent crash and four gold companies that could be perfectly positioned to take advantage of a reset credit market 
The Gold Report  Mike  you ve been watching the stock market and  by extension  the precious metals markets very closely for signs of a larger equity market blow off that could send gold higher  What makes you think the Dow Jones Industrials and the Nasdaq are in a bubble  What are the signs that a crash might be imminent Michael Berry  I have been watching bubbles since 1987  In September of that year I correctly predicted the 25  crash of October 19  We have been blowing through mini and maxi bubbles for 30 years  this one is nothing new 
The solution to our macroeconomic issues has been to inflate new bubbles  to inflate asset values to soften the blow from the last bubble  all the while creating the conditions for the next one  That is how we ended up with the current equity market bubble  It is driven solely by the Federal Reserve s liquidity  Always remember that liquidity begets liquidity  I also see a debt market that I consider to be a bubble  These markets are just not sustainable  I can t say when  but we have an equity market decline coming  maybe a severe decline 
TGR  The housing bubble and the tech bubble were  by definition  confined to certain niches initially and then the impact reverberated to other sectors  Are you predicting a market wide crash where everything falls or will it be confined to certain sectors MB  The correction will impact everything  As of April 8 I m measuring the Dow technically  fundamentally and behaviorally  and I see a clear top by all three measurements  The top is not quite as clear for the S P 500  but it s certainly there  A major event could cause this bubble to burst and the markets turn down  I think it s imminent  probably this year  With the Federal Reserve pulling back on its quantitative easing  I can t see the equity market being able to sustain itself 
TGR  Are there any specific indicators that might tell when a crash is about to happen or will we only know after it happens MB  The money multiplier  M1  which is a measure of how well the banking system is working  is at its lowest level ever 0 69  according to the St  Louis Federal Reserve   It usually has been above 1 0   It has continued to decline for the last five and a half years  That is the sign of a disabled banking system  a coming bear market and a severe recession or worse  There s no doubt about that  The velocity of money has been in a decline for quite some time  These indicators mean our banking system is not working properly  These conditions were last this serious during the Great Depression  Even Milton Freidman acknowledged this when he suggested the Fed s problem will be dealing with its own drastically expanded portfolio  Freidman claimed that the Great Depression was the result of a falling multiplier and the failure to increase the money supply  That has not been the case this time but we are still in serious trouble 
Europeans are now concerned about deflation  the slowing of the economy and the falling of prices  The  D  word is actually spoken  The International Monetary Fund is particularly concerned  We ve certainly seen falling prices in the metals markets over the last year and a half  China s tightening and slowing along with the U S  tapering its quantitative easing mean the economic winds are in our face  not at our back  Those are the things I am concerned about 
TGR  So when this bubble does burst  how might the different metals   Gold  Silver  Copper   respond differently to a market crisis MB  That is a good question  The answer is it depends  If we don t fix the broken credit cycle and deal with exploding government debt  we will probably begin to see disinflation and deflation  Then prices will fall  Gold  copper  silver  tin  lead and zinc will decline  but probably less than the valuations in the macroeconomic economy  That will be the time to buy metals because we will recover once we see a new credit cycle  However  it could be a three  to five year hiatus  The Fed and others will have to deleverage  Only then will the economy be able to recover and break out of it torpor  We ll see a new bull market in the commodities then 
On the other hand  if we were to inflate out of the crisis  which the Fed would prefer  we will see gold achieve very high prices  I wish I could give you a very clear answer  Personally I think deflation is much more likely 
TGR  If we experience inflation  and the gold price goes up  will the equity prices follow 
MB  Absolutely  When we have inflation and we will as soon as a new credit cycle is in place then we are going to see gold miners take off  A lot of them are really struggling   Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  are all down 50   They are reacting to a lower gold price  We will see Goldcorp back up to  50 share  but right now there isn t a bottom on the price of these stocks because if gold goes much below  1 250 an ounce   1 250 oz   then the cost of producing gold is going to be a problem for the big gold producers  These stocks have been punished and are close to their bottoms now  People interested in precious metals and who are patient ought to be buying these on any declines in their current share prices 
TGR  Are some mining stocks going to come back faster than others MB  Yes  A lot of the big cap miners are highly leveraged with debt  They need to deleverage  and that s difficult to do in this environment  I look at a company like Goldcorp and I think it will recover much faster  Its balance sheet looks pretty good  It has a good set of assets  So I think investors want to be buying the big stocks that are not highly leveraged  and Goldcorp is certainly one of them 
The midtier producers have a real problem because they re really not big enough to go to the next level in this kind of a capital market environment  We are going to see that quite a few of them will be taken out  Goldcorp made a bid and just upped its bid for Osisko Mining Corporation  OSK TO   We may see more of that 
The juniors and explorers have been decimated  It s a bloodbath  There s no other word for it right now  These stocks are trading anywhere from  0 07 to  0 40 share  They are worth a lot more  but not in this environment  I have a number that I follow that have good management and good assets  and the ability to sustain themselves over the next year or two until we see a recovery  Sustainability will be very important 
I like Pershing Gold Corpor  PGLC PK   especially its management  Steve Alfers is CEO and running Pershing  It is a derisked near term production story  It has about 552 000 oz gold Measured and Indicated and 165 oz gold Inferred  and is building a very nice gold resource 
I like Nulegacy Gold Corporation  NUG V   Barrick is its partner in the Cortez Trend  It has done a couple of recent financings  which is a significant feat  NuLegacy is going to be drilling based on a fully funded exploration program  I think it has a real chance 
I like Terraco Gold Corp   TEN V   I like its proximity to Midway Gold Corp   AMEX MDW  Spring Valley project and  of course  the Barrick interest in Spring Valley helps  Barrick has invested  53 million   53M  into Spring Valley 
TGR  Do each of these companies have the capital to stay in business until the price of gold goes up MB  I have a 10 point Discovery grid  The factor the market is valuing most right now is sustainability  The No  2 factor is the quality of the asset and No  3 is the strength of management 
Pershing scores well on all three  I like its shareholder base  Dr  Phil Frost is a big shareholder in the company  The management team will have access to capital  I also like the asset  The Relief Canyon mine property already has three open pits on the property and a finished processing facility  It has a good chance of being successful 
Over at Terraco Gold  I really like CEO Todd Hilditch s view of the world  He saw this mining economy coming a long time ago  He acquired the royalties on Spring Valley  where Barrick has put more than  50M into development while showing significant gold reserves  That makes the royalty worth a lot more because I think Barrick  which has now earned in  will develop Spring Valley  So by waiting and focusing on the royalty play  Terraco management has been very shrewd 
Nulegacy is on the Cortez Trend  I like it because Roger Steininger is the COO  and he s done a great job of exploration  He s a brilliant guy  Barrick is the partner there and will probably take NuLegacy out eventually for a nice payoff 
TGR  Any other companies you think could benefit when precious metals prices take off 
MB  The final one I want to mention is US Precious Metals  USPR PK   Nobody knows about it  I just visited its property in the state of Michoac n  Mexico  which is on the Pacific Coast roughly parallel to Mexico City  It has a 37 000 acre property  I actually call it my  pregnant virgin  because the gold and copper systems are visible  but it has never been properly explored  The Spanish were there in the 1500s and 1600s and there were adits from the Spanish but no real production records  You can pick up copper float on the ground so it is definitely pregnant  It is a huge mineralized system  We just don t know how big it is yet  It s a  0 12 stock  I don t own it yet  but I will probably take a position in it at some point 
What s really interesting about U S  Precious Metals is that the management is using satellite generated  ground penetrating radar to identify the mineral composition of the anomalies  It also will be using a thermal process based on plasma torch for extracting the ore eventually 
TGR  Tell us about the processing  How will this new technology make the project more profitable MB  Just as hydraulic fracturing revolutionized the oil industry and may make us energy independent in the next 30 years  I think plasma arc processing  developed here in New Jersey at Princeton University by Dr  Edgar Choueiri  could revolutionize mining  Plasma arc will be used to propel satellites  It s the fourth state of matter  a state of ionized gas  This process increases the recovery of the ore significantly and with much less environmental impact  This is the most efficient way to separate minerals from waste  It could well be transformational for the mining industry  My understanding is that at present there is a pilot plant in operation at 29 Palms in California 
TGR  The other three companies that you mentioned were all in Nevada  a fairly safe jurisdiction  What are the risks of being in this part of Mexico MB  Whenever you talk about mining in Mexico  you worry about illegal activities  U S  Precious Metals has decided put together a security force mainly because there s a lot of gold that can just be panned from the dry riverbeds on this property in the Tierra Caliente region  So management has decided to provide its own security  But U S  Precious Metals and its associates are very close to the Mexican government  so I believe the risks are minimized  When I visited the property I saw a road being built to the property by the Mexican government 
Mexico is still a country that has to be mined in spite of the new 7 5  tax  A lot of good players are there  Coeur Mining Inc  CDE   Hecla Mining Company  HL   Endeavour Silver Corp   EXK   U S  Precious Metals is likely to become a big copper gold play with a silver byproduct  I think management has really done a good job of minimizing the risk with respect to the cartels and the exploration risk 
TGR  Is this a long term investment  When might the thesis for the processing and the thesis for the asset be proven MB  The plasma arc technology is proven  U S  Precious Metals is the first to license it for processing the ore  The company is not yet in mining operations  Its property contains 37 000 acres in one land position and only several hundred acres have been explored 
So it is early days at U S Precious Metals  but a good investment for those people who like early exploration plays on potentially world class assets  Let s face it  you do not find properties like this easily 
TGR  The silver market is more volatile than gold  What companies are worth looking at in that space MB  I love silver  I m on the board of a couple of companies that have big silver plays  But the silver market is volatile  it s a much smaller market and an industrial  as well as a precious metals  market  Gold is down 27   but silver is down almost 45  from its October 2012 top  We produce about 800 million ounces  800 Moz  year silver globally  and we basically use it all for everything from electronics to medical technology  The price can t stay at  20 oz for very long because new silver mines are going to be required  Tahoe Resources Inc  TAHO K  has a new mine down in Guatemala  which I think will be a very good producer  But you don t find new silver mines every day  So I m very bullish on silver 
Right now  I think you have to look at Coeur and Hecla as two companies that are self sustainable  generating cash  and are going to be around  I should point out Goldcorp itself produces a lot of silver from Pe asquito  So  it  too  has a significant upside as silver goes from its current  20 oz level to where it should be   50 oz  which would not surprise me in 2014 or 2015 
Then there are companies that are midtier  and I think they are probably takeout candidates eventually  First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG  would be one  It produced 11 Moz silver last year  It has five mines  and is an  11 stock  It will likely produce 12 Moz this year 
Then there is Endeavour Silver  It produced about 6 8 Moz silver last year  and it has three operating mines 
Silver investors must be believers today  They must live with the volatility of the market and believe the price of silver will appreciate eventually  If you believe in silver and you believe in the ultimate limited supply excess demand dynamic  then I think you ought to own a portfolio of these companies  put them away and let silver do its thing  because it will over time 
TGR  Would that same advice go for the other metals  MB  Not exactly  Copper is a totally different market  I like copper a lot  I m on the board of a company that has a big copper play  It is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to bring big mines on line  The Indonesians have done some things that hurt both Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc   NYSE FCX  by disallowing them to ship ore overseas  Freeport actually declared force majeure in Indonesia  The Chileans and other South Americans have had some problems  There are problems in Mongolia with Bhp Billiton  BBL  Ltd  s big copper facility there  That makes North American copper plays in Arizona  Nevada  Canada and  to a lesser degree  Mexico  a great place to be right now  Copper could go below  3 pound  but with the rest of the world growing a new middle class of consumers  we re going to need more copper and that means more copper mines  It takes a long time to bring a copper mine into production  so I think copper is also very cheap today and should be considered selectively 
TGR  So these are long term investments MB  Certainly  We are seeing a lot of private equity players now that are picking up properties for cents on the dollar  The private equity players can afford to sit with a property for two or three years until the commodity prices improve  Most junior mining management teams cannot do the same thing  Juniors are going to have to be able to survive over the next couple of years  so look for companies that can conserve resources  Some developers have stopped drilling  A few marginal producers have stopped producing  Everyone is  or should be  reining in costs  cutting costs  The Vancouver model of financing is broken right now  The capital market is telling us that nobody cares  If nobody cares  then it s time to tread carefully in the exploration space

17707,239222,FCX,Copper Is Pathological And Suffers From SAD  But It Has Value,opinion,"Dr  Copper may be in a supercycle  but there are serious problems  In this interview with The Gold Report  Salman Partners  Vice President of Commodity Economics Raymond Goldie explains why even though the base metal acts pathologically and has a bad case of seasonal affective disorder  these six equities are priced below their intrinsic value 
The Gold Report  You are giving a presentation at the  called Diagnosing the Doctor  which refers to assessing the supply and demand problems for Dr  Copper as a way to understand what is ailing all the mining products today  Are we in a supercycle  What is the meaning of a sustainable supercycle 
Ray Goldie  I suppose it s best to answer your second question first What is the meaning of a sustainable supercycle  because a lot of people use the word supercycle to describe the wonderful state that we had beginning in the early part of this century  when metal prices kept going up  commodity prices kept going up  seemingly forever  I m a little less restrictive on what I define as a supercycle  I think a supercycle is any period in which we have commodity prices higher than their long term average values  On that basis  even allowing for overall inflation  we ve been in a supercycle since 2004  We re still in it  although for a few months regrettably at the end of 2008 we popped out of it  But right now we are in a supercycle 
TGR  What are the fundamentals keeping us in your definition of a supercycle 
RG  The usual reason is China  It s the biggest consumer of most of the commodities in the world and has the biggest growth in consumption of most of the commodities in the world  But what that analysis tends to overlook is that production of most commodities in China has been increasing at roughly the same rate as consumption in China  So  on balance  China may not be as big a contributor to the supercycle as we ve imagined 
TGR  Does that mean that the Western world is playing a larger role in supporting the supercycle than we give it credit for 
RG  When it comes to assessing supply and demand from Asia  it is important to consider Chinese economic data  which a recent Bloomberg article equates to some of the meat served in low cost restaurants  We don t know where it comes from and don t really know what it means  It s not easy to put a lot of credence on Chinese economic numbers  so it s hard to tell the extent to which China does affect supply and demand 
But one thing that we can count on is the diligence of people who sit at borders with clipboards looking at stuff crossing borders  They are paid to make sure that the right duties get paid and the ships are carrying what they re supposed to be carrying  If we look at China s trade with the rest of the world  those numbers are fairly reliable  even if the numbers for what s going on inside China are not reliable  Since 2008  the dark days when the world seemed to have ended  China s imports of copper from the rest of the world have grown 41  per annum 
TGR  And what about the supply side 
RG  I think the single most important reason that we re in a sustainable supercycle is that we haven t invested enough in finding more resources  The supply side constraints are probably why prices are higher than the long term trend in prices 
TGR  Why has it been so difficult to predict how much copper will be produced in a given year if it takes so long to bring a mine to production 
RG  Since about 2003 analysts have consistently overestimated the production of copper  My theory for the consistent shortfall is that before 2003  when strikes  landslides  earthquakes  storms  civil unrest  late trains and the like slowed down production  someone in the head office would send a cable calling for the mining of high grade ore to make up the difference  But since 2003  there hasn t been any high grade ore to mine because of a lack of investment in new resources  And this happens year after year  About 7  less copper is produced each year than the mines predicted at the start of the year 
TGR  So why isn t that inconsistency causing the price to go up 
RG  Maybe it is  There has certainly been what I ve called a pathological situation in the copper markets because typically the relationship between copper inventories the stuff that s sitting around in warehouses and prices is that the lower the inventories  the higher the price  But since 2005  in the Western world we don t know what s going on in China inventories have gone up 185   Typically  that would mean prices go down  right  But  no  prices have gone up 95   That may be one of the reasons that we re consistently producing less of the stuff than we thought we could 
TGR  You have said that the pitch point  curve  for supply and demand compared to prices is pathological  Is that because of the role of recycling in meeting some of the demand 
RG  I think it could be because it used to be that every pound that was in inventory was backed by all the copper that the mines would produce and all the copper that scrap yards would produce  The amount that the scrap yards produce has been declining  in large part because Asians have been very diligent about taking scrap from North America and refining it into good usable copper again  But  again  it s hard to get good figures for how much copper there is in scrap yards so that answer is probably yes  the declining use of copper in recycling is probably one of the reasons why we ve seen prices go up even though inventories have also gone up  But it s hard to be more precise than that 
TGR  You have also said that copper has seasonal affective disorder  SAD   What causes that 
RG  That s right  it does  I can tell you what SAD is  but I can t tell you exactly what causes it  In the good old days of the London Metal Exchange  LME   the saying was  sell in May and go away   And that was always a wonderful excuse to take an English summer holiday and not bother coming back to trade copper until September or October  Now  the peak seems to be around the end of February and the end of June tends to be the bottom in copper prices  It s pretty consistent  Year after year we see that effect  but what causes it  I don t know 
TGR  Because copper is so important for growth  is it feasible that it could be used as the world reserve currency instead of gold or the dollar  What would that look like 
RG  Copper is being used as a reserve currency in China right now  Some of the importers will use the copper that they hold as collateral for loans that they make from various banks in China  One of the advantages of copper as collateral is that unlike wheat  silver or potash  you can store it outside  Even in the rain  copper will keep its value  and there s always a use for the stuff 
But to talk about copper as a reserve currency for the whole world is not practical  If a country is holding reserves of  1 trillion  it would have to have 150 million tons on reserve  That is about eight and a half years of copper consumption just sitting there  But certainly copper is being used as a currency on a small scale  as it s being used now in China 
TGR  What prices are you using for copper going forward in the rest of 2014 
RG  Since 2003 when the fundamentals of the copper business changed so significantly  the forward prices on the LME have been a much better forecaster of copper prices than we analysts  This afternoon  the LME is telling me that if I buy copper now for delivery in 10 years  I would have to pay  3 02 pound   3 02 lb   That s as good as any forecast I have for the long term price of copper  If you were to buy a pound of copper for delivery tomorrow  it s pretty much the same as where the price of copper is today 
TGR  If copper prices look to be fairly flat going forward  why do copper equities tend to outperform the metal 
RG  This gets back to the unwieldy nature of copper as a store of value  Let s say you were thinking of retiring and decided to make off with all of your fortune  say  3 million   3M   and drive away into the sunset  Now  if you put that in the form of gold   3M would weigh less than 200 lb  it would fit in the trunk of your car  But  3M worth of copper would weigh 450 tons  That is why when people get enthusiastic about buying gold  they often buy gold bullion  But when they re thinking of buying copper  the unwieldy nature of buying copper metal means they are better off with the equities  That s why the equities have done about the same or even a little better than the price of copper itself  That certainly has not been the case with gold 
TGR  Are the copper companies less risky than some of the gold companies 
RG  Riskiness is a feature of the things that Mother Nature can fling at us or the surprises that come with the election of a government that no one expected and that government nationalizes some of its assets  Most of the companies that I follow are managed by a lot of gray hairs  they ve seen all the unpleasant things that can happen  Most of the ones that I tend to look at are well managed  and they include the big producers  like Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   NYSE FCX   whose biggest growth comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo  where there are political risks  but Freeport is skilled enough and experienced enough in operating in parts of the world where there is high political risk that it has so far been able to stave off most political concerns 
Another company that has also done well in that part of the world is First Quantum Minerals Ltd   FM TO    FQM LSE   a Canadian company that just bought Inmet Mining Corp  and  through its acquisition of Inmet  is building a new copper mine in Panama  Of the companies I cover  First Quantum stands out for being relatively low risk and high return 
TGR  Does First Quantum s acquisition make it stronger because it is diversified 
RG  Certainly  it s diversifying geographically  Before the acquisition most of its assets were in Zambia  which has been a good address for a mine  but that may not always be the case  Having assets in Panama  Finland and Turkey is not a bad idea 
TGR  What about some smaller companies that you cover in the copper space 
RG  It s pretty hard to find a small copper producer  The only one I cover is Amerigo Resources Ltd   ARG TO   It operates a  mine  in one of the best addresses in the world for a copper mine  and that s Chile  But instead of mining the stuff  it processes the tailings from one of the world s biggest copper mines  El Teniente  It is profitable and it is expanding its operations 
TGR  Do you evaluate a company in the tailing business very differently than a company like First Quantum 
RG  I don t actually  I generally use the standard textbook discounted cash flow valuation method  For a mine in production  like Amerigo s operations  I use a low discount rate  For potential expansion  I use a higher discount rate because this is an unproven technology there  For First Quantum  the same thing  For First Quantum s existing operations  I use a lower discount rate than for valuing the operations that it hopes to bring onstream in a few years in Panama or Zambia  I use an even higher discount rate on something that isn t in production yet  simply because of the technological  political and community risks associated with that prospect 
TGR  Do you follow any explorers 
RG  The explorers I cover are NovaCopper Inc   NCQ TO    AMEX NCQ   Curis Resources Ltd   CUV TO    PCCRF PK  and Nautilus Minerals Inc   NUS TO  
NovaCopper is a company that has one of the world s highest grade copper deposits  but it s in a part of Alaska that requires a road to be built  Until that road is built  probably around 2021  the mine is going to sit there  So the risk in that case  even though it s in the U S   is a political risk 
TGR  Does NovaCopper s resource make the risk worthwhile 
RG  I assume that it s not until about 2025 when it comes into production  and I discount that back to the present  Every year you discount it  you make it worth a little less or you value it at a little less  If NovaCopper were in production today  it might be worth  10 share  but because it s so far in the future  I think it s worth about  5 share  The company is trading under  2 share  so there is upside 
TGR  What about the risk reward story for Curis  It is in the U S  as well  a fairly safe jurisdiction 
RG  Curis is also a political risk story  The company hopes to use a fairly new method of extracting copper  which is pumping fluids into the ground  dissolving the copper and bringing it up to the surface  No shovels and excavators required  It looks like an oil well field  It surrounds the town of Florence  Arizona  which does not allow mining  but the half of the deposit surrounding the town has state approval 
Curis has been waiting more than a year and a half for the federal Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  approval  I don t know how long it s going to take for the EPA to act  but when it does give its comment  it is likely to be approval  One of the lessons I have learned is that if any mining company tells you it thinks the government will approve its project in such and such a time  you can usually be confident in adding another year  Companies always tend to underestimate how long it takes governments to get around to doing anything 
TGR  How about the risk and reward for the last one you mentioned  Nautilus 
RG  That s another government story  It s also a new technology story  It s the most exciting and interesting of all the companies I cover because it has identified high grade copper  zinc  gold and silver bearing deposits right at the surface of the sea floor a couple of miles under the ocean off Papua New Guinea  It has just completed the first of the three machines it needs to dig the stuff up from the sea floor  The government has a legal dispute with the company  which hasn t been resolved yet  So there are both technological and political risks  And it also is a cheap stock 
TGR  What s the timeline on these  Are these all long term investments 
RG  NovaCopper could be up and running by 2025  Amerigo is in production right now with expansion dependent on government approval  Once that has happened  it is probably two or three years before that comes into production  Once Curis gets EPA approval  it should be in production in about 18 months  First Quantum s Panama project should be in production around 2016  Nautilus is two or three years away from production once it resolves its differences with the government 
TGR  With all of these great ideas  what advice do you have for resource investors who are looking to keep their portfolios healthy during the next two or three years while they wait for some of these things to happen 
RG  There are two questions that investors should ask about any investment they make  Is the value there  When should I seize on that value  Most copper mining stocks are trading as if the price of copper were  2 lb and is going to be about  2 lb forever  But copper on the LME 10 years out is actually  3 lb  That means the equities are definitely a value story  As to when to buy it  given the SAD cycle we mentioned earlier  investors might want to wait until the end of June 
TGR  Thank you for your advice 
RG  Thank you

17745,239260,FCX,Sector Leadership Changing  Rotation Current S P 500 Theme,opinion,The forward 4 quarter earnings estimate for the S P 500 took a hit this past week  dropping to  114 01 from last week s  115 04  according to the ThomsonReuters  This Week in Earnings  data  which is a harsher than normal decline The P E ratio on the forward estimate is now 13 9 x   while the earnings yield for the S P 500 is currently 7 21  The year over year growth of the forward estimate has now slowed to 3 75   so the yellow light in terms of the slowing growth of the forward estimate is now blinking yellow  and has slowed more than we thought it would The S P 500 rose 1 74  this past week  led by Homebuilders  6   Metals and Mining  3   Financials  2 5  and Industrials  2 10  Consumer Staples fell 0 29   after their scorching hot run  and Healthcare also slid  0 15   as these two sectors look very extended If there is one theme that seems prevalent through three weeks of earnings season  it is to sell what has been strong into earnings  and buy what has been weak  Note the action in Caterpillar  CAT    Freeport  FCX   Intel  INTC  and Microsoft  MSFT   versus such Consumer Staples as Procter   Gamble  PG   Large cap Pharma  Amgen  AMGN  and other previous leaders   Long all   added some PG  and CAT this week  post earnings  Stat of the week Per Bespoke s data  here is the   of each sector s stocks selling above their respective 50 day moving average as of Thursday night  along with the sector s P E ratio Consumer Discretionary  88   19 7 x Consumer Staples  93   18 4 x Energy  35   12 5 x Financials  81   13 5 x HealthCare  75  16 x Industrials  52   15 x Materials  53  16 8 x Technology  56  15 x Utilities  100   17 5 x Telco  100   22 x Two things struck me about this data  given the forward P E ratio for the S P 500 is 13 9 x   see the second sentence in the opening paragraph   only two sectors listed above  currently have lower P E ratio s than the S P 500  and those sectors are Energy and Financials  The second thing that struck me was that Utilities and Telecom are remarkably overbought and expensive as sectors  although both sectors have been market leaders year to date Technology surprises me with its 15 x  P E ratio  given how cheap Apple  AAPL  is  as well as Intel  INTC  and Microsoft  MSFT   You can buy all 3 of these market cap giants for less than 10 x  earnings  and well under 10 x  cash flow   Long all 3 names We are looking to hold steady on our Consumer Staples  and Healthcare weightings  with no exposure to Telco and Utilities currently as these 4 sectors are very overbought We would be looking to add to Consumer Discretionary  Financials  Industrials   maybe  Basic Materials and Technology as these sectors are oversold  Energy has the least number of oversold stocks  with the most reasonable sector P E ratio We remain very partial to Financials  which has been the ONLY sector within the S P 500 that has seen steady to slightly higher estimate revisions the last 6 months  per the ThomsonReuters data  We added the Financial Select SPDR ETF  XLF  and Schwab  SCHW  this past week in client accounts  The challenge in financials today is finding oversold stocks   there just aren t a lot to be had at lower risk buy points  as evidenced by the above stat with 81  of the sector trading above their 50 day MAs Three of the large cap tech leaders off the  09 lows have been Apple  AAPL   IBM  IBM   and Amazon  AMZN   Apple and IBM started to fade last fall just as Financials started to outperform  Amazon is now flat for 2012 and underperforming for the year  S P 500 leadership is changing   Long all 3 names  Many heart felt thank you s to guys like Jeff Miller of  A Dash of Insight   Jon Najarian of OptionMonster com  Gary Morrow of Yosemite Asset Management  a great technician  Todd Harrison  Jim Cramer  Scott Rothbort  Cody Willard  and Drexel Hamilton  a wonderful brokerage firm with a great mission of hiring disabled American vets  and able bodied veterans  who have given a substantial part of their lives serving our country  Dr  Mark Schoenebaum  the ISI bioetch and large cap pharma analyst for his great calls on the sector  not to mention all the great ISI research material  When you are a small shop as we are  you appreciate all the help you can get  Also  I have to give a shout out to clients  many of whom have stayed with me through 12   13 tough years  suffering through two brutal bear markets Gratitude is not often a quality found in abundance on Wall Street  but as is so often the case  somebody at some point gives you an opportunity  Opportunity is THE best gift you can get in life  and it is up to you what you do with it  and if you f k it up  well  that is your problem Is the S P 500 seeing a triple top  with the March  2000 peak at 1 555  the October  2007 peak at 1 576  and the recent peak at 1 597  Could be  but I think any pullback is going to be well contained  given that so many are expecting a correction similar to what we saw in 2010  2011  and 2012 this year  Given the bearish sentiment  I think we take out the recent highs and head through 1 600 in the not too distant future  The forward estimate on the S P 500 does worry me  but the sector rotation in the market is pushing the S P 500 forward even as it seems disaster is just around the corner What has changed since the market bottom in early October  2011 1   Housing has bottomed  auto sales continue to improve  and both have led the US economy out of every post WW II recession  albeit the recovery is much slower and subdued this post recession 2   Japan is in a full blown recovery  since last summer  Japan is the world s 3rd largest economy  so don t discount what is happening over there  The yen has temporarily stalled at 100  but give it time  I believe it will continue to weaken 3   The recovery in the US banking and financial system continues apace  The banks are well capitalized and credit losses have fallen dramatically  releasing reserves from the balance sheets  Eventually the Dodd Frank fiasco will fade and despite the current  Too Big to Fail  legislation getting pushed through Washington right now  the financial system will exit this near collapse and once in a century seizure in far better financial shape  with better  smarter managements  and better incentives  like claw backs  that at least tempers the  blind leading the blind  mentality that exists in the sector  A stronger banking system means more loan growth and credit availability 4   Despite the headlines  I think Europe is now stable  at least the sovereign credit spreads have improved to the point where the EU can take a breath  and think that the first stage of the crisis is over   That is not a widely held opinion  5   High yield credit spreads are continuing to hold firm or even improve  Bespoke noted on Thursday that the average spread was now 466 bps over Treasuries  Credit is still cheaper to Treasuries per Norm Conley of JA Glynn out of St  Louis 6   It has been 9 months since the Treasury yield has made a new low yield  bottoming at 1 39  on July 30th  2012 Food for thought Moody s is spending time talking loan covenant quality during this recovery and preparing analysts   investors for the inevitable downdraft in the corporate bond market when it does come  They are noting the erosion in covenant quality currently  which given the issuance volume is not surprising  That happens during this part of the cycle Two oversold names we added to this past week were Caterpillar  CAT  and FedEx Corporation  FDX   Both cheap  both very oversold We made a good call on Coach s  COH  earnings release this week  Still long most of the names  Sold some small amounts just to lock in the gain Thanks for reading and stopping by  This is still a hated market  and Treasuries have rallied to 1 66  on the 10 year  in terms of the yield  but with all the pessimism still out there  it is hard to believe the stock market doesn t work higher  One element to the market that has surprised me is the continued strength in retail  In the last year  Coach  COH   Tiffany s  TIF   UnderArmour  UA   Abercrombie   Fitch  ABF  and Bed Bath and Beyond  BBBY  have all sold off sharply on bad fundamentals news and then righted the ship in a few quarters  only to see the stocks pop again  We ve made good money for clients trading COH  ABF  BBBY  etc  Retailers report en masse in May  so it could help S P 500 earnings  particularly Wal Mart  WMT   Home Depot  HD   etc   Long COH  WMT  HD  Friday s payroll report is expected to show 160 000 jobs created in April per Barron s  That would be almost double last month s numbers and in line with what jobless claims are telling us should be job creation  I usually defer to Jeff Miller for his economic commentary and detail on reconciling jobless claims with the monthly Labor Department reports  This week s articles from him talk about that flash crash we had this week on the phony AP headlines  and the use of stops ,2013-04-29,Brian

17747,239262,FCX,Markets Jump After The Jobs Report  ,opinion,This morning  the S P 500 Index e mini futures  ES M3  are trading higher by 12 00 points to  1604 25 per contract  It seems that the non farm payroll report that was released by the U S  government is the catalyst for the rally in the stocks  Economists had expected just 140 000 new jobs in the month of April  however  the U S  Labor Department reported 165 000 new jobs which was better than expected  The whisper number by economists was much lower around 110 000 new jobs so you can see why the stocks futures are soaring before the opening bell  The U S  Dollar Index futures  DX M3  are also rallying sharply higher on the back of this job news  A stronger dollar has certainly affected many of the leading commodities  Today  equities such as the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD   and the iShares Silver Trust  SLV  are trading lower ahead of the opening bell  Usually  many of the leading industrial metal stocks will decline when the U S  Dollar Index is stronger  but that may not happen today since the Chinese market was strong last night  Leading stocks such as Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  FCX   and Southern Copper Corp  SCCO  will often follow the Chinese stock market  Shanghai Index  very closely Below you may find the video ,2013-05-03,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-jump-after-the-jobs-report-165621,165621

17763,239278,FCX,Bulls Resist Giving Up Any Ground,opinion,Earnings reports on Wednesday from big banks like Goldman Sachs  GS  and JPMorgan Chase  JPM  were encouraging  And Apple  AAPL  got a much needed boost from the top tech analysts  However  Goldman s analysts tried to throw a wet blanket on the markets earlier this week with their expectation that earnings reports overall this year would be  uninspiring  and that equity returns this year likely will be only in the single digits  But I take that as something of a contrarian indicator On a forward basis  the S P 500 forward P E is only about 13  whereas the historical P E average is around 15 5  which suggests that investors are skeptical that earnings expectations will be met  Many of the biggest companies like Apple  Cisco  CSCO   and Freeport McMoRan  FCX  have forward P Es below 10 This pervasive pessimism in the face of a climbing market is historically bullish  And in my book  U S  equities still look well positioned for 2013  despite the potential for volatility around the Federal budget and debt ceiling debates  I still see reasonable stock valuations  record corporate earnings  high levels of cash in corporate coffers  and an accommodative Fed The wild card continues to be the future of debt and spending in this country  The Administration  Senate  and House have all vowed to give no ground  Yes  the amazing hypocrisy of our elected officials is in full plumage now  For example  back in 2003  Democrats bitterly opposed the Bush era tax cuts  but this year they bitterly fought to protect the Bush era tax cuts  except for the  rich   of course   And back in 2006 when President Obama was but a junior senator  he railed against the idea of mortgaging our future by raising the debt ceiling  but of course now that he is in charge  he has continually pushed to raise the debt ceiling so as to perpetuate runaway entitlements  with no regard to the longer term consequences  But Republicans are no better  they adamantly supported raising the debt ceiling when Bush was president Looking beyond our shores  emerging markets also appear strong  Take a look at markets in Malaysia or Turkey or Mexico  But Ian Bremmer  president of political risk firm Eurasia Group  said this week that emerging markets will be particularly risky this year as the level of political instability is  underpriced   especially in China  Some market observers are saying that Europe looks the best of all markets  with ultra low valuations  ECB President Mario Draghi said last week that eurozone financial markets have stabilized  with bond spreads tightening against German Bunds  To paraphrase Mark Twain  it turns out the reports of Europe s death were greatly exaggerated The Sabrient  Baker s Dozen  Top Stocks list for 2013 was released on January 11  In addition  a Unit Investment Trust for the same 13 high potential GARP stocks the Sabrient Baker s Dozen 2013  issued by First Trust Portfolios L P  was launched  Last year s portfolio gained an astounding  43   and in fact each of the past four annual portfolios has crushed the market since inception in January 2009  This year s portfolio is already off to a fine start  led by our top pick Genworth Financial  GNW   which was up nearly 9  on Wednesday alone You might already know that Sabrient is an index provider for a variety of ETFs  including Guggenheim Defensive Equity  DEF   Guggenheim Insider Sentiment  NFO   Direxion Multi Cap Insider Sentiment  KNOW   iShares Balanced Income CorePortfolio  CBD TO   and iShares Balanced Growth CorePortfolio  CBN TO   So  I like to follow the ETF money flows  Last week   22 billion flowed into equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds  ETF   which was the most since September of 2007  Nicolas Colas of ConvergEx thinks inflows could reach  200 billion in 2013  according to IndexUniverse  Moreover  IU reports that more than half of all U S  listed ETFs hold less than  100M AUM  and most of those hold less than  25M  So  although we will continue to see ETF closings and consolidations of the smaller and more thinly traded funds  the future is bright for ETFs The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 147 05 as it consolidates a quick burst within this band of strong triple top resistance between 146 and 148  Buyers have been coming in on every intraday dip as the bulls recruit support to continue their gradual assault on the highs  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic remain quite overbought as bulls refuse to give up much ground  so perhaps a partial retracement of the breakaway gap from January 2 will come The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 13 42 after making a new 52 week low intraday  The mixed message remains that fear is low  which is bullish for stocks  but an overdue bounce would send stocks lower  at least temporarily Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Healthcare  IYH  has taken back the top spot with a score of 81  while Technology  IYW  has fallen into a tie with Consumer Goods  IYK   each with an Outlook score of 77  IYH shows relatively good support among analysts and solid return ratios  while Technology  IYW  shows strong projected growth and a low forward P E  as well as solid return ratios  Consumer Goods  IYK  shows the most analyst support and strong return ratios  Notably  in fourth place is Basic Materials  IYM  as the analysts are gradually coming back in support of the sector and its forward P E is looking pretty good 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 10  and is again joined in the bottom two this week by Consumer Services  IYC  with a 23  Stocks within IYZ appear overvalued from the standpoint of the forward P E and lack analyst support 3  This week s rankings are mostly neutral  given the high scores for defensive sectors Healthcare and Consumer Goods  but with strength in Tech  Materials  and Industrial  which all score above 50  The bullish trend that seemed to get started last week from the prior defensive rankings has kind of stalled at this point 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Technology  IYW  is the leader on strong market days  scoring 60  Utilities  IDU  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 40  In other words  Tech stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  none of the sectors are scoring very high  In fact  none score above 50  Utilities  IDU  is normally the favorite safe haven on weak market days  but it s only scoring 45  which indicates that most everything is selling off equally during recent market weakness  Amazingly  Basic Materials  IYM   which is normally among the worst on weak days  is scoring the highest at 49  Energy  IYE  is the worst during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 37  but there s only a 12 point range from top to bottom  Thus  Energy stocks have been selling off the most when the market is pulling back  while Materials stocks have held up the best  relatively speaking 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 179  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 107  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare  IYH   although displaying the best Outlook score  doesn t look very good at all with a total score of only 90  Utilities  IDU  is the lowest at 85  Basic Materials  IYM  has the best score at 105 These scores represent the view that the Healthcare and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Consumer Services sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYH and IYW include DaVita HealthCare Partners  DVA   The Cooper Companies  COO   Cognizant Technology Solutions  CTSH   and Gartner Inc  IT   Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look   Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions   Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors   About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-01-17,Scott

17765,239280,FCX,Does Freeport McMoRan s Energy Acquisition Make It More Attractive ,opinion,Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc  FCX  explores and mines mineral resources  primarily Copper  Gold and Molybdenum  Recently  the company has made moves to enter the energy market by acquiring Plains Exploration and Production Company and McMoran Exploration Company for  20 B combined  which gives it access to high quality US Oil and Natural Gas reserves  This move is significant as the latest projections from the International Energy Agency projects that the  and will become a net exporter of oil by 2030  Clearly  the company  like so many others in the energy sector  is jostling to carve out its market in the ever growing domestic oil production in the US  Therefore  it is logical to review Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold in terms of current valuation as well as the potential future improvements in its top and bottom line with these acquisitions  The Current Valuation At the time of writing  FCX traded at  34 51 share  which values the company at  32 75 B in the market  With  3 13 in trailing twelve months earnings per share  the PE ratio is 11 03  This compares favorably to Southern Copper  another major copper producer that is valued at 17 44 times earnings  However  the companies differ in key metrics like profitability and efficiency  so a vanilla P E comparison is not always appropriate  One quick check I do when looking at the current operations and its profitability of an asset heavy company is to compare the earnings yield of the stock to the returns the company is generating on its equity  For FCX  the ROE  ttm  is 20 11   The shares are also priced at 1 95x tangible book value so investors should get 20 11 1 95   10 31  return on the equity they hold per share  However  the earnings yield of the stock is 9 1   inverse of P E ratio   therefore the shares appear to be fairly valued to mildly overvalued  Here  I am using ROE as a proxy for expected growth rate since the growth projections are generally unreliable  while the return on equity is a measure of how well the company uses its assets and capital and gives us a better understanding of the management effectiveness at growing the company from its current base  This way you can also simplify analysis in industries where revenues and earnings are bought and sold more frequently in terms of mergers and acquisitions  as you would generally expect the management to make transactions that are in line with their internal hurdle rate  This is not perfect  of course  but unless something else stands out causing me to go much deeper in the financials  it is a good proxy for valuation  It also does not account for any future price increases in the underlying commodities  which could potentially improve the margins and returns  Give me a 15  20  discount to the current share price and I will be interested in buying the stock today  all other things being equal  but they are not  as we will find out   However  investor optimism can be justified in situations where the assets themselves can be expected to be revalued higher  either because the current book valuations are below the market  or is more likely the case for FCX  commodity prices for copper  gold and now oil gas are expected to increase at better than the rate of inflation  making their productive assets more valuable  The Energy Acquisitions and Future for the Shareholders FCX is acquiring the following two companies in the energy sector Plains Exploration and Production Company  PXP  for a total cost of  6 9 B  This values the company at 2 1 times book value and buys an operation returning 5 91  on equity  They are clearly overpaying McMoran Exploration Company  MMR  for a total valuation of  3 4 B   2 1 B in cash net of 36  they already own   This values the company at 3 85 times book value and MMR is currently unprofitable  having lost money in 3 of the last 3 fiscal years and 3 of the last 4 fiscal quarters  Also  PXP and FCX jointly owned 36  of MMR prior to the acquisition with MMR sharing some board members and executives with FCX They are also assuming  10 6 Billion in debt as part of the acquisition  In short  the company is overpaying for the acquisitions  It is likely that this consolidation will result in more efficient management and better utilization of assets  but it is not clear how much benefit it will produce for the shareholders  One of the strategic advantage is securing a long term low cost supply of natural gas for their mining operations  The company does expect the acquisitions to self fund using the cash flows After the acquisitions are closed  the company expects oil and gas to be 26  of its EBITDA  This is a significant amount and short term dynamics of the oil prices may be favorable  Global demand growth of 30  40  is expected by 2035  However  US production is expected to grow 23  by 2014 and will accelerate and even with production growth in the rest of the world staying moderate  it is likely that we may see oil prices declining before the decade is out  There is a short window for the combined company to generate growing excess cash flows to compensate for the excess valuation  The company also estimates the demand for Copper growing at 60  by 2025  which should help  If this was not enough  FCX will also issue 91 million new shares to close the PXP acquisition  sometime in 2Q 2013  This is a little less than 10  of the current shares outstanding and will dilute the existing shareholders  The additional  10 6 B in assumed debt  at say 1  rate of interest will cost the company an additional  100 m in cash for interest payments plus any principal payments they make  This is not enough to cause undue concern for a company that expects to generate  12 B in EBITDA and  9B in combined cash flows  and FCX is likely to delever quickly similar to the way they did with their Phelps Dodge acquisition  In short  the stock today does not offer compelling value and I am not confident that the foray in the energy sector is going to be a game changer for FCX  They might of course make other

17769,239284,FCX,Copper Rally Continues To Give A Buy Signal For These Two Stocks,opinion,Copper continues to play an important role in the world as its superior electrical conductivity  corrosion resistance  structural capability  efficient heat transfer and aesthetics make it a popular ingredient of many industrial products  This popularity has led to multitude of multinationals being involved in the mining of the metal with the two of most well known copper miners being Freeport McMoRan  FCX  and Southern Copper  SCCO   First mined by man more than 10 000 years ago  copper today is one of the most common and versatile metals in use around the world  It is an internationally traded commodity  and its price is effectively determined by the major metals exchanges  the London Metal Exchange  the New York Commodity Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange  Prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand  but from time to time  they are also influenced significantly by investment flows and currency exchange rates  Copper prices have rallied over the past 3 months  rising from about  3 45 lb to about  3 70 lb at today s prices  The rally is expected to continue as the economic data from some of the world s biggest economies continues to improve  Copper is found in many places in the world  but Chile is a notable hotbed for Copper  Chile is not only the largest copper producer in the world  but also the country with the  of the red metal  reveals the latest commodity report by the U S  Geological Survey  According to the agency  Chile has 28  of the world reserves  more than twice the reserves of its neighbor  Peru  the No  2 global copper producer  It means that the South American country has reserves of 190 000 million tons of copper   26  more than it was thought  150 000 million tons    which guarantees copper extraction for the next 100 years  at the current extraction rate  The economic data has been the big driver behind copper gains  and here is an overview  The news from China has been positive  China s economy grew by 7 9  year over year in the fourth quarter  up from 7 4  in the third quarter  The news provided   who feared that the world s second largest economy may have continued to slow after growing at the weakest pace in three years in Q3  Instead  it seems as if China s growth may have stabilized above the official government target of 7 5    a positive outcome  Analysts have also come out positive on the metal   recently said that the economic recovery and growth should push prices up   Copper is one of those metals that people feel is linked to the industrial cycle   said Carole Ferguson  an analyst at SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP  a broker and adviser in London   Demand is obviously returning  we ve had good numbers coming out of China and the U S  definitely looks as if it s in a recovery trend   HSBC raised its   saying it expects positive sentiment to drive prices for the metal in a structurally balanced market  The bank lifted its 2013 forecast for the average cash copper price to  8 000 per ton from  7 500  London s copper metric  to reflect the metal s relatively good start to the year   Copper  perennially described as fundamentally tight  actually finished 2012 posting a gain in inventories   analyst Andrew Keen said in a note to clients   This market remains balanced in our view  and this is enough to keep prices high when sentiment is good   With that said  the copper sentiment is positive  and should continue to be so  As a result below are two great stocks to own to play off this copper rally  HudBay Minerals  HBM  is a Canadian integrated mining company with operations  development properties and exploration activities across the Americas principally focused on the discovery  reduction and marketing of base and precious metals  The company s objective is to create sustainable value through increased commodity exposure on a per share basis by growing long life deposits in high quality and mining friendly jurisdictions  HudBay is a strong stock with great analyst coverage  Of the five analysts currently covering HBM  all five have buy ratings or higher Copper is an industrial metal and therefore  it is very sensitive to economic cycles  Copper has a variety of uses  and it is a key component of every day life  from the coins in our pockets to the powerlines that provide us with electricity  Furthermore  its extensive use in  green  technologies  such as solar cells and electric vehicles  ensures that copper will continue to play a key role in our sustainable future  Copper is conductive  durable  malleable  and eminently recyclable  making it one of the world s most useful natural resources There have been some worries surrounding copper because of the short term macroeconomic concerns regarding the US and Europe  However  the fundamentals are still excellent for copper  as Asia represents over 60  of world demand with China by itself at 39  and could reach 45  in 5 years  Southern Copper forecasts that China and Emerging Markets countries will continue growing  albeit at a lesser pace  but still showing substantial gains  The company also notes that limited production upside and falling grades will result in a deficit copper market going forward Two weeks ago  China s neighbor  Japan  also reported positive economic news  Japan raised its expectations for the economy for the first time in eight months  as private consumption held firm and business sentiment improved in a sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s policy of easy money and big spending had begun taking effect   The economy is weak  but signs of bottoming out can be seen in some areas   the report said  That was an improvement from last month  when the government said the outlook was weakening because of a slowdown in overseas economies  HBM has performed substantially well the past three months with shares rising over 26  HBM is a quieter and smaller copper name  but nonetheless  is an interesting one to take a look at with the growth projections  HBM expects its copper production to increase 390  between now and 2015  with a 115  increase in precious metals production and 30  growth in zinc over the same time period  which are some pretty hefty growth figures  There also is significant downside protection built in with its balance sheet containing  1 4 billion of cash Swingplane Ventures  SWVI OB  is one company involved in copper one of the newer entrants in the space  Already though  the company is generating a buzz as can be seen by the stock chart The company owns one major property  the Algarrobo Property that is located in Chile  The mineralized trends for the mine are very well defined at surface through abundant workings  both historical and from more recent work  The workings range from shallow pits and near surface workings to more extensive mine development extending up to 450m below surface Swingplan Ventures has seen some analysts pick up as one research firm just issued a  10 target price on Swingplane Ventures  The firm said that a due diligence property evaluation suggests there is a significant opportunity to further develop the mineral potential of the property and dramatically increase the current level of production  The company intends to evaluate potential to  1  increase the current level of production and 2  undertake construction of a processing facility to maximize recovery of economic grades of copper concentrate Notably  in early January  First Quantum Minerals  a  9 billion mining company  made an offer of  5 1 billion to purchase Inmet Mining which holds a very coveted copper mine in Panama  Inmet Mining  a company with a prized copper mine has almost doubled in market valuation this past year alone  Swingplane Ventures operates in the copper market in Chile  located in South America  This part of the world has been proven to possess extremely profitable copper mines as seen by First Quantum s offer for Inmet  After further due diligence and research  we are upgrading the stock to  11 50 with a possibly buyout looming Now  we take a closer look into a recent news item for the metal signifying of some larger trends  The fundamentals for copper are clearly improving as the world s copper usage and demand for copper is picking up  Friday  was a prime example of that as copper futures rose the most in a week as China s trade expanded more than forecast  and car sales jumped to a record in the Asian nation  the world s biggest consumer of industrial metals  In January  exports from China surged 25  and imports climbed 29  from a year earlier  both topping projections by economists in Bloomberg surveys  government data showed today  Sales of passenger vehicles surged 49   a state backed trade group said  A 6 month price chart of copper follows Recent news for Swingplane included the President s discussion of the property  The Algarrobo Property is located approximately 850 km north of Santiago  in the III Region  Province of Copiapo  Chile  The city of Copiapo is located approximately 43 km to the southeast of the Property  with the small port city of Caldera 25 km to the east  The Property consists of 32 tenures  comprising a total of 6 161 hectares The current limited artisanal workings are now producing 9  copper ore on 10 acres  The 3 current veins that are being worked on have been trenched and sampled and shown to be over 6 km in length  From existing information on adjacent mines ie  the Viuda Mine  which is 250 meters in depth  the evidence suggests that the company has the same formation Knowing that we are not the only ones bullish on the metal has given us more confidence in our own thesis  This fact was demonstrated this week when Kevin Puil  the Malcolm Gissen   Associates portfolio manager  went through his bullish thesis on Seeking Alpha  Puil said  The fundamentals for copper remain highly favorable and I continue to see secular demand for most commodities  copper in particular  Industrialization and urbanization  especially in the BRIC  Brazil  Russia  India  China  countries  is not about to stop  and this continues to put pressure on copper miners  who struggle to keep up with demand  Supply growth has slowed due to lower grades  higher costs and political unrest  In addition  the new projects and mine expansions that were scheduled to come on line haven t materialized  and if they do  it will not be in a timely fashion  Quite frankly  I think you could see copper peak above  4 a pound   4 lb  this year  The decline in output that Puil discussed is already being seen in the financial markets as Teck Resources  TCK   Canada s largest diversified miner  may consider acquisitions in copper mining to help offset an expected decline in the company s output of the metal  Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay said   Copper is a priority for us with declining production for the next couple of years   Lindsay said on a conference call to discuss the company s fourth quarter results   Something that might fill the gap would be of interest to us  Based on size and time on the market  Swingplace Ventures most closely compares to HBM  which rose to  7 a share in its first year on the market ,2013-02-21,Stocks on Wall Street,https://www.investing.com/analysis/copper-rally-continues-to-give-a-buy-signal-for-these-two-stocks-156137,156137
17770,239285,FCX,Spotting The Miners That Can Survive The Long Capital Drought,opinion,In order to make wise investment decisions  gold investors must coldly assess economic realities  says Eric Coffin  As the publisher of Hard Rock Analyst Advisories  Coffin tracks a range of gold explorers with the bling to weather the long capital drought  He has figured out how to separate the winners from the losers and  in this interview with The Gold Report  he shares the names of some strong ventures   The Gold Report  In your January Hard Rock Analyst Journal  you remarked that 2012  sucked  for precious metal investors  What happened   Eric Coffin  Last year was a very difficult time for junior gold miners to raise funds and there has been no improvement in the financing environment yet in 2013  There were a few bright spots  SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVLC  moved into production profitably  Management did a great job getting the Santa Elena mine up to full production and the company uncovered a lot of new ounces at its La Joya property  Generating profits insulates SilverCrest from having to finance  although its share price will still track gold and silver for good or for ill   The companies that did well  and there weren t many of them  were new discovery stories  The epitome of the phenomenon on the HRA list was GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V   which shot from a share price of  0 07 up to  2 after its discovery in the Dominican Republic  It drifted down thanks to the weak market and some weaker holes but it now has a  15  million   15M  cash position to sustain it   The basic problem is that with such a weak market backdrop  the financial sector is focused only on companies with strong management and proven projects  That s a very small subset of the explorers   TGR  Are the small companies going to wither on the vine   EC  Companies with large shareholders that can be tapped for cash to keep things going might eke through  Companies that did not have a lot of success in the last two years are going to have a real problem unless the fundraising situation improves soon   TGR  Are the capital markets for gold miners likely to improve this year   EC  I believe that the financial market will get better for the juniors  but selectively  Money will go to development stories with clear top quartile economics and successful exploration stories  And the devil will take the hindmost  A few hundred companies could disappear over the next couple of years  That stinks  but on a rational  sector wide level  it is better for everybody in the long run if there is more focus on a smaller number of companies that have multiple targets and the ability to deliver  That s where the real game is   The thousand other companies hoping to be able to option a property to a major are just not going to get any attention  It is easy to see the writing on the wall  Today s tiny financings are via insiders  Those are guys in the front office putting in  100 000 among them to keep the door open for another three months  You can only do that for so long  Without real funding to generate real news  companies are stuck   TGR  Is there a feeling out there that the price of gold is too high  that it s going to collapse and not be able to sustain development and exploration   EC  When gold was at  280 ounce  280 oz   mining companies were trading at 50 60 times earnings  That s because investors were not trading on earnings  they were buying for leverage on gold reserves  But after the price of gold went up more than fivefold  the market shifted to trading on earnings  The firms that get higher multiples  as in any other sector  have convinced the market that they can grow earnings  That s fairly normal market behavior  but it is shocking to a lot of people in precious metals  Plus  there is just a lot of competition for capital  although a fair amount of it will eventually return to the gold sector   TGR  Large corporations are sitting on trillions of dollars that have to find a home   EC  There is definitely a lot of big money around  but it is very picky  In 2007  2008 and 2010  there were a lot of large takeovers  Some of those deals came back to haunt the executives who did the takeovers  because many of them lost their jobs  And the executives who replaced them are very hands off  thinking   I don t want to be the next person to do a  5 billion takeover that blows up in my face   But the pendulum will shift back  because executives who work 120 hours a week want to run big companies and to do takeovers  That s who they are   TGR  Were expectations too high with the takeovers   EC  In some cases  acquirers just paid too much  In other cases  there were difficulties with permitting or construction that slowed things  Take a deal that has  say   1M net present value  NPV   Push the start of the cash flow of that project back a couple of years and you reduce the NPV by 15 25  just based on the start of cash flows being pushed back  It may still be a good project  but in terms of what was paid for it  it suddenly does not look so cheap  There s not much you can do about that  A lot of big low grade bulk tonnage projects in South America  for instance  have really big capital expenditures  capex  required to build them and their payback periods are just too long  Those types of firms are having trouble finding buyers  Massive increases in the cost of mine building is a problem across the sector   TGR  On the other hand  gold stocks that were trading for dollars are now trading for pennies  So for the average investor  it could be a pretty good deal if they can wait for these companies to come back into the game   EC  Long term investors who have done well are game for that  They know that when stocks are cheap is when you make the big money  It s not for the faint of heart  though  as you usually only see bottoms in the rear view mirror and companies need to survive until things improve   TGR  Have you made any gold buys recently   EC  I added a couple of companies to the list near the end of the year  They had lots of cash and are in no rush to find new financing  That removes the dilution risk  if not the market risk  For example  I bought Mundoro Capital Inc   MUN TSX V   Back in the day  Mundoro had developed a large gold discovery in China  Unfortunately  the Chinese yanked it away  handing Mundoro a  20M door prize  The company still has  15 16M in the bank  Its market cap is  10M  It has early stage prospective properties in Serbia and Mexico  Mundoro hasn t drilled in Serbia yet  but it has picked up some good looking geophysical anomalies adjacent to Reservoir Minerals Inc   RMC TSX V    Reservoir Minerals Inc  is a Serbian discovery story  also on the HRA list  Reservoir and Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX  made a very impressive blind copper gold discovery on the Timok project  the discovery hole reported 160 meters  160m  of over 10  copper equivalent  Freeport is earning into the project and seems to be taking it very seriously  with five high capacity drill rigs at work  Reservoir is being carried at Timok and working on earlier stage projects elsewhere  It s also very well cashed up with about  20M on hand   TGR  What s the infrastructure for drilling in Serbia   EC  It s good  The foreign investment rules are quite good in Serbia and it is a mining region  There is a famous cooper mine there called Bor  a high sulfidation epithermal deposit  similar to what Reservoir and Freeport are drilling just to the north of their project  Serbia has lots of good geologists  The permitting system is well understood  Because it s a mining area  people do not freak out when they see a piece of flagging taped to a tree  There are lots of miners living in the area   TGR  Are there any other bargain price picks in the junior gold sector   EC  My late brother  Dave  and I followed GoldQuest in the Dominican Republic for years  We liked it because the belt of rocks that its new discovery is in is very well endowed  GoldQuest and its former partner Gold Fields Ltd   GFI  really drew attention to the area several years ago  Unigold Inc   UGD TSX V  has a discovery next door to GoldQuest  I don t follow Unigold but have been watching it closely  The company has reported a number of impressive drill results  It will certainly have a resource on its project and has several other targets it has barely started on  On the other side of the Haitian border  Eurasian Minerals Inc   EMX TSX V  and Newmont Mining Corp   NEM  have a nice discovery  It s a great belt with lots more potential   TGR  Have you been on the ground in the DR   David was there several times over the years  When GoldQuest drilled its successful holes and became the flavor of the day  I went looking in the Dominican Republic  Now  I am a very large shareholder in Precipitate Gold Corp   PRG TSX V   which has picked up two concessions bordering GoldQuest in the same rocks  the Tireo volcanic belt  I do not have a rating on Precipitate and won t  due to my large shareholding and closeness to the company  but I do update it periodically for readers   Precipitate acquired its concession applications last fall  It takes time to get concessions approved and until they are approved  companies make sure they don t do any work that is  messy  like drilling or large scale trenching  just sticking to sampling and mapping  Precipitate announced a few days ago that it has results just shy of 12 grams ton  12 g t  gold and 50 60 g t silver in one spot and over 100 g t silver in another spot  The company is exploring altered Tireo volcanic rocks over a 1  kilometer area on one of its concessions and has other targets it is working on as well  I was quite happy about this because Precipitate has not spent a lot of money on the operation yet  The company ran a few fast reconnaissance programs and found a couple of interesting areas  There is a crew back at work there  Precipitate also just announced an inexpensive option to earn 100  in a Mexican project that should be easy to work and has reported historic results up to 180m of 1 2 g t gold in a drill hole   It is worth noting that when GoldQuest ran up to  2 share  it was pulling insanely high grade drill holes  They were so good that the many better than average results that came more recently paled by comparison  Its stock fell back to  0 50 share  But GoldQuest is doing a very large induced polarization  IP  geophysical survey  IP discovered the Romero zone on its Las Tres Palmas property and has been responsible for other finds in the trend like those of Unigold next door  It appears that GoldQuest s new geophysics system may discriminate the higher grade areas better than before  presumably picking up the copper   The only way to prove this out is to drill the new anomalies  Exploration is generating a whole set of new targets  If GoldQuest hits on one or two of those targets  it will be flavor of the day again  The Romero discovery is quite real and is probably already close to a couple million ounces  GoldQuest just announced a fully funded 30 000m drill program so the company will be generating a steady news flow   HRA has recently put together a report on the Tireo Trend and the companies that we follow in the Dominican Republic  TGR  What about North America and Canada   EC  Mexico lost its flavor of the day status for a while  but it s starting to get traction again  Mexico is simply a great exploration address  It has excellent geology  lots of discoveries  mineral tenure and a smooth permitting system  You don t get a lot of permitting surprises in Mexico  A number of the new mines and SilverCrest is a good example are not gigantic  but they are low capex  low cash cost per ounce mines that are proving to be quite profitable  I think that track record will lure people back   TGR  Any more names in Mexico   EC  I like International Northair Mines Ltd   INM TSX V   It has been drilling a silver project called La Cigarra for a couple of years  Three separate zones in that property are part of the same trend  It has reported plenty of broad 50 60m drill intercepts of 40  50  60 g t silver and quite a number of much higher grade ones in shoots within the broader zones  Northair is due to report its first resource estimate this month  I d be surprised if it is less than 50 million ounces  50 Moz  silver  and it s probably more like 100 Moz  The original property was small  it didn t have much room to work with for drilling to depth or putting in a leach pad or mill  So International Northair just did a deal that vastly enlarged the property  which should give the company more targets to work on   Almaden Minerals Ltd   AAU  recently put out a resource estimate for its Ixtaca project  It is over 3 Moz equivalent  roughly equal gold silver  It wasn t high grade  The metallurgy seems to be pretty good  but it needs to either be a little bit larger  which it could well be because it s open in a couple of directions  or the company must hit on some of the other targets on this property  Almaden isn t joint venturing this project  it s drilling for itself  But it is participating in many joint ventures and has other companies spending a lot of money on its properties  Almaden has a very strong  well known management group and is really good at finding targets  Its joint venture model skills are really the main asset  Not many companies are really good at executing the JV model but Almaden is one of them   In Canada  I expect more activity in the Yukon  though it will be at levels far below the past couple of years  Last year didn t see much new discovery and that took the shine off the Yukon play  One company that did make a bona fide discovery there last year was Comstock Metals Ltd   CSL TSX V   which reported very good drill results from its QV project located just northwest of the Golden Saddle discovery that kicked off the whole rush  Comstock Metals has been hammered like most gold explorers lately but it is fully funded for a 5 000m drill program this year  It s trading very cheaply so it could generate some positive traction with a few more good drill holes   TGR  Anybody else come to mind   EC  The Labrador Trough in Canada is an iron ore story  The first company we followed in the trough  Consolidated Thompson  was taken over by Cliffs Natural Resources  CLF NYSE  at an impressive  17 50 share  Iron ore prices declined last year as traders fretted about China but have come roaring back to the  150 tonne level  There will be production coming onstream over the next couple of years that should moderate prices but  150 tonne is very high by historic standards  Most recent feasibility studies use longer term pricing in the  100 115 tonne range   The big question mark for the Labrador Trough right now is transportation  The current rail line is near capacity  CN just announced it was suspending its study on a new rail line  which sent most of the Labrador iron stocks into a tailspin  It will take time to resolve this issue  The solution might be a second rail line to the current main port on the St  Lawrence Seaway at Sept  les  it might be a line going north or a slurry pipeline that avoids rail altogether  I don t know  but I suspect it will be one of them  There is too much value in the region for it to stay landlocked  but the transport issue will determine the short term direction   There are two companies in the trough that we currently follow  Champion Iron Mines Ltd   CHM TSX  has several iron ore resources in the area  Fire Lake North is the lead project and a prefeasibility study was recently released  The numbers were pretty good  but it has to deal with the rail situation noted above  It is one of the most advanced developers in the region with large resources so it s worth watching   Cap Ex Ventures Ltd   CEV TSX V   the other company in the area I follow  issued a very impressive initial resource estimate of 7 2 billion tons  Bt  iron ore in the Labrador Trough  The resource  located on Cap Ex s Block 103 project  is quite thick  good grade  flat lying and at or near surface  A 7 2 Bt resource is very large and it still has room to grow  Cap Ex has the same challenge of convincing traders that the transport issue can be handled  but it s also very inexpensive compared to the size and quality of resource it controls   Farther afield much farther in Fiji  actually  is another company I follow called Lion One Metals Ltd   LIO TSX V   The company has a gold project in Fiji called Tuvatu  which hosts a gold resource of about 650 000 ounces at about 6 5 g t gold  Work by Lion One has shown the veins that host the resource are still open along strike and there are several other gold bearing structures that have not been brought into the resource  There are workings in place on much of the resource and a feasibility study from the 1990s that indicates the project should be quite profitable at current prices  The company is well funded with over  15M at Sept  30  Lion One recently made a takeover offer for a small Australian explorer  Avocet Resources Ltd   AYE ASX   This deal would bring another  4M onto the balance sheet  several good looking gold and iron ore projects in Australia and a strong technical team that could help accelerate work at Tuvatu  It looks like a smart deal   TGR  Let s talk for a minute about how gold investors should view the macroeconomic situation  Is the debt ceiling back and forth a real crisis   EC  The whole debt ceiling thing just makes me crazy  It s a farce  Since World War II  they ve raised the debt ceiling 90 times  Politicians like to have it around because they can feel like stewards of the public interest when they raise it  I d like to see it abolished   TGR  What about the outlook for the world economy   EC  The numbers are improving  We are emerging from a long balance sheet recession  It takes a long time for people to clean up their balance sheets  not just the government  but also companies and individuals that have a lot of debt on the books  I don t expect growth to go back to where it was six or seven years ago  and it shouldn t  because that was a bubble  But it will return to something more like normal  The rebound in housing and slow healing of the labor market continues in the United States  It should be a relative bright spot and I expect it to surprise to the upside with growth in the 2 3  range later in the year   I think Japan is going to get a bump which it desperately needs  thanks to the new Prime Minister  Japan has been the poster boy for deflation for 20 years now  Shinzo Abe is starting to crank up the government s printing presses  I don t know if it s the best idea ever but I have to agree that the deflationary spiral has to be broken or Japan will never get anywhere   With the installation of the new Politburo  China s numbers have gone positive in the last few months  It is working on rebalancing its economy and I think China can continue to grow at 7 8  for a while yet   Europe is still a basket case  although the bond markets have calmed down  Europe has seen a lot of austerity and a lot of budget cutting  A lot of people in my line of work tend to think good fiscal policy is all about austerity and cutting budgets  But there is a limit to that when austerity chokes the growth rate  And at the end of the day  most governments will do what governments do  try to grow their way out of recession by increasing government spending  It is a short term political solution but these are democracies and politicians want to get re elected  The most painless way to reduce your debt load long term is to grow and or inflate your way out of it  Governments have been doing this for centuries and I see no evidence the current crop of world leaders is planning anything different   TGR  Maybe they should buy some gold stocks   EC  Not a bad idea  All of these countries are trying to get a currency advantage  In Japan  there s no pretense  It is saying   We are going to devalue the yen  We re just going to keep printing yen until the price goes down   We will see governments continue with this competitive devaluation  so gold is going to bounce around for a while  It s not an easy algorithm to track because gold is trading in a variety of currencies like a currency itself   Gold has gotten hammered because traders worry about the U S  dollar staying  strong  because others devalue  and worrying about the U S  Federal Reserve taking away the punch bowl  Both are possible but I think the Fed will keep monetary policy loose for a while yet and that things settle out once currencies find some new equilibrium  I view gold as a currency but it s also a commodity  one that gets harder to find and more expensive to mine every day  Medium term  I don t see huge downside in gold because the mining sector simply will not produce enough to meet demand at prices much below current levels  That s not politics  it s the realities of the mining business   TGR  Thanks for your time  Eric   EC  You are welcome  Peter   Eric Coffin is the editor of the HRA  Hard Rock Analyst  family of publications  Responsible for the  financial

17777,239292,FCX,Valuation  Sentiment Different Than March 2000  October 2007,opinion,According to ThomsonReuters  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500 fell  0 37 this past week  from  112 39 to  112 02  Given the S P 500 s 2 17  increase for the week  the P E ratio for the S P 500 as of Friday  March 8th was 14 x   which is at the high end of the 2   3 year trading range  The year over year growth rate for the S P 500 s forward estimate fell to 5 67   which is lower than the recent range as well   I don t like to see that  but I ll give it a few weeks   The  earnings yield  for the S P 500 as of Friday  March 8th was 7 22   The 10 year Treasury closed Friday at 2 055   higher than its February 14th  high tick  and the highest close since the 2 40  yield peak from March  2012  Q4  12 earnings are almost entirely reported now  and the quarter came in far better than expected  at  6 1  year over year earnings growth and  3 7  revenue growth  All eyes now turn to Q1  13  with reports set to begin in about 30 days  The S P 500 earnings growth is expected at a very tepid  1 4   while revenue growth  when we see the data  should be expected to be in the range of 1    2  again  It is our opinion that Q1  13 earnings expectations are still too low  but the pattern has been for the quarterly estimate to decay as we approach the quarter  and then see stronger than expected results  Towards the end of March  we will hear from FedEx  FDX   Oracle  ORCL   Accenture  ACN   and Nike  NKE  which will give us a nice cross section of sectors when these companies report  industrial  technology and consumer spending   long FDX  ORCL  NKE   Stat of the week   It pays to look ahead to see how analyst estimates are reflecting sector fundamentals  There is great uncertainty still surrounding how full year 2013 earnings estimates will unfold  The following three tables will show how the 10 sectors of the S P 500 rank from from highest to lowest earnings growth on the following dates  October 1  2012  Jan 1  2013  and then Friday March 8th  2013  for full year 2013 expectations  October 1  2012  Telco  23 3  Basic Mat  21 9  Consumer Discretionary  15 3

and Basic Materials sectors remain the top 2 sectors the last 6 months  gets very little play in the financial media  probably because the two sectors combined  comprise only about 5    6  of the S P 500 by market cap  We lifted our Basic Materials weighting this week  buying Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold  FCX   although we think upside in the stock might be limited given worries over the two acquisitions it made  Still  an upside move in copper over the next 3   6 months  would help FCX  but less so after the acquisition   Long FCX  Alcoa  AA    For Q1  13  Basic Material earnings growth estimates have declined 1 500 BPs since Oct 1  2012  Notice how Financials remains in the top 3 sectors when ranked by earnings growth for 2013  Our largest holding is JP Morgan Chase  JPM   and then Charles Schwab  SCHW   Goldman  GS  and Wells  WFC   and CME Group  CME   long all   Our largest overweight remains Technology in client accounts  which should help on any market pullback as we think Apple  AAPL  is pretty much done declining   Long AAPL  Industrial earnings estimate revisions have turned positive the past 6 months  even though the sector s 2013 growth prospects are still below the S P 500   Breakout in Boeing  BA  this week  now above  80  Long BA  Finally  we are surprised that Standard   Poor s does not just roll the  Telecom  sector into the Technology sector of the S P 500  Like Transports were rolled into Industrial s years ago  roll Telecom into Tech  and Basic Mat into Industrials  and the result is 8 sectors of the S P 500  Our largest sector overweights as we move through 2013 will remain Technology  Industrials and Financials  as has been the case for the last few years  unless earnings pre announcements or some kind of warning  takes us out of the sectors  However  given such low expectations and the negative sentiment  we think there is more earnings upside for these sectors for the rest of the year  Various and Sundry   I continue to be amazed at the poor market and investor sentiment  even as the S P 500 reaches its March  2000 and October  2007 highs  The fact that equity fund flows just turned positive after a 4 year bull market  probably tells you a lot about mutual funds  and about market sentiment  As a portfolio manager  am I in the prediction business or the risk management business for clients  Definitely the latter  I would think  ISI Research   we were fortunate to have ISI turn us on to their research  Dr  Mark Schoenebaum is a great biotech   pharma analyst  Love Scott Leuffler s weekly missive and the occasional notes from Bijal Shah and Ed Hyman  Quality research from the group  Ed Hyman and Nancy Lazar were early and right on the housing turn  while John Mendelson  technician  was early and right on the bounce in pharma  It as been 12 years  man  12 years       takeoff on Jeremy Piven s character in Grosse Point Blank  since the S P 500 has made an all time high  and kept it   It is a light week for earnings  although we get more releases from retailers  We ll have our preview of Costco  COST  up  tonight   Long COST   Every year  since 2010  we ve seen a decent correction in the S P 500 as we moved through the 2nd quarter  Will we get it this year  Last year  the peak to trough correction was just 10   Not very much  indicative of sentiment I think  Gary Morrow  excellent technician at  likes the    big breakouts this week  We ve never owned or followed fundamentally  Morrow also  Encana  ECA   which is a natural gas play  We are long ECA  frustratingly  Both ISI and the Natural Gas Association  in trips through Chicago in 2012  thought the equilibrium price of nat gas  was  4    6 btu  Still have a ways to go  Bob Lang  another friend from my days at TheStreet com wrote an  that has merit for stock and sector picking  If you are waiting for a definitive market pullback  you may wait a long time  Buy in slowly and in small increments  Big test for California muni bonds and the muni market this week with the California GO issuance  Looking at the National muni ETF  MUB   and it looks toppy  December  12 low was  109 79  Last point  favorite headline this week found

17825,239340,FCX,In a Sea of Uncertainty  Earnings Remain a Net Positive ,opinion,The  forward 4 quarter earnings estimate   per ThomsonReuters  for the S P 500 as of Friday  December 7th was  109 20  down from  109 42 last week  and still stuck in the 3 month range between  107 and  112  The P E ratio on this forward earnings estimate is 12 9 x   Expected year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 in 2012 is roughly 4   while 2013 is expected in the 10  range  The S P 500 is probably pretty fairly valued on a PE basis at its current level  There is little new news on the S P 500 earnings front and likely won t be until early January  2013 when we roll into the new quarter  The big thing to watch for between now and the end of the year  is negative earnings pre announcements  Personally  given the state of market sentiment and reasonable sector valuations  it is not as if negative pre announcements will have a tremendous and deleterious effect on the stock market in general  in our opinion  The real surprise would be positive pre announcements  which most pundits would view as a complete shock  but that possibility seems remote too  However  the  special dividend  splurge we have seen the last 3 weeks seems to have lost its luster  Stocks that declare a special dividend get a one day pop and then seem to fade  We are keeping an eye out for how this group has performed in December since the announcements  Surprised Bespoke hasn t published something performance related on the special dividend stocks yet  On balance  we believe that S P 500 earnings remain a  net positive  for the stock market  despite recession talk  and Fiscal Cliff worries  The key unknown is how forward earnings estimates will be impacted once we do have a deal from Washington  However  you would think if analysts were getting some guidance from managements on how sequestration and fiscal policy was going to impact earnings  it would have started to show up in estimates by now  We won t post our  Stat of the week  since I was too lazy to gaze at my navel for too long  but I will say  Basic Materials  earnings estimates for 2013 were looking pretty decent  China recovery  anyone    and by that I mean the forecasts were trending higher  but I wonder if Freeport s ill fated and scathingly reviewed acquisitions this week  will put a cork in that sector  Freeport Copper  FCX  is a big basic materials sector component  Also worth noting is that S P 500 earnings for 2013 are currently expected to be up 10  y y  while the Financial sector is expected at  15  in 2013  and estimates have been stable  I still think financials are a safe r  place to be in this market  Market sector security update     Apple  AAPL  had another brutal week  Per Bespoke  in the history of AAPL corrections though  this correction is still  normal   even though the weekly drop was 9   Still like it and remain long AAPL    Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Procter   Gamble  PG  and Home Depot  HD

about  start picking stocks    Three excellent charts by Gary Morrow  a long time friend  and current contributor to    could be breaking down  which we ve long wondered might happen given the slowly growing adoption of hybrids and electric cars    However just because crude might break a few bucks doesn t mean it is done permanently  Starbucks  SBUX  held their annual analyst love in this week

junk bonds  have held in quite well despite worries about the economy  We cut our exposure about a month ago  but still carry an overweight  We worry that owning high yield in the search for  yield  is now as commonly accepted paradigm as being long AAPL stock  but nothing tells us yet to trim more  although we can get out quickly since we own a lot of our exposure in the HYG and JNK  long HYG  JNK     Could Europe be stabilizing  Seemingly better news on Greece this week and the Greek debt announcement and the 10 year yields in Greece  Italy and Spain have really rallied nicely this year  Jeff Miller told his blog readers to watch that 10 year  particularly the Italian 10 year for a one metric gauge on Europe s health  Tiffany s  TIF  reported their European comp s rose 8  in the

perspective  no      is another chart from Norm on transfer payments as a   of the federal budget  Maybe Boehner wanting to extract spending concessions from the President  isn t such a bad thing    Outside of AAPL  our favorite stock into year end is IBM  IBM   Earnings estimates actually went up slightly after the October earnings reports  but the stock is down from  210 to the  190 area  Too cheap  Great cash flow generation and a lot of bad news cooked into prices in our opinion   Long IBM    A lot of Treasury supply scheduled to be auctioned this week  with 3s  10s and the 30 year

price returns   2003  I need to refresh my Ibbotson data    One thing that struck me in terms of the mortgage interest deduction and the Cliff  is that with interest rates so low  the deduction is already diminished anyway  Whoever hasn t refi ed to a reasonably low mortgage rate  must be living in a cave    With the mess that is now Freeport  FCX   we hope that Alcoa  AA  attracts some of this

17826,239341,FCX,US Equity Futures Slip In Pre Market Trading,opinion,U S  equity futures slipped in pre market trading as mixed economic data with a slight positive bias was weighed down by fears over Europe s debt crisis  Positive industrial production and retail sales data in China were offset by weak trade data  Meanwhile  the return of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to Italian politics has created a new political crisis in the country and caretaker Prime Minister Monti said he would not seek a new term amidst the crisis   Top News In other news around the markets  Recent developments on the Fiscal Cliff may be indicating that leaders are closer than previously thought to a deal  as top Senate Republicans are seemingly giving up on their no tax hikes pledge to reach a deal  but the House still remains divided Due to its recent success  Greece has extended the debt buyback offer that it launched last week in hopes of buying back more debt to aid its finances The Bank for International Settlements  BIS  has warned economies around the world to be careful of sparking a new credit bubble with extended low rates  The warning comes as Central Banks are internally debating the exact effects of non traditional policy on inflation S P 500 futures fell 4 5 points to 1 411 50 The EUR USD was slightly higher at 1 2903 Spanish 10 year government bond yields rose to 5 648 percent Italian 10 year government bond yields rose to 4 684 percent Gold rose 0 28 percent to  1 710 28 per ounce Asian Markets Asian shares initially traded strongly but gave back some gains upon the release of the weak Chinese trade data  The Japanese Nikkei Index rose 0 07 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 07 percent while the Hang Seng Index gained 0 39 percent  In addition  the Korean Kospi was flat and Australian shares rose 0 14 percent   European Markets European shares fell sharply in early trade with notable weakness seen in Italian stocks as fears over Italy s new political crisis have caused investors to fear that economic reforms will be ignored for the sake of politics  The Spanish Ibex Index fell 1 98 percent and the Italian MIB Index fell a whopping 3 47 percent on these fears  Meanwhile  the German DAX fell 0 62 percent on poor domestic trade data  the French CAC slipped 0 67 percent  and U K  shares fell 0 31 percent   Commodities Commodities were slightly stronger overnight  shrugging off much of the bad news emanating both from China and Europe and rising on hopes of a Fiscal Cliff deal  WTI Crude futures rose 0 47 percent to  86 33 per barrel and Brent Crude futures rose 0 74 percent to  107 81  Copper futures rose 1 11 percent to  370 75 per pound because  although the headline Chinese trade data was weak  metals imports remained strong  especially iron ore demand  Gold was higher and silver futures rose 0 69 percent to  33 36 per ounce   Currencies Currency markets were in clear risk off mode overnight as the yen reigned and the euro was little changed  The EUR USD was basically flat at 1 2903 and the dollar fell against the yen to 82 16  Overall  the Dollar Index rose 0 05 percent to  80 451 on strength against the Swiss franc and the Swedish krone  Except for yen crosses  forex markets were pretty quiet overnight with moves limited  The AUD JPY fell 0 28 percent to 86 09 and the EUR JPY fell to 106 06   Pre Market Movers Stocks moving in the pre market included  Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold  FCX  shares rose 0 91 percent pre market following its massive acquisitions last week where the company shelled out nearly  20 billion to purchase McMoRan Exploration  MMR  and Plains Exploration  PXP  United States Steel  X  shares fell 0 55 percent pre market as weak Chinese trade data overshadowed the subtly positive iron ore import data Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  shares rose 0 42 percent pre market as the company has started to attract new bullish speculation  according to Schaeffer s Research Bank of America  BAC  shares fell 0 7 percent pre market as financials as a sector traded lower Earnings Notable companies expected to report earnings Monday include  Stein Mart  SMRT  is expected to report a third quarter loss of  0 09 vs  a loss of  0 08 a year ago Winnebago Industries  WGO  is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 10 vs   0 04 a year ago Economics On the economics calendar Monday  the Treasury is set to auction 3  and 6 month bills  Overnight  French nonfarm payrolls are due out and the German Zew Economic Survey is expected to be released By Matthew Kanterman,2012-12-10,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-equity-futures-slip-in-pre-market-trading-146887,146887
17827,239342,FCX,S P 500 Still Creeping Upward,opinion,T2108 Status  60 6 VIX Status  16 1General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold  assuming at least some profits from oversold trade already locked  Otherwise  sell some Commentary The media headlines continue to suggest that the drama of the Fiscal Cliff is making large swings from one pronouncement to another but the stock market has now settled down into a definite comfortzone  The S P 500 managed to close marginally above its 50DMA although it has yet to recover all its post election losses T2108 is also steadily creeping higher  On Monday  it closed within striking distance of overbought territory  This is truly remarkable against what is supposed to be a high risk backdrop  My earlier assumption that the market would fall in and out of oversold status has not panned out  If the market does achieve overbought status before the Fiscal Cliff gets resolved  I will feel compelled to follow through with the T2108 overbought rules to try an initial short  I have to assume at that point the market will be particularly vulnerable to any bad news  Of course  if you are already predisposed to being bearish on the prospects for a good resolution to the Fiscal Cliff  this is a perfect time to start planning  and even implementing  some short positions I conclude with three chart reviews  Apple  AAPL   Jinko Solar  JKS   and Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX  Despite a tame open in the general market  AAPL opened the week with a rapid plunge that stopped almost as soon as it started  The stock bounced back and even printed positive gains for a short time  The bad news is that AAPL retested critical support at the former intraday low from May  This is now the third test of that support and is a rapid retest from last week  These rapid retests rarely end well because enough time has not yet passed to build a stabilizing base of buyers  Instead  breaks of support will likely generate an amplified wave of selling as traders quickly get stopped out of positions and or chase the stock downward  The chart below shows Apple is right at the edge of a fresh sell off  My current assumption is that Apple will indeed soon sell off a lot more given the continued heavy volume  and such selling will likely  eventually  pull the rest of the market down with it   I have decided to trade the uncertain outlook on AAPL shares by opening several call and put spreads covering multiple expirations  I hope to write more details on this structure in a future post  Jinko Solar  JKS  surged on heavy buying volume on Friday  December 7th  Buyers returned to the fray in high volume again yesterday  While the stock is now up 2 5x from its recent all time lows  Friday s move marked the stock s first true breakout  JKS last traded above its 200DMA in the summer of 2011  but this breakout is quite bullish for finally establishing a bottom  Here is    I think it is time for me to write about the company again  JKS    announced that JinkoSolar  Switzerland  AG  its Swiss subsidiary  has entered into a strategic cooperation agreement   Strategic Cooperation Agreement   with the Guangdong Branch of China Development Bank   CDB    pursuant to which CDB intends to provide financing cooperation to JinkoSolar  Switzerland  AG of an aggregate amount up to US  1 billion over a five year period  The final conditions  terms and amount of the financing under the Strategic Cooperation Agreement is subject to the parties  further approval and will be set out in separate agreements  JinkoSolar  Switzerland  AG will act as the platform to further expand the Company s presence overseas as the Company intends to use the financing to develop its overseas expansion  merger  acquisition  and downstream business  including project development and EPC for Photovoltaic   PV   solar power plants  Pursuant to the Strategic Cooperation Agreement  the two parties will establish a high level joint meeting mechanism to evaluate the progress of major development projects   Finally  a quick update on FCX  The stock continues to loiter around its QE2 price  As   this line has become a very important pivot point for the stock  I still think it is a buy here  and I wish I had sold puts during the first two days of selling Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Be careful out there Full disclosure  long FCX  long AAPL shares  call and put spreads  long JKS,2012-12-11,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/s-p-500-still-creeping-upward-147022,147022
17828,239343,FCX,When Forward Earnings Estimates Don t Work ,opinion,There are a number of important earnings reports due out this week  including Oracle  ORCL   the enterprise software giant on Tuesday night  FedEx   FDX  the transport giant due out Wednesday morning  Bed  Bath   Beyond  BBBY   due out Wednesday night  Nike   NKE   the athletic footwear giant due out Thursday night  and then Walgreens  WAG   the retail drugstore chain is scheduled to release fiscal 1st quarter  2013  earnings on Friday morning  December 21 before the open   long ORCL  FDX  NKE   We will get a reading on a wide swath of the US economy this week from these earnings reports  from FDX s look across the globe from a basic industrial perspective  to Oracle s read into enterprise tech and the cloud  and WAG  NKE and BBBY s look into retail and the consumer   There is little new to add to S P 500 earnings  the forward 4 quarter estimate is now  109 09 as of Friday  December 14th  and per ThomsonReuters   4 85  higher than the same estimate one year ago  I feel like we are beating a dead horse here  but we continue to think that Q3  12 s earnings for the key benchmark will be the nadir in terms of year over year growth and that Q4  12 and forward quarters will show better growth than Q3  12 s  0 1   The financial press continues to beat on the fact that 4th quarter  2012 earnings are  only  expected to grow 4  year over year  downwardly revised from the 10  expected from Q4  12 as of early October  but that is better than Q3  12 s  0 1   and the fact is forward quarters  as least in terms of how current estimates look  will continue to be better than the end of 2012  The two big events of the last two months  the Presidential elections and the Fiscal Cliff  getting to hate that term  seems to have had an interesting effect on Corporate and Consumer America  the Cliff and the almost certain higher cap gains taxes in 2013 has seemed to spur a rush of private client transactions and business on real estate and some business transactions to lock in the lower cap gains tax rate in 2012  Meanwhile the pending Cliff has seemed to slow some aspects of Corporate America as enterprises and such seem to be on hold waiting for what tax reform might look like   An old collegiate friend is a tax attorney in Cleveland with his own practice that revolves around manufacturing  and he is booked solid through Q1  13 as a number of his clients are selling businesses now to lock in long term gains  Heard something similar from another friend in Southern Wisconsin  around longer term real estate holdings   Unfortunately that is very anecdotal  but it seems to be a growing theme  It is currently a very strange macro environment  with very mixed data points on the economy  The one aspect that doesn t seem well understood in Washington is that tax reform changes consumer and investor behavior  without a doubt   This coming week  we get more housing data  starts and permits and existing home sales  as well as the final look at 3rd quarter GDP  This coming Thursday s Jobless claims release will no doubt get a lot of scrutiny  Last Thursday s Jobless Claims release portends bullishly for the December employment report due out early in January  from what we ve read  When Forward Estimates Aren t Predictive  we ve spent a lot of time educating readers on the importance of understanding forward earnings estimates and what that information tells us  but the fact is that sometimes   with the 2008 Great Decession  sic  as a prime example   forward earnings estimates can be flat out wrong  We stayed bullish throughout 2008 because that  S P 500 forward earnings estimate  was consistently rising up until early July  2008  when it peaked at  104 07 on July 4th  2008   We ve tracked this data weekly since 2000   Even by late August  early September  2008  that forward estimate had only been revised lower to roughly  100 per share  so the forward estimate didn t capture the mortgage and liquidity crisis of 2008 until it was happening  and by then it was too late  We were in the teeth of a horrific market correction by September 15th  2008  and the Lehman collapse  The point is that forward earnings estimates may not be a great predictor of the  exogenous shock  and I m not sure that the Lehman collapse and the mortgage crisis qualifies as  exogenous   but the point is that in late 2008 the forward earnings estimates followed the crisis rather than helped predict the crisis  And that brings us to a tangential and related topic this week  the nature of our recessions and business cycles has changed  When I studied finance and economics in the 1980 s and 1990 s  BSBA  MBA  CFA  etc   the nature of the business cycle was cyclical   and still is   with a foundation around manufacturing  Since the tech bubble burst and then housing popped  after a 60 year bull market in housing   much of the  traditional  economy such as manufacturing  actually continued to expand thanks to China and Europe  until the last two years anyway   The point being that I think 2000 and 2008 were the first  services  recessions we ever experienced   and that is simply an educated guess and I could be wrong on that   Services is now 80  of GDP  and has been since the mid 1980s  The post WW II US economy was primarily manufacturing and agrarian based  which then transitioned in the 1960s and 1970s into a services based economy  The point is that the nature of our business cycle has changed in demonstrably the last 12 years  and continues to evolve as trading partners such as China and Europe suffer through their own issues  Each recession and crisis is somewhat different than the last as the US economy continually evolves and changes its shape and structure  To conclude  after the last 12 years and the two horrific bear markets we have experienced  the quality of today s earnings and estimates are probably more  predictive  than historical earnings estimates  but the important element to remember is that we can t rely on any metric solely  and at the exclusion of others  The Cliff could present an issue with forward estimates if we have broad and far reaching changes to our tax system  As of yet  in terms of revisions for 2013  that doesn t seem to be in the cards Market sector security update     The 10 year Treasury has not made a new low in yield in almost 6 months or since late July  2012 when it touched 1 38   Hard to say if a long top is forming in the Treasury complex  Ray Dalio  the famed hedge fund manager and founder of Bridgewater   Associates  was interviewed this past week and said that the decline in bonds will be  the  trade  i e  being short bonds  of the next century or something to that effect  The unusual element about Ray making such a statement is that he really isn t prone to hyperbole  Ray thinks Treasuries will start to rise in yield in late 2013  We remain long the ProShares Short 20  Year Treasury ETF  TBF  and will be long the ProShares UltraShort 20  Year Treasury ETF  TBT  at some point  You can be patient with the TBF  unlevered or 1 1 inverse Treasury ETF  and you can time your Treasury short with the TBT  levered or 2 1 inverse Treasury ETF    We use both but are only long the TBF currently     It seems very strange to hear those  gurus  and prognisticators be bearish Treasuries and interest rates  i e  implying higher interest rates down the road  and then be bearish equity markets  like the US equity market or the S P 500  Inflation would be beneficial to corporate earnings  It looks like the S P 500 will finish 2012 with a 4    5  year over year growth rate for earnings  versus a   what   1 5  core inflation rate  if that   The point being that  real  or inflation adjusted earnings continue to be positive  After 10   12 years of disinflation or deflation  a little faster rate of inflation might be welcome by the Fed  Certainly I think that a little inflation would be beneficial to corporate earnings    Day after day we continue to hear about recession worries in early 2013  mostly Cliff related  The big surprise could be unexpected economic strength once Washington comes to some agreement and now that the Presidential election is behind us  Without a doubt  it seems there is a lot of short side money riding on a recession in 2013  but the unexpected and lower probability occurence for 2013 would be economic acceleration   The contrarian in us tells us that the  recessionistas  can not all be right  and hopefully Washington is not that stupid     Natural gas   there is a US manufacturing  renaissance  occurring in the US after two decades of losing jobs to China and Latin America  and ISI Group thinks it is due to lower natural gas prices and the US finding cheaper sources of energy by drilling domestically than by importing  The equilibruim price for natural gas is thought to be between  5    6 per MCF  While nat gas looks substantially undervalued at its current price  they keep finding more of it too  We are long only Encana  ECA  and are underweight Energy as a sector  We ve never been very good energy traders as it was   still  I think the growing numbers of hybrids and eventually electric cars impacts gasoline prices  and gas prices  supply and demand  are a huge determinant of crude oil prices  The price of electric cars seems to be the prime deterrent to widespread consumer acceptance at this point  but in effect the auto OEM s are cannibalizing their own product lines  Eventually I expect prices to decline over time and for electric cars to gain greater acceptance   I don t qualify as an expert on this topic by any means  but electric cars and hybrids remind of PCs in 1979   1980  i e  consumers have a growng awareness of the technology  but pricing is still prohibitive  and it is still viewed as cutting edge rather than mainstream technology     Gold and silver   neither has an  intrinsic value  so it is impossible to tell whether the metals are cheap or not  We are long just a smidge of gold and no silver  After a 12   13 year bull market in both  there are far more gold and silver bulls in the market  which is what you d expect  My own opinion is that the  long gold and short dollar  dollar trade of the last 10   12 years is nearing an end  Both have run their course  That doesn t mean gold is a short or the dollar is a long trade  Rather  it means that it will be more difficult to make money on that traditional theme  Goldman Sachs made a call during the  past few weeks saying the gold bull market has ended   long a very small position on GLD in a few client accounts  and long GS     Tom Lee of JP Morgan Asset Management was out this week saying  Basic Materials  will be the best performing sector of 2013  The forward earnings estimates for the sector for 2013 have been flashing positive signs  as we wrote about a few weeks ago  Currently Basic Mat   which is 3  of the S P 500 by market cap   is expected to have the highest level of earnings growth in 2013  at  22 2  up from 19  as of July 1   Tom is looking at the same data we do   Telecom is the 2nd highest sector at 20 8   up from 17 5  as of July 1  The one quirk to these sectors is that   in total   basic materials and telco   are just 5  of the market cap of the S P 500  or relatively tiny sectors  Technology is the largest sector at 20  of the key benchmark  If you are looking at Basic Materials  that would be Freeport  FCX   Alcoa  AA  and the steel stocks for starters   Long Alcoa  sold in taxable accounts for the tax loss  kept in tax deferred accounts     There will be a plethora of predictions about 2013 in the next few weeks  with very few firms telling you how their predictions panned out for 2012  Those whose forecasts and predictions were right for 2012 will crow about it loudly  One thing most individual investors do not consider is that no one person  or one firm  or one style or investing methodoology or economic or forecasting model is ever  and I mean  ever  CONSISTENTLY right about predicting the economy or the stock   bond markets  One lesson I ve also learned in fact  is that the  righter  you are  the more wrong you will likely be  since success in the money management business often attracts assets  and the more successful you become with a particular strategy  the less likely you are to want to deviate from that strategy even though that is often the prudent course of action  This is a topic for a longer article  but as an advisor to individual wealthy investors  we try to stay flexible and think as much about risk as we do about return  With the 20 year bull market in the late 1990s we didn t do that  and like a lot of other shops  we should have  Don t forget to sell on occasion  and don t ignore valuation    Resurgent Chinese economy   the China 25 Index ETF  FXI  had a big day Thursday as the Shanghai Composite rose 4   its best day since 2009  We have played China through the FXI in the past  Haven t owned that ETF in a long time    The US market was outperforming most non US markets until the last month  I think some of that is Apple s  AAPL  decline  which is still a big part of the S P 500 index  European markets are now up more than the S P 500 for 2012 year to date    Facebook  FB  was one of our better calls this year  We bought most of it under  20    Finally our corporate  high yield  overweight in balanced or bond accounts remains  although Moody s raised another red flag about the covenants starting to erode on new issues  This is what happens when you get a strong demand for a  yield   You want to focus on corporate high yield when it is a buyer s rather than a seller s market  and today it is an issuer s market  Could be an early warning sign for the fixed income market  but we remain overweight  About a month ago we sold one high yield fund and put the proceeds into the  Unconstrained  asset class which gives managers flexibility to move between and amongst asset classes  so while we reduced our high yield overweight slightly  the proceeds are still predominantly in corporate bonds    Municipal bonds   The National Muni Bond ETF  MUB  had a tough week last week and is sitting at key support  Could municipal bonds tax exempt income be under the gun in Washington  Be careful of your muni portfolios  Individual bonds would be safer on a risk reward basis than either mutual funds or ETFs if munis  tax exemption gets thrown under the bus  We sold all of our munis in late November when we worried about this happening  We are still not  right  yet  but why take the chance  and we lock in capital gains at the 15  rate  This doesn t smell good    Wal Mart  WMT  at  65    66 is a screaming buy  Buy it all the way down  One of the best  run and under loved companies in America   long WMT  want to get longer     This week we posted an article on three large cap stocks poised for all time highs  You can find it  is the article  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  got a positive mention in Barron s this weekend  Procter   Gamble  PG  may take a little longer   Long JNJ  PG  HD     Finally this is expiration week and the S P 500 is sitting right between overbought and oversold  There isn t a clear sentiment trade one way or the other   is our preview  of Bed  Bath   Beyond  BBBY  earnings report due out this Wednesday night  as well as FedEx s  due Thursday morning  We have a much bigger position in FDX than in BBBY  FDX is trading at 5 x  enterprise value to cash flow  We have no position in Bed  Bath because we are hoping to buy it between  45    50  We ll be out with previews on Nike and Wagreen s early this week ,2012-12-17,Brian

17829,239344,FCX,Byron King s Shocking Energy Sector 2013 Predictions,opinion,Byron King  editor of the Outstanding Investments and Energy   Scarcity Investor newsletters  is expecting surprises in the energy sector in 2013  In this interview with The Energy Report  King discusses his forecasts for fracking s impact on oil and gas prices  a worldwide uranium shortage and a possible change in the economics of alternative energy sources  The Energy Report  Let s start with a recent takeover deal that s been getting a lot of criticism in recent weeks  Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX  made a  9 billion takeover offer for the oil and gas explorer McMoRan Exploration Co   MMR  and Houston based Plains Exploration   Production  PXP   Are you happy with this deal  Byron King  It came as a surprise  I ve held McMoRan Exploration in Energy   Scarcity for about two years  I like what McMoRan is working to do with deep gas in the Gulf of Mexico  Still  I recommended that readers take their money off the table with this deal  Sell the shares  take the cash and we ll find other opportunities  McMoRan Exploration nearly doubled after the Freeport announcement  going from  8 to  15 per share  You can t walk away from that kind of potential gain  Take your money  pay your taxes at the lower 2012 rates and do something else with the money next year  There s another angle to this takeover  Freeport and Plains together already own about 36  of McMoRan  There are a lot of ties here  between key individuals  I think this deal was driven by the impending tax changes next year  Freeport  the copper play  is borrowing a lot of money to fund this whole process  Fortunately  interest rates are very low  so it s borrowing cheap to do a big takeover  which will give a lot of people a really sweet payday  and they ll get to pay capital gains taxes at much lower rates this year than if they wait until January 2013  TER  James  Jim Bob  Moffett  who founded McMoRan  is also paying himself  He was a significant shareholder in McMoRan Exploration  He s taking from his left pocket to put it in his right pocket  BK  Wall Street hated this deal  Freeport s share price dropped by about  6 share within a few minutes of the deal being announced  TER  This whole deal really hinges on the Davy Jones well offshore of Louisiana and whether or not it can make that play  Can it turn this around  Can it make it a viable  producing well  BK  Davy Jones is all about using new  deep drilling and production technology to make this type of well work in the Gulf of Mexico  albeit in shallow water 20 feet or so  Sad to say  the Davy Jones well isn t quite where it needs to be  But it s coming  and likely sooner than most people believe  The components of the technology are all there  I d say  I ve seen super strong well casing  I ve seen advanced valve systems  I ve seen blowout preventers that can handle the stresses  It s just that I have seen these things in vendors  offices and warehouses in Houston  Now the trick is to systematize it all  and make the Davy Jones concept work as a deep gas producer with economics that won t break the bank  The next question is what s going to happen with natural gas prices in the U S   Whether it s Davy Jones or a new well  companies are drilling wells that need  6   8 and  10 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf  gas  Yet  on a good day  gas is selling at  3 3 50 Mcf  Are the economics going to work  That s a whole other discussion  TER  How does this change the landscape among the hard asset players  Are we returning to the 1970s  when mining companies and oil and gas companies were one and the same  BK  Back in the 1970s  when oil prices went up and the economy realized that energy was a key component of everything  a lot of oil companies started to get into other resources  They did these types of rollups in the 1970s  and then they spent a big part of the 1980s divesting and spinning these things back out  Right now  in this era  McMoRan may be a one off idea  It s a unique play  It s not quite time to break out your old 1970s leisure suits and hang the disco balls or anything  TER  Let s get to what you re calling  taxageddon   How will this affect investors  BK  When the tax code changes dramatically on Jan  1  a lot of people are going to feel the sting  We ll get hit by that 2  increase in the FICA Social Security in every paycheck  The capital gains tax rates will effectively double on Jan  1  including the Obamacare increase  The personal rates will go from 15  to the 30 35  range  It s a big hit  TER  Are you managing the Outstanding Investments portfolio differently than you were a year ago  Are there more yield bearing stocks in that portfolio  BK  In the last year  I ve focused more on identifying yield bearing stocks  I added one this fall called Linn Energy LLC  LINE   TER  In recent editions of Energy   Scarcity  you have discussed declining rates at fracking wells across the U S  Do you believe this is an across the board problem or is it limited to certain plays or geology  BK  It s pretty much all of the shale gas wells  A fracked well that does not decline quickly is truly the exception  Last week  at a conference at the University of Texas  the overall decline rates that were tossed around were absolutely shocking  The decline rates on wells in their first year are in the range of 35 40   and it is a similar number in the second year  By year two  a company will have produced perhaps 75  of the ultimate recoverable hydrocarbon out of a well  It utterly wrecks the economics of a gas well to produce most of its output up front  during a low price environment  These frack plays are astonishing wells  in a technical sense  but the economics are very problematic  TER  If the production rates are rapidly declining and there is not as much natural gas as first thought  won t that ultimately lead to higher natural gas prices  BK  Natural gas prices are already starting to climb back up  About a year ago  the number of rigs devoted to drilling for gas fell off a cliff  I am bullish on natural gas in general  The natural gas price could double to the  7 range within the year  TER  One of the companies in your Outstanding Investments portfolio is Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   which is moving heavily into natural gas  Is that a smart move  BK  Royal Dutch Shell is moving to gas  Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  is moving to gas  Chevron Corp   CVX  bought Chief Oil and Gas LLC in western Pennsylvania to establish itself as a major player in the Marcellus region  However  the executives from these companies will tell you about the very tight economics of these projects  Actually  Rex Tillerson of Exxon said that up until now  Exxon has been losing its shirt on these things  I m not going to say that Royal Dutch Shell has done the wrong thing  It bears watching  These big companies have deep pockets  and will have to work their way through this storm the same as everyone else  The good news is that the big guys can afford to take risks that small companies  or even large independents  can t take to drill gas plays and test new technology that might change those decline rates from being so steep  TER  What are some other senior oil and gas producers in the Outstanding Investments portfolio  BK  Over the years  I ve focused more on international names  Statoil ASA  STO NYSE  STL OSE  of Norway is a large  well run company  I like that the Norwegian government has a large stake because it seems to be mature enough to let Statoil operate as an oil company  collect the dividends and benefits  but not interfere in the day to day operations  Statoil has wonderful technical capabilities  It s a nice dividend payer  French company Total S A   TOT  is also a large  global company that operates in a lot of jurisdictions that France has close ties with  It pays a nice dividend  Total has been good  BP Plc  BP NYSE  BP LSE  has been in the portfolio for a while  I kept it through the Gulf of Mexico blowout  BP s shares dropped terribly right after the blowout  although I told people to buy back in at  28 share  and it wound up going up to the  40s  Yet BP has been a very frustrating company for a lot of reasons  Of course  there is the Gulf of Mexico disaster  but it has other issues related to people s perception of its safety culture  Fair or not  people write books about it  like Drowning in Oil  BP and the Reckless Pursuit of Profit  by Loren Steffy of the Houston Chronicle  That hurts BP s share value  Plus  BP hasn t done itself any favors with the confusion over its partnership with TNK BP  I m still thinking through what to do with BP  On the one hand  it has a lot of great people and assets  It has an aggressive aspect to its exploration and production in the future  On the other hand  there is informed speculation that BP could be worth more in a broken up state  It s going to be interesting to see how BP evolves over time  TER  Most natural gas is used to heat homes and to create electricity at large utilities  Could declining output from fracked natural gas wells ultimately be a boon to green energy sectors like solar  geothermal or wind  BK  Cheap natural gas has completely altered the economics of the electric utility system in North America  Natural gas base rates are now considered the number to beat  even when people are proposing nuclear power  That s a very odd dichotomy because a natural gas well can be set up and generating electricity in a few years  With nuclear  it can be a 25 year process to acquire a site  get the permitting and navigate the maze of regulation and public acceptance for a reactor  What may be a temporary glut of natural gas is truly altering the long term investment climate for nuclear power  TER  Are you less bullish on uranium plays as a result  BK  I m bullish on uranium because there s not going to be enough new uranium mined and milled to meet demand  China has an aggressive plant building program  Every one of those plants needs to lock down a 20  to 30 year supply early in the development cycle  There are not enough new mining plays coming on to supply that  An entire level of uranium supply is also going to go away in a year  Russia is not renewing its agreement with the Megatons to Megawatts program  which purchased nuclear reactor fuel that had been converted from enriched uranium in old nuclear weapons  TER  Are there any particular uranium plays that you re bullish on  BK  Uranium Energy Corp   UEC  extracts uranium via in situ recovery  by washing the uranium out of sandstone using hydrogen peroxide in Texas  It is producing uranium yellowcake at an internal loaded cost of about  18 20 pound  lb   which sells into a spot market at  50 lb  UEC s numbers are going up  It just had a brand new permitting approval at Goliad  Texas  It will be using a fairly simple technology  drilling wells that are less than 1 000 feet deep  It s pumping the fairly benign substance hydrogen peroxide  along with a few other odds and ends  into the sandstones  It is pulling it out with resins and taking it to a fully licensed plant at Hobson  outside of San Antonio  I ve visited the facility  It s all good  The people are good  The technology is good  The economics seem good  I like Uranium Energy as a long term play  It will be very sensitive to rising uranium prices that I forecast in the next year or two  TER  Any others  BK  Over a longer time frame  there is a Canadian company operating in South America called U3O8 Corp   UWE TSX  OTCQX UWEFF   U3O8 has very early stage uranium deposits in Colombia  Guyana and Argentina  I ve visited the Colombian play  It is polymetallic  which means that in the process of recovering the uranium  it is going to be able to pull out phosphate  silver and some intriguing quantities of rare earths  It s very early stage  It is still doing the drilling out in the jungle  It is a speculative play for long term investors who know how to ride these junior resource markets  TER  The green energy sector is in the midst of hard times  It s had more downs than ups during the past few years  How would you characterize alternative energies right now  BK  The renewable energy space has been very frustrating for most investors  It s not to say that you can t produce energy using solar  wind or geothermal  Of course you can  But it gets back to that well known critique about how  when the wind doesn t blow  you have no power  When the sun doesn t shine  you have no power  What s the answer  Europe has a lot of wind and solar power  It creates so much power during windy and sunny times that it actually disrupts the fossil fuel baseload within Europe  Yet  for every windmill and solar field  Europe still needs fossil fuel backups to kick on if the alternative source goes down  This kind of overdevelopment of so called renewables may feel good to the green side  but it has completely disrupted the economics of a lot of utilities across Europe  Many European utilities have ceased being investment grade assets  We haven t built renewables to that scale in the U S  If we do  we would have a similar problem  Rapid overbuilding of green power will degrade the investment quality of many public utilities  which are among the few things that pension funds and institutions can still count on  It s something that investors need to keep an eye on  We blew up the stock market in 2008 with a housing meltdown  Do we want to risk blowing up the market again with a utility meltdown  We re not there yet  but we could be on that track  The Holy Grail for renewable energy is backup battery storage that charges up batteries for continued use after the wind or sun dies down  I ve been focusing on American Vanadium Corp   AVC TSX V   which is developing a vanadium redox battery that s very intriguing and scalable  It s capable of storing immense amounts of electricity  TER  They re only being used right now in Japan  right  BK  The Japanese are leading the charge of commercializing it  The Chinese are close behind  In the U S   it s the typical story of caution and underinvestment  relating to the problem of industry working with public utility commissions  PUCs   Will the PUCs of America build this new tech into the rate base  Nobody wants to be the first one to approve a vanadium redox battery system for a public utility  People don t want to put their necks on the block  But I suspect that a lot of people would love to be the second players at bat  Unfortunately  we are very risk averse in the U S   whereas Japan and China are charging ahead if you ll excuse the pun  Looking ahead  if we crack the code on reliable  large scale storage  it could truly alter the economics of alternative energies  TER  If you were to speculate on which one of those renewable energy sectors will be the first one to be commercially viable  where would your money be  BK  Solar panels are becoming less costly  which is improving the economics for use on a much larger scale  It will be geography dependent  The sunny Southwest and West regions ought to see solar penetration the soonest and in the greatest degree  The idea that there could be a solar powered Boston or Minneapolis is probably not as realistic  TER  One issue with solar is the lack of baseload power  That s a big advantage of geothermal over solar  However  if you want to talk about frustrated investors  look at geothermal energy  BK  I started out Energy   Scarcity Investor with a number of geothermal ideas  I truly believed that these things were on the way up  but the technical problems and capital requirements have been absolutely overwhelming  The fact is that the largest geothermal power producer in the world is Chevron  It picked all that up when it bought Unocal  In 2005  Unocal had developed a lot of geothermal in Indonesia  A lot of green power people hate it when I say that Chevron is the biggest geothermal player  TER  Geothermal is working in Central America  Why isn t it happening in the U S   BK  It s started to happen here in certain areas  such as Nevada  I drove by a geothermal facility on Interstate 80 when I was in Reno recently  Where it works  it works well  But it s getting it to work that s the hard part  The foremost reason is that there are few geologists and engineers who understand this space  It s tough to build a technical team and keep the lights on long enough to make it all work  It s been very frustrating  Even more frustrating is that geothermal is struggling to spread in an environment that is supportive of renewable energy  California and Nevada state legislatures are telling the public utilities to have a certain percent of power coming from renewables by certain dates  The Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are supportive at the regulatory level  There are tax benefits and low interest rates  Still  the geothermal space has not worked out  TER  Have you stopped following geothermal companies  BK  I haven t stopped  I just don t spend a lot of time on them  There are too many other ideas that offer a better return on investment  TER  To conclude  what investable themes in energy should investors look for in 2013  BK  In terms of oil and gas  people should look for surprises  I m forecasting that oil prices are going to rise  There are conventional oil plays that still offer excellent returns to investors  Natural gas prices are also going to drift up as the year goes on  The rapid depletion rates on fracked wells from the past two and three years are going to kick in  and probably with a vengeance  There could be interesting breakthroughs in the alternative space  2013 could be the year when investors start to better understand energy storage  This could be the year that the investing community is going to begin to realize it s out there and that could lead to the beginning of a rebound in the solar and energy storage spaces  TER  Will we see a dramatic rise in uranium prices in 2013  BK  I think the spot price will start to drift up late in the year  People are going to have a lot more on their plates to worry about in the first six months of the year  For some strange reason  a lot of investors have allowed their investment horizons to shorten up  What people ought to be worried about now is that at the end of 2013  there is going to be a big uranium shortage worldwide  It will happen  I don t think that it

17844,239359,FCX,Chinese Economic Data Due Out Overnight  Set Tone For Thursday Trading,opinion,Late Wednesday night  two key data points are set to be released from China which will shed light on the state of the manufacturing sector  At 9 00 pm  the official manufacturing PMI is due out and at 9 45 pm  the HSBC Manufacturing PMI is due out Critics have pointed to the fact that the two surveys have diverged over the past year or so  However  the way the surveys are conducted gives insight into this divergence of the two indexes  The HSBC survey has shown a larger slowdown than the official number in recent months  however this is due to the fact that the official PMI tracks only the largest companies in China while the HSBC survey tracks a larger number of companies who are generally of smaller size  Thus  it is not a question of whether to rely on either of the surveys but more of how to analyze them together With both indexes dropping below 50 in recent months  it is clear that the Chinese manufacturing sector is slowing  The official PMI is expected to show that the manufacturing sector returned to growth in October  as the index is expected to rise to 50 2 from 49 8  The data is still expected to be well below the cycle peak from April of 53 3 and below the post crisis high of 56 6 seen in December of 2009  For reference  the high estimate is 51 8 and the low estimate is 49 8  meaning that no economists expect the rate of contraction to have increased In addition  the China HSBC Manufacturing PMI is due out  The survey is expected to show that the rate of contraction of China s manufacturing sector slowed in September but still contracted  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect a reading of 49 1  higher than September s 47 9 reading  The high estimate is 49 2 and the low is 48 1 with most estimates clustered between 49 and 49 2 A strong reading from the data would create a risk on environment globally  all else equal  Materials stocks would most likely rally  especially Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold  FCX   which is rather positively correlated with the official PMI index  meaning that as China s manufacturing sector expands  Freeport performs better  Also  the Aussie dollar  FXA  is used as a proxy for investing in Chinese growth by currency traders and would most likely bounce on a strong number Luckily  there is no significant data set to be released out of Europe overnight  so investors should be able to trade based on the sentiment from China  The ISM Manufacturing Index and the Markit U S  PMI will also helped in setting the tone for U S  trading Thursday following initial jobless claims and setting up Friday s nonfarm payroll release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics By Matthew Kanterman,2012-11-04,Benzinga ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/chinese-economic-data-due-out-overnight,-set-tone-for-thursday-trading-142037",142037
17845,239360,FCX,Royal Bank Of Australia Keeps Rates On Hold  Surprises Market,opinion,The Royal Bank of Australia  RBA  overnight released its November interest rate decision and unexpectedly kept rates on hold  The RBA kept the benchmark cash lending rate at 3 25 percent in November  defying economist expectations of a 0 25 percent cut to 3 00 percent  The holding of rates follows October s decision where the Bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis points In fact  only one economist of the 27 surveyed by Bloomberg has predicted the previous two decisions accurately  The economists at ANZ bank predicted that the RBA would cut rates in October and keep them on hold in November  The RBA cited recent upticks in inflation and better signs out of China as reasons for keeping rates on hold The RBA was slightly concerned with recent inflation data coming in higher than expected  a key reason for keeping rates on hold  but also noted that wage growth remains low  Generally  inflation can not take off unless wages  which are regarded as  sticky  by economists  start to inflate  Thus  the lack of wage growth could mean that the spurt in inflation is transitory and not fundamental The Bank also noted that China appears to be bottoming along with the rest of the economy  In its post decision communique  the Bank said that Chinese growth has stabilized  The RBA has a unique view of the Chinese economy both due to its geographic proximity but also because of the trade ties between Australia and China through raw materials  Thus  these comments should not be taken lightly and could confirm recent data trends that China is bottoming or has in fact already bottomed Officials were concerned about the strength of the domestic currency and of commodity prices though  The RBA members warned in the communique that the Aussie dollar remains strong  one reason that exports have stayed lower than anticipated  Also  the bank is worried about commodity prices being lower than they were this year  as a large portion of Australia s economy is reliant on strong exports of raw materials An interesting fact to note about the lack of a rate cut is that  although economists were expecting a cut  the market was decidedly in disagreement with the economists  Using interest swaps to extrapolate the chances of a cut just before the release of the statement  the market had only priced in approximately a 45 percent chance of a cut in rates  Therefore  either traders knew something that economists did not know or that the Aussie swap traders were simply just smarter than their forecasting cousins The Aussie dollar rallied markedly on the news and the Australian stock market outperformed other Asian bourses  The Aussie dollar popped from near 1 0360 to near 1 0420 against the U S  dollar on the release and has traded higher since  Currently  the pair trades at 1 0433  just below resistance and stops at 1 0450  Also  the EUR AUD cross dropped to the lowest level since early September on the release as aussie strength weighed on the euro  The aussie also gained against the Japanese yen as investors piled into the carry trade  getting the higher than expected yield in the aussie as a rate cut would have meant lower interest on deposited currency Australian stocks also showed relative outperformance in Asian trading  The S P ASX Index rose 0 24 percent overnight while other regional indexes suffered losses on global growth and European fears  For comparison  Chinese stocks fell 0 38 percent overnight and Japanese shares also fell 0 36 percent Materials stocks rose slightly in U S  trading at the open on the largely positive comments from the RBA  The Materials Select Sector SPDR  XLB  rose 0 17 percent and notable out performers included Rio Tinto PLC  RIO  and BHP Billiton PLC  BBL   which each rallied nearly 1 0 percent at the New York open  Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold  FCX  also rallied  but not as strongly as its British competitors By Matthew Kanterman,2012-11-07,Benzinga ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/royal-bank-of-australia-keeps-rates-on-hold,-surprises-market-142551",142551

17874,239389,FCX,Best   Worst ETFs   Mutual Funds  Materials Sector,opinion,The Materials sector ranks fifth out of the ten sectors as detailed in my sector roadmap  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 11 ETFs and 11 mutual funds in the Materials sector as of July 12  2012    Figure 1 shows the five best and worst rated Materials ETFs and Figure 2 ranks from best to worst the nine Materials mutual funds that meet our liquidity standards  Not all Materials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 30 to 156   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks    To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Materials sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings    Investors should not buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off    Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsPowerShares Dynamic Basic Materials  PYZ  is excluded from Figure 1 because its total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  where available    Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsICON Funds  ICON Materials Fund  ICBMX  and ICON Funds  ICON Materials Fund  ICBCX  are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards iShares S P North American Natural Resources Sector Index Fund  IGE  is my top rated Materials ETF and Fidelity Select Portfolios  Fidelity Advisor Materials Fund  FMFEX  is my top rated Materials mutual fund  Both earn my Neutral rating SPDR S P Metals   Mining ETF  XME  is my worst rated Materials ETF and ICON Funds  ICON Materials Fund  ICBAX  is my worst rated Materials mutual fund  Both earn my Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 49 out of the 232 stocks  over 28  of the total net assets  held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  there are not any Materials ETFs or Materials mutual funds that get an Attractive or better rating The takeaway is  Materials ETFs and mutual funds are not picking the right stocks and are undeserving of their fees no matter how small Figure 3  Materials Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management    I do not recommend that investors buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds  Instead  I would recommend buying a basket of individual Attractive or better rated Materials stocks    Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold  Inc   FCX  is one of my favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  Freeport McMoRan is one of the largest copper  gold  and molybdenum mining companies in the world  Although investors often assume that mining companies trade according to the price movements of the commodities they produce  not all Materials companies generate the same profits per ounce of gold or pound of copper  In that regard  FCX is one of the best  FCX s ROIC is 16 2   meaning that it generates higher returns on invested capital than 86  of other Materials companies  Despite fluctuations in commodity prices  FCX earned a ROIC that beat its WACC in each of the last 7 years  generating the economic profits that drive shareholder value  Furthermore  the market is pricing Freeport McMoRan as if its operating profitability will permanently decline by 48   This pessimistic valuation makes a highly profitable company like FCX a Very Attractive stock right now    Weyerhaeuser  WY  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating  Weyerhaeuser has not earned a ROIC that beat its WACC a single time in the 14 years I have covered the company  In fact  WY s ROIC at 2 1  places it in the bottom 15  of Materials companies  Despite Weyerhaeuser s consistent record of paltry returns and ineffective capital allocation  the market s valuation implies high expectations for future growth and profitability  In order to justify its current stock price  Weyerhaeuser needs compounded annual revenue growth of over 15  for the next 20 years  a daunting task for a Materials company  When you combine a sky high valuation  consistently unimpressive returns  and Weyerhaeuser s nearly  4 5 billion in debt and  1 5 billion in underfunded pensions  you get a high risk low reward stock    168 stocks of the 3000  I cover are classified as Materials stocks  but due to style drift  Materials ETFs and mutual funds hold 232 stocks    Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Materials ETFs and mutual funds     Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst ETFs Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 5

17877,239392,FCX,Freeport McMoran Is Ready To Fall Off  A Cliff,opinion,For the near term and tactical traders out there  it appears Freeport McMoran  FCX  is offering a decent short opportunity on a small and imperfect Head and Shoulders pattern that makes for a nice apex to its most recent Rising Wedge  FCX s Rising Wedge outlined in the darker trendlines is confirmed for its target of  31 while the small H S will confirm right around  34 65 for a target of  31 83 and fairly close to previous bearish target for FCX  Such a potential move down seems consistent with its apparent inability to rise above its 200 DMA with these patterns suggesting FCX may soon be near the bottom of this year s sideways trend and back below the 50 DMA   This makes sense  of course  in one of the more fractal chart displays out there with FCX s very scary long term chart showing an uncanny similarity to the six month daily chart above not to mention the long term chart of copper with its multi year Head and Shoulders pattern and long term Rising Wedge   FCX s long term H S confirms around  28 for a very conservative target of about  15 while its Rising Wedge born of QE1 that carries a full target of about  7 and the technical reason this chart stands out as truly frightening and something made worse by the fact that it is a likely reflection of the macro picture and not something specific to FCX alone   Unless FCX can rise above its 50 DMA and then its last protruding high right below  50  all of these bearish aspects should be taken very seriously even though it is tough to determine the precise timing of this very serious decline with some of the other risk asset charts suggesting it may come at any point ahead of next spring   Put otherwise  it appears that FCX is ready to fall off of a cliff ,2012-09-06,Abigail Doolittle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freeport-mcmoran-is-ready-to-fall-off--a-cliff-135388,135388
17878,239393,FCX,World Markets Modestly Higher Friday ,opinion, FORECAST STOCKS  The European debt contagion has been  kicked down the road  a bit further as Spanish and Italian short and long term bond yields have moderated recently given the ECB  plan  to buy bonds of up to 3 years in maturity   but only if asked  and only if conditionality is imposed upon those asking  The Fed has also changed its game from  inflation fighting  to  unemployment fighting   and with any war   they will go further and farther than anyone believes in printing money to achieve their ends  This will support all asset prices ultimately STRATEGY  The S P 500 remains above long term support at the 160  wma at 1228  which delineates bull bear markets  The much followed 200 dma support level stands at 1353  and remains the bulls  Maginot Line   We ve noted this is perhaps one of the  weirdest rallies  we ve ever seen  and it causes us a great deal of consternation  But the new Fed policy is directly at stocks  expect an S P all time high test at 1576 WORLD STOCK MARKEST ARE MODESTLY HIGHER THIS FRIDAY as a rather  boring  week has transgressed into today s trade  The very same issues that were on the table last week are on the table this week  ECB  FED  BOJ an PBOC easing monetary policy  European 10 year note yields are moving lower  there is a rumor of a Spanish bailout request to come in the very near future  There is very little else to report on in the economic sphere because with all this  liquidity  being put into the markets it all matters very little  But be that as it may  yesterday s jobless claims figures rose a bit  while the Philly Fed index remained negative showing contraction Thus  the markets are in the nether lands  and we can only rely upon price action  and for the moment   it is rather good in the sense is that it is corrective  This means  buy the dips  until major support is violated   which in our mind is when the S P breaks below roughly 1395  Until then  buying stock with bottoming patterns and well defined risk points is where we should be trading  Today  we want to add another long position in Freeport  McMoran  FCX   which has recently broken out above long term resistance at its 300 day moving average and corrected back to this very level  We are doing so given the bullish copper chart show on page 1 in the lead chart position  note the bullish consolidation breakout and positive model underpinnings Copper looks to move sharply higher  and if it has a PhD in economics   then it means the economy is about to strengthen   with copper moving to new highs  FCX is the best way to play this move  Outside of this  we ll sit tight with our current positions  and consider the environment as it develops To read the entire report please click on the pdf file below ,2012-09-21,Richard Rhodes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/world-markets-modestly-higher-friday-137364,137364
17880,239395,FCX,S P 500 Earnings At Record  Index Still 7  Below March  2000 High,opinion,  Alcoa  AA   Costco  COST   JP Morgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  report this week  with Alcoa reporting after the bell on Tuesday  Costco reports before the bell on Wednesday  and JPM Morgan and Wells Fargo report before the bell on Friday morning  Alcoa  s report will kick off the 3rd quarter earnings season for the S P 500   is our preview of AA s 3rd quarter  Alcoa s valuation is compelling  but there are significant headwinds being faced  Still  the stock looks to be bottoming for the last year  A trade above  11 75 or the 200 week moving average has not been seen since August  2008  A note out of Trefis late last week  notes that the London Metal Excahnge s price of aluminum started at  1 900 in early Q3  and ended at  2 100 with a lot of volatility in between   We remain long AA in tax deferred accounts   The amount of aluminum in inventory is still substantial from what I read  Most investors looking for Basic Materials exposure have gravitated towards Freeport McMoran  FCX   which is tied to the price of copper rather than AA and aluminum  JP Morgan and Wells Fargo will be important 3rd quarter reports on Friday  With the capital markets strong in q3  including record corporate bond issuance  can JP Morgan report an upside surprise   JPM s tailwinds began late July  but was it enough to drive healthy earnings upside for q3  12   Hard to believe Wells Fargo will have a tough quarter with mortgage rates so low and still gravitating towards all time lows  WFC is now thought to total about 1 3rd of all new mortgage originations  We ll have earnings preview for both over on Seeking Alpha early this week  Financial stocks started moving in early August   we have not seen relative outperformance in Financials for a while  with the exception of V  and MA and a few select others   Long JPM  WFC  V     The Investment Company Institute continues to pound on the relative mix of equity mutual fund outflows versus bond fund inflows  Is this a contrarian sentiment indicator   is a great article from Schaeffer s Investment Research  SIR  on the dynamic between fund flows and investor sentiment   150 million have left domestic equity funds per SIR  while  275 billion has flowed into bond funds  My guess is this won t end well     is another Schaffer s piece about short interest that also seems to bode well for higher equity prices  Note how the author concludes that the last time we saw this short interest configuration  the S P 500 rallied 30    Thanks to Gary Morrow of Yosemite Asset Management in San Luis Obispo  Ca for pointing this out to us     Mega cap retail   Home Depot  HD  and Walmart  WMT  continue to trade well  We bought more of both this week  although in small amounts as both stocks remain overbought  Home Depot hit a series of all time highs in Dec  99  Jan  00 and March  00 near  69 and hasnt been back there since  The stock is now closing in on this key technical resistance level  Walmart  WMT  took out its  70 high from the late 1990 s in late July  2012  Both retailers are not that expensively valued  but more importantly  with HD s market cap of  95 bl and WMT s  252 bl  I like to see this part of the market  large and mega cap  trading better  Both companies do not report again until November  12   Long HD and WMT     Large cap pharma had another good week  Pfizer  PFE   Merck  MRK  and Amgen  AMGN  were added to again this past week  We like JNJ too  but we need to see an earnings catalyst   Long PFE  MRK  AMGN and JNJ    Listened to a strategist on CNBC this past week  one of the many paraded on throughout the week   and this person has a  140 eps estimate for the S P 500 in 2017  at which point he predicted that the earnings cycle will peak  Not one CNBC anchor or interviewer challenged the strategist on the prediction  in terms of how accurate he had been up till now  which sectors would lead  or which stocks would perform the best  With a  140 eps estimate  the S P 500 is now trading at 10 x   17 earnings  Does it matter   Not really  As of this weekend  ThomsonReuters is looking for 11 7  earnings growth for the S P 500 for 2013  which would result in a  112 eps estimate for 2013 or about consistent with the current  forward 4 quarter  estimate  An  140 eps estimate off the expected  102 projected at the end of 2012 is almost a 50  increase in 6 years  A straight arithmetic average return   in terms of earnings growth   is 8  per year  Maybe the quiet bull market this year has a basis in fundamentals after all    JP Morgan puts out their  Guide to the Markets  at the end of every quarter  This week was no exception  It is great information if you are a JP Morgan client as we are  As of 9 30 12  there was no significant style difference between growth and value  and even small  mid and large cap for year t0 date or quarterly returns  While there are still big performance differences from the  07 peak and off the  09 low  in terms of large cap  small cap  the returns are very close this year  between 14    16   There is no big advantage being invested one way or the other at present  and large cap seems to be narrowing the long term gap  In terms of valuation for the S P 500  here are the valuation metrics as of 9 30 12  per JP Morgan s  Guide to the Markets   check our post yesterday for a quick preview   P E   12 9 x  P B   2 3 x  P CF   9 x   although cash flow data on the S P 500 is tough to find  seek and you shall find  and sure enough the S P 500 s cash flow valuation is actually lower than I thought when we posted yesterday   P Sales   1 3 x  PEG   1 7 x  Div Yield 2 3  Although the stock market could use a 3    5  correction given its overbought status  the market s fundamentals   valuation remain attractive  the technicals flash green  and the sentiment  as detailed by Schaeffer s Investment Research  also suggests continued higher stock prices  We look for q3  12 earnings to be better than expected  in the mid single digit growth range  and S P 500 revenues to be slightly positive  possibly up 2   q3  12 will be the nadir for S P 500 earnings in our opinion  One of our earnings tracking metrics has turned decidely green  in that regard  since August 1  and we ll be out with it next week

218841,440357,FCX,Freeport McMoRan Follows Copper Down on Another Virus Selloff,news,"By Kim Khan
Investing   Freeport McMoRan sank in midday trading Monday as the world s biggest copper producer fell afoul of the pervasive virus concerns and effect on the Chinese economy 
Freeport McMoRan  NYSE FCX  shares sank 6  
Copper prices also sank  off 3   heading for their ninth straight down session  which would be the metal s longest losing streak in six years 
China  the world s top buyer of metal  is hitting worldwide investments as concerns of a wider spreading of the coronavirus and an economic slowdown grew  The government has taken emergency measures to contain the disease  like extending the Lunar New Year holiday  as the death toll hit 81 
Copper  regarded as a bellwether of the global economy  has given up all of its gains since early December when a rally pushed prices up nearly 10  to eight month highs as investors welcomed the first phase of a U S  China trade deal and hoped for a rebound in economic growth 
 Chinese demand accounts for about 50  of the majority of base metals and looking at the latest data regarding the coronavirus  it s now spread quite widely   said analyst Timothy Wood Dow at BMO Capital in London 
 On Friday  we didn t know this  it seemed quite contained  Now this wider geographical spread is very concerning  so that s feeding through to the market  
Freeport sold off last week following its fourth quarter earnings report  While profit was better than expected  it was down more than 80  from the year ago period 
Shares had been up sharply going into the report
