5710,227225,MITSY,Secret Scheme To Manipulate Silver Price ,opinion,"The lawsuits against banks that alleges they engaged in a secret scheme to manipulate the price of Silver bullion is proceeding 
Litigation alleging that Deutsche Bank  Bank of Nova Scotia and HSBC Plc illegally fixed the price of silver were centralised in a Manhattan federal court yesterday  The banks have been accused of rigging the price of billions of dollars in silver to the detriment of investors globally 
Lawsuits filed by investors since July over the allegations were consolidated yesterday in the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York  following an order issued last Thursday by the U S  Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation  a special body of federal judges that decides when and where to consolidate related lawsuits 
The banks abused their position of controlling the daily silver fix to reap illegitimate profit from trading  hurting other investors in the silver market who use the benchmark in billions of dollars of transactions  according to the suit

The U S  Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled that the cases should be handled by U S  District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan  who is already overseeing similar litigation over alleged gold price fixing 
Three lawsuits were originally filed in Manhattan  and two were filed in Brooklyn  The plaintiffs in the Brooklyn lawsuits had sought to have the litigation consolidated there 
The banks had also asked that the litigation be consolidated in Brooklyn  in the Eastern District of New York  However  the multidistrict litigation panel said Manhattan made more sense because the defendants all had corporate offices there and also because the cases involved issues similar to the gold litigation 
The plaintiffs allege that the banks abused their power as participants in the silver fix  a London based benchmark pricing method dating back to the Victorian era  in which banks fixed silver prices once a day by phone  
In August  the system was replaced by a new benchmark system administered by the CME  Chicago Mercantile Exchange  and Thomson Reuters  NYSE TRI  
HSBC  NYSE HSBC  spokesman Neil Brazil declined to comment and representatives of the other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
This follows the initiation of similar actions against some bullion banks for alleged gold price manipulation earlier this year  The three named banks  Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   Bank of Nova Scotia  NYSE BNS  and HSBC are alleged to have abused their position at the LBMA to profit from inside knowledge 
The fixing of the price of silver is a daily operation where banks on the panel of the LBMA agree on a price for the precious metals which are then used throughout the financial  jewellery and mining industries throughout the day 
It is alleged that some of the banks who fix the price  position themselves advantageously in the silver market before the price is made public  
 Defendants have a strong financial incentive to establish positions in both physical silver and silver derivatives prior to the public release of silver fixing results  allowing them to reap large illegitimate profits   plaintiff Scott Nicholson told the AFP 
Separately  Bullion Desk reported yesterday that J P Morgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  is now the fifth accredited member of the silver pricing benchmark  the LBMA has confirmed  with others parties  in the pipeline   a spokesman said 
The American multinational bank which has been the subject of silver manipulation allegations by Max Keiser and others  took part in its first silver benchmarking session yesterday 
A spokesperson said they had completed  strict regulatory controls  for accredited members  
JP Morgan becomes the fifth member  alongside HSBC Bank USA  Mitsui   Company  OTC MITSY  Precious Metals  the Bank of Nova Scotia   ScotiaMocatta and UBS  NYSE UBS  AG 
Furthermore  the LBMA has confirmed that several other parties are also in the process of joining the list  subject to passing regulatory requirements 
Several Chinese banks have expressed interest in participating in the new global price setting mechanism for silver  according to the head of the LBMA 
The LBMA ushered in a new era of electronic benchmarking for London s precious metals market in August when an algorithm was used for the first time to set the benchmark price for silver after recent scandals regarding price fixing and concerns about the nature of the gold and silver fix 
It will be interesting to see if Chinese banks partake in the new fix process as the concern is that the fixes remain the play things of certain western banks and are not representative of global physical demand and supply of actual gold and silver bullion
