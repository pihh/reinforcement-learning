Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  and welcome to Zions Bancorporation s fourth quarter 2019 earnings results webcast   Operator instructions  I would now like to hand the conference over to Director of Investor Relations James Abbott James Abbott    Director of Investor Relations Thank you  sir  and good evening  We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings  For our agenda today  Harris Simmons  chairman and chief executive officer  will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance figures  after which Paul Burdiss  our chief financial officer  will provide additional detail on Zions  financial condition  wrapping up with our financial outlook  Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean  president and chief operating officer  and Michael Morris  chief credit officer  Referencing Slide 2  I would like to remind you that during this call  we will be making forward looking statements  although actual results may differ materially  We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward looking information  which applies equally to the statements made during this call  A copy of the full earnings release  as well as the supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation com  We will be referring to the slides during this call The earnings release  the related slide presentation  and this earnings call contain several references to non GAAP measures  including pre provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio  which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts  The use of such non GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures  A full reconciliation of the difference between these measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents  and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation  We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour   Operator instructions  I will now turn the time over to Harris  Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks very much  James  and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results  Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights  which I ll cover in the next few slides  And so I m going to move right to Slide 4  Slide 4 shows a time series of the bottom line earnings per share results  We reported earnings per share of  0 97  As noted on the slide  in the fourth quarter of 2019  there were three items that adversely affected the earnings per share figure by a net  0 17  Also shown is the adjusted pre provision net revenue  which as noted  already excludes the impact of  37 million of noninterest expense related to severance and restructuring charges  However  the PPNR number also includes the positive impact of the derivative valuation gain on client related interest rate swaps and the  10 million adverse impact associated with the resolution of a self identified operational issue  Moving to Slide 5  The efficiency ratio is  of course  a function of both revenue and expense  With a relatively quick change in the trajectory of interest rates in mid 2019  and the expectation of such a change would create a revenue headwind  We took action to adapt quickly on the expense front in order to actively manage our profitability  We announced three months ago  in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release  a plan to cut about 5  of our staff positions and a number of other positions that were not yet filled  We also said that the resulting reduction in salaries and benefits would be roughly proportional to the number of positions eliminated and that these reductions should be reflected in our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2020  We ll continue to work to reduce a variety of costs and execute on plans we ve announced to realign certain branches during 2020  In short  we ve tried hard to respond to a rapidly changing business environment  really an interest rate  competitive environment  And I believe these efforts should help to offset some of the interest rate related revenue challenges we expect in 2020  Turning to Slide 6  One of Zions  strengths is its sizable portfolio of noninterest bearing deposits  which account for more than 40  of total deposits  During the fourth quarter  average noninterest bearing deposits increased an annualized 7 5   Average total deposits increased an annualized 10 5   The cost of deposits declined six basis points  which equals a 12  linked quarter improvement relative to our third quarter total cost of deposits  Going now to Slide 7  Credit costs remained low  Consistent with my comments last quarter  credit losses have been somewhat episodic within our loan portfolio attributable to problems specific to a small handful of borrowers  unique circumstances  Net charge offs for the full year were a modest eight basis points  generally consistent with our expectations for the year  Nonaccrual loans and loans of 90 days past due continued to show improvement  Our nonperforming assets plus loans 90 days past due expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned at 51 basis points was four basis points lower than the year ago period  Our improved risk management and credit performance have been key factors in an improvement in our debt ratings in recent months due largely to the strong credit quality of the loan portfolio  resulting in part from a shift in recent years and the portfolio s composition to what we believe is a less risky credit profile and due to a reduced risk profile generally  We have been able to reduce our capital rates to a level closer to that of our peers  We re pleased to have repurchased more than 3  of our outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and more than 12  of our shares during 2019  In addition to a substantial buyback program during the past few quarters  we ve also been delivering an annualized common dividend yield of nearly 3   Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 10 2   Next  let me step back from the financial data and update you on just one of a variety of strategic initiatives we have under way  and that s digital delivery  Shown on Slide 8  we are enhancing digital experiences for our customers with a goal of being quite competitive for the best providers  financial services products  banks and nonbanks alike  while remaining focused on continuous improvement in streamlining our processes  thereby keeping noninterest expense under control  We continue to make solid progress  notably in small business and consumer digital account opening and small business and mortgage digital loan application processes  Additionally  we are on track to significantly enhance our online consumer and small business mobile platforms later this year  Our core replacement initiative remains on track  and I ve noticed that at least a couple of other of our peers have recently announced that they would be embarking on some form of core systems replacement projects  We ll spend a significant amount of time on our core systems replacement and our other technology initiatives at our Investor Day in just two weeks  With that overview  I m going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail  Paul Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Harris  and good evening  everyone  Thanks for joining us  I ll begin on Slide 9  which highlights two measures of balance sheet profitability  return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity  As noted  the fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by the severance and restructuring charges and the resolution of an operational issue and positively impacted by a derivative valuation gain on customer related interest rate swaps  Combined  these factors adversely impacted return on average assets by about 20 basis points and return on average tangible common equity by about 200 basis points  We remain focused on continuing to improve balance sheet profitability  On Slide 10  looking at the chart on the left  Zions  net interest income declined slightly compared to the prior year period  While average earning assets increased by 3  during that time frame  the yield on earning assets decreased by 17 basis points  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by two basis points  leading to a decline in the rate spread of 19 basis points and a decline in the net interest margin of 21 basis points  Net interest income was down 3  over this period as the decline in net interest margin was somewhat offset by balance sheet growth  Turning to a linked quarter view  The net interest margin compressed two basis points relative to the third quarter as the lower interest rate environment continued to impact loan and securities yields and also led to lower borrowing costs  The waterfall chart on the right depicts the elements that resulted in the linked quarter charge in change in net interest margin  Within the loan yields bar  about half was portfolio churn  sometimes referred to as the front book and back book  while the other half was due to the change in benchmark interest rates  On the funding side  the net interest margin impact of the cost of funds decline was evenly mixed between the cost of deposits and the cost of wholesale funds  As Harris noted  highlights in the quarter included the growth of deposits and the decline in the cost of average deposits  While our cost of funds increased three basis points over the year ago period  it decreased a solid 14 basis points from the third quarter of 2019 from 57 basis points    to 57 basis points from 71 basis points or about a 20  improvement in cost  This was primarily due to lower rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities in addition to a favorable mix shift as solid deposit growth made it possible to reduce wholesale borrowings  We expect that the net interest margin will compress further during the next couple of quarters  reflecting the forward curve and our best estimates of loan yields  deposit costs  balance sheet turn  and other factors  Slide 11 highlights a key component of net interest income loan and deposit growth and breaks them down by both rate and volume  Average loans grew 5  over the year ago period  Average loans in the fourth quarter were essentially flat to the prior quarter  As we have noted previously  it is not unusual to observe a quarterly ebb and flow to balance sheet growth due to several factors  including customer demand  the balance of loan growth and payoffs and seasonality  Over the prior year period  the yield on loans decreased 23 basis points  and relative to the prior quarter  the yield on loans decreased 19 basis points  As I noted in the discussion of the previous slide  about half of the linked quarter compression in loan yields was due to movement in benchmark interest rates  and the other half can be attributed to the churn of the portfolio  where new yields are 15 to 20 basis points less than maturing loan yields  Shifting to funding  Average total deposits increased five basis points over the prior year period Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Five percentage points Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Sorry  five percentage points over the prior year period and a solid 10 percentage points annualized growth rate when compared to the prior quarter  As I noted last quarter  maintaining this rate of growth in deposits will be difficult  especially with seasonal factors typically seen in the first few months of the year  Nevertheless  we expect moderate deposit growth to accompany our loan growth for 2020  Slide 12 is a new slide and shows the changes in our investment portfolio size and yield and changes in our borrowed funds position size and yield  As I have mentioned on previous calls  we reevaluated the on balance sheet liquidity needs a few quarters ago and  in conjunction with that analysis  elected to bring down the size of the securities portfolio  Simultaneously  we were able to achieve solid growth in deposits  The combination of these two trends allowed us to pay down wholesale borrowings by about  2 billion in the fourth quarter  As a reminder  almost all of the wholesale borrowings are variable rate  These changes in the lower interest rate environment has allowed the cost of borrowed funds decrease 20 basis points relative to the prior quarter and 44 basis points from the year ago period  Turning to loan growth  Slide 13 depicts year over year period end loan growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolio  Municipal loan growth has been a highlight for a couple of years now  The marginal credit quality there is very good with the average new deal being about  4 million  and the probability of default being relatively low  Loan growth across the enterprise also reflects our credit risk appetite and active management of portfolio concentration limits  On Slide 14  customer related fees were up 2  from the year ago period  In certain categories  our long tenured and deep client relationships enable stable core fee income  This includes commercial account fees  card fees and retail and business banking fees  We have greater growth opportunities in certain other segments and have been working to improve the revenue from these areas  Notably  we have seen strength in capital markets product sales  which were up 19  from the prior year  as well as wealth management and trust fees  which are up 14  from the prior year period  As shown on Slide 15  noninterest expense increased 12  to  472 million from  420 million in the year ago quarter  adversely impacted by the previously mentioned  37 million in severance and restructuring costs and  10 million for the resolution of an operational issue  Excluding the impact of these items  noninterest expense reflects the ongoing efforts to reduce expenses  streamline operations and improve overall efficiency with notable reductions in advertising  credit related expense  and professional and legal services over the prior year period  During the fourth quarter  we ran a full parallel allowance for credit loss process  one for the incurred loss accounting standard and other for the new current expected credit loss or CECL accounting standard  Slide 16 reports the results of that parallel run  We have highlighted the various changes that may impact the allowance for each of the major loan portfolios with a total estimated impact on the allowance for credit losses at the bottom of the table  Our day one impact on the allowance for credit losses was a 5  reduction associated with the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard  I might add a word of caution here  We ve noted many times in the past that we expect our allowance to become more volatile under the new CECL process as it is now subject to economic forecasts that may move materially from quarter to quarter  Therefore  our day one impact in the allowance for credit losses  which will be set at March 31  2020  may be materially different  Now I ll turn to the outlook slide on Page 17  This is our outlook    financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the fourth quarter of 2019  Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged at moderately increasing  Our outlook for net interest income remains slightly decreasing  incorporating our outlook of the current shape of the yield curve and our continued expectation that balance sheet growth will be more than offset by the continued churn of the portfolio  We will continue to actively manage our deposit pricing in a lower rate environment  and this may present some upside opportunity to this outlook  Regarding customer related fees  we expect slightly increasing customer related fees a year from now when compared to the fourth quarter  Building on our prior comments related to noninterest expense  we expect the overall level of adjusted noninterest expense in 2020 to be consistent with or slightly below adjusted noninterest expense for 2019  And as a reminder  the position elimination announced in October of 2019 will begin to impact the run rate of noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2020  Also  as we have previously disclosed  we are in the process of resolving our defined benefit pension plan  which is expected to result in a onetime charge likely toward the middle of 2020  Our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense excludes this charge  Finally  regarding capital management  our CET1 ratio has declined to 10 2  from 11 7  a year ago  Our current level of capital is more than sufficient to support the risk on our balance sheet  implied by our internal stress testing  Our CET1 ratio remains above the median of our peers  We continue to believe that remaining stronger than the peer median is important  Maintaining a risk profile  which we believe compares favorably to peers while also maintaining relatively strong positions in capital and liquidity  is prudent  Therefore  we expect the capital return to shareholders in 2020 will be significantly less than it was in 2019  assuming no material change in the macroeconomic environment  Said differently  we expect our capital ratios to remain relatively stable throughout 2020 when compared to the levels reported this quarter  This concludes our prepared remarks  Andrew  would you open the line for questions  Thank you  Questions   Answers  OperatorCertainly   Operator instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Great  Thanks  I guess  maybe just to start off  I saw net charge offs jump up a little bit to  22 million  Obviously  I did not see a related increase in your provision expense  Can you just provide a little more detail on what drove the higher charge offs in the quarter Michael Morris    Chief Credit Officer Sure  Ken  This is Michael Morris  We had one modest charge off in Q4 that drove the overall charge offs for the year  Beyond that  we saw stabilization and stronger probability of default metrics around the rest of the portfolio along with other improvements  So it was not material enough to drive an increase in CECL Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer And I would say it was not related to any other segment of the portfolio  I would characterize it  Michael  correct me if I m wrong  but I would characterize it as sort of one off charge off Michael Morris    Chief Credit Officer Right Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Was there any industry or a particular industry it was in Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It s in a recreation industry  And I was just    and it was a  10 8 million charge off that kind of came out of the blue Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Got it  OK Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So that we threw in the towel and walked on a large investment  and we and some others took the hit Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer As Paul noted  there s nothing systemic  It s not like we have a portfolio of these kinds of loans  etc   etc Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Gotcha  OK  And I ll refrain from asking if it was a federally legal recreation type Michael Morris    Chief Credit Officer It was very legal Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer It was very legal Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Yes  It was legal  OK  Just fine  Just    sorry  And then sorry  just my follow up question  On the expenses  obviously  you took the severance and restructuring charges  totally get it  It seems that your guidance is still sort of unchanged or sort of already consensus in myself are already building in sort of that modest reduction in  20 versus  19  Is that just solely the fact that you adjusted your guidance back in 3Q such that    because I guess  I m just trying to figure out like how meaningful that is going to be in first quarter when you start to see the benefit from those restructuring actions Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Yes  The outlook is unchanged because  as you said  we had sort of full information by the time we reported third quarter earnings toward the end of October  And so that will    the expense reductions that we have undertaken were baked into that outlook that we provided in the third quarter  And as it relates to run rate  we are saying kind of flat to slightly decreasing relative to full year adjusted 2019  And we re saying that because while these reductions are allowing us to continue to make the investments that we think are important to run the business  including continuing to invest in our people Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  Great  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Good afternoon  John John Pancari    Evercore ISI    Analyst On the NIM  I I know you gave the comment that you expect some incremental compression here over the next couple of quarters  Can you just help maybe size that up  Is it similar to the magnitude of the compression that you saw in the fourth quarter of about a couple of bps  Is that the pace that we re looking for  And what s the likely driver going to be  Is it ongoing modest pressure on the loan book  Is that where the pressure is coming from Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer John  as you know  we don t provide specifically guidance on the net interest margin  We do  however  provide an outlook on loan growth  And net interest income  which you see in our outlook slide  So I don t want to go further than that  I will say that the ongoing net interest margin pressure would really be related to the loan portfolio churn that I described in my prepared remarks  And also  as I said  the opportunity  I think  is repricing deposits  And so to the extent we are successful there  obviously  and are able to reprice our deposits lower  that will have a positive impact John Pancari    Evercore ISI    Analyst OK  Got it  And then on the loan growth front  just want to get a little bit more color around what areas of the loan portfolio do you expect to drive the bulk of the growth as you look into 2020  And more specifically  regarding the municipal loan book  I know you ve seen some really good growth there  Which appetite for incremental growth there do you have a target size that you re willing to let that bulk reach Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer John  this is Scott McLean  And our growth should continue to look like the year to date panel that you see on Slide 22  basically 50  to 60  coming from C I  That s where municipal sits  And we don t feel like we re reaching any limits in terms of our municipal growth  It s been growing rapidly  largely because it s coming off a very small base  But the underwriting procedures we re using and practices are highly consistent with what we ve done for many  many years there  We just have leaned into the area  covering more geography  more densely than we have historically  So we see continued growth in municipal  But the growth in 2020  it should look like  19  probably 50  to 60  C I  We ll see some modest growth in CRE  but it would probably be low single digits  And then consumer  I think we ll continue to see will represent 20  of our growth  plus or minus  Largely    it s largely driven by our one to four family and home equity businesses  I would just note on the fourth quarter being soft  the four quarters ending in the third quarter of  19 were all very strong  But if you look back prior to then  we had two or three soft quarters in a row  And so we re not especially alarmed by having a soft fourth quarter here John Pancari    Evercore ISI    Analyst Got it  All right  Thanks  guys  Appreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Thank you  Good evening  Two questions  First  can you just talk about the operational issue you outlined in the nonrecurring items  And secondly  other than technology investments and your progress there and strategy there  could you talk about maybe the other topics you re going to focus on  on February 6 of the Investor Day Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer Sure  Jennifer  This is Scott  The operational issue  I would just describe as as we    one  it was self identified  Secondly  as we continue to adopt common practices  we just saw some disparity in a certain pricing practice that we had that we thought we really just needed to double back and create consistency over a period of time  That s all it was  The dollar amount is larger than we would have liked  but we felt like it was the right thing to do  So no real story there other than just creating consistency in our practices across the company relative to how we price items to our customers  And for the Investor Day  Paul  do you want to take it Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I can  At a high level  yes  we are going to talk about technology as you would expect  But I think the idea this year that we re going to talk about technology in the context of our business  And really demonstrate how    kind of how we re going to market and where we re focused in our business  how technology is going to support that  And then  of course  provide an update on credit and financial outlook Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Thank you Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Jennifer OperatorOur next question comes from the line Erika Najarian with Bank of America Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thank you for taking my question  So in thinking about the outlook slide  is positive operating leverage still possible in full year 2020  I caught in the remarks potential upside mentioned from potentially pulling more on the expense lever and potentially also pulling on the deposit cost lever Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Erika  We have not commented specifically about positive operating leverage  As we have mentioned previously  over the sort of the medium and long term  that s clearly our goal  I think next year will be tough  as we outlined in the slide  While noninterest income will be up  net interest income is expected to be slightly down  And so expenses    with expenses sort of flat to down in that brew of revenue  as I said  I think positive operating leverage will be tough to achieve in 2020 Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Got it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    Analyst I had a kind of a big picture type question  I m just thinking where we are in the cycle  How you guys think about the balance between protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I guess I ll just say that I think it s a time where everybody    you have to be just very careful  That said  actually  we keep asking ourselves where are we in the cycle because it    I mean  this has been a very unusual cycle  It s been about as long and flat as the yield curve is  In some respect  in terms of the    it s been kind of low growth for a very long period of time  And we re not seeing anything that suggests to us that anything is about to turn suddenly  We re not seeing anything systematically in our credit metrics  our portfolio that gives us any real pause  But just know that at some point  we re going to see a cycle  And so we re trying to    we ll try to be careful  We certainly establish goals and targets internally in terms of what we d like to see in the way of loan growth  At least  starting with me  I m pretty careful about making that sort of the main thing around here is to hit loan growth targets  I think that s just    that creates a culture that s not very healthy in a financial institution  Deposits is kind of a different animal  I mean you can push people to go out  and they get deposits  but loans  the nature of that game is you have to be selective  And so while we hope to see the kind of loan growth we ve outlined here  expect to see it  we re going to be careful along the way  And I think we have been in the last couple of years Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer I would just add to that well that if you look at the loan categories that are possibly most toxic going into a decline  construction lending is an example  Our construction loan growth has been really flat  really dating back to 2014 and four  we re up maybe  300 million in terms of total outstandings and construction loans  from 12 14 to 12 19  We re not a big card or auto lender  And those are two places where you see a lot of challenges going into a downturn  And our leverage portfolio  as we ve talked about before  compared to our peers is we re underexposed there relative to our peers  although you have to always watch that portfolio carefully  So I just    those are the three product categories that you would want to be really concerned about if you saw a lot of rapid growth  and we haven t experienced that Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I ll just add to that  In energy  we ve significantly reduced our total exposure to the services sector over the last three or four years  And so the portfolio has to    in terms of its tough composition  it has to add up to a hundred percent or something  But that something has become more conservative  we think  over time  So   Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    Analyst That s really helpful  And then just on these loans  can you just give an update on customer sentiment and how it compares to maybe last quarter if you re seeing an improvement Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think it s still    I mean  around the markets we re in  still pretty good  and maybe even getting a little better from where it was a quarter ago  I mean it s    we still hear concerns about labor availability  They are sort of high class problems  if you will  as opposed to the kinds of challenges that can really  really hurt businesses  But I think that the economy feels pretty good throughout the west Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Great  Thanks a lot OperatorThank you  And your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with J P  Morgan Steven Alexopoulos    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hey  everyone  I want to first ask you  so the securities portfolio came down quite a bit in 2019 as you telegraphed  Well  how do you think about this in 2020  Should we still expect a decline in the portfolio Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer I wouldn t expect a lot of this kind of balance sheet repositioning  I ll call it  we really took care of in 2019  So we are constantly looking at our kind of net liquidity position  constantly thinking about the size of the portfolio  relative to the size of the balance sheet  And it s really being driven by our liquidity stress testing  I don t foresee a big decline from here in the series of portfolio  But as I said  we re    in such a flat interest rate environment  we re very sensitive to the fact that the securities portfolio is not a moneymaker for us  and it s dilutive to the margin and  frankly  to income  And so we are managing that portfolio almost completely for liquidity at this point Steven Alexopoulos    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  And where are new yields or new securities Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Last quarter  we    our average was about 2 45  of the securities we put on Steven Alexopoulos    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  And then finally  on expenses  If we look at the expense outlook  does that include the anticipated benefit from eliminating the defined pension    defined benefit pension plan Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Our plan has been closed for years  And so what s happened is that it s not really for    I ve been here five years  and it s really not been    had a significant impact on our noninterest expenses that I can think of in any given year over the last five years because we had closed it kind of 10 years ago to new entrants  and it was no longer  as I recall  accruing benefits  So this is really sort of an administratively    this is a plan that was waning as it was  So this is sort of an acceleration of the resolution of all the liabilities in the plan Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And as we ve noted previously when we say that expenses will be    is stable to slightly decreasing  that would exclude this kind of a onetime expense that takes the mark that s currently in AOCI and runs it through the income statement  That s at back of the equity Steven Alexopoulos    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  Thanks for taking my questions Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst Hey  thanks  Good afternoon  guys  Paul  if I could ask you another right side of the balance sheet question  You obviously saw a really nice remixing into deposits and were able to lower your wholesale debt profile  First question is just how much more room do you have to remix on the right side of the balance sheet Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Well  as we said  we reduced wholesale borrowings here  2 billion in the fourth quarter  So to the extent  we can continue to grow deposits  and those deposits are priced correctly  we can continue to change that mix  Although my expectation is  and as I said in the outlook  the balance sheet will continue to grow  and that wholesale funding will be an important part of just kind of that ongoing mix  So in other words  I don t see huge opportunity there  unless we get an outsized kind of deposit growth Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst OK  And that s my second question then  Just related to the type of deposit growth you got and the pricing of it  can you talk about relative to the 11 or so basis point decline you saw in interest bearing deposit costs or how do you see that going from here  Meaning  how much more ability is there just through the pull through of lower rates versus continuing to work with customers on the downside of rates as you had on the way up Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I believe we continue to have opportunity there  When you look at where deposits were a year ago versus where they are now  and then you compare that to the absolute level of rates  my belief is  well  we won t get deposit rates down as low as they were one or two years ago  I think we still have some room to really manage that exception pricing to continue to work that pricing down Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst OK  One quick follow up  Just on the slide deck  you mentioned the year over year impact of premium amortization from the SBA book  Can you talk about    is that expected to continue  Or is there any outlook for changes in premium amortization in your forward outlook Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer Not a big change  On the SBA look    book specifically  that is just over 10  of our investment portfolio  It used to be larger  That is an asset class that is declining over time  The other artifact about that asset is that it s floating rate  and so it s prime based  And so you ve got the    in that particular case when you ve got kind of a floating rate asset that is experiencing prepayments in a falling rate environment  the yields on that book have been a bit of pressure on the whole portfolio  So as I said  that part of the book is a little over 10  of the investment portfolio  But when you look at the four basis point decline in the yield  over half of that was related to the SBA book  So that s all incorporated into our outlook  and we re not expecting a big change in that trend Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst Thanks  Paul Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer OK  Thank you OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B  Riley Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR  Inc     Analyst Good afternoon  I wanted to ask about the increase in commercial NPL this quarter  Just wondering if that was driven by energy  and what are your expectations for the energy book and loan balances here going forward Michael Morris    Chief Credit Officer I ll take that  Steve  This is Michael  The increase mostly is related to commercial loans  some oil  and gas  but mostly other non oil and gas commercial  The outlook is favorable  We don t see further NPL issues for 2020  They re hard to predict  as you know  but we have    also  we have quite a few nonperforming loans that are actually contractually performing  So we look at the net number as well  and it s positive relative to the industry and our peer group Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer On energy  did you want to    were you asking about energy specifically  Or Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR  Inc     Analyst Yes  please  Scott Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer Sure  Our commitments and outstandings are well below our December 14 levels  which is really when they peaked  As Harris noted a bit ago  our exposure to services is now less than 20  of outstandings  down from about 42   43  of outstandings back then  We re always watching the    this portfolio very closely  I think what s getting a lot of headlines is the equity markets are basically closed to upstream companies  E P companies and to the midstream and so that just creates a lot of sort of tension in the narrative about energy  The public debt markets and the private equity markets are open for upstream and midstream companies  So capital is certainly flowing  And we re    our upstream and midstream portfolios they re    knock on wood  they re performing pretty well right now  Natural gas is also really highly visible topic right now  Pricing of natural gas will continue to be soft  It will stay in probably the sub two region for a bit here during the next couple of months  three to four months potentially  But that portfolio for us  where we have natural gas in our borrowing basis  came through the fall redetermination in pretty good shape  And we could have some criticized loans that have heavier natural gas exposure  but we think it s very manageable  So we re   Harris Simmons    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I also think  I mean  the  13 million increase in nonperforming loans in C I this quarter didn t include anything of any material amount in oil and gas Scott McLean    President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  Energy was    energy non performings were basically flat to last quarter Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR  Inc     Analyst OK  That s helpful  And then let me take one more crack at expenses here  The quarter included that  10 million item  Just wondering  like  is there just going to be an acceleration of the investment expense coming on that perhaps does it make you a little bit more constructive on the level of expenses  the level of decrease in expenses Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer I would say that those two items are unrelated Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR  Inc     Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe  Bruyette    Woods Brian Klock    KBW    Analyst I was going to ask you about the capital stack  I know that you guys    your guidance is for the overall level of CET1 to be stable here  And you guys have returned a lot of capital over the last few years  So just looking at your capital ratios  I mean  the CET1 is still pretty strong  but even your total capital ratio is very strong  And then I look at you still have the 100 basis point cushion between CET1 and your Tier 1  so it doesn t look like you need to do anything to add to that capital stack  but it does seem like maybe that the preferred stock  it seemed like it s a little bit expensive relative to what some of your other peers have issued at  Is there anything you guys can do to make that more efficient  anything in that preferred stock part of the stack that maybe you could refinance out for something cheaper Paul Burdiss    Chief Financial Officer We have been  Brian  because you followed this for a while  we have been very active in kind of proactively managing particularly that preferred part of our capital stack because we recognize this as being relatively expensive  So    but at this point  it would be hard for us to go out and kind of pick anything out of the open market  We really need to wait for the contractual provisions of the preferred before we can manage that any more closely Brian Klock    KBW    Analyst Got it  Appreciate it  Thanks for your time  guys  Let s see you in a couple of weeks OperatorThank you  And I m showing no further questions at this time  So with that  I ll turn the call back over to Director of Investor Relations James Abbott for closing remarks James Abbott    Director of Investor Relations Thank you  Andrew  and thank you for joining  everyone  Our next public appearance will be on February 6 for our Investor Day  as Brian Klock just alluded to  That s scheduled to begin at 10 30 a m  Eastern Time  If you would like to attend  please contact me either by phone or by email  And we look forward to seeing you at that point in time  Thank you again for your attendance today Operator Operator signoff  Duration  49 minutesCall participants James Abbott

 NEW YORK  Aug 11  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Tuesday
after data showed an unexpectedly large drop in inventories at
wholesalers in June  while an analyst s warning that
fundamentals for the banking industry have not improved sent
financial sector shares lower 
 The magnitude of the monthly drop in inventories in June  a
fall of 1 7 percent  was nearly double the 0 9 percent decline
analysts expected  which knocked stock indexes more than 1
percent lower as investors worried businesses were cutting
inventories sharply because they remained skeptical about a
return in demand 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 95 45 points  or
1 02 percent  at 9 242 50  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
down 11 24 points  or 1 12 percent  at 995 86  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was down 26 68 points  or 1 34 percent  at
1 965 56 
  The drop in inventories suggests that businesses continue
to be cautious and that production is below demand   said Alan
Gayle  senior investment strategist at Ridgeworth Investments
in Richmond  Virginia 
  Most analysts are expecting inventory cuts to slow over
the third quarter  and it looks as though that hasn t
materialized  That s an important growth factor in the second
half recovery  
 Financial stocks tumbled after Rochdale Securities analyst
Richard Bove painted a gloomy outlook for the banking industry 
saying that bank stocks are trading on  fumes   and that he
expects a short term pull back in the stock prices after a
recent rise 
 The S P Regional Banks sub index was off 4 08 percent 
while the KBW Bank Index was also down 3 34 percent 
 On top of the disappointing outlook  Miller Tabak cut
price targets on Zions Bancorp  taking the stock down nearly 10
percent to  16 23  Regions Financial Corp dropped 3 percent at
 4 82 on a similar note 
 CIT Group Inc fell 22 percent to  1 15 after the company
said it would file for bankruptcy protection if it failed to
complete its debt tender or arrange other financing 
 The negative news offset better than expected data on U S 
non farm productivity in the second quarter  which showed
productivity rose at fastest pace in six years as hours worked
fell much steeper than output 
 Investors are closely eyeing the two day monetary policy
meeting by the U S  Federal Reserve that kicks off on Tuesday 
While interest rates are likely to remain at current levels 
the focus will be on signs of an exit strategy from the Fed s
quantitative easing policy 
 Also Tuesday  Applied Materials Inc  the world s largest
chip equipment maker  reports third quarter earnings after the

  There are some worries about additional equity that needs
to be raised  The market is going to have a hard time moving
meaningfully higher without them   Kruszenski said 
 The drop in wholesale inventories in June  which was nearly
double expectations  suggests that businesses remained
skeptical about a return in demand 
 A report late Monday from the Congressional Oversight
Panel  a U S  bailout watchdog  which underscored difficulties
still facing the banking industry  also weighed on bank stocks 
The panel said toxic loans and securities continue to pose a
threat to the financial system  particularly for smaller banks
that face mounting losses on commercial real estate loans 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 75 95 points  or
0 81 percent  to 9 262 00  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell

 The financial sector of the S P 500 shed 2 8 percent while
the KBW Bank Index  was down 4 percent 
 As earnings season draws to a close  investors were also
cautious as a two day monetary policy meeting by the U S
Federal Reserve got underway Tuesday  Also weighing was a
report on July retail sales  due Thursday 
 Earnings reports are due this week from retailers Wal Mart
Stores Inc  J C  Penney Co Inc and Macy s Inc  which may
provide investors with some insight as to whether consumer
spending  which accounts for roughly two thirds of the U S 
economy  is stabilizing 
 Another worrying sign of a still weak economy came from
hedge fund firm Atticus Capital LLC  which told investors that
it is closing two of its three funds and would return  3
billion to shareholders 
  Adding to losses for financials  Miller Tabak cut its
price targets on Zions Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp

144354,365869,ZION,Zions  ZION  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Zions  ZION  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  702 03 million  down 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zions 
For Zions  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Zions will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Zions would post earnings of  1 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

check the factors that are likely to have impacted State Street s third quarter results Factors at PlayNet interest income  NII  not to offer support  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets is pegged at  185 billion for the third quarter  which suggests rise of 2 9  from the prior quarter s reported number  However  overall growth in lending activities remained muted in the quarter  Moreover  the decline in interest rates and the flattening of the yield curve along with rising deposit betas are expected to have hurt State Street s NII In fact  at an investors  conference  the company projected net interest revenues to be flattish in the third quarter on a sequential basis  During the second quarter earnings call  management anticipated the same to be down in the range of 1 3  Fee income growth could be muted  While the third quarter witnessed mixed foreign exchange  FX  trading volatility  FX volume declined  Given this  it is expected that the company s FX trading revenues might have remained flat sequentially in the third quarter Further  the spread between the three month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate contracted during the third quarter  Thus  State Street s securities finance revenues are likely to have declined because of lower spreads and the impact of seasonality Nonetheless  decent equity market performance seems to have provided support to servicing and management fees in the third quarter Notably  management expects servicing fees to have been relatively flat on a sequential basis while management fees are expected to have been up in the low single digit Expenses not of much help  Management expects operating expenses  non GAAP basis  in the third quarter to remain flat sequentially Earnings WhispersAccording to our

144392,365907,ZION,Zions  ZION  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Zions  ZION  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 5  
Revenues are expected to be  723 21 million  up 5 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 32  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zions 
For Zions  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zions will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Zions would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of  0 95  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Zions doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zions-zion-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200439819,200439819

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Zions has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-08-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zions-zion-down-55-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200457101,200457101
144417,365932,ZION,This Is Why Zions  ZION  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Zions in Focus
Zions  ZION  is headquartered in Salt Lake City  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 11 29  since the start of the year  The financial holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 3 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 65   This compares to the Banks   West industry s yield of 2 01  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 99  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 20 is up 15 4  from last year  In the past five year period  Zions has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 59 52   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Zions s current payout ratio is 30   meaning it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  ZION expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 49 per share  with earnings expected to increase 9 97  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  ZION is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-zions-zion-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200425634,200425634
144418,365933,ZION,Should Value Investors Consider Zions  ZION  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Zions Bancorporation   NASDAQ ZION   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Zions has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 2  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 32  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Zions  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Zions has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for ZION stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Zions has a P S ratio of about 2 84  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Zions currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 9 94  which is better than the industry average of 11 67  Clearly  the stock is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though ZION might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of D  This gives ZION a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen eight upward revisions with five downward movement in the past sixty days  For the full year  the estimate has seen 10 upward revision in the same time period with four movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate rose 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Zions Bancorporation Price and Consensus   Even though Zions has a stable estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineZions is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 20  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks West Banks industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for favorable industry factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling

144419,365934,ZION,ZION Vs  FRC  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Banks   West stocks have likely encountered both Zions  ZION  and First Republic Bank  FRC   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Zions has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while First Republic Bank has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that ZION s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
ZION currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 73  while FRC has a forward P E of 18 53  We also note that ZION has a PEG ratio of 1 10  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  FRC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 64 
Another notable valuation metric for ZION is its P B ratio of 1 13  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FRC has a P B of 2 02 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ZION s Value grade of B and FRC s Value grade of C 
ZION is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ZION is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-06-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zion-vs-frc-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200430210,200430210

144424,365939,ZION,Pick These 7 Low Price to Sales Stocks For Optimum Returns,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation

144443,365958,ZION,ZION Vs  TCBK  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Banks   West stocks are likely familiar with Zions  ZION  and TriCo  TCBK   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Zions has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while TriCo has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ZION is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
ZION currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 04  while TCBK has a forward P E of 13 33  We also note that ZION has a PEG ratio of 1 37  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  TCBK currently has a PEG ratio of 1 90 
Another notable valuation metric for ZION is its P B ratio of 1 34  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  TCBK has a P B of 1 45 
Based on these metrics and many more  ZION holds a Value grade of B  while TCBK has a Value grade of C 
ZION is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ZION is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zion-vs-tcbk-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200399413,200399413
144444,365959,ZION,Analysts Estimate Zions  ZION  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Zions  ZION  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  715 64 million  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 25  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zions 
For Zions  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zions will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Zions would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Zions doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-zions-zion-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200406799,200406799
144445,365960,ZION,Zions  ZION  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Zions in Focus
Headquartered in Salt Lake City  Zions  ZION  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 14 65  so far this year  The financial holding company is paying out a dividend of  0 3 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 57  compared to the Banks   West industry s yield of 1 89  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 9  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 20 is up 15 4  from last year  Zions has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 59 52   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Zions s current payout ratio is 29   This means it paid out 29  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
ZION is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 44 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 8 82  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  ZION is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zions-zion-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200409703,200409703
144448,365963,ZION,You Won t Believe What The Insiders Are Buying In 2019,opinion,"Were you surprised by the strength of the financial stocks in 2016 
Maybe you shouldn t have been 
One of the biggest CEO insider buys in 2016 was by Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  who bought 500 000 shares for  26 million in February 
On the day he bought  JPMorgan s shares had hit a new 2016 low and were down 16 5  year to date thanks to the early year stock market sell off 
At the time  Dimon already had 7 million shares of JPMorgan stock in his 401k and his wife also owned a million shares in her own account 
It was just Dimon s third purchase of shares on the open market in the prior 12 years  He bought 500 000 shares in January 2009 during the Great Recession doom when bank shares were plunging to multi year lows and another 500 000 in July 2012 
What did Jamie Dimon know that February 
The shares have since jumped 94  
In 2016  the Bankers Dove In
But he wasn t the only banker buying in 2016 
At Huntington Bancshares  NASDAQ HBAN   three corporate insiders  including the CEO and CFO  bought on Feb 1  2016  Through the end of 2016  those shares jumped 53  
At Zions Bancorporation  NASDAQ ZION   between January 28 and February 9  the CEO  the CFO  a director and two Executive Vice Presidents all bought shares  By Dec 31  2016  they were up 107  
At KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   there was a huge cluster buy of insider buying between January 25 and February 8 that resulted in 9 directors and the CEO all buying shares  From Feb 8 through the end of 2016  the shares soared 71  
They re at it Again in 2019
2016  it turns out  wasn t a fluke 
After the big rally off the 2016 lows  the bank stocks stalled out again in 2018 
They are  once again  under valued 
And the insiders know it 
The bank insiders are back  diving in for more shares in 2019 
For example  in April  the CEO  General Counsel and one of the directors all bought shares of Simmons First National Corp   an Arkansas based regional bank 
Shares are down nearly 20  over the past year and are up just 3  in 2019  They clearly see a buying opportunity 
Insider Buying Sends a Strong Signal
Why would these CEOs and corporate insiders spend so much of their money on their own companies  stock when they already own a ton shares already 
Greed 
Pure and simple 
The opportunity to make more money motivates people  even people who are already millionaires like Jamie Dimon 
If top insiders are buying  it s because they know something very good is going on at the company  Maybe it is a new product  Or contract  Or pending merger 
Whatever the reason  they are very confident that shares will be on the rise  After all  who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking   
More      
                                                                                                      

When in the know officers dip into their own pockets to buy shares of their own company  there s only one reason  They expect the stock price to go up 
Zacks is now targeting insider moves that include a monster buying spree in a little known regional bank  The CEO  COO  CFO  and 5 directors just ponied up  2 263 273 of their own money even though some were already awarded shares as part of their compensation  Time to get in on this action 
Our recommended insider trades are normally closed to public view   but you can gain access until midnight Sunday  May 12  And make your move at market open Monday 

                                                                                                      
Buy When the Insiders Buy
When high level insiders buy  they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade  The trade then becomes public information 
Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades 
For most of us  though  it s not easy to get access to the insider information  While the media will trumpet huge insider buys like Dimon s  26 million buy  did you hear anything about Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney s  1 million stock purchase on Apr 30  2019 
The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy 
Where to Find the Insider Buys
Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information but it s time consuming to search by individual companies 
Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a weekly list  Have you ever seen one of those lists  The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming 
In some instances  the insiders have been known to buy en masse  Then what s an investor to do 
This happened during the stock market dip in August 2011  As stock prices fell  insiders felt that their companies were undervalued and rushed out to buy shares 
That August  insiders bought stock in 50 different S P 500 companies in just one week  Even if you got a list of those stocks  how would you narrow it down to the stocks that were truly worth buying 
To solve this problem  our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations  We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys so you don t have to 
Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our 
Right now  we ve narrowed it down to 10 insider buys that make the grade 
Look Into the Portfolio Now
Normally closed to public view  we ve opened it up temporarily through this weekend  You ll see live recommendations with substantial upside 
For example  there s a little known regional bank that insiders are pouring their own money into 
Eight key officers feel so good about the stock price going up that they bought  2 3 million dollars worth of shares 
  The CEO invested  996 500  The COO President spent  995 000  The CFO jumped in with  99 979  5 directors kicked in a total of  171 794

In the last reported quarter  this Providence  RI based bank displayed organic growth  Continued rise in revenues and loan growth were the key highlights  Also  the company recorded rise in deposits  However  the results were partially offset by higher expenses and provisions 
Notably  Citizens Financial boasts an impressive surprise history  It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 6  
Citizens Financial Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    
However  the company s price performance has not been very impressive  Its shares have lost 2 8  in the past three months compared with 3 9  decline recorded by the  
Will the price performance improve post fourth quarter earnings release  Let s check which factors are expected to impact Citizens Financial s earnings 
Factors at Play
Net Interest Income  NII  to Exhibit Growth  The fourth quarter witnessed commercial and industrial  and consumer loan growth  thus some support to NII is expected from this scenario 
Further  rise in earning assets is likely to boost interest income as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  143 7 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates a 3 8  rise year over year 
In addition  margins are likely to expand due to the rising interest rates  further boosting NII  However  flattening of the yield curve during the quarter is likely to offset the benefit to some extent 
The consensus estimate of  1 17 billion for NII reflects 8 1  year over year growth 
Moreover  management expects 1 1 25  sequential average loan growth for the quarter  Further  expansion of 3 4 basis points is expected in margins 
Fee Income Might Increase  While rising interest rates are likely to have kept the trend of debt and equity issuance activities low in the fourth quarter as well  Citizens Financial might have bagged higher advisory and underwriting fees due to its solid business profile  The consensus estimate for capital market fees of  53 million indicates a 26 2  rise 
Also  the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter  which is likely to provide some support to the company s top line  The consensus estimate for card fees of  61 million indicates an 8 9  increase 
Furthermore  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for foreign exchange and interest rate products fees is  33 5 million  reflecting year over year growth of 4 6   Also  trust and investment services fees are expected to rise 5 9  year over year to  44 5 million 
However  with the rising interest rates  mortgage refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down  Therefore  no major help is expected from this segment 
With improvement in most of the components of fee income  total non interest income is expected to rise  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest income is  434 million  indicating 7 4  rise on a year over year basis 
Notably  management expects fee income to increase 5 7  sequentially with benefit from strong capital markets 
Controlled Expenses  Citizens Financial s expenses are expected to continue declining due to its TOP IV efficiency initiative  Also  its self funding revenue initiatives might help lower the efficiency ratio 
Credit Quality Might Improve  Citizens Financial s credit quality is expected to improve during the quarter backed by an improving economy  Per the consensus estimate  non performing loans and leases are likely to decline 2 6  year over year to  848 million

According to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Citizens Financial in the upcoming results  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better for this to happen  which is not the case here as elaborated below

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Zions is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Bank of Hawaii has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ZION likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BOH has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ZION currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 77  while BOH has a forward P E of 15 01  We also note that ZION has a PEG ratio of 1 38  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BOH currently has a PEG ratio of 2 
Another notable valuation metric for ZION is its P B ratio of 1 33  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BOH has a P B of 2 64

This financial holding company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 54  
For the most recent quarter  Zions was expected to post earnings of  0 96 per share  but it reported  1 04 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 33   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 92 per share  while it actually produced  0 89 per share  a surprise of 3 26  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Zions  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Zions currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 62   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 22  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

144545,366060,ZION,ZION Vs  BOH  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Banks   West sector might want to consider either Zions  ZION  or Bank of Hawaii  BOH   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Zions has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Bank of Hawaii has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that ZION has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ZION currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 36  while BOH has a forward P E of 15 09  We also note that ZION has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BOH currently has a PEG ratio of 2 01 
Another notable valuation metric for ZION is its P B ratio of 1 40  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BOH has a P B of 2 65 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ZION s Value grade of A and BOH s Value grade of C 
ZION sticks out from BOH in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that ZION is the better option right now ",2018-11-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zion-vs-boh-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200357595,200357595

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ZION due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Zions  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Costs EscalateZions reported fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 80 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents  Also  the figure compares favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings of 60 cents per share Results to a great extent benefited from improvement in both net interest income and non interest income  Also  the quarter witnessed overall improvement in credit quality  Further  loan growth remained strong  However  higher adjusted non interest expenses remained a major headwind After taking into consideration the tax adjustment  relating to the passage of the Tax Act  net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at  114 million or 54 cents per share For 2017  net income attributable to common shareholders was  550 million or  2 60 per share  up from  411 million or  1 99 per share registered in 2016 Revenues Improve  Costs EscalateNet revenues were  665 million for the quarter  increasing 9 4  year over year  However  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  670 6 million Net interest income for the quarter came in at  526 million  increasing 9 6  year over year  The rise was primarily attributable to increased interest income  partially offset by higher interest expenses  Further  net interest margin improved 8 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 45  Non interest income amounted to  139 million  up 8 6  from the year ago quarter  The rise was due to an increase in all components except other income Adjusted non interest expenses increased 5 1  from the year ago quarter to  415 million The efficiency ratio was 61 6   down from 64 5  a year ago  A fall in efficiency ratio indicates improvement in profitability Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31  2017  total loans  net of allowance came in at  44 3 billion  up 1 5  from the end of the prior quarter  Total deposits increased nearly 1  from the prior quarter end to  52 6 billion Credit Quality ImprovesThe ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases as well as other real estate owned decreased 41 bps year over year to 0 93   Further  net charge offs were  12 million  down 55 6  from the year ago quarter In the reported quarter  the company registered a provision benefit of  12 million  compared with almost nil provisions recorded in the prior year quarter Capital   Profitability Ratios DeteriorateUnder the Basel III rules  Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10 5   as of Dec 31  2017  down from 11 1  at the end of the prior year quarter  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 13 2   down from 13 5  in the year ago quarter At the end of the reported quarter  return on average assets was 0 74   decreasing from 0 88  as of Dec 31  2016  Also  as of Dec 31  2017  tangible return on average tangible common equity was 7 4   down from 8 4  a year ago OutlookManagement projects pre provision net revenue to increase in the high single digits rate Management expects net interest income to rise moderately in 2018  driven by continued growth in loans and securities while a slight rise in funding costs is expected to marginally hurt   Notably  the projection does not take into assumption further rate hikes The company expects NIM for the first quarter of 2018 to remain stable  sequentially  This is because benefits from the December rate hike will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield Zions expects adjusted non interest expense to increase in the low single digits rate in 2018 Management expects effective tax rate to be in the range of 24 25  in 2018 Over the next four quarters  preferred dividends are expected to be approximately  34 million 2018 2019 ObjectivesManagement projects annual mid single digit loan growth  driven by improvement in the commercial real estate loan portfolio  which is also expected to grow in the mid single digits rate The company targets customer related fees to grow slightly from the fourth quarter 2017 level Given that the company has been reinvesting its cash flow from the investment portfolio into higher yielding securities  the securities portfolio is expected to increase in the long term Moreover  adjusted efficiency ratio is projected to be below 60  for 2019

management and commercial loans Another Beat in the Second QuarterOn July 25  Zions reported its second quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents  Earnings were  0 73 compared to the consensus of  0 62  It has now beaten 5 quarters in a row Net loans and leases rose by  941 million to  43 7 billion from  42 5 billion year over year  The gains came from an increase of  647 million in commercial loans and  302 million in 1 4 family residential loans It s seeing real improvement in its credit loss provisions  It was just  10 million in the second quarter  down from  18 million in the first quarter  That is also significantly lower than the  31 million credit loss provision in the second quarter of 2016 Zions saw improvement in its oil and gas related loan portfolio as non performing assets fell  37 million in that area year over year The allowance for credit losses for oil and gas related loans decreased during the second quarter but still exceeded 8  of the

boutiques in 47 states and the District of Columbia It also has an ecommerce web site at  A Beat in Q2 But Same Store Sales FallOn Sep 6  it reported its second quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Earnings were  0 20 versus the consensus of  0 19 It had already previously announced preliminary results but earnings exceeded that preliminary expectations due to better than expected merchandise margins and SG A expenses Same store sales  however  came in at the low end of the expected range  falling 3  year over year  That was due to a decrease in boutique conversion rates  Last year s second quarter same store sales were flat Unfortunately  it also reported that August sales were soft due to  merchandising missteps   It was trying to get rid of its back to school inventory so that it could focus on the lucrative upcoming holiday season Hurricane Harvey Strikes a BlowFrancesca s is headquartered in Houston  Texas and it wasn t immune to impacts from Hurricane Harvey Its corporate headquarters  ecommerce fulfillment  distribution center  and approximately 40 boutiques were all directly impacted and had to shut down  Many of its employees suffered personal impacts as well As of Sep 5  it had re opened its headquarters and all but one of its impacted boutiques but it expected it take a couple of weeks to normalize In addition  Hurricane Irma then followed on Harvey s heals  leading to business disruptions in Florida It s unclear how much of an impact it will have on the third quarter though Estimates Cut for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018It s tough in the apparel retail business right now  One wrong step  like getting the trend of the season wrong  and it sets the company back Francesca s had made quite a turnaround in the last few years as it cut inventory and made management changes  It invested heavily in ecommerce  with a new web site and better product distribution However  since the earnings report  analysts have been cutting estimates on Francesca s for both this fiscal year and next fiscal year Earnings are expected to fall 26  this year to just  0 81  It made  1 09 last year Analysts are bearish on next year too

144617,366132,ZION,Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks With Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,Investors typically have a fixation for the price to earnings  P E  strategy while looking for stocks trading at bargain prices  The ratio is widely considered by value investors as a useful tool for working out the fair market value of a stock  However  even this widely popular valuation multiple is not devoid of shortcomings What Gives EV EBITDA the Upper Hand Although the widespread popularity of P E stems from its apparent simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity   also known as the enterprise multiple  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other constituent  EBITDA  gives a better understanding of a company s profitability as it strips out the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more tempting it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is hard to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses But EV EBITDA is not without its downsides  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside

Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios 

	Investors typically have a fixation for the price to earnings  P E  strategy while looking for stocks trading at bargain prices  The ratio is widely considered by value investors as a useful tool for working out the fair market value of a stock  However  even this widely popular valuation multiple is not devoid of shortcomings 

What Gives EV EBITDA the Upper Hand 

	Although the widespread popularity of P E stems from its apparent simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity portion 

	EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents 

	The other constituent  EBITDA  gives a better understanding of a company s profitability as it strips out the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings 
	Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more tempting it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued 
	EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is hard to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive 
	EV EBITDA also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses 
	But EV EBITDA is not without its downsides  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements 
	Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks Screening Criteria 
	Here are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median   A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median   This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

144624,366139,ZION,The Bank Insiders Are Buying Again  Should You ,opinion,"Were you surprised by the strength of the financial stocks in 2016 
Maybe you shouldn t have been 
One of the biggest CEO insider buys in 2016 was by Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  who bought 500 000 shares for  26 million in February 
On the day he bought  JPMorgan s shares had hit a new 2016 low and were down 16 5  year to date thanks to the early year stock market sell off 
At the time  Dimon already had 7 million shares of JPMorgan stock in his 401k and his wife also owned a million shares in her own account 
It was just Dimon s third purchase of shares on the open market in the prior 12 years  He bought 500 000 shares in January 2009 during the Great Recession doom when bank shares were plunging to multi year lows and another 500 000 in July 2012 
What did Jamie Dimon know that February 
The shares have since soared 69  
In 2016  the Bankers Dove In
But he wasn t the only banker buying in 2016 
At Huntington Bancshares  NASDAQ HBAN   three corporate insiders  including the CEO and CFO  bought on February 1  Since then  the shares have risen 53  
At Zions Bancorporation  NASDAQ ZION   between January 28 and February 9  the CEO  the CFO  a director and two Executive Vice Presidents all bought shares  The shares are up 108  
At KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   there was a huge cluster buy of insider buying between January 25 and February 8 that resulted in 9 directors and the CEO all buying shares  The stock has gained 65  since those buys 
They re at it Again in 2017
2016  it turns out  wasn t a fluke 
Despite the rally in bank stocks  the insiders are diving in for even more shares in 2017 
At JPMorgan  for example  a director bought 11 500 shares on April 19  2017  It was his first open market purchase since he bought thousands of shares in January and February 2016  That was around the same time that Jamie Dimon was buying  when the shares were hitting new lows 
Insiders are also buying again at the big regional banks even though the shares are much higher than 2016 
Four insiders at Keycorp bought more shares in July and August 2017  All four of these insiders were among the 9 who bought in the big cluster buy at the bottom in January and February 2016 
For several of them  this is the first time they have bought again since those 2016 lows 
Cluster buys send a powerful signal 
What do they know that they are buying even though the shares are no longer at those 2016 lows  They are still seeing value in the shares 
Continued      
                                                                                                      

It s worth noting when major company officers pour their own money into their stocks  But it s an even stronger signal when those stocks are already riding at or near all time highs 
Zacks found two such rare insider purchases  both near the top of their price charts with surging industries  good business practices  and strong outlooks  Our selected insider trades are normally closed to public view   but we are opening them up until midnight Sunday  August 13 

                                                                                                      
Insider Buying Sends a Strong Signal
Why would these CEOs and corporate insiders spend so much of their money on their own companies  stock when they already own a ton of shares already 
Greed 
Pure and simple 
The opportunity to make more money motivates people   even people who are already millionaires like Jamie Dimon 
If top insiders are buying  it s because they know something very good is going on at the company  Maybe it is a new product  Or contract  Or pending merger 
Whatever the reason  they are very confident that shares will be on the rise  After all  who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking   
Buy When the Insiders Buy
When high level insiders buy  they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade  The trade then becomes public information 
Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades 
For most of us  though  it s not easy to get access to the insider information  While the media will trumpet huge insider buys like Dimon s  26 million buy  did you hear anything about Cree CEO Charles Swoboda s  222 000 buy of 10 000 shares on October 20  2016 
The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy 
Where to Find the Insider Buys
Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information  but it s time consuming to search by individual companies 
Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a weekly list  Have you ever seen one of those lists  The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming 
In some instances  the insiders have been known to buy en masse  Then what s an investor to do 
This happened during the stock market dip in August 2011  As stock prices fell  insiders felt that their companies were undervalued and rushed out to buy shares 
That August  insiders bought stock in 50 different S P 500 companies in just one week  Even if you got a list of those stocks  how would you narrow it down to the stocks that were truly worth buying 
Picking the Best Insider Buys
To solve this problem  our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations  We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys so you don t have to 
Just a small number of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks  
Right now  we ve narrowed it down to 11 insider buys that make the grade 
One is particularly intriguing because the CEO already owned  32 million worth of his company s stock and receives shares as part of his compensation  The VP owned more than  1 3 million 
Yet  even with the stock near new highs  they recently bought more shares with nearly  2 million from their own pockets 
What do they know  Why did they make this big move  Well  for starters  our signals on their cutting edge electronics stock are flashing brightly  It s now a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy with earnings estimates on the rise  It s also coming off a very positive earnings surprise 
You are welcome to share this and 10 other insider trades in our portfolio that have impressive gain potential  But please be aware that we are limiting access to these stocks  Entry to our portfolio closes to new investors this Sunday  August 13

Jd Com Inc Adr  NASDAQ JD 

JD com    has been a volatile stock  After a strong move lower to start the year it retraced most of the down leg by April  Then it fell again to a new low in June  Since then it has been rising  At the start of September it moved over its 200 day SMA in a pronounced way and has held there  consolidating under resistance  The RSI has turned back higher in the bullish zone and the MACD is curling back up  Look for a push over resistance to participate to the upside  That volatile action created a bearish Shark harmonic that has its first Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 32  with the second PRZ at 35 above that  There is resistance at 27 and 28 25 followed by 30 and 33  Support lower comes at 25 60 and 25 30 followed by 24 80  Short interest is elevated at 7 8   Enter long on a move over 27 with a stop at 25 50  As it moves over 28 move the stop to break even and then to a  1 50 trailing stop over 28 50  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 32 or higher and by 34  As an options trade consider the October 27 Calls  86 cents  and trade them like the stock trade  There is large open interest at the 25 Put Strike  30 cents  which might act as support if it pulls back  if you want to sell something to lower the cost 
Worthington Industries Inc  NYSE WOR 

Worthington Industries had a long run higher until it found resistance in July  It has pulled back in a bull flag since then with a bigger dip into September  It started back higher off of the 100 day SMA in mid September and is now pressing against falling resistance  The company reports earnings on Wednesday  Look for a push through resistance to participate to the upside  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is crossed up  both bullish  There is resistance at 44 30 and 45 50  A Measured Move higher would give a target to 58  There is support lower at 42 and 40  Short interest is moderate at 5 2   Enter long on a move over 44 30 with a stop at 42 75  As it moves over 45 50 move the stop to break even and then to a  2 trailing stop over 46 30  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 58 or higher  As an options trade consider the October 45 Calls   1 55  and trade them like the stock trade  Sell the October 40 Puts  45 cents  as well for a bullish Risk Reversal 
Zions Bancorporation  NASDAQ ZION 

Zions Bancorporation    started the latest leg higher from a retest of support at 23 50 in July  The pullback from a peak at the start of September created a bull flag and the price broke that to the upside Friday  The RI is bullish and turning back higher while the MACD is level and stopped falling  Look for follow through to participate to the upside  The broad price action since November has created a Deep Crab harmonic pattern with a PRZ above at 38 30  Resistance stands at 31 10 followed by 32 and 33 10  then you have to go back to 2008 to find it at 34 and 37 50 before 44  Support lower comes at 29 80 and 29 50  Short interest is moderate at 5 7   Enter long on a move over 31 with a stop at 29 50  As it moves over 32 move the stop to break even and then to a  1 25 trailing stop over 32 25  Take off 1 3 on a stall at 38 30 or higher  As an options trade consider the October 31 Calls  57 cents  and trade them like the stock trade 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the last week of September sees the Equity Indexes looking strong  especially on the longer timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Gold to move higher short term in consolidation while Crude Oil consolidates  The US Dollar Index also looks to continue to move sideways while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite looks to drift higher while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in the short term 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ    Their charts show strength in moving higher at the end of the week  especially in the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

144667,366182,ZION,First Republic  FRC  Q3 Earnings Beat On Higher Revenues,opinion,"First Republic Bank s   NYSE FRC   adjusted earnings per share for third quarter 2016 came in at  1 00  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents  The figure also improved 22  from the year ago tally A sizeable increase in net interest income and non interest income during the quarter was primarily responsible for the bottom line improvement  The top line also witnessed a decent upside on the back of a considerable rise in loans and deposit balances  Lower provisions also drove results  On the flip side  the quarter recorded higher expenses Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter jumped 29 2  year over year to  154 million 
Revenue Up  Expenses RiseNet revenue in the quarter was  557 9 million  up 19  year over year  The figure  however  lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  571 0 million Specifically  First Republic s net interest income soared 18 4  year over year to  460 6 million primarily backed by growth in average earnings assets  Moreover  core net interest margin  excluding the positive impact of purchase accounting  increased 2 basis points  bps  to 3 11  Non interest income came in at  97 3 million  up 22  year over year  The rise was primarily driven by higher wealth management revenues On the other hand  non interest expenses were up 22 4  year over year to  337 7 million  An increase in salaries and benefits  which was an outcome of continued investments in the expansion of franchise and regulatory compliance activities  and growth across all business segments  primarily led to the upside The efficiency ratio was 60 5   compared with 58 9  in the prior year quarter  The rise was mainly a result of higher costs due to the new FDIC assessment rule and interest expense on subordinated notes issued during the quarter  Note that a rise in the efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability 
Balance Sheet Still HealthyAs of Sep 30  2016  loans increased 17 6  year over year to  49 9 billion  while total deposits were up 24 2  to  55 1 billion First Republic s total wealth management assets were  80 2 billion as of Sep 30  2016  reflecting a growth of 36 4  year over year  Wealth management assets included investment management assets  brokerage assets  money market mutual funds  and trust and custody assets 
Credit Scenario a Mixed BagOn a year over year basis  total non performing assets declined 1 1  to approximately  54 0 million  Further  as of Sep 30  2016  the ratio of net loan charge offs to average total loans was 0 01   up 1 basis point On the other hand  the non performing assets to total assets ratio declined 2 bps to 0 08   Moreover  provision for loan losses decreased 58 5  to  18 0 million in the reported quarter 
Capital Position DeterioratesAs of Sep 30  2016  the company s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9 26   reflecting a decline of 12 bps from the prior year quarter Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 12 89   down 32 bps However  tangible book value per share increased 13 5  year over year to  33 41  Further  on Aug 1  the bank issued a 30 year  4 375  fixed rate unsecured subordinated notes  amounting to a total of  400 million  The issued notes qualify as Tier 2 capital FIRST REP BK SF Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    In ConclusionWe are encouraged by First Republic s strong performance during the third quarter and expect the company to maintain its organic growth momentum backed by increase in loans and deposits First Republic currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Among other West banks  Zions Bancorporation   NASDAQ ZION   and Bank of Hawaii Corporation   NYSE BOH   are slated to release third quarter 2016 results on Oct 24  while SVB Financial Group   NASDAQ SIVB   will report quarterly numbers on Oct 20

144679,366194,ZION,Stocks Confirm Tepid Breakout  But On Ultra Low Volume And Volatility,opinion,"Well  it s official  The old adage about selling in May didn t apply this year  Instead  larger cap  higher quality  and value oriented stocks continued to lead the market higher  The S P 500 gained  2 1  during the month and confirmed its tentative technical breakout from the prior Friday with steady progress last week  However  it was tepid at best during the holiday shortened week  and a somewhat concerning  double low  confirmation    i e   on extremely low  and decreasing  volume and with a backdrop of persistently low volatility 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last week at 11 40  after setting yet another new 52 week low moments earlier  Although some observers are predicting single digits for the VIX  the greater likelihood is a mean reversion in the form of a spike higher  However  the VIX is not a timing tool  so it could stay low for some time before eventually going higher 
Among the ten U S  business sectors  defensive sector Utilities is still the clear leader year to date  up nearly  14  after a strong showing during last two weeks of May  Energy and Healthcare are in a virtual tie for second place YTD  So  the top three are largely defensive sectors  which doesn t feel particularly bullish in the traditional sense  However  Technology is making an effort to join the leaders  and it was quite strong during May  up over  3 5   Consumer Services Discretionary remains the laggard  and Telecommunications also has been weak  Both of these sectors have consistently ranked at the bottom of our fundamentals based SectorCast rankings 
Going hand in hand with the outperformance of defensive sectors is the low  and falling  yield in the 10 year Treasury bond  which indicates that global capital continues to flow into the safety of U S  Treasuries  The 10 year yield has now dropped below 2 50  and seems destined to fall further  despite prevailing expectations of the inevitability of higher rates among most of the financial community  In fact  I have read some compelling arguments that we are stuck indefinitely in a low interest rate environment  as the Fed cannot raise short term rates without tanking the economy  And that s what the flattening yield curve is signaling to investors 
With forward valuations in equities somewhat elevated but not egregiously so  and with low interest rates encouraging corporations to issue debt in order to continue their stock buybacks  and with central banks around the world committed to keeping the liquidity spigots open  there is little reason to expect equities to have a massive selloff anytime soon  although periods of fear inducing technical consolidations and short term corrections surely will occur    perhaps soon   On the other hand  there is also little reason to expect a big surge in GDP growth  corporate earnings  and the broader stock indexes  either  So  thoughtful stock picking  rather than relying on all boats lifted in a rising tide  seems to be in order 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust   ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 192 68  The prior Friday  it had barely broken through tough resistance at 190  but last week clearly confirmed the breakout  Or did it  With such ultra low volume in the holiday shortened week  bullish conviction to take this market higher is still not clearly proven to me  The Bollinger Bands had become quite pinched  signaling an imminent price move in one direction or the other  and in conjunction with the upside breakout that ultimately occurred  price has been hugging a rising upper Bollinger Band  Now price is quite stretched from its moving averages  and oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all either at or approaching extreme overbought levels  With price approaching the upper line of the long standing bullish rising channel  a pullback seems highly likely to occur soon  first testing resistance turned support at 190  and then perhaps the 20 day and 50 day simple moving averages  Below that  support resides at the top of the mid April gap around 186  the bottom of the gap around 184  and then the lower line of the bullish rising channel  currently around 182 5  

I noted last week that the iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  small cap ETF had bullishly regained its 200 day simple moving average  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund  ARCA EEM  saw its 50 day SMA crossing bullishly through its 200 day in a golden cross  However  the bounce in the IWM appears to be losing steam at resistance from its down sloping 50 day simple moving average  and price action may be forming a bearish falling channel that started in mid March   And for its part  the EEM looks as though its rally might be peaking  as well  All told  I expect a summer pullback to occur soon to allow the technicals to cycle back down to oversold conditions  from which the market can then stage a fall rally to new highs 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each  
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a strong Outlook score of 90  which is quite impressive especially given its big 26 point gap above second place Energy at 64  Technology displays generally solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and the strongest sentiment among Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   Energy displays a low forward P E and suddenly got a burst of upward earnings revisions from the sell side  as well as insider buying activity  Financial solidifies its hold on third place over Utilities  and Industrial rounds out the top five after falling 12 points from second place    there were relatively fewer Wall Street upward revisions and less insider buying 
2   Telecommunications stays in the cellar once again with an Outlook score of 2  as it scores among the lowest in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two this week by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 14  as companies within the sector endured more downward earnings revisions from Wall Street 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Basic Materials holds the lead with a 59  followed closely by Technology  Energy  and Industrial at 58  while Utilities is the laggard with a 45  The top bottom spread narrowed slightly to 14 points  reflecting somewhat higher sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities continues hold up well  scoring 78  which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  No surprise here  Energy is second at 66  Consumer Services  Technology  and Telecom all share the lowest score at 48  The top bottom spread remains a highly robust 30 points  reflecting extremely low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays by far the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed by Energy  Telecom is by far the worst  followed by Consumer Services  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy is the leader  followed by Utilities  but it is Energy that displays the best balance between its Bull and Bear scores  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Telecom scores the lowest  followed by Consumer Services  indicating general investor avoidance of these sectors during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  I would still interpret this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings as mostly bullish  given that four of the top five also display high Bull scores  Technology  Energy  Financial  Industrial   Although Utilities remains surprisingly strong  note that Energy is displaying both bullish and defensive properties these days 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Energy sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Energy  and Financial in the prevailing bullish climate   In this particular model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Energy  and Financial sectors include First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund   NASDAQ TDIV   PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration   Production Portfolio  NYSE PXE    and PowerShares KBW High Dividend Yield Financial Portfolio  NYSE KBWD

However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model still suggests holding Technology  Energy  and Financial  On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Consumer Goods Staples
