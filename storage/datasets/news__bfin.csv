IL   June 15  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include BankFinancial Corp    NASDAQ BFIN    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa    American Equity Investment Life Holding Co    NYSE AEL   and WSFS Financial Corp    NASDAQ WSFS   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Fed Lifts Rates 2nd Time in 2018  Winners and LosersThe Federal Reserve lifted a key U S  interest rate for the second time this year and signaled at a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term  Interest rates rose again as the U S  economy heated up and inflation crawled higher With the Fed hiking rates and aiming for more increases this year  banks  insurers and brokerage firms stand to gain  Meanwhile  utilities  homebuilders and gold miners are likely to lose Fed Gets Slightly More HawkishThe Fed  as widely expected  raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1 75  to 2   Eight of the 15 Fed officials said that they expect interest rates to increase at least four times this year  up from seven in the March Fed rate meeting  The Fed s dot plot  in fact  indicated that policy makers predict two additional rate hikes this year for a total of four increases instead of three as planned earlier By the end of this year  the median forecast for the federal funds rate stands at 2 4   compared with the March forecast of 2 1   Beyond this year  the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee predicts that it will hike rates three times next year and one more time the following year to propel its benchmark rate up to 3 4  Fed s View on Economy   InflationThe Fed s decision reflected an economy that is improving by the day  After all  the jobless rate is at its lowest since 2000  wages are going up and consumers are pretty confident  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that  most people who want to find jobs are finding them  and unemployment is low   Lest we forget  for the first time in nearly 20 years  there are more job openings in the United States than workers to fill the positions Fed officials also believe that the economy doesn t require much help at the moment  Fed has removed the language that said the central bank expected federal funds rate  to remain  for some time  below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run  Powell  in the meantime  added that the Fed is comfortable with the comeback of inflation  The Fed s preferred gauge of inflation  known as the personal consumption expenditures price index  PCE   has already touched the central bank s 2  target during March and April  The Fed expects inflation to remain higher than 2  in the next two years   read more    Winners   Losers in a Rising Rate SettingWith the Fed raising interest rates and hinting at faster hikes  certain sectors stand to gain  while some sure have a lot at stake Let s take a look at the sufferers first  UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario  Utilities are capital intensive and funds generated from internal sources do not always meet requirements  Hence  these companies have towering debt loads  Low interest rates help them pay off debts and book profits But higher rates along with an escalating debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Home Construction Higher federal funds rate will make it more expensive for banks to borrow money  which eventually translates into higher borrowing rates for consumers  This is surely a dampener for real estate activities and losers  affecting construction related businesses  like homebuilders Mortgage rates are already on the rise  On average  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate climbed to 4 66  last month  the highest in seven years  before dropping slightly in recent weeks GoldRising rates diminish the appeal of precious metals like gold because the commodity doesn t offer yield as high as other safe haven assets like government bonds  Higher interest rates also boost the dollar and dent demand for dollar denominated commodities Following the Fed s announcements  the ICE Dollar Index that measures the value of dollar against a basket of six major currencies  was up 0 1  to 93 898 Now  which areas are set to make the most of a rate hike  Of course  financials BanksBanks are definitely the go to rate trade now  As a rule  higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities National banks like Bank of America  NYSE BAC  are very rate sensitive and have consistently seen earnings rise on a quarter point rate hike InsurersVery few companies root for a rate hike as much as those in the insurance industry  And why not  The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward  meaning the higher the rate  the greater the growth Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums  which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds  Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates  This enables life insurers to invest premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income  expanding their profit margins Not only investment income  which is an important component of insurers  top line  annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment Asset ManagersBrokerage firms advantage significantly from an increasing rate environment since a hike in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments Notably  a wealth management firm like Schwab has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenues  much of which flows directly to pre tax profits Top 5 GainersGiven the aforesaid

6250,227765,BFIN,Goldman To Withhold Top Executives  Pay Until 1MBD Resolves,opinion,"The Goldman Sachs Group   NYSE GS   plans to hold back distribution of bonuses worth at least  7 million to the top executives until investigations related to the Wall Street biggie s role in the 1MDB scandal are completed 
Further  in its annual filing  Goldman disclosed that it has added a new forfeiture provision in its annual compensation plans that would give it the permission to reduce the size of the  award prior to payment and or forfeit the underlying transfer restricted shares  
This would primarily impact the current Chief Executive David Solomon and former head Lloyd Blankfein  if the outcome of ongoing probe turns out to be negative 
Blankfein stepped down from his role of CEO in October 2018  and later in December retired as chairman  For 2018  he is eligible to receive  20 5 million  which includes  2 million salary   18 5 million bonus and more than  14 million in restricted shares that vest over time 
Further  David Solomon  who succeeded Blankfein as CEO and chairman  should receive pay of  23 million for 2018  including a  1 9 million salary   21 million bonus and restricted shares of  15 4 million  per the annual filing 
Goldman also disclosed that it may withhold payments for a period as long as five years if it is determined that the results of  the 1MDB proceedings would have impacted the Committee s 2018 year end compensation decisions for any of these individuals  
Goldman continues to face probes and queries from several federal agencies and a few foreign governments for its businesses conducted during the pre crisis period  However  its focus to capitalize on new growth opportunities through several strategic investments  including the digital consumer lending platform  will likely bolster overall business growth 
Shares of the company have lost around 14  in the past six months compared with the 13 4  decline of the

6251,227766,BFIN,Goldman Plans To Pull Back Commodities Trading Operations ,opinion,"The Goldman Sachs Group   NYSE GS   is planning to cut back Commodities trading  which used to be a major source of revenues for the investment bank  However  no final decision has been made by the executives  so far 
The decision to pull back from commodities comes after months of review conducted on Goldman s businesses  as proposed by the new chief executive officer David Solomon  with a view to control costs and tap on areas that could generate higher profits 
A similar review on the commodities arm revealed that the wing was not being able to make enough returns to justify the amount of capital being invested  The executives are mulling to pull back physical trading of iron ore  platinum and other metals  which  in turn  would help lower costs associated with the storage and transportation of physical commodities 
For Goldman s commodities traders  2017 was a disappointing year  In 2018  the scenario improved slightly  However  it is yet to regain the spark it had in 2000  when it contributed about 15  of Goldman s pretax profits 
The bank held on to the commodities business even though its peers pulled back since the financial crisis  Further  strict regulations made other banks exit the business  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  divested a fleet of oil tankers and pulled back energy trading  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  stopped physical trading of commodities 
Solomon  who became the CEO in October 2018  plans to reallocate resources to lending to clients in the trading business and make its business profile similar to the rivals 
While Goldman is on track to remodel its business into a more profitable organization  it continues to be face investigations over its role in helping to raise funds for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd  1MDB   The Malaysian government has filed corruption and money laundering charges against Goldman and two former employees in connection with the probe 
Recently  this investigation led to Goldman holding back distribution of bonuses worth at least  7 million to the top executives until investigations related to the 1MDB scandal are completed 
Shares of the company have lost around 17  in the past six months compared with the 13 2  decline of the

6254,227769,BFIN,5 Stocks To Gain From Dollar s Recent Strength,opinion,The U S  dollar has maintained its strong rally so far this year  with a popular gauge of the strength of the greenback hovering near a two year high  The strength is predominantly attributable to global central banks turning dovish and an array of weak European PMI manufacturing data  On the flip side  fresh bout of positive results from the U S  economic calendar means the dollar will remain strong  And let s admit  as long as we ve got Brexit  France s yellow vest protests and an Italian recession  the U S  economy surely will continue to remain alluring  So  how to play this dollar s newfound strength  Small caps  being domestic centric  are better positioned to weather a stronger U S  dollar  This category of stocks should gain immensely as they are cushioned against the loss of competitiveness and currency translation impact of a stronger greenback  Needless to say  that multi nationals are poised to lose their competitive edge  as foreign consumers will now see U S  products as more pricey than non U S  goods  What s Driving the Dollar  The ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  which measures dollar s strength against a basket of major currencies  traded at an intraday high at 98 322 on Apr 25  its highest reading since May 16  2017  From Riksbank and the Bank of Canada turning dovish to lower than expected Australian first quarter CPI  all have been helping the greenback scale upward  The Swedish krona recently took a beating against the dollar after its apex bank said that interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer than earlier anticipated  Dean Popplewell  vice president of Market Analysis at OANDA chipped in and said that  Sweden s Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the repo rate would remain at current level for somewhat longer period of time than was forecasted back in February   the next potential rate hike is near year end or in early 2020   Elsewhere  the Canadian dollar and the Aussie dollar both fell against the greenback  Canada s central bank did keep its rates unchanged as expected but trimmed its growth outlook for the first half of the ongoing year  In Australia  the Bureau of Statistics confirmed that consumer prices remained flat for the first quarter of this year  below analysts  estimate of 0 2   This weaker than expected reading on CPI is making investors  believe that the central bank will cut interest rates later this year   Things are also not so bright in the Eurozone  The euro continues its slide against the dollar  currently trading to its lowest level since June 2017  Germany s Institute for Economic Research reported that the Ifo business climate index fell from a revised 99 7 points in March to 99 2 points in April     However  the U S  economy has gone from strength to strength in recent times  Headline durable goods orders expanded at 2 7  last month  easily surpassing estimates  In fact  durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in seven months  Similarly  core orders gained 0 4  compared to a month earlier  But  it was U S  March retail sales  surprise jump of 1 6  that primarily boosted the dollar up against its peers  What Does a Stronger Dollar Mean for Stocks  A rising dollar impedes earnings growth  which suggests that returns from the equity market might be subdued  Particularly  companies that derive a majority of their earnings from overseas will suffer  Such companies are exposed to foreign exchange risks between the United States and other countries they are operating in  Thus  if dollar gains strength  it tends to hamper foreign sales of such companies  The tax cuts along with deregulation are further benefitting small caps  and helping their profits accelerate in the near term  One of the popular measures of small caps  the Russell 200 Index  has risen 16 8  so far this year  slightly more than the broader S P 500 s rise of 16 7    5 Winning Picks Small caps are set to benefit from wider domestic revenue exposure  which insulates them from the effects of a stronger dollar  Thus  investing in stocks with high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation seems

6255,227770,BFIN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Advanced Emissions  Aptevo  BankFinancial  Good Times And Health Insurance,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 29  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Advanced Emissions Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ ADES    Aptevo Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ APVO    BankFinancial Corporation   NASDAQ BFIN    Good Times Restaurants Inc    NASDAQ GTIM   and Health Insurance Innovations  Inc    NASDAQ HIIQ   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 Stocks to Gain from Dollar s Recent StrengthThe U S  dollar has maintained its strong rally so far this year  with a popular gauge of the strength of the greenback hovering near a two year high  The strength is predominantly attributable to global central banks turning dovish and an array of weak European PMI manufacturing data  On the flip side  fresh bout of positive results from the U S  economic calendar means the dollar will remain strong And let s admit  as long as we ve got Brexit  France s yellow vest protests and an Italian recession  the U S  economy surely will continue to remain alluring  So  how to play this dollar s newfound strength  Small caps  being domestic centric  are better positioned to weather a stronger U S  dollar  This category of stocks should gain immensely as they are cushioned against the loss of competitiveness and currency translation impact of a stronger greenback  Needless to say  that multi nationals are poised to lose their competitive edge  as foreign consumers will now see U S  products as more pricey than non U S  goods What s Driving the Dollar The ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  which measures dollar s strength against a basket of major currencies  traded at an intraday high at 98 322 on Apr 25  its highest reading since May 16  2017  From Riksbank and the Bank of Canada turning dovish to lower than expected Australian first quarter CPI  all have been helping the greenback scale upward The Swedish krona recently took a beating against the dollar after its apex bank said that interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer than earlier anticipated  Dean Popplewell  vice president of Market Analysis at OANDA chipped in and said that  Sweden s Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the repo rate would remain at current level for somewhat longer period of time than was forecasted back in February   the next potential rate hike is near year end or in early 2020  Elsewhere  the Canadian dollar and the Aussie dollar both fell against the greenback  Canada s central bank did keep its rates unchanged as expected but trimmed its growth outlook for the first half of the ongoing year  In Australia  the Bureau of Statistics confirmed that consumer prices remained flat for the first quarter of this year  below analysts  estimate of 0 2   This weaker than expected reading on CPI is making investors  believe that the central bank will cut interest rates later this year Things are also not so bright in the Eurozone  The euro continues its slide against the dollar  currently trading to its lowest level since June 2017  Germany s Institute for Economic Research

6257,227772,BFIN,Is BankFinancial  BFIN  A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BankFinancial Corporation   NASDAQ BFIN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BankFinancial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 59  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 65  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  BankFinancial s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 23 99 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 84  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  BankFinancial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 95  which is higher than the current level  So  so it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BankFinancial has a P S ratio of 2 42  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BankFinancial currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BankFinancial a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though BankFinancial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B  This gives BFIN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward and one downward movement  the current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward movement over the past two months This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has dipped 8 3  over the past two months  the current year estimate has increased 2 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BankFinancial Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite such mixed analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBankFinancial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a sluggish industry rank   among Bottom 43  of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  2 buoys investors  optimism in the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance and rank  a good Zacks rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in BankFinancial Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2019-10-27,Zacks Investment

6272,227787,BFIN,5 Top Stocks To Buy On Dollar s Newfound Strength ,opinion,The U S  dollar maintains its strong rally since the start of the second quarter  The strength is primarily attributable to an uptick in U S  government bond yields  Inflationary pressure owing to rising oil and raw material prices drove the U S  10 year bond yield higher Small caps  being U S  centric  are better poised to weather a stronger U S  dollar  This category of stocks is ripping to fresh records as they are cushioned against the loss of competitiveness and currency translation impact of a stronger greenback  Needless to say that as the dollar rises  multi nationals lose their competitive advantage  as foreign customers see U S  goods as more expensive than non U S  goods What s Driving Dollar The ICE U S  Dollar Index  which measures dollar s strength against a basket of major currencies  has been above the psychologically key 3  level since the beginning of April The greenback continues to rise in tandem with government bond yields  After all  currency traders tend to be drawn toward such currencies where interest rates are attractive  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note  a benchmark for interest rates  climbed above the 3  threshold to touch a seven year high in the past week  read more    Inflationary pressure  being more prevalent  led to a selloff of Treasuries and has kept the yield at elevated levels for now  Lest we forget  the Fed is set to take aggressive steps with respect to rate hikes this year  In fact  the Fed will release the minutes from its May 1 2 meeting this week  which may add to dollar s strength and Treasury yields  provided they sound hawkish What Does a Stronger Dollar Mean for Stocks A rising dollar impedes earnings growth  which suggests that returns from the equity market might be subdued  Particularly  companies that derive a lion s share of their earnings from overseas will be dealt the biggest blow  Such companies are exposed to foreign exchange risks between the United States and other countries they are operating in  Thus  if dollar gains strength  it tends to dent foreign sales of such companies S P Global added that with every 1  rise in the greenback  large cap companies with heavier U S  concentration in terms of revenue generation have gained 71 basis points on average  For small caps  the correlation was way better  In fact  small caps have outperformed large caps so far this year  read more    The tax cuts enacted this year along with deregulation should further benefit small caps  helping their profits accelerate in the near term  One of the popular measures of small caps  the Russell 200 Index  has risen 5 9  so far this year  while the broader S P 500 gained only 0 6   Year to date  nearly  3 7 billion has gone into small cap U S  equity exchange traded funds  per FactSet  This category of U S  stock ETFs has  thus  become the second most popular category in the last decade 5 Winning StocksSmall caps are set to benefit from wider domestic revenue exposure which insulates them from the effects of a stronger dollar  Thus  investing in stocks with high domestic exposure in terms of
