Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  and welcome to today s Colgate Palmolive Company Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  This call is being recorded  and is being simulcast live at   for opening remarks  I d like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations  John Faucher  Please go ahead  John John Faucher    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Aaron  Good morning  and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call  This is John Faucher Today s conference call will include forward looking statements  Actual results could differ materially from these statements  Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC  including our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10 K and subsequent SEC filings  all available on Colgate s website  for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements This conference call will also include a discussion of non GAAP financial measures including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release  A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate s website  Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace  President and Chief Executive Officer  and Henning Jakobsen  Chief Financial Officer I will begin with some thoughts on our performance in 2019 before moving to our 2020 guidance  We made meaningful progress in 2019 on our path to returning to sustainable profitable growth  As we said at the beginning of 2019  we increased investment behind our brands and in the capabilities that are required to deliver growth in our changing global markets  We also implemented changes in how we work to streamline our processes and drive empowerment to make us faster  Those strategic choices have started to pay off  as in 2019  we delivered net sales growth in excess of our initial guidance  and organic sales growth at the high end of our initial 2019 guidance range of 2  to 4   and within our long term target range of 3  to 5  On a non GAAP basis  we delivered earnings per share within the guidance range we gave you at the beginning of the year  while our GAAP earnings per share were in excess of our initial guidance  Our free cash flow was up 7  in 2019 due to improved working capital performance and discipline on capital spending  We delivered this performance despite some headwinds from economic uncertainty in markets like Mexico  Brazil and India  And importantly  we delivered on our commitment to return to growth in China  delivering organic sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters So how do we drive better growth in 2019  Our continued focus on innovating around the core of our business  driving growth in adjacent segments and expanding our availability in faster growth markets and channels is paying off  We successfully relaunched several of our core franchises  On Colgate Total  we delivered that brand s fastest organic sales growth in several years  led by key markets like the US  Brazil and Mexico Hill s continued to deliver strong growth with major contributions coming from the Science Diet relaunch  In North America  Hill s delivered double digit growth in Q4  while cycling a double digit comparison in the year ago period  We have more core innovation to come in 2020  especially on key Oral Care and Personal Care brands  Our performance in faster growing adjacencies has been a significant contributor to our improvement in 2019  We delivered growth with new products that appeal to consumers  preferences for products that are more natural and sustainable  We ve driven sales and market share growth with our Charcoal toothpaste and Bamboo toothbrush launches around the world  And Sanex Zero  continues to grow as well In Skin Health  EltaMD and PCA Skin  both achieved double digit sales growth for the year  We acquired Filorga in Q3  and we are excited to announce that earlier today we closed our acquisition of the Hello Oral Care brand  These acquisitions should also contribute to growth going forward A quick note on Filorga  We are currently reporting Filorga on a one month lag  So the fourth quarter includes Filorga results only from the closing of the deal in mid September  through the end of November When we transition Filorga to SAP  we will line up our reporting calendars  Our focus on availability in the faster growth markets and channels has seen us deliver very strong growth in pharmacy  club  cash and carry and especially e commerce  Our e commerce organic sales grew 30  in 2019  and we established a new direct to consumer business with Hill s to Home  which provides the fast and easy way for veterinarians to sign patients up for prescription diet It s a new subscription model that increases compliance  We are leveraging the learning from Hill s new venture into our direct to consumer efforts across the rest of our businesses We also made significant inroads on sustainability during the year  We launched the first of its kind recyclable toothpaste tube  certified by the Association of Plastic Recyclers  which is now available in both Europe and North America  As of 2019  we have received TRUE Zero Waste certification on 16 facilities And we earned our highest recognition ever from the Dow Jones worldwide Sustainability Index  taking the lead in our industry sector for the first time  Our fourth quarter performance reinforces the progress that I just laid out  We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration in organic sales growth  And we returned to gross margin expansion and delivered leverage on our overhead On a GAAP basis  our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was up 100 basis points  Excluding the impact of charges from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and acquisition related costs  our gross profit margin was up 80 basis points  For the fourth quarter  pricing was favorable to our gross margin by 60 basis points  Raw materials were unfavorable by 270 basis points  almost entirely offset by productivity from our funding the growth initiatives of 260 basis points  Further  primarily mix from Filorga was favorable by 30 basis points Our advertising spending was up 13  for the fourth quarter  finishing up 6 5  for the full year  In the fourth quarter  excluding the charges from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising  our SG A was down 70 basis points year over year  as we benefited from operating leverage  productivity savings and lower logistics costs So as we close the door on 2019  our focus is to advance on this progress through 2020  For 2020  we expect net sales growth of 4  to 6   driven by organic sales growth in the 3  to 5  range  consistent with our long term targets  a 1  to 2  benefit from the acquisitions of Filorga and Hello and a modest negative impact from foreign exchange  We expect gross profit margin expansion in 2020  driven by the underlying business as well as the mix benefit from Filorga  We expect positive pricing and the continued strength of our productivity initiatives to more than offset modest raw materials inflation We will continue to invest behind our brands to maintain organic sales growth  not just in terms of advertising  which we expect to be up year over year  but also in building key growth capabilities in areas like innovation  and data and analytics  We expect to drive leverage through the rest of our cost base through a combination of top line growth  cost discipline  productivity and mix  These investments are crucial not only to sustain organic sales growth  but also to get our market shares growing again Our growth in non measured channels is very strong  And this is a key part of the strategy we ve talked about all through 2019  So we are focused on improving our overall share performance  This is particularly true in North America  where we think a share turnaround in track channels is still a few quarters away  Accelerating our innovation efforts  particularly in premium segments will be the key factor in delivering better market shares Interest expense should be up slightly in the year due to the increased debt from Filorga and the Hello transactions  We expect our tax rate to be between 24 5  and 25 5  on both the GAAP basis and excluding acquisition costs  On a GAAP basis  based on current spot rates  we are planning for a mid to high single digit increase in earnings per share  Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program  acquisition related costs  the benefit from a value added tax matter in Brazil and the benefit from Swiss income tax reform in 2019  based on current spot rates  we are planning for a low to mid single digit increase in earnings per share At this point  it seems certain that there will be a negative impact from the coronavirus on our businesses in China  and the total company for at least the first quarter  While we expect it to be temporary  it is still too early to quantify the impact  and therefore this is not been included in our guidance  We expect to be in a position to provide an update at CAGNY as well as on our first quarter call  We believe our plan for this year appropriately balances our improved performance  our need to sustain organic sales growth  our focus on driving cost out of our P L  and the uncertainties that exist in a fairly volatile world And here to give you his thoughts on 2020  is Noel Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John  and Happy New Year  everyone  As John discussed  we made meaningful progress in 2019  We grew volume and organic sales in every division  We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories  Oral Care  Personal Care  Home Care and Pet Nutrition  In our Oral Care business  we grew organic sales mid single digits in the year  led by our toothpaste business  And we closed out the year with our highest quarterly rate of organic sales growth in more than three years We know we re in 2020 now  we have more work to do  So here are my thoughts on our top three priorities for this year The first is premium innovation to drive growth  We delivered successful innovation last year by focusing on our core adjacencies and new channels  but markets  categories  consumer preferences are changing and premium is winning  Still a lot of opportunity for us in Whitening  Lifestyle  Therapeutic  new forms in pet like Wet  and importantly products that are more sustainable and more natural We re deeply excited about the Hello acquisition given the potential we see for that brand on top of our core business  And obviously Skin Health is a big area of opportunity for us  Lastly  while we ve improved our speed of innovation  we need to get faster  We are aggressively cutting the time it takes innovation to reach the market and you ll see that play out over 2020 Our second priority is becoming more digital and data driven in everything we do commercially  Continuing on innovation to get faster  we need to use digital tools to replace our traditional testing methods in order to speed up our innovation  We re using analytics to more effectively target our digital spending and drive a higher ROI  We re accelerating our e commerce business by becoming more data driven  We re sharing learning across our businesses and geographies and we re co locating Colgate and Hill s businesses to share best practices and drive efficiencies And finally  delivering productivity across the P L to new ways of working  Digital plays a part here as well  Projects like our global move to S 4HANA will allow us to simplify and standardize processes and move resources toward areas that drive real growth  In our supply chain  we have opportunities for more automation and robotics to drive more savings  And we are enhancing our productivity culture  so our Colgate employees can continue to deliver our best in class  funding the growth program along with tackling other cost opportunities to drive efficiencies So those are our top three priorities we re focused on for 2020  More premium innovation to drive our growth  digital and data to make us faster and smarter  productivity to drive our margins And now  I ll be happy to take any questions Questions and Answers OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen  today s question and answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience   Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Steve Strycula with UBS Steve Strycula    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning  So  my first question would be is  how should we think about with the inclusion of new brands such as Hello  How do we think about your ability to manage category assortment within Oral Care as you kind of build it forward  I think  John mentioned desire to premiumize some of the North American business on his prepared remarks  So how do we think about namesake Colgate returning to growth in the United States and balancing that with growth platforms such as Hello and Tom s Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Steve  thanks and good morning  So clearly  as you look at our portfolio around the world  we have had a history of managing multiple brands and doing it quite successfully  Obviously  the Tom s brand here in the US has been a successful growth driver over the last couple of years  And what s so exciting about the Hello brand is given its positioning it really complements our entire portfolio extraordinarily well  It s obviously on a lifestyle type brand and a feed farm type positioning skews very high among Millennials and Gen Z where some of our other brands don t perform that well So as we look to manage this brand  particularly in North America and around the world  we think it s uniquely positioned in terms of delivering incremental growth to the core franchise  As we    you saw in 2019  we continued to accelerate Oral Care growth across the business and last year was one of the better years we ve had on Oral Care  particularly in toothpaste  And so we re very excited about what Hello is going to bring to the business  We ve shown historically  we know how to integrate acquisitions and run brands and portfolios with multiple brands in them and that will be the case for us in 2020 with Hello OperatorWe ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good morning  So very interesting that you did not give a gross margin target for 2020  So I wanted to know if you could just sort of address that change if we should think about that as maybe being a bit of a different approach at Colgate whereas gross margins has always been held up as sort of a must have  So if you can just talk a little bit about that  that would be great  Thanks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Good morning  Lauren  Listen  there s a lot of unpredictability in the world that we live in today  a lot of volatility  whether it d be raw and packed materials  whether it be foreign exchange  a lot of mix play  a lot of geographic mix play as well  And while we still have laser focused on driving gross margin  and as John outlined in his commentary  we plan to grow gross margins in 2020  We felt it was important to really focus on the continued priority  which is driving top line growth and delivering the EPS guidance that we provided to The Street this morning  As far as gross margins go  we believe the mix opportunities that we have obviously bringing brands like Hello into the business  the skincare focus we have  all of those complementing our productivity funding the growth initiatives will allow us to continue to accelerate gross margins OperatorWe ll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley Dara Mohsenian    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good morning guys Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Dara Mohsenian    Morgan Stanley    AnalystWe ve seen a clear rebound in organic sales growth of the company  But so far it s been a bit uneven with Pet in emerging markets business is accelerating substantially  both for the full year  but also in Q4  but not a strong results in North America and Europe  So I was just hoping you could compare and contrast the impact from your strategy changes on those two separate areas  Is there anything you ve learned in emerging markets in Pet  you can apply it in North America and Europe and any green shoots there in North America  Europe  or when should we expect to see improvement  particularly in light of the comments that the track channels in North America may take some time to turn  Thanks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Dara  So let s take a step back on the overarching strategy that we ve been deploying over the last 12 to 18 months  which is obviously focused on our core driving adjacencies and it s exploring and operating differently with our different channels and you ve seen that obviously play out in the acceleration of organic growth  And as we said in the upfront statements  we accelerated growth across all of our geographies  all of our divisions in that regard  and obviously all of our categories So we think the underlying strategy on how we re executing there around the world is doing quite well  Now  obviously as you pull out different geographies  Europe categories are a bit slower  different competitive base  Obviously  we ve got a very strong business there with both the Colgate franchise and the Elmex franchise  and the strategy that we just articulated  we are executing really well there  Shares are pretty good across Europe on our business  And as we talked about earlier  Total performed very  very well  particularly in UK  which is one of our largest market So overall we re optimistic on where we see Europe going relative to some of the strategies we deployed  but bear in mind the categories aren t growing nearly as fast in Europe  as they are in the rest of the world  Categories in emerging markets are basically in our categories  growing at about 2x to the developed part of the world  So again  you would expect both North America and Europe to be at a slower pace in terms of top line growth  Relative to North America  obviously there s a lot of work being done from the team on how we re turning around that business  We re clearly now at the potential that we see for that business as we speak  We re very  very focused on transforming how we think about innovation to be a lot more focused on premium as we go throughout the year Most of that will be back half weighted  The team under John s leadership is really rethinking on how we look at innovation from a structure standpoint  how we look at it from a premium standpoint  and we have some good R D technologies coming down the pipeline that we think will continue to accelerate growth  But we re going to fix North America  the right way Obviously we re disappointed with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter  but I have to say  based on the plans I ve seen  we re really encouraged on where they re going  We re not going to buy our share back  We re going to do things in terms of making sure that we have long term sustainable growth in that business and driving the premium piece of the business is the key focus OperatorWe ll move next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning  folks  and happy belated New Year  I guess    I want to come back to one of the pieces that are highlighted that s performing quite well and that s Pet Food  Really impressive growth  I guess the key question is one of durability  because it s been long time since we ve seen this type of growth  We are hearing from Tractor Supply yesterday and I know they re not the hugest retailer but they re one of the more vocal ones that they re looking to reset their shelves and give some brands that have turned positive  more space  give us some of the legacy grain free brands  less space  Are you seeing that same shift  And do you expect it to benefit you and is there a reason to believe that we can continue to see this type of momentum as we track to 2020 Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  listen  we re obviously very pleased as you ve seen in the numbers with Hill s and this hearkens back to kind of the cornerstone of our strategy across the company  which is focusing on the core  which we ve seen terrific growth on Science Diet as we rolled out across North America  We will be rolling the Science Diet relaunch  we started in the late 2019 in Europe and that will expand to the rest of the world in 2020  We looked at adjacencies  obviously  as we re gauging into the core and the channel expansion that we ve had both in farm and feed  as well as e commerce really sits well with how confident we are with the strategy that we re executing around the world And specifically on the durability of that business  aside from the fact that they continue to have a strong pipeline of innovation coming  the Science Diet rollout will go throughout the rest of the world in 2020  Take the US as an example  we delivered double digit growth in the fourth quarter on the Hill s business last year and we delivered another double digit growth this year in the fourth quarter  So given the size of that business  I think  a clear indication that the durability is there  Now  there s no question the comps will get more difficult as we move forward  So we need to continue to focus on the things that we do really well  which is the innovation piece of the business  executing against new channels and exploring new adjacencies  which I mentioned in some of my upfront comments about the opportunities we see in Wet moving forward OperatorWe ll move next to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Andrea Teixeira    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good morning everyone  So I wanted to know if you can explore more  you took us through Europe and a bit of North America but as embedded in your guidance  you re thinking of a more balanced growth in between North America and developing markets  And if you can also elaborate a little bit more  obviously we ve got the coronavirus impact but the Asia Pacific volumes have been coming back since last quarter    since the third quarter and then the fourth quarter and if you continue to see momentum there  And in LatAm  if you can still see a more balanced volume pricing growth as you roll out the more premium products there  Thank you Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  So let s talk a little bit about emerging markets  As you well know  we do 70   more or less 70  of our revenue is outside the US  So we re very focused on emerging markets  And as I mentioned earlier  the emerging market growth rates at least in our core categories are growing at a healthy pace above where we see the developed part of the world moving  So organic growth of 5  in emerging on the year versus 3  in developing obviously is consistent with what we like to see the profile of our organic growth moving forward given the strength that we have in emerging markets Latin America specifically doing well  Mexico doing well  and Brazil  categories are in the 4  to 5  rate there  We should    obviously there s some uncertainty on where Mexico is going given the fact that they are technically in a recession  And macroeconomics in Brazil seem to be improving  We ll see how that unfolds over time  But the business is quite solid in Latin America and the category seem to be holding up pretty well Moving on to Asia  obviously very pleased with another quarter of organic growth and we seem to be getting on track  but as we ve said  the turnaround in Asia is going to be    it s going to take some time  While we saw good growth in the back half of the year  this is a long term strategy that we re executing in Asia to get the portfolio right  to get the go to market right  and get the innovation structure right  particularly as we look at how we innovate on the growing e commerce channel The coronavirus  there s not much more to add on that  First and foremost  we re very pleased  All of our employees are safe  We are very focused on that  We have mobilized the supply chain to look at all contingency planning relative to    production should    the implications of the virus extend beyond the current dates  And we re intending to come back to everyone with more information at CAGNY  Africa is one  we don t talk about a lot  obviously we had issues in that business  18 months to 24 months ago  you ve seen  I think the durability of the strategy play out in the Africa numbers where we ve seen consistent growth  Importantly  one of our largest markets  South Africa  had a good back half  And so the categories as well as our business in that important geography seem to be performing quite well OperatorWe ll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thanks  Maybe first  just a cleanup on North America  I know you said you would buy your way back to share strength  but the pricing and profitability this quarter just came in below our expectation  So maybe you could help unpack what happened in the quarter  and whether that will carry over into at least the first half of 2020  My main question more broadly just if you could maybe just the state of play across your skincare businesses in that category has been accelerating  just love a little bit more context from you about how your various brands are performing against the expectations  And then also just the comment on your appetite to do more in skin care  whether prioritizing organic investment maybe expanding brands like Tom s or even Hello in that direction or obviously pursuing additional M A  Thanks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Steve  On the pricing  bear in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year  we were not promoting quite frankly at all across most of our toothpaste franchise given the preparation for the launch of Total  So  the comps were obviously very difficult for us in the fourth quarter of this year versus where they were in the fourth quarter last year  We also had a bit of mix  both in the category and    excuse me  and channel mix has impacted the margins in the quarter Moving forward  as John mentioned in his comments  the work that we re doing to prepare for long term sustainable growth in the US consistent with our strategy and very focused  particularly in the US around premium innovation  most of that will kick in  in the back half of 2020  Relative to skin care  we re very pleased  You heard in the upfront comments  those businesses are growing double digits and we intend to continue to focus and accelerate our investment in those categories as we move through the balance of 2020 and they ve got a good innovation pipeline and we re obviously very carefully thinking about our expansion into new geographies What we do see is significant upside in geographies in which we currently compete Obviously  China is a big piece of the skincare business both for Elta and for Filorga  So we ll have to    we are on a wait and see in terms of the impact of the coronavirus on our business there  Filorga specifically has a good travel retail business  So we ll see how that unfolds moving forward  And as it relates to M A  listen  we ve got between Elta  PCA and Filorga  we think the skincare assets right now  obviously if something came across that really got our attention and we would consider it  And with the acquisition of Hello  where we re tremendously excited in terms of the growth potential there  We think we re right where we need to be in terms of M A  but never say never OperatorWe ll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Nik Modi    RBC    AnalystYes  good morning everyone  Noel  I was hoping you can provide some compare and contrast  I mean  Hill s has been doing very well after struggling for a bit  And so I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what happened with Hill s and kind of how you think about the Oral Care business in terms of kind of a progression and evolution of some of the strategies that you ve been putting in place John Faucher    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsSure  Again  relative to the strategy that we re deploying across the world  which is core adjacencies and channels  Hill s is hitting on all cylinders in that regard  The other important area that we see that they have a unique advantage and it s how they re thinking about the business digitally and how we re focused very much on now embracing analytics to use to drive our e commerce business  which was incidentally up almost 40  in the quarter  So they re hitting on all of the right things right now  And they ve got obviously good growth plans moving forward  But as I ve said  the comps get more difficult The good news is  obviously the Prescription Diet  a business which is an important part of that business  We have strong innovation coming down in 2020 and we think we re well positioned obviously given some of the impacts of the recall that we had in 2019 to recover from that moving forward  Obviously relative to the learnings we have on Hill s  as I mentioned  likewise in my upfront comments  we re seeing great benefits by combining our teams  particularly around digital and E commerce on the ground to share learnings and really maximize efficiencies in terms of how we look at digital  how we buy digital and how we execute against the data that we re learning from that  Hill s is quite advanced in that and sharing those learnings broadly across the Colgate business will pay dividends for us OperatorWe ll go next to Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI Rob Ottenstein    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  I think you mentioned e commerce overall up 30   Hill s almost 40   Can you    perhaps kind of just give us a sense of what s going on in e commerce on the Oral Care side and particularly in the US market and in China  what kind of growth rates you re seeing  What percentage of the business is e commerce  kind of initiatives you re doing  And then most specifically on China  you started to touch on it but love to get a little bit more granularity in terms of whether you have the right brand portfolio  the right price points  whether it s a question of technology relationships with the large e commerce providers to really get the Chinese e commerce business rocking and rolling  Thank you Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So pleased with the e commerce overall  As John mentioned  we were up 30  in the year  This is a fluid business that you continually bring new learnings and which is great about the business  because it s so data driven  you re able to ascertain what s working  what s not and act upon that pretty quickly  So we re thinking quite differently among how we structure ourselves around e commerce with fully independent teams managing that business  so they can take    that they re empowered to make decisions and taking those decisions very live rather than having to wait for that  So that s certainly benefiting us both on the Oral Care side  the Colgate side as well as Hill s side  The Colgate business was up significantly last year in the US  Our e commerce business was up just shy of 40   our shares picked up again  Remember  we have a very strong Tom s of Maine business  Hello  will come into the franchise now which is quite strong on e commerce as well and the Colgate business is driving nice growth As we look at China specifically  we re starting to develop much more strategic relationships with some of the big platforms there  whether it d be Alibaba or JD  We re looking at structuring ourselves differently in order to ensure that we re partnering with them in a very different way  not only in terms of the data side of the business  but likewise on the innovation side of business where we re going to need to really focus on the premium side  which I mentioned and collaborating with some of our big partners and having the flexibility to do things a bit more uniquely  we think will bode well for the business moving forward OperatorWe ll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Olivia Tong    Bank of America    AnalystThanks  First on North America  Just as you think about the remediation actions you re taking there  what s your view on margins because they ve obviously come in pretty dramatically  So you talked about the focus on premiumization  Do you think going forward  the margin gets better because of the premiumization or is this sort of a certain level of investment is now here to stay Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Olivia  Sure  Listen  the margins improved in the fourth quarter obviously from where they were in the third quarter  As I talked about  we had some more difficult comparisons given the promotional environment a year ago  We have seen a little bit of step up in promotional in the toothpaste category particularly around couponing as we ve seen some of our competitors increased their values in that space  But we ll manage that very carefully  As I mentioned earlier  our focus is getting back to durable sustainable growth and premium innovation is at the heart of that  And the premium innovation will obviously be accretive to the margin as we move forward  and as we continue to push the mix in that area  Obviously  the move toward Naturals and Lifestyle brands  Naturals with Tom s of Maine  which will increase the investment behind that business  will help margins  The Lifestyle brands like Hello as we continue to push that business  which incidentally today only has a 9  awareness in the US market So as we put more investment behind that and we continue to expand the distribution  obviously that will play out nicely for the business as well  The advertising is meant to obviously create long term sustainable growth for us and we ve seen that obviously play out holistically and globally on the top line and North America will get its fair share as we continue to rebuild that business moving forward  But again we re going to do that the right way  focused on innovation and making sure that we re building the brands for the long term OperatorWe ll go next to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  good morning everyone  Question for you on the company s ability to drive greater leverage between the top line and earnings  as we look beyond  20  So clearly  this was an investment year  you re getting the top line payback  which is encouraging  but EPS down mid single digits as you look out to next year up low to mid single digits relatively in line with the mid single digit    excuse me  low single    excuse me  mid single digit top line that you re guiding to organically  understanding FX is a little bit of a component there  a little bit of a headwind  But  will investment levels be adequate for the company as best you can tell  as you look at your budget and you look at your guidance now  so as you get beyond  20  should the investment community expect a return to high single digit EPS growth  where you re able to get better leverage once investment levels are adequate  Thanks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks  Kevin  We re not going to obviously guide beyond 2020 at this stage  but let me talk a little bit about leverage and productivity and how we re thinking about it  First and foremost  as we ve been very consistent with our strategy around reinvigorating top line growth and driving sustainable organic growth  you ve seen now obviously  sequentially through the last five quarters and the best leverage we re going to get through the P L is as we deliver the top line  obviously  we ll see where foreign exchange goes  we believe it will be a little less punishing it has been in the past this year  But again with the unpredictability of the environment that we compete  we shall see As I mentioned in the upfront beyond premium innovation  which will obviously drive the top line and the leverage to the P L  we are very  very focused on productivity across the entire P L We have a list of projects that we re thinking through  we re obviously looking at productivity  delivered some technology in the discussions I had around S 4HANA and how we leverage the simplification efforts that will come from that and the standardization  that will come from that  So  we re very focused on that  The supply chain  likewise  looking  as I mentioned to use robotics and automation very differently moving forward  We re looking at segmentation of our facilities around the world to drive more efficiencies in the plants  So productivity is right in our focus right now and as we drive the top line  we ll see that productivity move through the P L  Most of that productivity particularly for North America  we ll see that coming through in the back half of 2020 OperatorWe ll move next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel Mark Astrachan    Stifel    AnalystThanks  and good morning everybody  Wanted to ask about Hello  kind of specifically in M A strategy broadly  So what is Hello give you that you couldn t have done with your own brands  And I guess just more broadly  what s driving the increase in M A over the last year or so as you ve taken over now  how do you describe the company s ability to handle  digest multiple deals  And once I get that  they re small  but there s a lot more going on here than there has been thoughts on doing more deals  Can you to take on more at this point potentially even something larger  should that materialize  And maybe how do you think about the leverage target and are not necessarily specific to M A  which is kind of broadly since there s certainly on a lot of leverage on the balance sheet at this point Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  thanks  Mark  So I mentioned upfront that markets are changing  categories are changing  consumers are changing  And we ve seen that disruption certainly peak out very aggressively in Asia and particularly China and we ve seen a lot more of that in North America over the last 18 months  And so as we look at our business  we re obviously looking to position our brands in areas where they can best compete  And as we look at our portfolio strategies  we obviously can t be a one brand for all  particularly given the disruptions you re seeing in the marketplace  And if we see the right opportunity for complementary brands within our portfolio  particularly in Oral Care  we will seek to go after those And hello was a perfect  perfect fit for us relative to its unique positioning  In terms of Millennials and Gen Z  which is now the strength of the Colgate franchise  it obviously complement itself very well with Tom s Hello is a very lifestyle oriented brand where Tom s is a very core natural oriented brand  So we think it fits well  And we re going to run the business independently  We re going to run the business differently and now bring it into the Colgate business  So we re very fortunate to have Craig and Lauri coming over to the business  I think some of you have met them  You know the strength of their leadership  you know the strength of their marketing instincts and how they think about brands  we fully intend to use both of them across the Colgate business around the world to help us think about innovation  very  very differently And I think  Craig  will be a wonderful ambassador for us as we think about  how we re transforming our innovation approach to the market As I mentioned earlier  we re very comfortable with the M A that we ve made  where we continue to be able to deliver against those  We have a track record of delivering successfully against M A and I think the reason is  we re very focused  we let the businesses run independently  we maintain their cultures  But we offer them all the opportunities to flex the Colgate machine  so to speak  relative to synergies and best practices  training  you name it  and that we ll continue to do that with Hello OperatorWe ll move next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust Bill Chappell    SunTrust    AnalystThanks  good morning  Taking a year to look back on the Total relaunch  especially in North America but also kind of worldwide  I mean  what would be your grade of it just from the Super Bowl commercial to the money spent there  And I understand that it was in part done you needed to kind of restage the platform before you rolled out new products this year  But just trying to understand  especially in light of kind of the fourth quarter North American results  how good    was this in line with the expectations to the money that s spent elsewhere  Just kind of your color would be great Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  thanks  Bill  So listen  we took a 10  price increase on that business and we held that price increase through the year  And if you take a big core franchise like Colgate Total  that s probably the best pricing performance  we ve had in the better part of the decade  So from a pricing standpoint  we re quite excited  We ve had the fastest growth on Colgate Total in over three years  So that and its own suggest that the relaunch was successful  Did we have slightly higher expectations in certain geographies  Sure  But in our big markets like the UK  like Brazil  like Mexico  where we have high shares  we did very well  North America  perhaps  under delivered against our expectation  Our volume share was OK  but recall we downsized that brand  And then perhaps we would have done a little bit differently given some of the learnings we have through the launch  But overall  it drove the brand  it drove the equity and we had a good year on Oral Care OperatorWe ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystHi guys  thanks  So regarding your    hi  Regarding your 2020 guidance  I d love to better understand kind of the lack of top line growth leveraging into your bottom line  And if you back it out  it feels like it would suggest something like another up to 100 basis points  call it  maybe 75 basis points of reinvestment into the business again in 2020  And so in that context  I d love to get a sense of how you assess the return on that spend  given what you ve seen so far in 2019  Particularly on the market share  the market share continues to decline as you put it out in your press release  not getting better  you still have the US  Brazil  Mexico  France  China  India  kind of your core areas still losing share  So love to hear how you think about the returns in that overall context Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  let me take the latter part of your question first  I think the returns in the results  Ali  obviously a 5  organic in the fourth quarter  sequentially up from the fourth  And as we met    as we ve discussed and you have highlighted it for quite some time  the need to continue to invest behind the business  we think with that played out relative to the organic performance  that we delivered  On the 2020 guide  obviously just a couple of mechanics through the P L  The Filorga  as a full year on a percent of sales  advertising obviously much higher and adding a bit to the overall advertising line  But as we mentioned upfront  we have a strong focus on premium innovation and we want to continue to accelerate the investment behind our brands in our businesses in order to deliver long term sustainable growth  It s early days right now Obviously  we ve got a lot of work to do with this year  it s only January  a lot can change relative to the macro  as you see  lot of uncertainty  We ll see where China plays out  Brazil  Mexico  likewise  as I mentioned earlier  India  a little bit of softness  obviously in the real markets we see  So we think the guidance from where we are today and where we sit  is absolutely appropriate in terms of how we re thinking about the business  And as we move throughout the year  we ll continue to update that as necessary OperatorWe ll take our final question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thank you  I just wanted to follow up on Asia in general  not seeking about outlook for China and coronavirus in particular at all  But it    when you look back  Asia had the best volume performance  I think since 2015 and the best pricing performance since 2014  So just at a holistic level  if you could talk a little bit about sort of again ex coronavirus sustainability and what types of things have really triggered that uptick  And if you re thinking about that as being like a new base level for the kind of performance you can have out of the region  Thanks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Lauren  There was also an earlier question on our portfolio in China  I remind the audience that we obviously have the Colgate franchise and the Darlie franchise that delivers our leadership market position in China  Both those businesses continue to perform well  particularly the Darlie business came back nicely in the fourth quarter was able to launch again focused on our strategy  premium innovation  particularly around some    you d be surprised to hear baking solar products that have now become a very  very popular in China and are being sold the premium prices and that certainly helped deliver now in the pricing  but the volume On the Colgate side  as I mentioned earlier  we re in the midst of a long term turnaround here  We still got a lot of work to do relative to that business  We re pleased with where we saw the business perform  We had a good 11 11 again  behind premium pricing  Our Miracle Repair product  our Volcanic products that we launched in the quarter  delivered good volume and good pricing  As you look outwards  obviously  we ll see the impact of corona and what happens in China is going to be very difficult at this point to predict the sustainability of where we are right now given the implications of that But we re certainly structuring ourselves and putting the fundamentals in place to deliver long term sustainable growth in those markets OperatorAnd at this time  I ll turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks Noel Wallace    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo thank you everyone  Obviously  we ll see everyone at CAGNY  I look forward to having more discussions there  And for all the Colgate people that are listening  let me wholeheartedly thank you for your incredible support and work for the last year and we look forward to your continued focus in 2020  Thanks  everyone Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  46 minutesCall participants John Faucher    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsNoel Wallace    President and Chief

174325,395841,CL,Colgate warns Venezuelans not to buy fake imported toothpaste brands,news,"By Corina Pons
CARACAS  Reuters    Colgate Palmolive Co  N CL  is warning Venezuelans not buy fake versions of its toothpaste brands  leading local authorities to issue a health warning  as demand for imported products in Venezuela s dysfunctional economy encourages the spread of knock off goods 
Colgate  in a statement on Monday  said it had alerted Venezuelan health authorities to the potential risk of the  commercialization and use of these falsified products   without giving further details 
The Venezuelan National Hygiene Institute said it had determined that some toothpastes claiming to be from Colgate did not contain fluoride  Their use posed a health risk because of possible microbiological contamination  the institute said in a public report 
The institute did not mention any reports of health problems but asked Venezuelans to report any that occur 
The fake toothpaste had been imported from China  Mexico and Thailand and had the same color scheme and design as some of Colgate s genuine brands available in Venezuela  the institute said 
Colgate in its Monday statement said buyers could identify the genuine products because the text on the tube and box are in Spanish and show an official sanitary permit 
The institute did not provide details about the number of fake Colgate products in Venezuela or identify the companies producing the toothpaste  Colgate did not respond to Reuters  requests for further comment 
Venezuela s hyperinflationary economic collapse has shuttered most local producers of dental products  stimulating demand for imports of hard to find consumer goods like Colgate toothpaste  Many imported goods are sold in black market stores that do not assess products  quality

militants who stormed an upscale Nairobi hotel compound  taking at least 21 lives and forcing hundreds of people into terrifying escapes  the government said on Wednesday  Fifty people believed to have been in the complex remained unaccounted for on Wednesday afternoon  the Kenya Red Cross said  raising the possibility of a much higher final death toll  The bloody bodies of five attackers were

174459,395975,CL,Kraft walks away from  friendly  bid for Unilever,news,"By Carl O Donnell NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  food company Kraft Heinz Co  O KHC  withdrew its proposal for a  143 billion merger with larger rival  Unilever  Plc  L ULVR   the companies said on Sunday  raising questions about whether Kraft will turn its focus to another target  Kraft had made a surprise offer for Unilever to build a global consumer goods behemoth that was flatly rejected on Friday by Unilever  the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap  Kraft withdrew its offer because it felt it was too difficult to negotiate a deal following the public disclosure of its bid so soon after its approach to Unilever  according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations  Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever  one of the people said  Some key concerns raised during talks included potential UK government scrutiny  as well as differences between the companies  cultures and business models  the person added    Kraft Heinz s interest was made public at an extremely early stage   Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said in a statement   Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis  but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction  It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value   Kraft was forced to publicly disclose its offer on Friday to comply with Britain s takeover regulations  after rumors of its approach to Unilever circulated among stock traders  Under UK takeover rules  Kraft s public withdrawal of its offer precludes it from reviving takeover talks with Unilever for six months   A combination would be the third biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK based company  according to Thomson Reuters data  The combined entity would have  82 billion in sales   The premature exposure of Kraft s bid left the aggressive acquisition machine scrambling to craft an appetizing message for shareholders  the press  Unilever s rank and file  and British and Dutch leaders  Prime Minister Theresa May ordered top officials to investigate if the proposed deal posed potential threats to British economic interests  the Financial Times reported  May has been adamant the government should be more active in vetting proposed foreign acquisitions of UK companies  She had previously singled out Kraft s 2010 acquisition of another British household name  Cadbury Plc  as an example of a deal that should have been blocked   A deal for Unilever would have marked the next installment of Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Management Inc s longstanding strategy of buying food companies and slashing costs  In 2013  3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to acquire Heinz and then purchased Kraft two years later  It is now the second largest shareholder in Kraft  behind Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa    Unilever feared that a merger with Kraft  under 3G Capital s relentless cost cutting  risked eroding the value of its brands and could impede its expansion in emerging markets  which requires more investment  according to people familiar with the company s thinking   Unilever also saw its household products and consumer care divisions as too distinct from Kraft s food business  the people added  3G made its name in corporate America by orchestrating large debt laden acquisitions and then slashing costs dramatically to juice profits  Using a strategy called zero based budgeting  its managers must justify all expenses  from pencils to forklifts  KRAFT STILL HUNGRY   The breakdown in deal talks sparked speculation among analysts and investors about whether Kraft might attempt to purchase another large consumer goods company as a backup plan   We believe this announcement serves as a reminder   if needed   of  Kraft s  interest  capacity  and commitment to pursuing large scale M A in a potentially near term time horizon   said  Barclays   LON BARC  analyst Andrew Lazar in a note   Its bid for Unilever  where more than 60 percent of sales come from home and personal care products  signals a willingness to make big buys outside of its historic area of focus   food   said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj  He cited Colgate Palmolive Co  N CL  as one potential target  noting that its stock popped 4 percent Friday on news that Kraft was eyeing Unilever   However  the breakdown of the Unilever talks means that some food companies that have long been speculated as potential targets for Kraft  such as Mondelez  O MDLZ   are still very much on the table  said an industry banker  who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press   Low interest rates and cheap debt have fueled big cross border deals  marking the busiest start to the year for M A activity on record  The bid also reflected a broader interest in UK companies as acquisition targets  in part due to the British pound  which has been under pressure since Britain announced plans to withdraw from the European Union   Labor union representatives expressed relief that the deal talks broke down  citing concern about its potential effect on jobs and consumers

174500,396016,CL,Do Big Food Acquisitions Really Boost Sustainability ,news,"By    Major food corporations looking to boost their credibility among consumers who demand authenticity  sustainability and social awareness from their food producers often rely on the acquisition of smaller  greener companies that can teach them the ways of the new paradigm  But experts differ on just how much impact such buyouts have on companies  actual corporate structures  policies and practices 
At least as far back as 2000  when the consumer goods giant Unilever PLC  NYSE UL  bought the environmentally and socially progressive Vermont ice cream company Ben   Jerry s Inc   the world s largest food corporations have been in the business of bringing more benevolent  smaller companies and upstarts under their umbrellas  

Examples of this trend are many  Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL  acquired Tom s of Maine Inc  in 2006  Dean Foods Company  NYSE DF  bought out Horizon Organic Holding Corporation in 2004  and the world s largest food company by revenue  Nestle SA  VTX NESN   is a master of acquisitions  buying a series of companies including Sweet Leaf Tea Co  in 2011 
The moves typically provide Big Food corporations with the tangible benefits of eliminating key competitors before they can pose too great a market threat while simultaneously allowing them to tap into new markets or consumer bases already nurtured by the emerging firms 
The buyouts also present an opportunity for companies to improve both public perceptions of their corporate social responsibility  CSR   as well as their actual impact on consumer health  supply chains and the environment 
In the ideal scenario  when a Big Food conglomerate buys a smaller company with a strong commitment to CSR  it obtains its talent  loyal customers and specialized knowledge  Often  representatives of the smaller companies attend their new owners  board meetings  Their ideas filter upward  and the parent companies adopt new guiding principles and systems in accordance with their new colleagues  values and idealism  according to some experts 
It s one of the best means Big Food corporations can employ to move toward greater sustainability and responsibility    and to communicate that message effectively to consumers  something that is often difficult for sizeable companies to do on their own  Executives are acutely aware of the need to make those changes in order to satisfy demanding consumers who have moved swiftly to healthier  more sustainable and authentic food options  according to Rachel Greenberger  director of the Food Solutions Institute at Babson College in Massachusetts 
 They cannot innovate fast enough from the inside out  The multinationals are having a hard time innovating   Greenberger said   It s easier to turn a dinghy around than an aircraft carrier  The pivoting that s been happening in the past five years has been so fast paced that making these acquisitions allows these major corporations to move into these new spaces and have a gluten free line  an organic line  
The superficial impact of such acquisitions can often be seen almost immediately as formerly faceless organizations make bold declarations about their newfound commitment to CSR  But instituting actual change is even more important  according to Jeff Carlson  a marketing professor at the University of Richmond s Robins School of Business in Virginia 
 Without a change in practice  companies risk creating a mismatch between their actual corporate social responsibility practices and consumers that care about those types of efforts   he said via email   A mismatch could influence how a consumer judges that company or even if they purchase the company s products and services  
If an acquisition is executed properly and new CSR practices are followed by a parent company  the outcome can be impressive  according to Rob Straughan  associate dean of the Williams School of Commerce  Economics  and Politics at Washington and Lee University in Lexington  Virginia 
He points to French yogurt giant Group Danone SA  BN EN Paris  s buyout of the natural and organic yogurt firm Stonyfield Farm    which began with the purchase of a 40 percent stake in 2001    as an example of how these deals can achieve meaningful results  Dannon   the U S  subsidiary of Danone  reports that it reduced its carbon footprint by 30 percent between 2008 and 2012 and that it donates almost 3 million pounds of dairy products to the anti hunger organization Feeding America each year  These results can be chalked up in large part to the influence of Stonyfield on its operations  according to Straughan 
 When Dannon bought Stonyfield  Dannon adopted many of the company s practices into its own  lowering its carbon footprint  connecting with sustainable farmers and adopting an executive dedicated to sustainability   he said via email   A number of companies have done similar things  with positive results in general  
But Big Food should also realize there are some downsides to the deals  which may be decreasing in frequency after peaking three to five years ago  according to Leslie Pascaud  executive vice president of sustainable branding innovation at the New York based global marketing consultancy Added Value 
 There s a culture clash that is sometimes difficult to manage  There s a risk for brands that have a strong target of activists to reject the brand when it s acquired   she said   And then there are all of the challenges with trying to grow a responsible brand in a way that can move beyond a niche     bringing costs down without jeopardizing commitment to sustainability and responsibility  
Major food corporations may portray their acquisitions as entirely benevolent  aimed solely at boosting their sustainability bona fides  But it s easy for such moves to appear as little more than an attempt to put lipstick on a pig  a way for companies to appear as though they are serious about CSR without making substantial changes to their business models 
 There s a concern also within this acquiring of  are you tampering with the recipe   And sometimes the company in the acquisition will have strict rules in the contract about what changes can be made or corporate oversight and other things   Greenberger said   I don t know if that s  green washing  or  P R  washing  or if that s real  
John Lang  a sociology professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles  said via email that he  tend s  to be skeptical  about corporations that acquire green outfits and then claim to be pioneers in sustainability 
  Executives  have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders  which means that they must make short term profits  limiting their actions to those that bring immediate    and visible    returns on their investments   he explained   So when bigger companies acquire smaller  high profile  socially conscious companies there may be good intentions but the business reality is that it has to be financially justified  
Still  ignoring the trend toward acquisition of    and investment in    quirkier  more CSR focused companies is simply not an option  according to Straughan 
 Companies like McDonald s    which divested itself of the sustainably conscious Chipotle in 2006    have found themselves falling behind as they lose the race to be seen as responsible companies  and are now struggling to catch up with more forward looking brands   he said ",2014-08-28,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/do-big-food-acquisitions-really-boost-sustainability -306382,306382

174515,396031,CL,Colgate Palmolive Company Expected To Report Higher First Quarter Earnings ,news,"By    Global consumer products powerhouse Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL  is expected to report slightly higher first quarter earnings Friday as a sustained turnaround in the company s pet nutrition brand  an on track global restructuring program and an innovation pipeline including tooth whiteners  soaps and diet pet food products   continue to aid  the company s bottom line 
Colgate Palmolive sells oral  personal and home care items and pet nutrition goods and dominates the global toothpaste market with 45 percent market share 
The company is expected to report net income of  646 million or 68 cents per share from the first quarter  a 3 percent increase from the  626 million or 66 cents per share of the year earlier period  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters  Analysts expect earnings per share  excluding one time items  of 63 cents per share compared with 49 cents per share in the year earlier period  a 29 percent increase 
Revenue is expected to rise slightly to  4 321 billion in the first quarter of 2014 from  4 315 billion in the first quarter of last year 
Colgate management revealed plans in January of an Optic White manual toothbrush with a built in whitening pen for North America and launched the Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste with sugar and acid neutralizer in Europe and emerging markets   In the first quarter  the company also launched a new line of Palmolive body soaps in Latin America and a new  deep clean  toothpaste and toothbrush in China  In pet nutrition  the company is launching a prescription diet medicine for stress and urinary tract health in cats

174532,396048,CL,Colgate Palmolive  CL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Colgate Palmolive  CL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 94 billion  up 3 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 04  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate Palmolive 
For Colgate Palmolive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Colgate Palmolive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Colgate Palmolive would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering a surprise of  1 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Colgate Palmolive appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/colgatepalmolive-cl-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200501502,200501502

Colgate Palmolive is a member of our Consumer Staples group  which includes 176 different companies and currently sits at  8 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group

174579,396095,CL,Analysts Estimate Colgate Palmolive  CL  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Colgate Palmolive  CL  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 96 billion  up 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 44  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate Palmolive 
For Colgate Palmolive  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Colgate Palmolive will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Colgate Palmolive would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering a surprise of  1 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

174632,396148,CL,Earnings Preview  Colgate Palmolive  CL  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Colgate Palmolive  CL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 87 billion  down 3 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 6  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate Palmolive 
For Colgate Palmolive  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Colgate Palmolive will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Colgate Palmolive would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 74  delivering a surprise of  1 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Colgate Palmolive doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-colgatepalmolive-cl-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408791,200408791

principles for Colgate s growth strategy over the years  The company s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments  In 2019  its innovation efforts will be marked by the re launch of Colgate Total and Hill s Science Diet as well as the continued expansion of the naturals range Notably  the initial response to the re launch of Hill s Science Diet has been positive  with improved market share in the first quarter  The company expects to continue the re launch across the globe through the first half of 2020  Also  it continues to expand the Naturals toothpastes  based on local insights  with the launch of the charcoal range across many countries  In Latin America  the company s Oral Care innovations bore fruit  with market share gains in Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste line  Colgate Guard franchise in pharmacies in Brazil and the Colgate Slim Soft Advanced toothbrush  The Colgate Vedshakti line is witnessing market share gains in India In the first quarter of 2019  the company s organic sales improved 3   mainly driven by 1  increase in global unit volume and 2  rise in pricing  It delivered volume and pricing growth  on an organic basis  for the first time in over two years  with growth in all four categories  including Oral Care  Pet Nutrition  Personal Care and Home Care  Additionally  organic sales growth was led by toothpaste and Hill s businesses  This growth was broad based  with 3  improvement witnessed in emerging and developed markets  Furthermore  pricing gains partly offset the decline in gross margin  reflecting a benefit of 70 basis points  In 2019  the company expects benefits of pricing and productivity programs to considerably offset rise in raw material costs  including the impact of transnational foreign exchange Apart from these  the company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels while extending the geographic footprint of its brands  In 2019  it plans to expand the portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like Elmex and Meridol to newer markets  It is also likely to increase investments in professional skin care businesses   Elta MD and PCA Skin   in spas and dermatologists  Further  it is expanding e commerce offerings  with the launch of Hill s to home  which significantly exceeded subscription targets in the first quarter  This platform will enable pet parents to purchase prescription diet products directly from their veterinarian  with home delivery option  All these actions are likely to drive solid top line growth in 2019 The company expects sales to be between flat and up in a low single digit in 2019 on current spot rates  It estimates organic sales growth of 2 4  for 2019 Also  the company remains on track with its savings programs  including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and the Funding the Growth initiatives  In fact  the success of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program prompted its board to approve expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31  2019  This  in turn  will enable Colgate to streamline its operations  It expects after tax savings of  500  575 million annually from the program Though management expects currency headwinds and higher input cost to remain hurdles in fiscal 2019  we expect the aforementioned endeavors to help sustain momentum 3 Stocks

174634,396150,CL,Here s Why Colgate Palmolive  CL  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Colgate Palmolive  CL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Colgate Palmolive currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this consumer products maker holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CL  shares are up 2 81  over the past week while the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is up 1 04  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 12  compares favorably with the industry s 1 38  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Colgate Palmolive have risen 9 12   and are up 12 91  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 55  and 12 27   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CL is currently averaging 3 008 469 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CL 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CL s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 83 to  2 84 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CL is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Colgate Palmolive on your short list ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-colgatepalmolive-cl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200415512,200415512

174645,396161,CL,UN Or CL  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Soap and Cleaning Materials stocks are likely familiar with Unilever  LON ULVR  NV  UN  and Colgate Palmolive  CL   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Unilever NV and Colgate Palmolive have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
UN currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 27  while CL has a forward P E of 23 95  We also note that UN has a PEG ratio of 3 10  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CL currently has a PEG ratio of 4 38 
Another notable valuation metric for UN is its P B ratio of 6 87  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CL has a P B of 298 59 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to UN s Value grade of B and CL s Value grade of D

Earnings History
When I think of a Bear of the Day  I normally see a stock that has missed a few times in the last year   That is not the case for CL  as the company has met or beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters 
Estimate Revisions
A quick glance at the estimate revisions tells me immediately why this is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    I see the current quarter estimate has moved from  0 72 to  0 66   That is not what we want to see   The next quarter has also seen a move lower by another nickel 
The full year 2019 number has slid from  3 03 to  2 83 over the last 60 days   The 2020 number has also moved lower by 17 cents over the same time horizon to  3 01 
The big move lower in earnings estimates is the primary reason for the lower Zacks Rank

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Unilever NV has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Colgate Palmolive has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that UN has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
UN currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 57  while CL has a forward P E of 23 50  We also note that UN has a PEG ratio of 3 19  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CL currently has a PEG ratio of 4 30 
Another notable valuation metric for UN is its P B ratio of 6 54  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CL has a P B of 292 86 
Based on these metrics and many more  UN holds a Value grade of B  while CL has a Value grade of D 
UN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CL  so it seems like value investors will conclude that UN is the superior option right now ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/un-vs-cl-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200397691,200397691

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 37   A quarter ago  it was expected that this consumer products maker would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Colgate Palmolive  which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry  posted revenues of  3 81 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 97   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 89 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Colgate Palmolive shares have added about 4 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 4  
What s Next for Colgate Palmolive 
While Colgate Palmolive has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Colgate Palmolive was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

174689,396205,CL,4  Powell Proof  Stocks Set To Skyrocket In 2019  And 1 To Sell Now ,opinion,"If you re confused about the direction of interest rates  don t worry Fed Chair Jerome Powell can t figure it out either 
And today I m going to show you 4  Powell proof  stocks set to explode in 2019 whether rates take off or freeze in place  First  back to Powell 
An Epic Flip Flop
You may recall October 3  when the Fed chief  momentarily forgetting his words can tank the market  said   We re a long way from neutral  probably   in reference to rates 
Here s what followed 
Loose Lips  
Powell has since changed tack  His new line  Rates are now  just below  neutral 
Traders betting through the Fed Fund futures market took the bait  They now see the Fed hiking at next week s meeting and then heading to the sidelines  possibly for all of 2019  That s a huge shift from a few weeks ago  when they were handicapping 4 rate hikes next year 
Heads You Win  Tails You Win
So what the heck do we buy in this hall of mirrors market  where rates have a long way to rise one day and are just fine the next 
Simple  dividend growth stocks 
Here s why  if rate hikes do tail off  you can bet first level investors will flock back into dividend stocks particularly those with yields of 3  or more  around the rate on the 10 year Treasury note now 
And if rate hikes pick up again  dividend growers win out  too  But we need dividend hikes that  outrun  the yield on the 10 year not stale  bond proxies  like Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL   which yields just 2 7  and dribbles out meager one cent  and sometimes two cent  annual hikes 
Compare Colgate with our next dividend grower and  well  there s no comparison 
Colgate  Orange  is Barely a Dividend Grower
With payout growth too weak to grab the herd s attention and boost the share price  CL has gotten crushed since the Fed started hiking rates 3 years ago 
Weak Payout Growth   Weak Share Performance
So where does that leave us  Our  profit either way  plays should boast 2 things 
Current dividend yields at or above the 10 year Treasury rate  and
Outsized and ideally accelerating dividend growth  to keep the payout ahead of interest rates and put some updraft under the share price 
Let s dive into the 4 names I have for you now 
 Profit Either Way  Play No  1  National Storage Affiliates
National Storage Affiliates Trust  NYSE NSA  certainly ticks our dividend yield box  with a 4 3  payout  it crushes the 10 year Treasury rate  And the payout is growing like a weed  having doubled in just the past 5 years 
In fact  management of this self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  is so confident that it regularly hikes the dividend more than once a year  Check it out 
NSA s Accelerating Dividend
In other words  if you d bought NSA a little more than three years ago  just after its IPO in April 2015  you d already be yielding an incredible 9 5  on your original buy now  thanks to that rapid payout growth  And if you need any convincing that a rising dividend drives up share prices  NSA delivers that  too 
NSA s Dividend Kick
NSA isn t the cheapest REIT  trading at 20 8 times funds from operations  FFO a better measure of REIT performance than earnings   but that s more than fair given its accelerating dividend and surging FFO  up 9   in each of the last 4 quarters   Buy now  before the next payout hike sends this one higher 
 Profit Either Way  Play No  2  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV 
The selloff has made stalwart dividend grower AbbVie  ABBV  cheaper than it s been in years  trading at just 11 5 times FCF  And talk about an accelerating dividend  This payout has nearly tripled in just 5 years 
But as you can see in the chart below  the dividend and the share price parted company starting in February  due to the overdone selloffs we ve seen this year  That gives us plenty of upside as the share price inevitably rises to close the gap 
Selloff Gives Us Our In
The thing I love about AbbVie is that it maintains this payout growth while spending just 43  of FCF on dividends  That leaves lots for R D  and that s exactly where the company puts its cash  pumping a high 18  of sales into its development pipeline 
And  yes  that pipeline is stuffed  with 38 development drugs  many of which are in Phase 3 trials or higher 
 Profit Either Way  Play No  3  UDR Inc 
You may have seen my recent article about  pullback proof  dividends  As the name suggests  these are wonderful companies whose share prices hold their own in a downturn  letting us collect their outsized dividends without losing sleep 
United Dominion Realty Trust Inc  NYSE UDR  fits that description to a T  the apartment landlord s stock didn t fall nearly as far as the market did in this latest selloff  and it s actually gained since Powell made his infamous  long way to go  comment in October 
Powell Can t Sink This REIT
UDR is so steady it sports a  beta  rating of just 0 37  anything less than 1 is more stable than the market  above 1 is less   So if you re looking to add consistency to your portfolio  UDR should be high on your list 
The REIT s yield of 3 1  doesn t really get our hearts racing  but hikes come year in and year out  like clockwork  The payout has grown a nice 37  in the last 5 years 
And that payout which has gone out to shareholders for 46 straight years is safe  eating up 73  of FFO  a very manageable level for a well run REIT like UDR 
Finally  the stock trades at 23 7 times FFO  but it s earned that multiple  given its stellar dividend history  modern buildings in growing coastal cities and sky high 97  occupancy rate  Grab UDR now and let it steady your portfolio in the next meltdown 
 Profit Either Way  Play No  4  Ingersoll Rand
Industrial stocks have taken a pounding this year  with the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLI  plunging 9  amid worries about tariffs and slowing global growth 
But Ingersoll Rand  IR  has bucked that trend  gaining 11   And thanks to the selloff  it s time to back up the truck on this hidden gem 
IR Shakes Off the Trade War
How is this possible 
Simple  three quarters of IR s business comes from heating and refrigeration  locking it into the trend toward energy efficiency 
As CEO Michael Lamach recently told CNBC   As the world gets warmer and more urbanized  people are concerned about greenhouse gas emissions  and we ve got solutions to eliminate 99 5  of those emissions in commercial buildings  
If that doesn t make IR a megatrend stock  I don t know what does  And the numbers back that up  IR s climate business is red hot  with bookings jumping 11  in Q3  and sales surging 10  
You re probably wondering how all this squares with President Trump s trade war  The truth is  it s not an issue  IR smartly makes most of the products in the US that it sells in the US  it does the same in the Chinese market 
One place IR does fall a bit short is in its current yield  just 2 1   But with a dividend that s more than doubled in the last 5 years and is accelerating we ll take that deal  the yield on our original buy will clear 3  in short order 
Trade War Rages  IR s Dividend Accelerates
The kicker  Despite its big gain  you can still snap up this rare tariff proof industrial stock at a bargain 15 5 times forward earnings

174690,396206,CL,Colgate Palmolive  CL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Colgate Palmolive  CL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 78 billion  down 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 56  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate Palmolive 
For Colgate Palmolive  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Colgate Palmolive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Colgate Palmolive would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Hold  stock Stock MovementThis New York City based global consumer products manufacturer and distributor has outperformed the broader sector in the last six months  Evidently  shares of Colgate advanced 14 7   compared with the Zacks categorized  sector s 9  upside  This is mainly attributable to its robust show even amid a tough retail landscape  This  in itself  speaks volumes about the company s ongoing prospects Robust Earnings TrendColgate has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record  Notably  the company has posted in line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three  Thus  the company s average positive earnings surprise is pegged at 0 7  for the trailing four quarters Colgate Palmolive Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    After posting in line earnings for two straight quarters  Colgate delivered a positive earnings surprise in first quarter 2017  Also  the bottom line grew year over year  aided by margin expansion and lower tax rate  The company has been witnessing enhanced margins for a while now  driven by the cost savings from the funding the growth and 2012 Restructuring Program  Further  better pricing and emerging market growth boosted performance amid a tough macro environment Solid Market Share GrowthColgate Palmolive commands a market leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories  Innovation and in store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate Palmolive s growth strategy over the years  enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories  In this regard  the gap between Colgate Palmolive and its closest rival increased from 70 basis points  bps  to 7 full points in the past 5 years  Moreover  on a year to date basis  the company s global market share in the manual toothbrush and toothpaste businesses reached 32 7  and 43 8   respectively  as of Mar 31  2017 Moreover  the company expects to further grow market share in 2017 through a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year  We believe that management s continued focus on product innovations  globally recognized brands and broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets assists the company to take advantage of growth opportunities  consequently enhancing profitability Strategic InitiativesThe company continues to progress well with savings programs  as both  its Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program along with its Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results  These initiatives contributed significantly to margin expansion in first quarter 2017  The four year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs in order to augment gross and operating profit  standardizing processes to improve the decision making procedure and enhance its market share position worldwide  Meanwhile  by the  Funding the Growth  initiative  the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers  while also reducing fuel and transportation costs  These programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term Further  the company has always followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that focuses on making investments to develop business  while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks  owing to its strong cash generation ability Bottom LineWhile all is well with this leading manufacturer of oral care and personal care products  its sales trend remains soft largely due to unfavorable currency movements  The company lagged sales estimates in 15 out of the past 16 quarters  Moreover  adverse currency and a tough global environment are likely to impact 2017 results  Nonetheless  organic sales are anticipated to improve sequentially throughout the year In a nut shell  we believe that Colgate s growth drivers far outweigh the obstacles and will help the company sustain its impressive momentum However  investors interested in the space can count on Unilever Plc   NYSE UL    Church   Dwight Company Inc    NYSE CHD   and Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC   OTC RBGLY    all carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Unilever  with long term EPS growth rate of 12   has increased nearly 11  in the last three months Church   Dwight has to its credit a spectacular earnings history as the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6 3  in the past four quarters  Moreover  it has a long term EPS growth rate of 9 2  Reckitt Benckiser  with long term EPS

3 Consumer Staples Stocks With Strong Growth Prospects

	The consumer staples sector has been drawing investors  attention of late backed by an improving economy and rising consumer confidence  Improved labor market optimism and gradual wage acceleration are driving consumer confidence  a key determinant of the economy s health 

Consumer Confidence Surges

	Consumer confidence improved moderately during the month of June indicating that the economy is on the recovery path after a dismal show in May  Steady job additions and persistently low unemployment have helped the household wealth to increase  This in turn  boosted consumer spending 

	According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 118 9 in June from May s reading of 117 6  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales 

	In mid June  the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate a quarter point for the third time since December  reiterating the fact that the economy is in good shape  The widely anticipated move  in view of strengthening labor market and stabilizing inflation  takes the Fed rate from 0 75 1  to 1 1 25   Further  the Fed indicated that it anticipates the next hike in December  along with three more in the coming year  which signals rising consumer confidence as well as the U S  economy s growth 

Sector s Correlation with the Economy

	Although the  sector  which is at the bottom 44  of the Zacks Sector Rank  9 out of 16   has not been an outstanding performer  it still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators  We note that so far in the year  the sector has registered an increase of 8 32   almost in line with the S P 500 that is up 8 34  

	The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  improving employment scenario and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode

The industry is part of the bottom 24  of the Zacks Classified industries  64 out of the 265   On the contrary  the broader sector is placed at the bottom 38  of the Zacks Classified sectors  10 out of 16  

Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way Are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at 57 cents  up 13 6  from 50 cents delivered in the year ago quarter 
What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Reynolds American is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Reynolds American has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 57 cents  Reynolds American has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP for an earnings beat Reynolds American Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Driving the Company
Increased competition in the vapor category  declining volumes due to general shift of consumption away from tobacco products and higher taxes and strict anti smoking regulations are expected to hurt the to be reported quarter 
Meanwhile  we note that Reynolds reported positive surprise during fourth quarter 2016  after reporting negative surprises in the preceding two quarters  However  Reynolds is losing share in Moist Snuff segment and the performance of Camel brand also remains under pressure 
Despite high excise tax and anti smoking regulations  we are impressed with the cigarette maker s strong brand portfolio  shift to low risk  smokeless tobacco products  cost reduction initiatives and strong pricing  The Newport brand  added to the company s portfolio post Lorillard acquisition  has enhanced its position in the industry  Newport s expanded presence is helping the company boost its top line 
Further  investors are looking forward toward the highly anticipated merger between Reynolds and British American Tobacco  LON BATS  Plc   NYSE BTI   signed in Jan 2017  The combined entity will own a global portfolio including next generation products and strong cigar brands including Kent from British American Tobacco and Camel  Newport and Pall Mall from Reynolds 
Further  the combined company will benefit from Reynolds  strong position in the alternative tobacco and next generation product development  and R D capabilities  Consequently  the newly merged entity can develop an innovative pipeline of vapor and tobacco heating products  The merger is expected to complete in third quarter 2017

174854,396370,CL,Unilever  UN  Q3 Sales Dip On Currency Woes  Stock Down,opinion,"Shares of Unilever  LON ULVR  N V    NYSE UN   declined 2 72  in after hours trading on Oct 13 after the company posted weak third quarter 2016 results 
In the third quarter  Unilever s sales fell 0 1  mainly due to currency headwinds and weak economic conditions in a number of countries  On a constant currency basis  sales increased 3 4  in the quarter  Unilever delivered organic sales growth of 3 2   in local currency   which was toward the lower end of the 3  5  range expected for the year  Higher pricing of 3 6  offset the volume decline of 0 4   Organic sales growth was lower than 4 7  growth in the preceding quarter 
Emerging markets grew 5 6  in the third quarter of 2016  weaker than 7 7  growth in the second quarter and 8 3  in the first quarter  Many emerging markets continued to remain weak and volumes have also slowed down  particularly in Latin America where currency devaluation has pushed up consumers  cost of living  squeezing disposable incomes 
The Asian markets were weak in the quarter  In India  consumer demand in skin cleansing was dampened by rising commodity costs  while in China  sales were down due to intense price competition from local brands in laundry and a rapid channel shift to e commerce 
Encouragingly  Philippines delivered double digit growth in the reported quarter  while Turkey and South Africa recorded price led growth  The company also witnessed improvement in North America and Latin America  despite a highly competitive environment  However  European markets remained challenging with subdued volume growth and continued price deflation in many countries 
Developed markets remained flat in the quarter as against 0 7  growth in the preceding quarter owing to weak volume growth and price deflation in Europe 
The company witnessed sales growth as well as improved pricing in all the categories of Personal Care  Refreshment  Home Care and Foods  Except Refreshments  volumes declined in all the other categories UNILEVER N V Price and Consensus
    Outlook
Overall  we are encouraged by the fact that Unilever is consistently focusing on improving its products through innovation  While the company is introducing new products in some markets  it is re launching some of its products with improvements in the existing markets  Unilever has also accelerated its cost containment measures to remove unnecessary costs and simplify the business 
The company has been relying on deodorants and hair care products to augment revenues this year  amid waning sales of its margarine and bread spreads  It also added personal care and other consumer brands  including Dermalogica and Kate Somervile  and the Zest soap brands  last year  In fact  the company entered into many deals recently in order to fortify its position in home care and personal care products  These acquisitions will strengthen the company s portfolio and add to its revenues 
Apart from acquisitions  Unilever has also been shedding off assets in its battered food business  The category has been delivering sluggish growth due to lack of innovation and declining demand  Demand has been weak owing to saturated markets in the U S    the company s major revenue source 
Also  the company still remains concerned about deteriorating trends in Europe  Brazil and Russia  Weakness in consumer demand persists  Many emerging markets continue to be volatile  particularly those dependent on oil and other commodity exports  and where currency devaluation is pushing up the cost of living for consumers

174857,396373,CL,Alternative Takeover Targets For Kraft Heinz,opinion,"I am quoted in a   Robert H  Smith School of Business  University of Maryland  on possible takeover targets for Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC   After withdrawing its offer for Unilever  LON ULVR   Kraft Heinz may be considering the acquisition of Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  or Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL  
Colgate Palmolive  The New York based Colgate Palmolive is smaller global player in household and personal care products and may have plenty to offer Kraft Heinz 
It doesn t have as many brands as Proctor   Gamble  but Colgate Palmolive  with its namesake toothpaste  dish soap and other consumer products has a strong global presence  In fact  most of its business is outside of the U S   Colgate is very big in Latin America and that s a whole new market that s growing   Kass says 
Among its other virtues  Kass says  is its size  Colgate Palmolive  with its a market capitalization of only about  68 billion  would be  more acquirable  
In fact  Colgate Palmolive s stock surged Friday morning on news about a potential Kraft Heinz and Unilever deal  Investors were betting that Unilever  perhaps looking to avoid a takeover  might look to merge with Colgate Palmolive as a white knight  making it more difficult and more costly for Kraft Heinz to make a deal 
And the stock has only added to those gains this week  on news that the Unilever deal wasn t meant to be   Colgate   Kass says   makes sense  
An alternative play  Kass says Kraft Heinz might play it safe and stick to its earlier script of acquiring another food company  If so  Mondelez International  the Illinois based multinational snacks and beverage brand that was spun off from the current Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC  in 2012  would be a likely candidate  he says
The company  with brands such as Oreo  Chips Ahoy   Triscuit  Nabisco  Milka  Toblerone  Cadbury  Trident  Dentyne  and Tang powdered drinks  has a presence in about 165 countries  giving Kraft Heinz the geographical reach it needs  Mondelez has a market capitalization of about  68 billion ",2017-02-23,David Kass,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alternative-takeover-targets-for-kraft-heinz-200176587,200176587

174888,396404,CL,Is Lululemon Stock Overpriced ,opinion,"lululemon athletica inc  O LULU 
Growing up in Vancouver  I had the pleasure of witnessing the rise of the Lululemon empire first hand  Back in the mid  2000s Lululemon apparel really started hitting its stride  fashion conscious young women began noticeably  and in large numbers  sporting the iconic black yoga pants with the white omega symbol all across Vancouver  As the yoga pants gave way to criticisms  complaints  and memes in the wider public  more and more Lululemon apparel started appearing on the streets  Popularity surged and a little known company from Vancouver  Canada that was once known merely for its black yoga pants is now a  8 5 billion market cap  publicly traded company 
It s not hard to see that the brand is immensely popular  It dug out a niche in the  athleisure  apparel through fashionable yoga inspired clothing and was a first mover  allowing it to quickly grow market share and command premium margins on its products  It has expanded its product line to include more than just yoga pants  Lululemon sells athletic leisure shirts  jackets  coats  sports bras  underwear  and other athletic apparel 
Over the past ten years  has grown revenue from  84 million to  1 8 billion  Net income has grown from  1 million to  239 million  Net margin has increased from 1 7  to 13 3   Free cash flow has grown from essentially zero to  195 million  Operating cash flow has consistently eclipsed net income over the past ten years  which hints at a strong ability to generate cash from the business 
On top of this growth  Lululemon carries very little debt  Current assets  of which 70  is made up of cash and short term investments  outstrip current liabilities by almost 6 times  There is absolutely no long term debt on the balance sheet  It carries a current ratio   total assets divided by total liabilities   6 3  The balance sheet is very pristine and a thing of beauty to look at 
Based on profitability ratios  Lululemon is generating Return on Assets of around 20   Return on Invested Capital of around 20   and Return on Equity of around 22   all while employing very little financial leverage  as the note on the balance sheet in the previous paragraph indicated 
Looking through these numbers  and first hand experience with the product  it is not hard to see that this is a strong brand with quality cash generating capabilities  Yet  although the enterprise is most definitely attractive  we must analyze if ownership in the enterprise at current prices is attractive  A single stock of Lululemon is currently trading at around  60 per share  With 2015 earnings per share at  1 83  you have to pay 33 times current earnings to buy into the enterprise 
Analysts project growth for Lululemon to be around 15  over the next 5 years  Doing a quick  back of the envelope calculation based on current prices and projected growth of 15   we can see project that earnings per share could be at  3 68 per share by 2021  Now  if the market is willing to pay the same 33 P E multiple in 2021  buying at current prices would compound at 15  over the next five years  If the stock experiences some mild P E contraction and the market is only willing to pay 30 times earnings  you get to compound at 13   And if the market is only willing to pay a 25 times multiple  you will have compounded at 9  
Lululemon operates in a fiercely competitive market  The athletic and athletic leisure apparel sector is strife with competition  with big players like Nike  N NKE   Under Armour Inc  N UA   and Gap Inc  N GPS   The competition is fuelled by the attractive margins and growing popularity in the  athleisure  style  I think it would be too optimistic to imagine that Lululemon will continue to enjoy a 30  earnings multiple as competition intensifies for consumer dollars in the sector 
In order to build in a margin of safety  I believe it would be wise to assume a P E compression into the mid to high twenties out in 2021  This would mean that at current stock prices  you could expect the stock to compound at an annual average rate of around 9  to 10   While these are potentially solid figures and nothing to sneeze at  one could expect similar results    all things equal  Colgate is the more logical choice in this scenario as it provides a better risk adjusted return 
Therefore  while Lululemon is an attractive enterprise  with a pristine balance sheet and a sound economic engine that pumps out torrents of cash for its owners  I wouldn t initiate a position now  but would rather wait for a more attractive entry point when a dip in the stock price occurs  I don t believe the current asking price for an ownership stake will provide a superior return to other
