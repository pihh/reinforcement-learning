175239,396755,SO,Explainer  How the path to the Democratic presidential nomination is different in 2020,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Democratic Party will officially nominate a 2020 presidential candidate at its convention in July  a process that begins on Monday with the Iowa caucuses and ends with the Puerto Rico primary in June  The goal is to amass on a state by state basis the 1 991 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Milwaukee  A candidate must get at least 15  of the vote statewide or in an individual congressional district to be awarded delegates  The nominating process will be much different this time around after Democrats made changes aimed at increasing participation and ensuring transparency  The following explains some key changes   For a graphic on the delegate race  see   FEWER CAUCUSES In 2020  Democrats will hold caucuses in four states   Iowa  Nevada  North Dakota and Wyoming   far fewer than the 18 conducted in states and territories in the 2016 campaign  Caucuses require voters to attend a lengthy meeting in person and vote in the open by raising their hand or gathering with fellow supporters  The process has been criticized as undemocratic because it can dampen participation and is subject to intimidation  In person meetings at a set time can often be difficult for shift workers or parents to attend   The caucus system favors candidates with a strong  active base instead of broader support  U S  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  for example  significantly outperformed his rival  Hillary Clinton  in caucuses in the 2016 campaign  In primaries  voters show up to their polling place and check the box for the candidate of their choice  SUPER TUESDAY TO PLAY A BIGGER ROLE  The first states to vote   Iowa and New Hampshire   have always had an outsized role in picking nominees   This year  Super Tuesday   when 14 states will vote on March 3  could hold more sway   California moved its primary from early June to Super Tuesday  With Texas already on the Super Tuesday calendar  the switch means the nation s two most populous states with a total of 643 delegates   both with large Hispanic populations   will vote on the same day  South Carolina may see the biggest drop in attention because of the rise of Super Tuesday  Traditionally  South Carolina has held the first Southern  NYSE SO  primary  and is the first state to vote with a sizable black population   This year  South Carolina votes on Feb  29 with Super Tuesday just three days later  Most polling in the state has former Vice President Joe Biden with a sizable lead  Activists in South Carolina say they have already seen a drop in visits from candidates this year  If candidates are forced to choose between campaigning in a state where they are way behind in polls or trying to bolster their fortunes in Super Tuesday states  it is possible South Carolina could receive little attention from many candidates   WHEN CAN WE EXPECT A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE  Democrats are looking at a more compressed calendar this year than in past presidential nominating cycles  and the sped up voting could produce a nominee more quickly  When more than two dozen candidates initially announced intentions to run  Democrats were privately concerned that the large field could result in a contest that stretched for months   Compounding that fear was a concern of a repeat of 2016  when Sanders refused to concede even long after it was clear he could not win  But the field of Democratic hopefuls has narrowed drastically before the voting begins  A week before Iowa votes  12 Democrats remain with only five of them polling nationally above 5    The compressed calendar may help one Democrat consolidate support more quickly  After Super Tuesday  nearly 30  of the eligible U S  population will have had a chance to participate in picking the nominee  By the end of March  elections covering well over 50  of the party s delegates will have taken place  There is one candidates trying to throw a wrench into anyone s efforts to ride momentum in the early primary contests to victory on Super Tuesday  Michael Bloomberg   The billionaire media mogul entered the race late and has been pumping millions of dollars of his own wealth into trying to be competitive on Super Tuesday  If he picks up enough delegates on Super Tuesday  it could make it harder for another candidate to consolidate support and secure the nomination  WHAT ABOUT SUPERDELEGATES  Superdelegates are elected Democratic officeholders who are part of each state s delegation but are not committed to vote based on the outcome of the state s nominating contest  All Democratic members of Congress and state governors are superdelegates   In 2016  many superdelegates announced early support for Clinton  drawing criticism that the party was tipping the scales in her favor  Superdelegates have not been eliminated in 2020  but new rules limit their influence  This cycle  they will likely not vote on the first ballot at the convention   To win on the first ballot  a candidate must secure the majority of the party s 3 979 pledged delegates available during the nominating contests leading up to the Democratic convention  If the front runner has fewer than 1 991 delegates  the convention will hold a second vote  On subsequent ballots  all delegates become unpledged and superdelegates can also vote   Then  a majority of all 4 750 delegates will be needed to secure the nomination   
If a candidate wins a supermajority of pledged delegates   or about 2 378   then superdelegates are permitted to vote on the first ballot ",2020-02-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/explainer-how-the-path-to-the-democratic-presidential-nomination-is-different-in-2020-2073838,2073838

175241,396757,SO,Lakers  James picks No  2 for All Star Game as tribute,news,"Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James had a choice for the NBA All Star Game later this month in Chicago 
He could choose to have his team wear No  24 to honor Kobe Bryant  who died Jan  26 in a helicopter crash  Or he could opt for his team to wear No  2 to honor Bryant s daughter  Gianna  a budding basketball star who died with her famous father and seven others on a foggy morning in Southern  NYSE SO  California 
James  who has a 5 year old daughter of his own  quickly chose No  2 to honor Gianna

 To see him these last three years just being     y all see  GirlDad   the hashtag  I m a girl dad  My brother right here  Anthony Davis  is a girl dad  
James told reporters that he thought of his daughter  Zhuri  as he chose No  2 
Monday was another day of tributes to Kobe Bryant  who died with Gianna and seven others in the crash in the hills of Calabasas  Calif  University of Connecticut women s basketball coach Geno Auriemma wore Bryant s Lakers jersey under his jacket and over his shirt and tie during his team s home game against Oregon 
The Huskies honored Gianna last week by placing a No  2 jersey on its bench  Gianna had said she wanted to one day play at UConn 
Also on Monday  the Lakers took down a large public memorial to Bryant across from the Staples Center on Monday  The team will store the donated items and may relocate the memorial or donate it to the Bryant family depending on the family s wishes 
James said Bryant remains at the top of mind for players on the Lakers  who pulled away for a 129 113 win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday after scoring 81 points in the first half 
 The fact that we scored 81 points     in the first 24 minutes  how eerie that was  and then both teams  combined points were 242   like 24 for Kobe and 2 for Gianna   there was some weird stuff going on   James said

Answering Beijing s call  banks are rushing to offer virus fighting loans at ultra low rates  investment banks are helping companies issue anti virus bonds faster  and managers of mutual funds are refraining from selling stocks  to damp market panic 
Concerted efforts to rein in the virus that emerged late last year in the central city of Wuhan highlight the centralized power the ruling Communist Party wields in a sector dominated by state owned companies 
But the campaign  which has stirred memories of government rescue efforts during a market crash in 2015  deepens concern over corporate governance in China and risks sowing seeds of future trouble 
Wuhan DDMC Culture   Sports Co  SS 600136   a leisure company in the city  won Shanghai Stock Exchange approval to issue bonds of up to 600 million yuan   86 million  via a  green channel  created for virus hit companies  it said on Thursday

Three other companies   Zhuhai Huafa Group  Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical and China Nanshan Development Group   have raised a combined 2 1 billion yuan   301 million  this week by issuing bonds via the interbank market  to fund virus battling efforts 
Proceeds from the debt issuance  which won quicker than usual approval from regulators  will fund drug discovery programs and hospital construction  the companies said 
Regulators have also asked banks to inject cheap funds into virus stricken areas  and not to withdraw loans from companies suffering the impact  Sectors such as tourism  transport and leisure are the worst hit 
Bank of Suzhou  in the eastern province of Jiangsu  vowed to cut financing costs for hundreds of small corporate clients and bolster lending 
For companies such as food producers  logistics firms and makers of anti virus drugs  it will cut the rate on loans by 10 basis points below the lending benchmark  to stand as low as 3 98  
A loan officer at Bank of China promised special treatment for those defaulting because of virus fallout  saying the central bank would cap interest on loans to firms with operations critical to beating the virus  such as makers of masks and drugs 
He added   Such companies will enjoy the lowest possible rates  
But the orchestrated support also triggered concerns of moral hazard among some 
 I m afraid many companies about to go bankrupt will come and say their businesses are affected by the virus outbreak   said a bond fund manager  who declined to be named

175247,396763,SO,Pimco ex CEO faces prison in U S  college admissions bribery scheme,news,"By Peter Szekely
 Reuters    The former head of asset management firm Pimco faces two years in prison if prosecutors get their way when he is sentenced on Friday for his part in a scheme in which privileged parents paid bribes to get their children into U S  colleges 
Douglas Hodge  who prosecutors called among  the most culpable  of 35 parents charged  would become the 15th person to be sentenced since the nationwide cheating scandal came to light last March 
While the other 14 defendants received prison terms ranging from one day to six months  prosecutors said Hodge and three others who entered guilty pleas in October deserve stiffer sentences 
 They are repeat players  who engaged in the conspiracy again and again  over years   Boston U S  Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a sentencing memo this week 
Hodge  who retired as chief executive of Allianz SE s  DE ALVG  California based Pimco in 2016  paid bribes totaling  850 000 over nearly 11 years to get two of his children into Georgetown University and two others into the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California  prosecutors said 
He tried and failed to offer bribes to get a fifth child into Loyola Marymount University  they said 
Prosecutors asked U S  District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton to impose a sentence of 24 months  which they called the low end of range that runs up to 30 months under sentencing guidelines 
In all  53 people have been charged in the college admissions scandal  including  Desperate Housewives  star Felicity Huffman and  Full House  actress Lori Loughlin  Huffman pleaded guilty and served less than two weeks in prison  while Loughlin pleaded not guilty 
The case revolves around consultant William  Rick  Singer  who admitted in March that he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and bribed sports coaches to present his clients  children as fake athletic recruits 
Singer  who has yet to be sentenced  is cooperating with prosecutors 
Hodge s lawyers sought leniency  citing his philanthropy  devotion to his children and Singer s deception in telling him that his money would go toward university programs and underprivileged student athletes 
Hodge insisted  contrary to a prosecution claim  that he never involved his children in the scheme  He admitted that he did not pull out of the scheme once he learned of Singer s deception 
 For that  I am deeply ashamed and remorseful   he wrote in a letter to the judge 






Hodge s lawyers asked the judge to consider splitting incarceration with home detention  along with supervised release  a fine and a  robust community service program  ",2020-02-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/pimco-exceo-faces-prison-in-us-college-admissions-bribery-scheme-2079021,2079021

PennEast had sought the support of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after a court decision prevented it from exercising eminent domain in New Jersey  Its developers    which include Enbridge Inc  and Southern  NYSE SO  Co     argued the ruling overturned 80 years of industry practice 
On Thursday  the energy commission voted 2 1 in favor of PennEast s petition  lending the project support as it prepares to take its case to the nation s highest court

175267,396783,SO,USA Gymnastics files plan to emerge from bankruptcy,news," Reuters    USA Gymnastics said on Thursday it filed a plan to emerge from bankruptcy that offers the group of survivors who were sexually abused by former national team doctor Larry Nassar a  215 million settlement 
The women  as a group  may vote to accept the  215 million to settle all their claims or pursue their lawsuits and collect any judgments from insurance policies available to the sport s national governing body 
USA Gymnastics also said if the survivors vote to accept the settlement  the insurers for Twistars  a Michigan based Gymnastics club where athletes said Nassar abused them  will also contribute an additional  2 125 million to the settlement amount 
Whichever option the women accept will apply to all members of the survivor class 
The plan also includes benchmarks that obligate USA Gymnastics to continue to enhance athlete safety and provides for payments to other creditors of USA Gymnastics 
 While we do not yet have an agreement with the Committee representing the survivors  we still hope to reach an agreement   USA Gymnastics Chief Executive Li Li Leung said in a news release 
 USA Gymnastics filed its proposed plan to communicate to the survivor class the two options that are currently available based on the amount of money USA Gymnastics  insurers are willing to pay into a settlement fund  
According to Leung  who was hired last February to help USA Gymnastics navigate the aftermath of a devastating sex abuse scandal  the plan allows for ongoing negotiations among the parties and the governing body are hopeful discussions will lead to an agreement that is supported by all parties in the case 
Many gymnasts who suffered abuse at Nassar s hands have accused USA Gymnastics of failing to investigate earlier complaints about his misconduct 
The plan of reorganization was filed with the U S  Bankruptcy Court for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Indiana 
USA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy in December 2018  saying at the time it was staggering under the weight of lawsuits filed by hundreds of women who were sexually abused by Nassar

LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The Los Angeles Lakers will pay tribute to Kobe Bryant on Friday when the team plays its first game since the NBA great died  although details of what that will entail remain unclear 
Bryant perished along with his 13 year old daughter Gianna and seven others when the helicopter they were travelling in crashed in foggy weather on a hillside northwest of Los Angeles on Sunday 
 I m gonna let that play out tomorrow night  let you guys see it   Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters on Thursday when asked what tributes fans could expect to see when the team takes on the visiting Portland Trail Blazers 
 I ve been briefed on some of the things that we re going to see  But I m going to let that play out tomorrow night  
The Lakers postponed a game scheduled for Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers after news of the accident broke and it is unclear when that game will be made up 
Practice on Thursday began with some flag football on an outside field near the team s practice facility in what Vogel called  therapeutic  Southern  NYSE SO  California sunshine 
 We are striking a balance of trying to make us feel good   Vogel said 
 Laughter is always a good remedy for something like this when it s appropriate 
 We ve had some of that at today s workout outside     it s not the first time we ve done that but it does feel good to be out there  you know  just a little bit of a change up 
 It was really just a warm up  once we came inside it was business  get back to business and lock into the work  
Vogel said the team is beginning to get back to normal but admitted staying focused on the task at hand on Friday will be challenging amid tributes to Bryant  who played 20 seasons with the Lakers  winning five championships and millions of fans 
 I would imagine it probably makes it a little harder than an ordinary game  with all the emotions and that stuff  but we shouldn t do it any other way   he said

175274,396790,SO,Burger King says it never promised Impossible Whoppers were vegan,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    Burger King  saying it never billed its  Impossible Whoppers  as vegan or promised to cook them a particular way  said a proposed class action by a vegan customer over the plant based patties being cooked on the same grills as meat burgers should be thrown out 
In a court filing on Thursday  Burger King said plaintiff Phillip Williams  NYSE WMB  should have asked how Impossible Whoppers were cooked before ordering one that he said was  coated in meat by products  at an Atlanta drive through 
Burger King said reasonable customers would ask about its cooking methods  and Williams would have known he could request an alternative method had he done even  the smallest amount of investigation  on its website or by reading media reports 
Williams  assumed that an Impossible Whopper would satisfy his own particularly strict form of veganism    solely because he asked a Burger King restaurant employee to  hold the mayo    Burger King said   This claim has no basis  
Lawyers for Williams did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment 
Williams claimed in his Nov  18 lawsuit in Miami federal court that Burger King  duped  him into buying the Impossible Whopper at a premium price and is seeking damages on behalf of all U S  consumers who bought it 
Burger King is a unit of Toronto based Restaurant Brands International Inc  TO QSR   which also owns the Canadian coffee and restaurant chain Tim Hortons and is overseen by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital 
Impossible Foods Inc  which helped create the Impossible Whopper  has said it was designed for meat eaters who want to consume less animal protein  not for vegans or vegetarians

175275,396791,SO,Southern Copper  SCCO  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Southern  NYSE SO  Copper  SCCO  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29  
Revenues are expected to be  1 88 billion  up 11 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 38  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Copper 
For Southern Copper  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Copper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern Copper would post earnings of  0 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 50  delivering no surprise 
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern Copper doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southern-copper-scco-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200504492,200504492
175276,396792,SO,Is Southern Company Stock a Buy ,news,"Southern Company  NYSE SO  has a market beating yield of 3 5  and  as one of the largest utilities in the United States  is viewed as a safe haven investment  However  the stock is up 47  over the past 12 months  Is it still worth adding to your portfolio after such a good run 
From last to first
In 2017 and 2018 Southern lagged well behind the utility peer group  as measured by Vanguard Utility ETF  The numbers were huge  Over that two year span Southern s stock fell 10  while the Vanguard Utility ETF advanced 10   a 20 percentage point difference  That may not sound like much  but utilities are supposed to be slow and steady stocks of the type that so called  widows and orphans  might own because of the safety and the income they produce  Note that  at the end of 2018  Southern s yield was nearly 5 5   

Since the start of 2019  however  Southern s stock has been on fire     for a utility  The stock is up nearly 60  since that point  providing more than twice the return of the utility average  In fact  its return was roughly twice that of the S P 500 Index  as well  That s worthy of note  being that the average utility basically tracked along with  though slightly behind  the S P 500  It isn t often that a utility stock beats that S P 500 by a two to one margin 
Getting back on track
The big price advance was largely driven by the company s ongoing efforts to build a pair of nuclear power plants at its Vogtle facility  In 2017 the future of this project was in question following the bankruptcy of Westinghouse  Southern s contractor on the project  Add in the fact that the project was already behind schedule and over budget  and investors were increasingly concerned it wouldn t get done  Canceling Vogtle would have been a huge blow  financially and image wise  Peer SCANA  for example  ended up canceling its nuclear build  a move that left it in a precarious financial position and led to its eventual acquisition by Dominion Energy 
Southern chose to step in and take over the Vogtle project  It also had to  basically  agree with its partners that it would shoulder any further cost increases to keep the nuclear build alive  These were bold moves and ones that  based on the project s track record  involved a lot of risk  Investors understandably took a show me attitude  letting Southern s stock languish while it proved it could handle the massive task it had taken on  So far  however  Southern has done a great job of getting Vogtle back on track  hitting a number of important milestones in 2019  The next three years will see the completion of the two nuclear reactors  assuming all continues to go well  Add in solid earnings in 2019  and the stock had a huge run 
So Southern has gone from pariah to darling in roughly 12 months  And that changes the equation a great deal when it comes to investors  For example  at this point  the stock is trading near all time highs and the dividend yield is near all time lows  For value conscious investors  adding Southern would be a tough call  Although its price to earnings ratio is toward the low end of its closest peers  size wise   suggesting that it s relatively inexpensive  its yield is far from compelling  historically speaking  and modest relative to those same peers  While historically low yields are fairly common in the utility space right now  it doesn t mean investors should step in at Southern 

SO Dividend Yield data by YCharts
The big problem is the same one that left Southern a laggard through 2017 and 2018  Vogtle  This project remains years away from completion  And there are a lot of major milestones that it needs to achieve if it is to get done on time and on budget  Building a nuclear power plant is a complicated affair  and while the success Southern has had getting Vogtle back on track is laudable  it still has a lot of work to do before it is done  
Not a great buy
At the end of the day  investors who own Southern should be pleased that Mr  Market has bid the shares higher  There s no particular reason to sell the stock  being that things are going well in its core businesses and with the once troubled Vogtle project  However  after such a sharp run up  investors looking to initiate a position should probably hold off  Southern s stock may look relatively cheap compared to some of its peers  but that doesn t mean it s a bargain  If you are looking for dividend stocks  the midstream sector and some select real estate investment trusts would provide a better hunting ground ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pprq0,2073686

175279,396795,SO,Disappointing Near Term Outlook For Staffing Industry,opinion,The Zacks industry comprises companies that offer a wide range of services related to human resources and workforce solutions  These include employment screening  recruitment  both for temporary staffing and long term placements   retirement solutions  human capital management  payroll management  performance management  organizational planning  financial and expense management Here are the industry s three major themes Revenues and cash flow have grown steadily over the past few years  enabling most industry players to pay out stable dividends  Economic strength and stability  which drives manufacturing and non manufacturing activities  are aiding the industry with additional hiring and wage increase  Notably  U S  GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2 1  in fourth quarter 2019  in line with growth in the third quarter  per estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis Staffing firms are shifting toward employee friendly  technology based recruiting techniques like social media  mobile technology  artificial intelligence and big data  Also  technologies like cloud and blockchain offer more storage and safety to HR data  These trends should keep demand for staffing services in good shape Owing to record low unemployment and a tight labor market  employers are reluctant to lay off skilled employees  This has reduced the pool of experienced candidates  As a result  hiring of temporary and contractual workers is likely to increase throughout the year Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Staffing industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  182  This rank places it in the bottom 29  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates weak near term growth prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The sell side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been decreasing their estimates  Over the past year  the industry s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has decreased 5 8  Despite the bleak prospects  we present a few stocks that investors can retain in their portfolio  But before that  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuationIndustry Underperforms Sector and S P 500The Zacks Staffing industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 6 7  over this period against 25 1  rally of the broader sector and 22 1  rise of the Zacks S P 500 composite One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization   which is commonly used for valuing staffing stocks because of their high debt levels  the industry is currently trading at 6 75X compared with the S P 500 s 11 95X and the sector s 12 19X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 9 73X  as low as 5 60X and at the median of 7 63X  as the charts below show EV to EBITDA  Bottom LineA solid economy  which drives manufacturing and non manufacturing activities  is aiding the staffing industry with additional hiring and wage increase  However  higher talent cost due to a competitive labor market and lack of

175294,396810,SO,3 Buy Ranked REITs To Help Investors Add Income To Their Portfolios  ,opinion,"U S  stocks fell on Tuesday amid worries about the spread of a potentially deadly virus that began in central China  Despite the downturn  the Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq have all counited to climb in 2020  Looking ahead  economists are calling for expansion in 2020  bolstered by the phase one trade deal  low interest rates  an expected return to earnings growth  and more 
Even with all the signs of strength  investors should still think about adding some income to their portfolios in the form of divided paying stocks  And a good place to start is the Real Estate Investment Trusts market 
REITs are companies that own  operate  or finance real estate properties that produce income  such as apartment complexes or retail locations  These companies are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications to be classified as a REIT 
We should note that instead of earnings  REITs report funds from operations or FFO  but investors can view them as essentially the same for our purposes  Meanwhile  one distinct advantage is that REITs must pay at least 90  of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders  Clearly  this means REITs are great options for income investors 
Here are three highly ranked REITs that we found utilizing our that investors looking for income might want to buy for their 2020 portfolios 
Medical Properties Trust  Inc    NYSE MPW  
Medical Properties Trust is a REIT that works to offer health industry operators access to capital to help fund technology upgrades  hiring  facility improvements  and new construction through long term net leases of real estate assets  MPW  which has become one of the world s largest owners of hospitals  boasting 390 facilities across eight countries  announced in early January that it completed its acquisition of the real estate interests of 30 hospitals in the UK for  1 5 billion 
Shares of the Birmingham  Alabama based firm have surged 28  in the last six months to outpace its industry s 8  average and the S P s 12   The stock  which hit a new 52 week high Tuesday  is now up 71  in the past two years  This helps make its 4 67  dividend yield all the more impressive  Medical Properties Trust s yield more than doubles the 10 year U S  Treasury note s 1 76   And MPW s positive earnings revision activity helps it hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system 
Our current Zacks estimates call for Medical Properties Trust s fiscal 2019 funds from operations to slip 3 6  on roughly 6 5  stronger revenue  But Q4 FY19 looks as though it will help kick start a strong 2020  with sales projected to climb 34 3  to help lift its bottom line by 16   Then its fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump 33  above our 2019 estimate to reach  1 11 billion  with its FFO set to surge 26  
VICI Properties Inc    NYSE VICI  
VICI Properties is a REIT that focuses on the gaming  hospitality  and entertainment spaces  The New York based firm s portfolio features  22 market leading gaming properties   which includes Caesars Palace   NASDAQ CZR   in Las Vegas as well as golf courses and nightclubs  Last month  the company completed an acquisition of three regional gaming properties from Eldorado Resorts   NASDAQ ERI   and entered into a master lease agreement with Century Casinos   NASDAQ CNTY   
VICI Properties is expected to see its 2019 FFO pop 4 2   even though its sales are expected to dip marginally  The company s Q1 fiscal 2020 revenue is then projected jump 16   with fiscal 2020 projected to surge 29 4  above our 2019 estimate to reach  1 15 billion  This top line expansion is expected to lift VICI s bottom line by 14 3  in 2020 
VICI s positive bottom line revisions help it hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now  The stock  like MPW  jumped to hit a new 52 week high Tuesday  VICI shares are up 11  in the past three months and 26  over the last year  And in keeping with the theme  VICI s dividend currently yields 4 53   Plus  VICI is trading at 15 4X forward 12 month Zacks earnings estimates  This marks a discount against its industry s 18 3X average and the S P s 19 2X 
Camden Property Trust   NYSE CPT  
Camden Property Trust focuses mainly on ownership  management  development  redevelopment  acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities  The Houston  Texas based company owns and operates roughly 160 communities that total 56 000 apartments around the U S  from Southern  NYSE SO  California to Florida 
Shares of Camden have climbed 21  in the last year and 30  over the past two years to sit just off their 52 week highs  CPT is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   based in large part on its positive bottom line estimate revisions for fiscal 2020  The stock also earns a  B  grade for Momentum and its dividend yields a solid 2 91  at the moment 
CPT s fiscal 2019 revenue is expected to pop nearly 8  to hit  1 03 billion and help lift its FFO by 5 7   Then  in fiscal 2020  Camden s revenue is projected to climb 5 5  above our current full year estimate  This climb is expected to help lift its bottom line another 7 5  higher

175295,396811,SO,The Energy Report  Big Wheels,opinion,"Big wheels are not turning  leading to more oil demand destruction because of the coronavirus  The negative impact on oil demand with more than 50 million people under quarantine  could have a historical impact on oil demand  The story is overshadowing an attack on the U S  Embassy in Iraq 
China has confirmed 2744 cases of the virus with the death toll at 41  In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus  they have decided to extend the Lunar Day holiday to February 2  That means more demand destruction for oil  In China  factories are closed and will remain closed  Hundreds of flights out of Wuhan and the surrounding 16 cities in Hubei Province have been cancelled  Trains and buses are also locked down as the toll on demand will continue to rise  Saudi Arabia said it believes the crisis so far will have a  minimal impact  on consumption  yet they may be overly optimistic 
Forex Live reports that China s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei today said the incubation period for the virus could range from one to 14 days  and the virus is infectious during incubation  which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome   According to recent clinical information  the virus s ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger   Ma told a media briefing  He warned that containment efforts would be intensified 
 China has now announced that going forward there will be daily briefings at 9 am Beijing time  That s 0100 GMT or 8 pm in New York  The WHO repeated on Sunday that it has not yet declared the virus to be a global emergency 
China Southern  NYSE SO  Airlines  China Eastern Airlines  and Air China have been ordered by the country s government to cancel flights to and from Wuhan and give prospective passengers full refunds 
The bottom line for oil is that we have never seen a quarantine of this magnitude  Planes and trains are not moving and factories are closed and will cause a historic hit to energy demand  Yet the more considerable fallout may be to come as it is possible that this could slow not only the Chinese economy but the global economy as well 
 Yet Fox News reports that U S  Embassy in Baghdad was struck by at least one rocket Sunday evening in the latest attack on American targets in Iraq  a senior U S  official confirmed to Fox News  The official said all Pentagon officials are safe and accounted for  There were no reported deaths or injuries   That risk may give oil some backdoor support

175304,396820,SO,Task force pushes U S  lawmakers to strengthen insider trading rules,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    A group of former U S  officials and lawyers is urging Congress to strengthen and clarify law around insider trading that has  generated confusion  and  failed to keep up with the times  
The United States needs a specific law to prohibit insider trading  rather than continuing to rely on rules against fraud and deception  a task force led by former U S  attorney for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York Preet Bharara said in a report published on Monday 
The task force recommended a legislative fix that outlines elements of insider trading with a focus on material  nonpublic information that is  wrongfully  obtained or communicated  according to the report 
That would mark a shift as there is no current U S  law that explicitly prohibits insider trading  according to the lawyers  Decades of cases  including a recent high profile one against former Republican U S  Representative Chris Collins  instead rely largely on previous court decisions and enforcement of restrictions against deceptions and fraud 
 If we move to a standard that talks about wrongfully obtaining information  it will cover conduct that unquestionably involves the same conduct as insider trading but do so more clearly   Joon H  Kim  vice chair of the group and former acting U S  Attorney for the Southern District of New York  said in a phone interview 
The U S  House of Representatives last month passed a law to explicitly prohibit trading of securities by someone who is aware of material  nonpublic information  But the Senate has yet to act 
The House of Representatives  Insider Trading Prohibition Act goes a long way toward providing that clarity  though it kept a requirement for  personal benefit  that should be eliminated  Kim said 
It was not immediately clear how much weight the task force s recommendations might carry with U S  lawmakers  but the panel includes many former enforcement officials besides Bharara and Kim 
The group also included Columbia University law school professor John Coffee  Jr   former Justice Department official Katherine R  Goldstein  former SEC Commissioner Joseph A  Grundfest  former U S  Attorney for the Northern District of California Melinda Haag  former SEC enforcement official Joan E  McKown  and senior U S  district judge for New York District Judge Jed Rakoff ",2020-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/task-force-pushes-us-lawmakers-to-strengthen-insider-trading-rules-2068712,2068712

remodeling  and development of outdoor structures  Companies in the industry also design  manufacture  source and sell flooring products Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry s prospects are highly correlated with the U S  housing market condition  Any untoward situation influencing the construction and housing sectors will impact the industry participants  financials  Housing starts  a big source of demand for forestry products  have been bullish in recent times  Lower mortgage rates since the beginning of 2019 appear to be boosting buyer demand for housing and improving housing dynamics should help industry players  entire mix of businesses  including lumber  Oriented Strand Board or OSB  and timber  The industry stands to benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure projects and strong gains in repair and remodeling activity  Volatility in lumber price has been a major concern for the wood industry  An unusual rise in the cost of lumber products sold by primary producers will increase the cost of inventory and limit margins on fixed priced lumber products  However  a decline in costs will lead to lower profits as products sold will be indexed to the current lumber market  Again  weaker export and domestic demand resulting from continued Chinese tariffs on Southern  NYSE SO  Yellow Pine logs coupled with an increase in tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine lumber remains the culprit  Meanwhile  lower OSB pricing continues to hurt the profitability of industry players  The companies whose products have a high degree of product concentration in OSB continue to struggle with lower OSB pricing  We do not expect OSB pricing to recover to levels seen in 2018 in the near term Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Wood industry is a 12 stock group within the broader  sector The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  The Zacks Wood industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  186  which places it in the bottom 26  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since June 2019  the industry s earnings estimate for 2020 has gone down 106  Despite the industry s dull near term prospects  we will present a few wood stocks that one can buy or hold on to  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Lags Sector  Outperforms S P 500The Zacks Building Products   Wood industry has lagged its own sector marginally over the past year  However  it has outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite over the same time frame Over this period  the industry has gained 40 4  compared with the sector s growth of 41 9   Meanwhile  the Zacks S P 500 composite has witnessed growth of 30 7  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing wood stocks  the industry trades at 51 6X versus the S P 500 s 20 3X and the sector s 18 4X Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 51 6X  as low as 16 3X and at the median of 23 9X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500 Bottom LineLow mortgage rates combined with resilient economic

industry players  entire mix of businesses  including lumber  Oriented Strand Board or OSB  and timber  The industry stands to benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure projects and strong gains in repair and remodeling activity  Volatility in lumber price has been a major concern for the wood industry  An unusual rise in the cost of lumber products sold by primary producers will increase the cost of inventory and limit margins on fixed priced lumber products  However  a decline in costs will lead to lower profits as products sold will be indexed to the current lumber market  Again  weaker export and domestic demand resulting from continued Chinese tariffs on Southern  NYSE SO  Yellow Pine logs coupled with an increase in tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine lumber remains the culprit  Meanwhile  lower OSB pricing continues to hurt the profitability of industry players  The companies whose products have a high degree of product concentration in OSB continue to struggle with

175339,396855,SO,Special Report  How secrecy in U S  courts hobbles regulators,news,By Mike Spector  Jaimi Dowdell and Benjamin Lesser LEBANON  Ohio  Reuters    Something wasn t right with the Rhino  Reports started trickling in to the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  in 2005 of people being killed or injured in the Yamaha Motor Co off road vehicles when they tipped over  But no clear pattern emerged  and in the rough and tumble off road world  accidents are common  The agency took no action  Then  in 2007  ten year old Ellie Sand was killed in a Rhino when it flipped in a cornfield in Warren County  Ohio  Her father  house painter John Sand  started reading up on other Rhino crashes  He spoke to other parents whose children had died or been seriously injured in similar incidents  He became convinced that Rhinos were the problem  Using a computer in a Cincinnati law library  Sand found more than a dozen lawsuits alleging that the vehicles were dangerously unstable  Some of the lawsuits   like the one he filed against the company in 2008   claimed that design flaws caused the Rhinos to roll over even at slow speeds on flat ground  Sand sent the results of his research to CPSC  highlighting details from the lawsuits of the tip overs that led to deaths and injuries  Soon after  CPSC sent a subpoena to Yamaha  forcing it to hand over a trove of information  much of which had lain hidden under judges  protective orders in the lawsuits against the company  By then  more than 40 people  including more than a dozen children  had been killed in Rhino crashes  The impact of Sand s work was confirmed in a voicemail message Sand received a few months later  Yamaha had agreed to a voluntary recall covering more than 100 000 Rhinos to fix the stability problems   As a result of the information   a lot of the information that we received from you   we ve gotten this far  so I wanted to thank you   Marc Schoem  then deputy director of CPSC s compliance and field operations  said in the March 31  2009  message  which was reviewed by Reuters  Five years after the recall was announced  CPSC staff noted in a 2014 briefing that crashes involving the Rhino had  decreased noticeably   Sand told Reuters he  was elated that the work I d done could help stop the carnage   Still  he was surprised that it took an  average Joe  like him to flag the lawsuits to CPSC  A CPSC spokesman said that the agency had investigated Rhino incidents and that establishing a pattern that would have supported finding the vehicles defective proved challenging  Schoem declined to comment  as did Yamaha  ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES CPSC is one of more than a dozen regulatory agencies tasked with protecting Americans from dangerous products  And the Rhino episode reveals a troubling dynamic in the way these watchdogs do their jobs  Sometimes the only way they can learn about and act on a possible threat to consumers is from evidence produced in lawsuits  but that evidence is often hidden behind a wall of secrecy  Most regulators have their own reporting systems for conducting oversight  But their databases can be vast and unwieldy  stuffed with thousands and even millions of consumer complaints and reports from manufacturers of safety concerns  injuries or deaths  The reports are often rife with mistakes and inconsistencies  Not all consumers even know they can file complaints  And companies regularly flout legally mandated reporting requirements  That leaves the courts as a conduit for alerting regulators to potential harm  and it s far from perfect  As Reuters has documented in earlier articles in this series  a thick blanket of secrecy covers product liability litigation in the United States  In just a handful of cases over the past several decades  hundreds of thousands of people were killed or injured by defective products   cars  drugs  guns   while information about the risks was hidden from consumers and regulators  sometimes for years  behind broad protective orders  These orders  though meant to protect specific information such as medical records and trade secrets  often give companies wide latitude to designate as confidential material exchanged between litigants in the pretrial discovery process   internal emails  data  research  meeting minutes  sworn depositions and the like  The secrecy typically persists for the life of the case  and long after  though court documents are  by law  presumed to be public  In an analysis of some of the largest mass defective product cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years  Reuters found 55 in which judges sealed information concerning public health and safety  And among those  only three had protective orders containing language specifically allowing information exchanged by the litigants to be shared with regulators  Regulators may subpoena information from a manufacturer after spotting a suspicious cluster of lawsuits  or after being alerted by a consumer like Sand in the Yamaha Rhino case  But those are rare exceptions  And regulators themselves aren t inclined to mine court records as a means of oversight  In the 55 big cases Reuters reviewed  public court filings contained no indication that regulators had requested any information arising from the lawsuits  A few years ago  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  and CPSC issued pleas for easier access to evidence introduced in court under protective orders  But the Environmental Protection Agency  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and 15 other federal departments or agencies surveyed by Reuters did not point to any explicit policy or guidance on gaining access to court evidence potentially relevant to their oversight functions  Yet regulators have repeatedly documented the failures of existing safeguards  Since 2009  NHTSA and CPSC have fined a total of at least 90 companies for failing to meet safety reporting requirements  while the FDA has issued more than a dozen warning letters to manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for similar lapses  Big business and its lobbyists contend that regulators have all the tools they need to do their jobs well   including the power to subpoena information subject to a judge s protective order   The protective order cannot block the government   said Victor Schwartz  a partner at law firm Shook  Hardy   Bacon LLP who has defended companies in civil litigation   Litigation gets publicity  If the government sees something about a case   it can use its power  the subpoena power  to find out more detail   he said  That argument  former U S  regulatory officials said  doesn t hold water when litigation is cloaked in secrecy   It s a catch 22   said David Friedman  a former NHTSA official  If documents and other evidence in litigation are sealed   how are you supposed to know about them   Friedman said   If you don t know about them  you can t get them   DEFECTIVE SWITCH Friedman was at NHTSA during General Motors  NYSE GM  Co s notorious 2014 recall of millions of cars with defective ignition switches  ultimately linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries  A 2015 deferred prosecution agreement between GM and federal prosecutors showed the company scrambled for years to make sense of mounting reports of deaths and injuries while keeping regulators and the public in the dark about the switches  even after uncovering clear internal evidence they were defective  As early as 2003  NHTSA received complaints that Saturn Ions were stalling and  by 2004  that their airbags were failing to deploy in collisions  Similar complaints soon cropped up about Chevrolet Cobalts  In the ensuing years  the agency examined several fatal Cobalt crashes  each involving switches that slipped out of position and disabled airbags  Yet NHTSA didn t make the connection between the switch problem and airbag failures  That was partly because its investigators misunderstood how GM s airbag system operated  but also because NHTSA rules gave automakers a lot of leeway in how they reported certain information regarding safety risks  As a result  similar incidents were reported inconsistently  One was listed as an  engine and engine cooling  issue  for instance  while another as an  electrical  problem  That made it difficult for regulators to detect a pattern  From the first consumer complaints and incident reports  it would be more than 10 years and scores of deaths and injuries before NHTSA and the public learned of the link between defective ignition switches and airbag failures   and then only after evidence of what GM knew emerged in litigation and prompted the automaker to pursue a recall   In June 2011  the parents of Jennifer Brooke Melton filed a product liability lawsuit against the company in a Georgia state court  Melton  a 29 year old nurse  was killed in March 2010 when her Cobalt stalled on a rainy highway  crossed into oncoming traffic  collided with another vehicle and careened into a creek  The Melton case started  as many like it do  under a veil of secrecy  In December 2011  Judge Kathryn Tanksley approved a broad protective order  keeping from the public and NHTSA any documents that GM designated  in good faith  as confidential  Tanksley  now retired  said she approved the order because both the Meltons  lawyer and GM agreed to the terms   The role of litigation is not to regulate GM   she said  When NHTSA officials want more information  she said  they  have to pursue it not through the court  but through their own power   The documents GM began turning over to Lance Cooper  the Meltons  lawyer  were damning  They showed that in 2005  for example  a company engineer suggested a fix for less than  1 per vehicle  but it was rejected as too costly and not effective enough  Cooper also obtained evidence that the company modified the switches between 2005 and 2008 to keep them from slipping  The evidence built a strong case that GM had known for years that the switches were faulty  The Meltons were eager to go public with the evidence to prevent others from dying as their daughter had  but Cooper worried that if he challenged the protective order and regulators didn t conclude the switches were defective  it would hurt their case  GM wanted to settle   We thought that people needed to know  There were still people out there driving those cars   Beth Melton told Reuters   It s a real shame that these things are kept secret and other people  suffer  because of it   Meanwhile  a Cobalt crash in Quebec  Canada  killed another driver  The airbags did not deploy  The ignition switch was later found to be in accessory mode  the position between on and off that could cut power to airbags  GM settled with the Meltons in September 2013 for  5 million  Five months later  after conducting its own investigation  GM recalled about 600 000 vehicles with the ignition switch  Cooper still wasn t satisfied  based on what he had learned in the Melton lawsuit  and having obtained a settlement for his clients  he decided it was time to share evidence with NHTSA   I basically said   The hell with it     Cooper said   If we can get this information to the federal government  they need it  Really  it was just a strategic decision to violate the protective order   In a letter to NHTSA   he suggested that the automaker knew about the defect far longer than its recall paperwork said and had not recalled enough vehicles  He urged the agency to investigate  citing evidence from the Melton case that he had seen as much as a year earlier  Eventually  NHTSA  Congress and federal prosecutors all investigated  relying heavily on evidence from the Melton case  GM increased the size of the recall  which eventually covered 2 6 million vehicles  In May 2014  NHTSA fined GM  35 million for failing to alert regulators to the defective ignition switch in a timely manner  The next year  GM entered into the deferred prosecution agreement with the U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York to settle criminal charges of concealing information from government officials and wire fraud  Under the deal  GM agreed to pay a  900 million fine and to submit to three years of oversight by an independent monitor  In 2018  a federal judge dismissed the charges against the company after prosecutors said the company had complied with the agreement   The most damning information came out in litigation   said Kevin Vincent  NHTSA s head lawyer at the time  Though the facts eventually came to light  Vincent said  initial confidentiality in the Melton case  stymied  the agency   That was evidence the agency needed to see   he said   We could have acted sooner   In a statement to Reuters  GM said   Since 2014  we have undertaken comprehensive reforms across the company to ensure that something like the ignition switch crisis never happens again   The company hired additional safety investigators  created a new executive position charged with overseeing global safety and recalls  and launched a program aimed at giving employees and dealers easier ways to flag potential vehicle defects  A NHTSA spokesman said the agency took 17 steps the U S  Transportation Department inspector general recommended in the wake of the ignition switch recall to improve collection and analysis of vehicle safety data  PLEAS FOR ACCESS In 2016  NHTSA and CPSC  seeking to address what they acknowledge is a blind spot in their efforts to safeguard consumers  issued bulletins recommending that judges and litigants agree to protective orders that would allow them to share confidential evidence pertinent to public health and safety with the relevant regulators   Our job is to protect consumers   said Marietta Robinson  a CPSC commissioner at the time   Obtaining information about an allegedly dangerous product from a lawyer representing a consumer who has been injured or killed is critically important to us doing that job   NHTSA s bulletin  which cited the GM ignition switch case  argued that keeping such information hidden from regulators clashes with federal legal requirements for courts to show  good cause  before allowing companies to keep it secret  But the bulletins  published in the Federal Register  where the government publishes new rules  proposals and public notices  carried no enforcement power  and they have had little impact  Judges have rarely shown willingness to grant requests from plaintiffs  expert witnesses or news organizations to share information with regulators or the public  Lawyers challenged defendants  claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 26 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed  and in most of them  judges refused to unseal the evidence  Some of those cases involved attempts to share information with the FDA  The FDA declined to comment on specific cases for this article  In general  the agency said  its powers to inspect drug makers  plants and launch criminal investigations  along with voluntary reporting requirements for drug makers   provide FDA with the tools to keep patients and consumers safe and fulfill its mission to protect and promote the public health   However  in the case of  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Inc s popular drug Chantix  which helps people quit smoking  court secrecy excluded possibly pertinent information from the agency s process for assessing safety  The FDA approved Chantix in 2006  Three years later  it placed a black box warning   its strongest   on the drug s label after receiving  reports of changes in behavior such as hostility  agitation  depressed mood  and suicidal thoughts or actions   Over time  Pfizer faced thousands of lawsuits blaming Chantix for such side effects  The company turned over millions of documents to plaintiffs under the condition they be kept confidential  In 2014  after Pfizer settled most of the cases for about  300 million  two plaintiff experts decided the FDA and the public should see internal Pfizer documents and expert reports that had been introduced in litigation  Through their lawyer  clinical psychiatrist Joseph Glenmullen and drug safety researcher Thomas Moore asked the judge overseeing the bulk of the Chantix litigation to unseal the information  which they said was important for  shedding light on Pfizer s awareness of Chantix s behavioral risks   Two days after their request was filed  U S  District Judge Inge Johnson in Alabama rejected it  Her brief order did not address the substance of the request  Johnson did not respond to requests for comment  The upshot was that  two years later  an FDA advisory panel did not have access to all the information the two men had sought to make public as it considered a Pfizer request to remove the black box warning  Pfizer s request was based on its own study claiming that Chantix did not have a significant association with depression and suicide  The advisory panel of medical experts in September 2016 recommended in a close vote to remove the black box warning  The FDA removed the black box warning a few months later  Chantix bottles still carry a less severe warning of potential mental health side effects  Moore acknowledged that it s impossible to know whether the evidence he and Glenmullen sought to provide to regulators would have changed the panel s decision  But he said he remains frustrated that information  central  to the question of Chantix s safety never made it into regulators  hands   The FDA should be able to see it   Moore said  Pfizer  in a statement to Reuters  said   The FDA and its 2016 advisory panel had access to all of the data and science on Chantix  and all of the adverse events reports   The plaintiff experts  reports  the company noted  were not original science and instead reflected views of the underlying science that differed from the FDA and the advisory panel s conclusions  Members of the FDA advisory panel Reuters contacted said they were unaware of Moore and Glenmullen s efforts  One of them was Dr Jess Fiedorowicz  director of the University of Iowa Mood Disorders Center  He voted to remove the black box warning  He said he didn t know whether the evidence from the two experts would have changed his mind  but   I m all for transparency in research   SEEKING SUNSHINE In September  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler  a New York Democrat  said he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act to address the problem of court secrecy  The bill would allow parties in litigation to share evidence related to public health and safety with state and federal regulators  regardless of protective orders  Nadler s pledge came during a hearing on courtroom transparency that was called after Reuters began publishing its series on court secrecy and its impact on public health and safety  Previous iterations of the bill introduced repeatedly since the early 1990s  despite enjoying bipartisan support  have ultimately failed in the face of sustained opposition from business groups that contend it would increase the costs and burdens of litigation for companies that are already meeting regulatory reporting requirements  However  as the Yamaha Rhino episode and others like it show  regulators and the public can t assume manufacturers are meeting disclosure and reporting rules  A few months after John Sand sent a packet stuffed with his research to CPSC  the agency told Yamaha it had received information indicating that the Rhino could roll over at low speeds on flat ground  posing  an unreasonable risk of injury or death to riders   It told the company to send it all relevant information  including documents from Rhino related litigation  CPSC spent the next few months trying to get Yamaha to comply  at one point complaining to the company that it was sending  duplicative  material and that  the only new item seems to be a Model Year 2009 owner s manual for the Rhino   Only after CPSC subpoenaed Yamaha did the company send to the agency a 70 page written response  a hard drive and 62 DVDs that contained all of the records the company had produced in years of litigation  including company documents that had been subject to protective orders  CPSC would have known about the Rhino much earlier if Yamaha hadn t repeatedly violated the rules for notifying the agency of a possible defect  according to William Kitzes  a former adviser to the agency and an expert witness for plaintiffs in Rhino litigation who reviewed correspondence between the regulator and Yamaha  Companies must report to the agency immediately upon learning that a product is defective or can cause injury or death  or when a product is subject to three or more personal injury lawsuits in a two year period that are settled or decided in favor of plaintiffs  From 2004 to late 2008  Yamaha faced about 250 lawsuits alleging that Rhinos were unsafe   Certainly no later than  and by many measures well before the end of 2005     Yamaha had adequate information to report   Kitzes wrote in a report for plaintiffs  CPSC didn t fine Yamaha for failure to report Rhino incidents  The agency and Yamaha jointly announced the Rhino recall on March 31  2009   referred to at the time  on Yamaha s insistence  as a  free repair program   In 2011  the Ohio jury hearing Sand s case found the Rhino defective  but awarded Sand no damages  Ellie was not wearing a helmet when she was killed  and the jury determined that she  her parents and others were negligent in her death  Yamaha stopped making the vehicles in 2013

175340,396856,SO,The 1 Thing to Watch at Southern Company in 2020,news,"Giant U S  utility The Southern Company  NYSE SO  has been working to fix a big problem  While it has been making material progress  2020 will be a very important year  If it can hit all of its targets  then 2021 and 2022 suddenly look a lot brighter  What is it that Southern needs to do  Nothing more than get the only nuclear power plant currently being built in the United States up and running  Here s what you need to know and watch at Southern as 2020 progresses 
Turning a  disaster  around
The word  disaster  is probably an overstatement when discussing Southern s plans to build two nuclear power plants at its Vogtle facility  In an industry that s seen the Chernobyl and Fukushima meltdowns  Southern s problems are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things  However  for investors  they are still big news  including cost overruns  project delays  and the bankruptcy of the company s original contractor  Westinghouse  
The truth is  Southern s dream of completing the Vogtle project very nearly ended not too long ago  which would have been a multibillion dollar hit  The Westinghouse bankruptcy  for example  pushed SCANA to cancel the nuclear plant it was building  resulting in a financial hit that ultimately led to the utility getting bought out by Dominion Energy  None of this is on the scale of a nuclear meltdown  but canceling Vogtle would have been a financial disaster for Southern and its shareholders 

Southern pulled this project back from the brink by  basically  taking over day to day management from Westinghouse  It also agreed to foot most of the bill if there were any more cost overruns  It is basically betting its reputation and  to a material extent  its finances on the Vogtle project  It s why Vogtle is the main topic of discussion on every earnings conference call right now  And since it s a multiyear project that won t be done until late 2022  there are a lot more conference calls to go before the conversation turns to other things 
However  there will be a very big deadline in late 2020 as the company looks to attach the first of the two nuclear builds to the grid in 2021  And investors should be watching very closely 
Hitting the deadline
The really big event will come around November or December of this year if everything goes as planned  when Southern loads nuclear fuel into the reactor of the Vogtle 3 nuclear power plant  That s when the rubber hits the road  as the saying goes  Although the plant won t be put into service for another 6 to 12 months after that  loading the fuel in is really when it becomes a living  breathing nuclear reactor 
There are still a lot of steps to nail down before Southern gets there  mostly designed to test the reliability of the work that has been done  For example  the company has been testing the control room and examining the water pipes to make sure they are all up to spec  The goal is to have construction substantially complete by around mid 2020  That will allow for some final testing before the nuclear fuel gets loaded into the reactor and it basically becomes a fully functioning nuclear power plant 
The thing is  building a nuclear power plant is a complex job with lots of moving parts that all have to come together at the same time if Southern wants to hit its targets  That includes getting enough workers on site  ensuring quality work  and keeping to the timeline across various aspects of the job    which are the types of things that keep Southern s CEO up at night  One small delay anywhere along the line could push the nuclear load back and delay the entire project 
It would also bring into question the timeline for the second reactor  Vogtle 4  which is also being built right now  This is a very real issue  A malfunctioning pump caused delays at a nuclear plant using the same technology in China  There was nothing wrong with the overall design  just the pump  But because of the stakes involved with nuclear power  the issue had to be thoroughly examined 
Southern had people on the ground in China to watch the construction process  including the pump troubles  so it was able to learn from the event  It is applying that learning to its Vogtle project back here in the United States  This highlights why Vogtle 3 is so important  Watching someone else build a nuclear reactor is good  but doing it yourself is even more informative  so every bit of knowledge that Southern earns through its own work on Vogtle 3 can be applied to Vogtle 4  Thus  if the utility can get the first one right  the chances that the second one will go smoothly increase 
The big dates
Since two of the biggest steps in getting Vogtle 3 up and running are set to take place in 2020  this is the biggest issue investors need to watch at Southern this year  Southern has done a reasonable job providing clear and consistent information to the market on the topic  And the Vogtle project will be heavily discussed during each quarterly conference call  There s no reason you can t stay well informed 
That said  the first big event will be when construction is largely complete around June or July  according to the project plan the company has shared   Then  after more testing  comes the fuel load toward the end of the year  when the facility really becomes a nuclear power plant  There will be more testing before it gets attached to the grid and many little steps all along the way  But these two dates are the big ones for investors to watch in 2020 as Southern looks to become the first U S  utility in years to successfully build a domestic nuclear power plant ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjq89,2062626
175341,396857,SO,Australian government says to support tourism industry as bushfires recede,news,"By Lidia Kelly and Stefica Nicol Bikes
MELBOURNE KANAGAROO ISLAND  Australia  Reuters    The Australian government said on Sunday it will provide financial aid to the country s tourism sector that s been badly hit by long lasting bushfires  as business owners fretted about cancellations that stretch into the months ahead 
Although recent rains have brought some relief  damage to the industry from the fires has approached A 1 billion   690 million  so far and may top A 4 5 billion by the end of the year  according to estimates from Australian tourism bodies 
 People have stopped coming   said Tony Coppins  owner of Kangaroo Island Safari and Kangaroo Island Ocean Safari  adding that he had received cancellations for February and March 
 They think the whole island is on fire and it s not  so we really need to send that message out that the island is still accessible  
A fire earlier this month scorched more than 200 000 hectares  494 000 acres  on the island  located off the coast of South Australia  in blazes described as  hell on earth  
The government said on Sunday it would channel  76 million   52 million  in what it described as an initial push to help the country s A 152 billion tourism industry  which accounts for more than 3  of annual economic output 
 International visitors are critical and especially critical in places like Kangaroo Island or tropical North Queensland and these are destinations that have relied upon a large part of their visitor market being international tourists and that s why we got to recover those markets as quickly as we can   said Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham 
Birmingham said bookings from key international markets to Australia were down by between 30  and 40   Domestic bookings across the country were down nearly 70   Australian media reported 
Rains have brought the number of fires burning across Australia s east and south coast to under 100 for the first time in weeks  easing a disaster that has scorched an area roughly one third the size of Germany 
Twenty nine people have been killed in the fires while millions of animals are also estimated to have perished 
In Melbourne  fears receded that smoke from the fires would disrupt the Australian Open which starts on Monday as the city and parts of the bushfire ravaged state of Victoria braced for heavy rains 
 Victoria is about to see its wettest two day period in many  many months   said Dean Narramore from the state s Bureau of Meteorology 
More than 780 000 fans attended the two week Australian Open last year  according to figures from the office of the state s premier  providing a major influx of cash for Victoria s economy 
GRAPHIC  How smoke from Australia s bushfires has spread   
Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis 
   About 80  of the Greater Blue Mountains that are on the World Heritage List of protected designations have been lost to the bushfires  Australian media reported 
   There were 69 bushfires in New South Wales  nearly a third of them still to be contained  and 14 fires were burning in Victoria  with some big blazes in state s mountain region known for hiking 
   Intense storms and heavy rains were expected across Australia s east and south coast on Sunday and Monday  with meteorologists warning of heavy flash flooding in Victoria

175358,396874,SO,Pro democracy Iranians in U S  say death of Soleimani could open a window for dissidents,news,"By Dan Whitcomb
CULVER CITY  Calif   Reuters    The death of a top Iranian general in an American missile strike was long overdue  the leaders of a U S  based pro democracy group said on Tuesday  and might  open a window  for dissidents to challenge a weakened government in Tehran 
General Qassem Soleimani  the commander of Iran s elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service  known as the Quds Force  was killed on Friday when missiles fired by a U S  drone struck his vehicle as he left Baghdad airport 
The surprise attack on Soleimani  who built up Tehran s network of proxy armies across the Middle East and was a pivotal figure in orchestrating its campaign to drive U S  forces out of Iraq  has plunged the region into a new crisis and raised fears of a wider war 
 This was long overdue   Nasser Sharif  president of the California Society for Democracy in Iran  told Reuters in an interview  Sharif said Soleimani had used repressive tactics against the Iranian people  spread fear via the Quds Force  and supported the government of President Bashar al Assad in Syria 
 Soleimani was pushing an agenda of expanding terror across the Middle East  He is responsible for the death of thousands of people  When our community here heard this news it was thrilled   Sharif said 
Southern  NYSE SO  California is home to the largest concentration of Iranians outside that country and hundreds of pro democracy Iranian Americans are set to meet on Saturday in a long planned convention at which the death of Soleimani is likely to be a major topic of discussion  Sharif said 
Soleimani was a national hero to many Iranians  whether supporters of the clerical leadership or not  but viewed as a dangerous villain by Western governments opposed to Iran s arc of influence running across the Levant and into the Gulf region 
On Tuesday at least 56 people were killed in a stampede in Tehran as tens of thousands packed streets to mourn the military commander  Iran pledged revenge for his death and  hours after the funeral  it launched a missile attack on U S  led forces in Iraq 
OUT IN THE STREETS
Sharif said dissidents inside and outside Iran see the country s leadership as vulnerable  weakened financially  and exposed to the world as repressive  and believe the death of Soleimani comes at an opportune time for those seeking a democratic uprising 
 This might open a window for Iranian protesters to come out into the streets again   Sharif said  The general would be hard for Tehran to replace  he said 
 Our organization doesn t want war   Sharif added   It wants change by the Iranian people  
In November  protests initially sparked by an abrupt hike in gasoline spread across Iran as demonstrators called for more political freedom  Reuters has reported that some 1 500 people were killed in the resulting crackdown ordered by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  the bloodiest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 
Sharif said he had not heard of any heightened security concerns in the United States affecting Iranians  But the Washington DC based National Iranian American Council expressed concern in a statement on Monday about  alarming reports  that over 60 Iranians and Iranian Americans had been detained and questioned by U S  Customs and Border Protection officials at Canada s border with Washington State 
Reuters has not verified those reports and the CBP has not responded to requests for comment 
Friction between Iran and the United States has risen since Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran  slashing its vital oil exports 
U S  officials have said Soleimani was killed because of solid intelligence indicating forces under his command planned attacks on U S  targets in the region  although they have as yet provided no evidence ",2020-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/prodemocracy-iranians-in-us-say-death-of-soleimani-could-open-a-window-for-dissidents-2054566,2054566

175366,396882,SO,Why Southern Company Stock Surged 45  in 2019,news,"What happened
Utilities don t typically produce market smashing returns  That s what makes Southern Company s  NYSE SO  2019 so spectacular  It delivered an eye popping 45  gain last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That easily outpaced the S P 500  which rallied an impressive 28 9  in 2019  Add in dividends  and the outperformance widened to a total return of 51 7  for Southern versus 31 5  for the S P 
Here s a look back at what powered Southern Company s strong year   

So what
Southern Company delivered stronger than expected financial results through the third quarter  with its performance in that period especially strong  It generated  1 34 per share of adjusted earnings  which topped the consensus estimate of analysts by  0 20 per share  Because of that  the company expects its full year results to be at or slightly above its guidance range  
Meanwhile  the utility also got some good news on the regulatory front as the Georgia Public Services Commission approved a rate increase for its Georgia Power subsidiary  On top of that  it continued to make progress on its Vogtle nuclear project  which is on track to start up in the 2021 to 2022 timeframe  However  the company did experience some setbacks on two gas pipeline projects  Because of that  both likely won t enter service until 2021  
However  investors overlooked those setbacks and piled into shares of Southern and other utilities because their high yielding dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in an environment where the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates  Yield seeking investors see utilities like Southern as a lower risk way to collect a high yielding income stream as the payouts on bonds decline with interest rates  
Now what
Shares of Southern Company aren t as attractive as they were to start 2019 since its valuation has risen to about 20 times earnings  which is a bit rich for a slow growing utility  Meanwhile  its yield has fallen to around 3 9   which isn t as enticing as other options in the energy sector  Because of that  yield seeking investors might want to look elsewhere  with several pipeline stocks in particular looking quite compelling right now ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgjb2,2057156

A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Tourism declined to comment 
Argentina is in the grip of a prolonged recession and annual inflation is running at more than 50

175371,396887,SO,Earnings Preview  Oxford Industries  OXM  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Oxford Industries  OXM  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 11  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the Tommy Bahama  Lilly Pulitzer and Southern  NYSE SO  Tide clothing lines is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  35 7  
Revenues are expected to be  241 44 million  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oxford Industries 
For Oxford Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oxford Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oxford Industries would post earnings of  1 86 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of  1 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oxford Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-oxford-industries-oxm-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200490068,200490068
175372,396888,SO,Is Kansas City Southern  KSU  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this railroad company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  is 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Kansas City Southern is 9 7   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Kansas City Southern  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Kansas City Southern a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Kansas City Southern is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-kansas-city-southern-ksu-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think--yes--200490097,200490097

175374,396890,SO,Germany Is The Rotten Economic Heart Of Europe,opinion,"The crisis in Europe will come from Germany  Germany has entered a period of political crisis that  as yet  has not exploded 
But the pyre is built  the torches lit and all that remains is dragging Chancellor Angela Merkel up and setting the whole thing on fire 
For those that want to understand the fundamental impulses which have led the European Union to where it is today and Germany s central role one really needs to read 
It s a book that damns pretty much everyone in their monomaniacal drive for the European Project but  Germany  in particular  to me  comes across the worst 
Because the design of the euro  as a currency  was guided by German industrialists looking for the advantage a single currency would bring them 
This is a point I ve made many times that the single exchange rate underprices the value of Northern European industrial entities while overpricing Southern  NYSE SO  Europe s productive capacity 
Moreover  it raised the effective quality of the debt of those countries far above the market rate  This allowed them to borrow at far lower rates than they would ever have been able to 
This has led to exactly where we are today with massive internal imbalances which have hollowed out these economies  further eroded their productive capacity and competitiveness and left them with a mountain of unpayable debt which is then used as a further means to extract the last of the country s real wealth when the inevitable crisis hits and the debt has to be restructured 
And to think that this point wasn t understood by the people who designed the euro is to be terminally naive  This is a point not only made by Connolly but also by Gyorgy Matolcsy  the President of the Hungarian Central Bank 
Thanks to a very generous regular reader I m reading his book     right now  And Matolcsy opens the book with a scathing attack on the euro and how it never should have been introduced in the first place 
Because the effects of the single currency have been wholly predictable  But he makes an even larger point than Connolly did in his book  Germany  through wealth extraction and collecting rent thanks to the exchange rate arbitrage 
It may anger my German readers to hear this but  again  if you didn t think this was the plan by some all along  to colonize countries like Greece that couldn t be conquered militarily in WWII  then you can t also see why the rest of Europe is becoming angry 
But Matolcsy goes one step further in his criticism of Germany  saying that if that wealth extraction had been distributed throughout the EU over the twenty plus years of the euro via investment then things would be far better today 
But Germany never gave up its mercantilist mindset  preferring instead to sell Spanish and Greeks BMWs and Porsches while lending them the money at suppressed interest rates to do so 
And then when the bills come due demand austerity to pay them back and call them deadbeats in the process 
That s why Germany  today  is the rotten center of a crumbling European would be empire  And why everyone  including Germans  will now be impoverished as the mountain range of unpayable debt collapses 
Empires always rot from within 
The American empire is facing the exact same problem  but because it is the world s reserve currency and has the biggest synthetic short against it will simply get hit later 
This is why the Dow Jones Industrials and the S P 500 are trading at all time highs despite President Trump s latest trade war salvos at China and the German DAX is struggling to best its 2018 high 
 in the political and economic uncertainties between the U S  and Germany  Because  
The big news is   the Social Democrats  SPD   just elected new leadership that is hostile to the governing coalition as they blame Merkel for their collapse as a political force nationally  That puts Merkel s political future in jeopardy or  at a minimum  ensures she has even less control over a mostly gridlocked German government 
For the past couple of months we ve seen the markets in general breath a sigh of relief after the Fed and ECB stepped in to provide liquidity   But that doesn t fix the underlying problems  it only delays them for a few more months by reflating the yield curve  in this case the U S  s and Germany s 
But is the reflation trade the new dominant one or simply a lull between crises  as J
My guess is the latter as the Fed keeps piling term Repos onto its balance sheet  now more than  207 billion since September  and 
Sure that could be normal quarter end shenanigans but why  And will we be asking these same questions when these 42 day repos expire in late January 
The bigger questions is what is causing U S  banks to need so many dollars to keep the money markets liquid  And why is everyone struggling with this dollar shortage 
Because everyone is feeling the same thing  something is going to change in a big way and when it does they want dollars  not euros  pounds  yen or yuan 
The German economy is slowing  It has been for more than a year 
And when the reflation trade is over  markets that haven t made new highs will be much more vulnerable to collapse  Germany s multi generational mercantilist empire has reached its zenith  It can t push it any further without conceding political ground to the rest of Europe or abandoning the very thing that created the empire in the first place  the euro 
That s the central problem which sits at the heart of the European Project  And it can t be papered over much longer ",2019-12-04,Tom Luongo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/germany-is-the-rotten-economic-heart-of-europe-200489788,200489788

The pact was reached after more than a month of indirect talks in Saudi Arabia  Under the deal  the separatist Southern Transitional Council  STC  and other southerners would join a new national cabinet and place all forces under control of the internationally recognized government 
An STC spokesman told Reuters the STC negotiating team had withdrawn from the joint committees working to implement the deal  known as the Riyadh agreement 
It was not clear what impact this suspension would have on the future of the agreement  which Saudi Arabia had hailed as a step towards a wider political solution to a conflict which has raged since 2015 
A member of the STC s presidential council  Salim al Awlaqi  said in announcing the move on Twitter that it was in protest against violence in Shabwa province it blamed on forces loyal to the Islah party 
The STC and its backers the United Arab Emirates oppose the Islamist Islah party  which is the backbone of the government of internationally recognized President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi 
Recent violence in Shabwa is part of an ongoing struggle for influence between forces loyal to Hadi and southern forces  The separatists accuse Hadi s government of mismanagement and corruption and took over the interim capital Aden in August  prompting the talks which led to the Riyadh agreement 
The Aden standoff had opened a new front in the almost five year war and fractured a Saudi led coalition battling the Iran aligned Houthi movement that ousted Hadi s government from the capital  Sanaa  in the north in late 2014

175409,396925,SO,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Kansas City Southern  KSU  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this railroad company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  is 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Kansas City Southern is 9 7   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Kansas City Southern  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Kansas City Southern has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

175415,396931,SO,Kansas City Southern  KSU  Is Up 4 87  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if KSU is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this railroad company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For KSU  shares are up 4 87  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 1 27  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 13 38  compares favorably with the industry s 2 62  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Kansas City Southern have risen 24 63   and are up 52 76  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 10 04  and 16 41   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to KSU s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  KSU is currently averaging 1 213 191 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KSU 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KSU s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 74 to  6 95 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that KSU is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Kansas City Southern on your short list ",2019-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kansas-city-southern-ksu-is-up-487-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200486023,200486023

 Specifically  the Government presently estimates that the defendant s debts at that time were  conservatively  in excess of  15 million   prosecutors said in a filing late on Tuesday in the U S  District Court for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York

The move from December 24 was disclosed by a filing approved on the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and comes as China prioritizes implementing mixed ownership reforms to revamp its bloated  debt ridden state sector 
China Southern is among 96 centrally owned companies supervised by the state assets regulator  the State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission  SASAC  
As such  China Southern Airlines would offload its old freight unit to the newly registered company  according to a statement from SASAC in October  The cargo company would also take over other air cargo assets under the parent company such as belly cargo services  cargo terminals and international logistics 
The cargo business would be managed in a market oriented way and would become a major source of profits  said the SASAC 
The air cargo market  an economic bellwether linked to global trade  saw its traffic decline by 3 3  in 2019  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  said  driven by a tariff war between the United States and China 
In 2017  China Eastern Air Holding  SS 600115  sold almost half of its freight unit to four firms  while Air China  SS 601111  last year offloaded a majority stake in its cargo arm in face of market uncertainties

175450,396966,SO,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Kansas City Southern  KSU ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this railroad company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  is 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 9  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Kansas City Southern is 9 7   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Kansas City Southern have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Kansas City Southern a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Kansas City Southern is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-kansas-city-southern-ksu-200479408,200479408

NEW YORK  Reuters    Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to an indictment accusing him of trying to extort as much as  25 million from  Nike  Inc  N NKE  by threatening to go public with claims the company made improper payments to athletes 
Clasping his hands behind his back  the celebrity lawyer  who gained fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against U S  President Donald Trump  said  not guilty  after U S  District Judge Paul Gardephe read each of the three counts against him in Manhattan federal court 
Avenatti declined to comment after the hearing 
Prosecutors have accused Avenatti  48  of demanding money from Nike in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss the athletic wear company s alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits 
A trial is scheduled for Jan  21  2020  and could last the rest of January  Nike has denied wrongdoing 
Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case  Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges 
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about  300 000 from Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  after helping her secure a book contract 
He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud  bank fraud and other crimes  including stealing from clients 
The amended Nike indictment dropped two conspiracy counts but added a charge of honest services fraud 
Prosecutors said Avenatti failed to reveal that Nike had offered to settle with his client  youth basketball coach Gary Franklin  so long as the Beaverton  Oregon based company did not have to pay Avenatti himself 
At Tuesday s hearing  Avenatti s lawyer  Scott Srebnick  said that charge should be dismissed  citing a 2010 Supreme Court decision involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling limiting the claim to bribery and kickback cases 
 The government s whole theory was that Avenatti was shaking down Nike   but its case has  morphed  into alleged bribery solicitation  Srebnick said   It s hard to know from this indictment exactly what this bribery scheme was  
Gardephe did not rule on the motion 
The judge also said he was  inclined  to let an expert witness testify for the prosecution about legal ethics rules  though not whether Avenatti violated them 
Prospective jurors are expected to receive questionnaires in advance about the case 
 Given how much press there has been about Mr  Avenatti  it seems obvious to me that a questionnaire is necessary   he said

Oodnadatta  a South Australian town of about 200 people located on an old Aboriginal trading route  is forecast to record peak temperatures of 47 degrees Celsius  116 6  Fahrenheit  on Wednesday  according to the Bureau of Meteorology  BOM   making it one of the hottest places on Earth 
 It s just another very hot day   said resident Hayley Nunn  who is the manager of the town s distinct pink roadhouse where tourists stop on their way to and from Australia s Simpson Desert 
 People say to me they love summer  If you love summer  come out and experience this because you will not love it   Nunn said in a phone interview 
The unrelenting heat in Oodnadatta  forecast to repeat every day for at least the next week  is expected to fall just shy of the 50 7 degree C  123 26 F  temperature recorded there in 1960  a long standing national record 
But other heat records are tumbling in the first month of the Southern  NYSE SO  Hemisphere summer 
Australia s warmest day on record occurred in January 2013  when the average maximum temperature across the country was 40 C  105 4 F   according to BOM data 
That mark is expected to be exceeded on Wednesday and then again on Thursday and Friday 
The hot weather is stretching across the continent and fuelling fires that have been ravaging Australia s east since late spring 
Fire authorities in the state of New South Wales  NSW  said on Wednesday there were 99 fires  half of which were not contained 
Fires have killed six people  destroyed more than 680 homes and burned nearly 3 million acres  1 2 million hectares  of bushland

BATTLE ON TWO FRONTS
Australia is being hit with two separate climate driving events off its west and southern coasts   a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and negative Southern Annulare Mode   that are reducing rainfall and increasing temperatures 
 They have combined together to create this situation of a particularly nasty heat wave event   said BOM meteorologist Sarah Scully 
The extreme conditions have been exacerbated by a warming climate  which is triggering large scale protests in a nation that is committed to exploiting its vast coal reserves 
The combination of thick smoke settling over populated areas and intense heat has triggered numerous health warnings across the country  especially for the young and the old  and those with respiratory conditions 
In Oodnadatta  where the temperature is only expected to drop to around 30 C  86 F  overnight  locals are warning travelers to take plenty of water on their car trips in case they break down on the long stretches of isolated roads 
 Between most towns  it s 200 kilometers  124 3 miles    said Nunn 
Nunn said Oodnadatta falls into a rhythm in the summer where people do jobs early in the morning and late in the afternoon  while sheltering from the heat in the middle of the day

175467,396983,SO,Kansas City Southern  KSU  Is Up 8 8  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if KSU is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this railroad company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For KSU  shares are up 8 8  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 0 07  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 43  compares favorably with the industry s 0 3  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Kansas City Southern have increased 16 29  over the past quarter  and have gained 40 36  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 87  and 10 81   respectively 
Investors should also take note of KSU s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  KSU is averaging 1 000 069 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KSU 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KSU s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 74 to  6 90 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that KSU is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Kansas City Southern on your short list ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kansas-city-southern-ksu-is-up-88-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200476677,200476677
175468,396984,SO,Southern Co   SO  Reports Next Week  What Awaits ,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Southern Co   SO  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  5 93 billion  down 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 27  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co 
For Southern Co The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Co  Will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern Co  Would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

While Southern National Bancorp has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

175479,396995,SO,Bayou hedge fund s Samuel Israel  who ran big Ponzi scheme  fails to win freedom,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    The ailing former Bayou hedge fund manager Samuel Israel has lost his bid for an early end to his 22 year prison sentence for running a  450 million fraud  as a U S  judge found it would make a  mockery  of federal sentencing laws to set him free 
Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the U S  District Court in Manhattan said she had no doubt the 60 year old Israel  who has spent 11 years in prison  suffers from severe  progressive and incurable medical problems  and was  certainly not a well person  
But she called Israel s fraud from 1996 to 2005  extremely serious   one of the largest Ponzi schemes uncovered before Bernard Madoff s  and said he did not deserve  compassionate release  though he could get better medical care outside prison 
 It would make a mockery of the sentencing statute if this financial fraudster  who ruined the lives and finances of hundreds of people while living the high life of an ostensibly successful hedge fund manager  were to have his sentence reduced   McMahon wrote 
The judge blacked out Israel s medical problems from her 29 page decision  McMahon had in August 2014 rejected Israel s prior request for a shorter sentence because of ill health  Bayou went bankrupt in May 2006 
A lawyer for Israel did not immediately respond to requests for comment  A spokesman for U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan  who opposed Israel s release  declined to comment 
Israel pleaded guilty in September 2005 to defrauding Bayou investors  and was originally sentenced by McMahon to 20 years in prison 
But rather than surrender as scheduled in June 2008  Israel faked his own suicide by leaving his GMC Envoy on the Bear Mountain Bridge north of New York City  with the words  suicide is painless  scrawled in dust on the hood 
He surrendered the following month  and another judge tacked on two years in prison for bail jumping 
Israel had sought leniency under the First Step Act  a bipartisan law signed by President Donald Trump last December that lets some older prisoners obtain freedom sooner 
McMahon  however  said it would not promote respect for the law to go easy on white collar criminals who have privileged backgrounds and can afford top flight lawyers 
 It simply reinforces the belief that there is one law for the white collar criminal and another law altogether for the ghetto dweller or the drug dealer   she wrote 
Israel is eligible for release on Oct  5  2027  He and Madoff live in the same Butner  North Carolina  prison complex

Cole also led the majors with 326 strikeouts  and he came in third in the AL with 212 1 3 innings pitched  In the postseason  he went 4 1 with a 1 72 ERA in helping the Astros reach the World Series

175504,397020,SO,Low Inflation Expectations Act As A Self Reinforcing Anchor,opinion,"Memories of high inflation have faded  what does this collective amnesia mean for inflation in the future 
Inflation expectations have drifted lower because society is forgetting about inflation  Indeed  a whole generation has grown up knowing nothing but price stability  This makes it harder for central banks to hit their inflation targets  particularly in Europe where more southerly countries  inflation  memory  has been subsumed by Germany s experience 
But this has not always been the case 
 An entire generation of young adults has grown up since the mid 1960s knowing only of inflation   it is hardly surprising that many citizens have begun to wonder whether it is realistic to anticipate a return to general price stability    Former Federal Reserve Chair  Paul Volcker  1979 
40 years ago  Volcker worried that persistently high and rising inflation had de anchored inflation expectations  A policy induced recession was ultimately required to drive them back down 
We re in the opposite situation today  We ve had 25 years   a whole generation   of low US inflation  depressing inflation expectations 
This explains one of today s macro puzzles  why wage inflation remains subdued despite low unemployment  Once we adjust for record low inflation expectations  households  perceived  real  wages are growing as rapidly as in previous economic booms 
But low inflation expectations act as a self reinforcing anchor for nominal variables  hampering central banks  ability to hit their inflation remits 
A whole generation has grown up knowing nothing but price stability
Micro evidence suggests  memory effects  explain the downward drift in inflation expectations 
After the inflation shocks of the 1970s  younger households had higher inflation expectations than older ones  The former were scarred by the successive oil shocks while the latter still remembered the golden era of the 1960s  if not deflationary tales of the Great Depression 
To illustrate this  I have plotted the gap between  young   60  people s inflation expectations in the chart below  It broadly matches the difference between short  10 year  and long term  50 year  averages of inflation  As inflation trends above historical norms  younger people will have higher inflation expectations than older ones  and vice versa   





This suggests inflation expectations are backwards looking 




Indeed  we can track the broad contours of US consumers  inflation expectations by aggregating everyone s lifetime inflation experience  
We find a  decaying average  works best   suggesting people put more weight on recent than distant inflation experiences 
It s not perfect  Clearly  shifts in policy credibility have a role too  But it does capture the general downward trend  Inflation expectations are drifting lower as society  forgets  high inflation  The 2014 collapse in commodity prices augmented this 
To paraphrase Volcker   A whole generation has grown up knowing nothing but price stability  
Inflation  memory  in Southern  NYSE SO  Europe has now converged with Germany
The most interesting implication of this analysis is for Europe 
It has always been a puzzle when German inflation shows only a meagre reaction to low unemployment  It probably reflects more strongly anchored inflation expectations than elsewhere because the Bundesbank did a much better job at keeping inflation under control in the 1970s 
It also helps explain the high inflation and loss of competitiveness in Southern  NYSE SO  Europe after the euro was introduced in 1999  Spanish  Italian and Greek households still remembered the peseta  lira and drachma and periodic currency devaluations 
What s fascinating now is that an  inflation memory  calculation for Southern  NYSE SO  Europe has converged with that of Germany  If Spaniards  Italians and Greeks start acting like Germans  it will be extremely hard for the European Central Bank to hit its inflation remit

175506,397022,SO,Analysts Estimate Great Southern Bancorp  GSBC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Great Southern  NYSE SO  Bancorp  GSBC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 2  
Revenues are expected to be  52 20 million  down 9 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Great Southern Bancorp 
For Great Southern Bancorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Great Southern Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Great Southern Bancorp would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 28  delivering a surprise of  13 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

 In these temperatures it can be pretty uncomfortable out there in trousers  so the feedback from the players has certainly been positive  
The relaxed rules on shorts will apply only to this particular tournament  the European Tour added 
Women professional golfers can play in shorts unlike their male counterparts  though the LPGA caused a social media storm in 2017 when it told its players to avoid plunging necklines  and skirts  skorts or pants that expose part of the  bottom area  
Men have traditionally worn trousers on competition days  but the European Tour and Southern  NYSE SO  Africa s Sunshine Tour tweaked the rules in 2016 to allow them to wear shorts during practice rounds and pro am events 
The U S  PGA Tour adopted the same policy for men earlier this year 
Thomas Bjorn  Europe s 2018 Ryder Cup captain  said the tweaked dress code was a step in the right direction 
 Golf has been moving in this direction and because of the extreme heat we need to make it as comfortable for the players as we can   he added 
 There are traditions in golf that will always be upheld  but we also need to try and make it easier for kids to get involved in the game and move with the times  ",2019-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/players-hail-move-to-let-them-tee-off-in-shorts-in-sunny-south-africa-2029932,2029932
175508,397024,SO,U S  citizen living in Singapore charged with helping North Korea evade sanctions,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  digital currency specialist living in Singapore has been arrested and criminally charged with helping North Korea use cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade American sanctions  the U S  Department of Justice said on Friday 
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Virgil Griffith  36  traveled to North Korea via China in April to attend the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference  despite being denied permission by the U S  Department of State to go 
Griffith  who has a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology  gave a presentation on topics preapproved by North Korean officials  provided valuable technical information  and engaged in talks about using cryptocurrency technology to circumvent sanctions and launder money  prosecutors said 
A lawyer for Griffith did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment 
Griffith was arrested on Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport  and charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  which carries a maximum 20 year prison term 
Prosecutors said Griffith was expected to appear on Friday in Los Angeles federal court 
His case was announced one day after North Korea launched two short range rockets off its eastern cost  ahead of a year end deadline that Pyongyang had given the White House to show flexibility in stalled denuclearization talks 
 The consequences of North Korea obtaining funding  technology  and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk   FBI Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney said in a statement 
 It s even more egregious that a U S  citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary   he added 
According to a criminal complaint  Griffith s presentation titled  Blockchain and Peace  described how blockchain technology including a  smart contract  could help North Korea 
Prosecutors said Griffith later started work on making it easier to move cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea and encouraged other U S  citizens to travel to North Korea  including for the same cryptocurrency conference in 2020 
The complaint said a search this month of Griffith s cellphone with his consent uncovered an Aug  6  2019  message to an unnamed individual  known as Individual 2  indicating a need to send some cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea 
 Individual 2 asked  in sum and substance   Isn t that violating sanctions   Griffith replied   it is    the complaint said

175511,397027,SO,China s facial recognition rollout reaches into mobile phones  shops and homes,news,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI  Reuters    China on Sunday put into effect new regulations that require Chinese telecom carriers to scan the faces of users registering new mobile phone services  a move the government says is aimed at cracking down on fraud 
The rules  first announced in September  mean millions more people will come under the purview of facial recognition technology in China 
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology  MIIT  did not say which companies will provide the telecoms providers with these services but China is home to some of the world s leaders in facial recognition software  including Megvii and SenseTime 
WHAT ARE THE NEW RULES FOR CHINESE MOBILE PHONE USERS 
China s telecom operators must now use facial recognition technology and other means to verify the identity of people opening new mobile phone accounts 
China s three largest carriers are state owned China Telecom  China Unicom and China Mobile  It was unclear how the law applies to existing mobile accounts 
WHERE ELSE IN CHINA HAS THE TECHNOLOGY BEEN USED 
Supermarkets  subway systems and airports already use facial recognition technology   Alibaba   N BABA  gives customers the option to pay using their face at its Hema supermarket chain and runs a hotel in its headquarters city of Hangzhou where guests can scan their face with their smartphones for advance check in 
The metro systems of some major Chinese cities have announced they will use the technology  with government owned newspaper China Daily saying Beijing will use it to  classify passengers  to allow for  different security check measures  
In July  the Xinhua news agency said Beijing had  or was in the process of  installing facial recognition systems at the entrances of 59 public rental housing communities 
Reuters reported last year on its wide use in the western Xinjiang region  an area wracked by separatist violence and a crackdown by security forces that has seen Uighur Muslims and members of other ethic groups detained in camps  China says the camps are re education and training centers 
Chinese police are also known to have high tech surveillance gadgets such as glasses with built in facial recognition 
HOW HAS ITS INTRODUCTION BEEN VIEWED BY THE CHINESE PUBLIC 
Surveillance technologies have encountered little public opposition  but there has been some mostly anonymous debate on social media platforms like Weibo 
Some users argue that it is a needed to combat fraud  like scam calls  but others have voiced concerns about its implications for personal data  privacy and ethics 
One rare case of opposition has involved a university lecturer  who sued a wildlife park in Hangzhou after it replaced its fingerprint based entry system with one that used facial recognition technology 
The Southern  NYSE SO  Metropolis Daily newspaper  which reported on the case in November  said he was worried that the system might result in identify theft and asked for a refund  He sued after the park denied his request 
HAS CHINA EXPORTED ANY OF THIS TECH OVERSEAS 
Countries from Myanmar to Argentina have purchased surveillance technology from the likes of China s ZTE  HK 0763  Corp  SZ 000063  and Huawei Technologies as part of plans to create  smart cities  
There has been U S  blowback over the work Chinese firms like Megvii and SenseTime have played in Beijing s treatment of Muslim minorities  The United States expanded its trade blacklist in October to include these firms  and others  barring them from buying components from U S  companies without U S  government approval 
WHAT IS NEXT 
The technology is currently being tested in areas such as street crossings to catch jaywalkers and China has announced that it will eventually expand its use to others like student registrations for its National College Entrance Examination 
There has also been calls for greater regulatory oversight 
The People s Daily on Saturday called for an investigation  saying one of its reporters had found face data could be found for sale on the Internet  with a package of 5 000 faces costing just 10 yuan   1 42  
Last week  China s Internet regulator announced new rules governing the use of deepfake technology  which uses AI to create hyper realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not ",2019-12-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinas-facial-recognition-roll-out-reaches-into-mobile-phones-shops-and-homes-2031320,2031320

insisting that energy companies increase oil and gas output before it auctions off more of the country s vast reserves or offers more partnerships with state run Pemex  firms ranging from foreign majors to local players are scrambling to buy and sell blocks they already own   The negotiations are creating a dynamic secondary market for oil acreage  which could be the only investment opportunity left for firms until leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador unblocks his predecessor s flagship energy reform that has seen no new licensing rounds since 2018   Companies selling stakes include large foreign producers that were awarded blocks in previous rounds such as China s CNOOC  HK 0883  and Germany s Wintershall Dea  Smaller firms including Hokchi Energy and Grupo Diavaz are also trying to share a portion of their assets  For sellers  allowing partners to get into their projects is a way to limit growing political and financial risks while sharing required capital expenditure  For buyers  this secondary market can open a way into a country whose industry still holds enormous potential although its competitiveness is fading    If I want to grow and there are no rounds  the only option left is to buy a stake in some of the existing   said Benigna Leiss  former country manager of U S   Chevron  Corp  N CVX  in Mexico   Fortunately  regulation allows doing so

Enrique Pena Nieto awarded over 100 contracts to energy firms in 2015 2018 to explore and produce oil and gas in Mexico  His reforms also opened the door for Pemex to form joint ventures   But Lopez

175516,397032,SO,China demands  fighting spirit  from diplomats as trade war  Hong Kong protests simmer,news,"SHANGHAI  Reuters    Chinese diplomats have been instructed to promote Beijing s view more aggressively as the country grapples with the trade war with the United States  anti government protests in Hong Kong and other crises that could dent its image 
The government s top diplomat  Wang Yi  prodded officials at a foreign ministry gathering last month to display stronger  fighting spirit  in the face of international challenges  three sources with knowledge of the matter said 
While Wang did not give explicit direction at the event  the instructions come after several senior Chinese diplomats set up Twitter accounts  some of which have been used to attack Beijing s critics  This week  the foreign ministry also launched a Twitter account 
More than 1 000 current and former officials attended the event in Beijing  singing patriotic songs to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the foreign ministry 
 This is the first time we have been told to show more  fighting spirit    said one source who attended the celebration 
Wang s comments reflect President Xi Jinping s revamp of foreign and military policy  in which he has abandoned the approach laid out by reform architect Deng Xiaoping  who said China should hide its strength and bide its time while it developed 
Xi s wide ranging policies have included the multi billion dollar Belt and Road Initative and the establishment of the China controlled Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank 
On Monday  the foreign ministry made its debut on Twitter  One of  MFA China s inaugural tweets outlined China s response to a new U S  law on Hong Kong while another took a poke at the case of a man claiming to be a Chinese spy seeking asylum in Australia 
Within a day and a half it had nearly 10 000 followers 
The ministry did not reply immediately to faxed questions about its new Twitter account  the November event or the policy 
RE SHAPING NARRATIVE
State run Chinese news outlets have had a presence on overseas social media platforms for years 
And the government has been accused of being involved in other ways   Twitter and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  said in August they had suspended hundreds of accounts that they said were part of a coordinated state backed effort by China to undermine protests in Hong Kong  Beijing has defended the right of Chinese people and media to make their voices heard on Hong Kong 
In the last few months  Chinese ambassadors and other senior diplomats have set up at least a dozen Twitter accounts  Twitter has said it considers  official government voices on Twitter an important element of the service  
The new accounts reflect efforts by the Chinese Communist Party  CCP  to attempt to re shape the global narrative  said Anne Marie Brady  a Chinese politics specialist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand 
 China s international image is a big preoccupation for the CCP leadership   she said 
Hu Xijin  editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper which is published by the party  said China s pushback  while perhaps appearing defensive at times  was natural 
The West s voices are more numerous and its  apparatus of public opinion  more developed than China s  he told Reuters 
 I think this is a problem for China   he said 
In the last six months  Chinese ambassadors to Austria  Iran  the Maldives  Mali  Namibia  Nepal  Saudi Arabia  South Africa  Suriname  the United States and the UK have joined Twitter 
Zhao Lijian  a deputy head of the ministry s information department  has been one of the highest profile diplomats on the platform  building on a Twitter following he started when posted to Pakistan until taking his new post in October 
Zhao has regularly needled the United States  with recent tweets thanking America for  squandering trillions of dollars in Afghanistan  Iraq  Libya  Syria  and highlighting racism in Washington  DC 
Mike Chinoy  a non resident senior fellow at the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California s U S  China Institute  said he expected China to aggressively make use of social media  perhaps even drawing inspiration from the U S  president

175534,397050,SO,Is Kate Spade To Blame For Tapestry s Dismal Run On Bourses ,opinion,The past three months have not been a smooth ride for Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR    as shares of this provider of luxury accessories and lifestyle brands have fallen roughly 18 3  compared with the  s decline of approximately 12 2   Further  analysts have become pessimistic regarding the stock over time  as evident from downward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2020 and 2021 have moved south by 27 cents and 35 cents in the past 60 days to  2 57 and  2 73  respectively  The consensus mark for the third quarter has fallen 17 cents to 36 cents in the aforementioned period What s Weighing on the Stock This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock came under pressure following the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein earnings came in line but net sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter in row  Further  soft first quarter fiscal 2020 view was not well perceived by investors  Challenging retail backdrop in North America  unfavorable currency movements  soft margins and weakness in Kate Spade brand hurt the company s performance  These factors compelled management to trim earnings forecast for fiscal 2020 and provide a disappointing first quarter view Tapestry expects first quarter revenues to be marginally below the prior year and earnings per share to decrease year over year  Consolidated gross margin is also likely to remain under pressure during the first quarter  For fiscal 2020  management now anticipates revenues to increase at a low single digit rate with earnings per share expected to be flat with the prior year  The company had earlier guided double digit increase in both operating income and earnings per share The company revisited its projection after taking into account the current business trend at Kate Spade brand  given the uncertain environment in North America  Consolidated gross margin is likely to witness a modest decline on account of bringing Kate Spade s footwear business in house and include currency and tariff related impact Weakness in Kate SpadeTapestry acquired the Kate Spade brand in June 2017 with hope to consolidate its position as a multi brand company  However  the brand s performance failed to live up to management s expectations  The company launched new products under the brand but those did not perform as expected  We believe that the weakness in brand is likely to persist in the near term and may hurt sales In the final quarter of fiscal 2019  Kate Spade sales increased 6  year over year on a reported and 7  on a constant currency basis  however  comparable store sales declined 6   We note that the rate of decline in comparable store sales accelerated from 3  witnessed in the preceding quarter  Also  this fared unfavorably with management s expectation to post positive comparable store sales Management expects comparable store sales to decline in high teens rate at Kate Spade during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 based on the current traffic trend  and product and merchandising challenges Management is Sparing no Effort to RecoverTapestry is trying all means to tackle prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape   soft store traffic  stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy  The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products  stores and marketing  Further  management has undertaken initiatives to have direct control over international distribution The company concluded the buybacks of the Kate Spade operations in Singapore  Malaysia and Australia  It also completed the buyback of the Stuart Weitzman business in Southern  NYSE SO  China  The company also acquired the Stuart Weitzman business in Australia from its distribution partner  Such moves help the company to directly operate these businesses  look for

175536,397052,SO,PAM Vs  SO  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Utility   Electric Power sector have probably already heard of Pampa Energia  PAM  and Southern Co   SO   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Pampa Energia and Southern Co  are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PAM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
PAM currently has a forward P E ratio of 3 92  while SO has a forward P E of 20 30  We also note that PAM has a PEG ratio of 0 19  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SO currently has a PEG ratio of 4 51 
Another notable valuation metric for PAM is its P B ratio of 0 52  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SO has a P B of 2 06 
These metrics  and several others  help PAM earn a Value grade of A  while SO has been given a Value grade of C 
PAM sticks out from SO in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that PAM is the better option right now ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pam-vs-so-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200469594,200469594
175540,397056,SO,After four decades  a Vietnamese woman reunites with the daughter airlifted to America,news,"By Cath Turner
HO CHI MINH CITY  Reuters    They wondered about each other over the decades  the Vietnamese mother constantly and more acutely than the 3 year old daughter she gave up in April 1975  just before Saigon fell to Communist North Vietnam 
As U S  troops exited Vietnam after twenty years of conflict  thousands of South Vietnamese who had fought alongside them or otherwise opposed the North were terrified of what lay ahead  As some fled  more than 3 000 children were flown to new families overseas in what became known as  Operation Babylift  
Among those infants was Leigh Mai Boughton Small   the daughter of a Vietnamese maid and a G I    who was airlifted out of the humid chaos of Vietnam for a new life and adopted middle class family in New England 
Leigh Mai and her birth mother may have spent the rest of their lives wondering about each other   except for the mother s persistence  the daughter s decision to try a DNA website  and help from a Vietnamese Good Samaritan 
After years of trying to find each other  Leigh Mai  now 47  met her birth mother Nguyen thi Dep on Nov  17 in Ho Chi Minh City  a reunion exclusively filmed by Reuters TV 
It began with awkward hugs  Dep  70  was afraid her daughter would be disappointed in her   the beautiful young mother had turned into  an old and gray woman  ugly and skinny   she said afterward  Leigh Mai  accompanied by her husband Jeff and three children  was eager to reassure her mother she harbored no resentment about being sent away 
Leigh Mai gave Dep a locket and a scrapbook of her childhood  Dep gave her grandchildren traditional red envelopes containing cash  They hugged  cried and laughed 
What hit Leigh Mai the most was realizing it wasn t just a mother she had lost  but a Vietnamese family  and that there was love there    and aunts and uncles and that never kind of crossed my mind  
She also could not comprehend how hard it must have been for Dep all those years ago when Dep had struggled with the decision to hastily send her daughter overseas to an unknown fate 
SAIGON S CHAOTIC EVACUATION
A feeling of panic was rife in Saigon as the North Vietnamese Army and their Southern  NYSE SO  wing  the Viet Cong  approached the city in April 1975  The evacuation of American civilian and military personnel  along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians  was underway 
Dep had worked as a maid and then telephone operator at a U S  army barracks in Saigon  where she met Leigh Mai s father  Joe O Neal  she recalled in an interview before the reunion at her home in Thu Duc  on the outskirts of what is now called Ho Chi Minh City 
She lost touch with O Neal after he was sent home not long after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in January 1973  The little girl  who the mother had named Phuong Mai  was nearly a year old then  A long letter she wrote to O Neal was returned  He was married and had a family in South Carolina  she later learned 
Dep s American and Vietnamese friends told her to get her daughter on an Operation Babylift flight  telling her  what if they come and kill her  
 I panicked and decided to send Mai away  It took only a week from when I filed her paperwork till when the plane took her away   said Dep 
Many of the children who were flown to new homes in Operation Babylift were orphans  Others were sent abroad in hopes they would have a better life   or that they might be reunited soon after the chaos of the war  But Vietnam and the United States  where most of the children were taken  did not normalize ties until 1995  dashing those hopes 
The last time Dep saw her daughter  at the orphanage where she was awaiting her flight  she told Leigh Mai she had  to go wash my face   intending to leave by the back door   But then her instinct told her something  and she yelled  Mom don t leave   To be honest  at that moment all I wanted was to turn around and take her home   Dep said  Instead  she walked from the airport to the city center  and told my boss that I let her go  
She thought about what she had done  until it felt like my brain shattered   She cried  every night for months  My father didn t speak to me for two months   She took  all sorts of jobs  after that to make a living   Life pushed me around  
But Dep never gave up hope of finding Leigh Mai  She contacted various intermediaries over the years and even wrote a letter to the late U S  Senator Edward Kennedy  who chaired a Senate subcommittee hearing on Operation Babylift in 1975  She said she never got a reply 
THE GOOD LIFE
Leigh Mai knew from an early age she was adopted and half Vietnamese but no one had any idea who her parents were  The children of Operation Babylift arrived with little or no documentation 
She enjoyed the good life Dep had hoped for her in a happy  middle class home in New England with a sister and brother  also adopted 
 I always had a wonderful home and family life  so I just dealt with normal teenage stuff  not really stuff that was about my nationality   she said 
Although she occasionally wondered about her mother growing up  it was only when she was 27 in 2000 that she thought of searching for her  She had just got married and knew she wanted to have children 
Leigh Mai and her adoptive mother  Mary Beth Boughton  went to Vietnam to begin the search  Their only clues were Leigh Mai s Vietnamese name  the town she was born in  and the orphanage she was placed in ahead of Operation Babylift 
But the ledger book listing all those who had stayed at the orphanage in Thu Duc began only in May 1975  after the fall of Saigon and a month after Operation Babylift   So we just concluded that everything kind of was destroyed or burned from when the Communists finally arrived   Leigh Mai said 
She gave up and the years passed  But then commercially available DNA websites offering to help people discover their heritage and family links began to take off  About four years ago  Leigh Mai submitted a DNA sample to ancestry com  occasionally getting a connection to  a fifth cousin  
Then in September 2019  Leigh received an email from ancestry com telling her of a connection to a  sibling first cousin   Another email arrived that said   I think you re my sister  Your Vietnamese mother is looking for you  
During an exchange of texts with the woman named Bonnie Ludlow  Leigh Mai learned they shared the same father   who had died in 2011   but had different mothers   And I think it just exploded from there   Leigh Mai said 
They were helped by a 30 year old Vietnamese man called Vu Le  who had read an article about Dep s search for Leigh Mai and made it his mission to help her  He found Joe O Neal s obituary with Bonnie s name  tracked Bonnie down  and told her about the half sister she had never met 
VALIDATED DECISION
For Dep  Leigh Mai was always a 3 year old child   Seeing her as this grown up woman with a family  it isn t as emotional as when I looked at her photos as a small baby   she said after the reunion 
But the meeting did give her relief about her daughter s life in America 
 I love her a lot and I am at ease because Mai has grown up  having her own family  can take care of her own self  as opposed to before when it was always  Is my baby still alive  If she is  what life does she have  I was worried she had it hard  
Leigh Mai thought about bringing her birth mother back to the United States  but Dep prefers her simple life in Thu Duc  She still bikes to her job as a school janitor 
With technology  Leigh Mai thinks they can stay in touch 
 I want her to still be able to live through us through videos and big moments that kids are going to have in their life and that Jeff and I are going to have in our life 
 So I m hoping that she can get into the iPhone   Leigh said with a laugh ",2019-11-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/after-four-decades-a-vietnamese-woman-reunites-with-the-daughter-airlifted-to-america-2027273,2027273

Victor Mones Coro  founder of Florida based American Charter Services  ACS   had been charged in March by federal prosecutors in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  along with El Aissami  for violating Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act sanctions imposed by the United States in 2017 
Those charges accused El Aissami  who currently serves as vice president for the economy in socialist President Nicolas Maduro s government  of illegally using services provided by ACS 
Washington recognizes opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s president  arguing Maduro is usurping power after holding sham elections last year 
 Victor Mones Coro has now admitted that he conspired to circumvent U S  sanctions to help former Venezuelan vice president Tareck El Aissami    obtain international transport via private jet   Manhattan U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement

175550,397066,SO,NFL notebook  Steelers make move to Hodges at QB,news,"After rallying the Pittsburgh Steelers to a victory this past weekend  Devlin Hodges was named starting quarterback for Sunday s home game against the Cleveland Browns 
Hodges came on in relief of Mason Rudolph in the third quarter last Sunday with the Bengals leading 7 3  On his second pass attempt of the game  he hit James Washington for a 79 yard touchdown and Pittsburgh never trailed again 
Hodges  a 23 year old undrafted rookie out of Samford  was named Southern  NYSE SO  Conference player of the year three times  He started Oct  13 against the Los Angeles Chargers and was 15 of 20 passing for 132 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers  24 17 road victory 
He was 5 of 11 in the second half against the Bengals for 118 yards and a score as the Steelers earned a 16 10 victory in a defensive struggle while improving to 6 5 
  The Baltimore Ravens lost center Matt Skura for the remainder of the season after he came away from Monday night s 45 6 win against the Los Angeles Rams with a knee injury  NFL Network reported 
Skura played just 16 snaps before he was carted off the field as the Ravens offense got off to a torrid start against the Rams  Without Skura  the Ravens did not skip a beat  scoring touchdowns on their first six possessions of the game    the first time a team accomplished that feat since 2008 
Skura  in his third season out of Duke  has started all 39 games of his NFL career  He made 12 starts in his rookie season of 2017 before starting in every Ravens game since  The 26 year old was second in AFC Pro Bowl voting at center 
  Lamar Jackson s dominating performance for the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night  when he threw for five touchdown passes against the Los Angeles Rams  has moved the quarterback into heavy favorite territory to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award 
According to DraftKings  Jackson is now listed at  230 to win the NFL s top individual prize just over one week after he first became the betting favorite  After a Week 11 victory over the Houston Texans  when he threw four touchdown passes  Jackson was listed at  170 
Jackson was listed at 10 000 to 1 odds for the MVP award when the Ravens reported to training camp this summer  Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is now listed at  300  he was  200 following Week 11

Despite the sack drought this season  Wake still ranks third among active players with 100 5 career sacks  He also has 358 career tackles  278 solo  and 22 forced fumbles  seventh among current players 
  The New England Patriots have released veteran offensive tackle Jared Veldheer off the injured reserve retired list  according to a report by NFL Network s Ian Rapoport 
Veldheer  who announced his retirement in May just a week after signing with the Patriots  is reportedly  in shape  and looking to be a late season addition to a team in need of an offensive lineman  according to Rapoport 
In an interview earlier this summer on MLive com  the 32 year old Veldheer said he chose to retire due to the toll that injuries have taken on his body  including a hip issue 
  The Jacksonville Jaguars signed veteran safety Marcus Gilchrist to their active roster and placed linebacker Najee Goode on injured reserve 
Gilchrist  in his ninth year  has played 123 career games  98 starts  and recorded a total of 495 tackles  376 solo  with 39 passes defensed  14 interceptions and four sacks  Most recently  he was signed by the Detroit Lions in October and cut just two days later

175555,397071,SO,U S  economy growing modestly  labor market still tight  Fed report,news,"By Jonnelle Marte
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy expanded modestly from October to mid November and the outlook for growth was generally positive while labor markets remained tight across the country  the Federal Reserve said in a report on Wednesday 
The latest temperature check of the economy  gathered from the central bank s discussions with business contacts around the country  also said prices had increased at a modest pace 
 Outlooks generally remained positive with some contacts expecting the current pace of growth to continue into next year   the Fed said in its  Beige Book  report 
Several Fed districts reported  relatively strong job gains  in professional and technical services as well as in health care  The picture was more mixed for manufacturing  with some districts noting rising headcounts while others said employment remained stable  One district reported layoffs 
Overall  employment continued to rise  even as tight labor markets across the country made it difficult for employers to find the workers they needed  Some contacts said their inability to fill vacancies was constraining business growth 
For example  two employment agencies in the New York district said  almost all job candidates  already are employed and are not interested in changing positions at this time of year 
Agricultural conditions were largely unchanged and remained strained by weather and low crop prices  In the Fed s Richmond district  farmers have been hesitant to invest in land or equipment 
Parts of the Atlanta district also experienced drought conditions 
The U S  China trade war  now in its 16th month  has dragged on economic growth  U S  manufacturing activity has softened and business investment has cooled as firms delay making decisions due to the uncertainty over tariffs 
Retailers mentioned higher costs  with contacts in some districts attributing the rises to tariffs  the Fed said  Some firms said they were limited in their ability to raise prices  while others were more able to pass on the costs 
Most districts reported stable to moderately growing consumer spending  with several districts reporting increases in auto sales and tourism  the Fed said 
However  some areas reported pockets of weakness  Retailers in the St  Louis district said the outlook for future economic conditions had turned pessimistic and that sales have been the same or slightly lower than last year  Attendance at Broadway shows in New York City dropped off during the first half of November and ticket prices were slightly lower than a year ago 
STRONG LABOR MARKET
The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year in an effort to protect the economy from the trade dispute with China  slowing global growth and a slump in business investment 
U S  consumer confidence fell in November for the fourth straight month amid concerns about current business conditions  but the index is still consistent with an economy growing at a moderate pace 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday monetary policy is now  well positioned to support a strong labor market  and help the central bank reach its 2  inflation target  a hint that interest rates are likely to remain steady unless there is a sharp decline in the economic outlook 
Elsewhere in the Beige Book  some districts said the restaurant industry was particularly strained by a shortage of labor  Some restaurants in Southern  NYSE SO  California had closed because of labor and operating costs  In Minneapolis  some restaurants cut hours due to a lack of staff 
The Beige Book was prepared by the Dallas Fed with information collected on or before November 18 ",2019-11-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-economy-growing-modestly-labor-market-still-tight-fed-report-2029707,2029707

What s Next for Oxford Industries 
While Oxford Industries has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Coming into today  shares of the power company had gained 4 92  in the past month  In that same time  the Utilities sector gained 7 09   while the S P 500 gained 4 25  
SO will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  In that report  analysts expect SO to post earnings of  1 14 per share  This would mark no growth from the year ago period  Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  5 91 billion  down 4 12  from the year ago period 
SO s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  3 04 per share and revenue of  22 12 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  0 98  and  5 86   respectively 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for SO should also be noted by investors  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

175574,397090,SO,Venezuela opposition cuts deal to delay litigation over PDVSA bond,news," Reuters    Venezuela s opposition has reached a deal with the trustee of a bond issued by state oil company PDVSA to delay litigation in a lawsuit challenging the validity of the bond  court filings showed 
The opposition appointed PDVSA board  which is recognized in the United States as the company s rightful representation  last month sued in the U S  District Court for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York to annul PDVSA s 2020 bonds   which are backed by shares in U S  refining subsidiary Citgo 
The deal between PDVSA and the defendants  bond trustee MUFG Union Bank and collateral agent Glas Americas  laid out a schedule in which fact discovery would extend until Feb  10 2020  followed by a period of expert depositions before a hearing on May 5 
Judge Katherine Polk Failla agreed to the arrangement  known as a forbearance agreement  last Friday  filings showed 
It was not immediately clear what the deal means for Citgo 
The U S  Treasury Department on Oct  24 temporarily blocked the transfer of shares in the company  which prevented 2020 bondholders from exercising their rights to seize the refiner when the bonds went into default days later 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cannot make payments on the bond due to Washington s sanctions aimed at ousting him  The opposition  whose leader Juan Guaido is recognized by the Trump administration as the legitimate president  said it did not have the funds to make the  913 million payment due Oct  28 
A spokesman for the Venezuela Creditors Committee  which represents bondholders  did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the forbearance agreement would prevent creditors from attempting to seize Citgo should the U S  Treasury not extend its measure protecting the company when it expires in January 
Representatives of Venezuela s opposition in the United States did not respond to requests for comment 
While Guaido controls PDVSA s assets and legal representation in the United States  Maduro remains in control of the company s operations within Venezuela  The socialist leader calls Guaido a U S  puppet seeking to oust him in a coup to seize control of the OPEC nation s vast oil reserves 
The country s economy has been in a tailspin since crude oil collapsed in 2014  prompting the government and PDVSA to default on much of its foreign debt and spurring hyperinflation and chronic shortages of basic goods that have forced millions of Venezuelans to emigrate ",2019-11-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/venezuela-opposition-cuts-deal-to-delay-litigation-over-pdvsa-bond-2023593,2023593

175579,397095,SO,Teen in California high school shooting rampage used  ghost gun  made from parts,news,"By Dan Whitcomb
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A 16 year old boy who opened fire at his Southern  NYSE SO  California high school  killing two classmates and wounding three others before shooting himself in the head  used a  ghost gun  built from parts  the local sheriff said on Thursday 
Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow pulled the  45 caliber semi automatic pistol from his backpack on Nov  14  his birthday  and shot students at Saugus High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita seemingly at random before turning the gun on himself  He died of his wounds the next day 
 When we did a search of the house  we encountered what s called a kit gun  The weapon used in the homicide was also a kit gun   Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told local KABC TV in an interview 
 It was assembled from parts  had no serial number  So it becomes what s known as a  ghost gun    Villanueva said 
The sheriff told KABC it was not yet clear if the teenage gunman put the weapon together himself  The boy s father  who died in 2017  was an avid hunter who once owned six guns  But those weapons had been confiscated from him and destroyed  Villanueva said 
Kit guns are sold legally at gun shows and online and are sometimes called  80  percent guns  because they are purchased roughly 80  assembled  he said 
STILL NO MOTIVE
The sheriff told KABC that despite conducting 45 interviews and conducting an exhaustive search of Berhow s home  police had not yet determined a motive in the rampage  the latest mass shooting at a U S  school during a national debate over gun rights 
 All of those witnesses have been interviewed  we know the mechanism  the how  but the why still remains an elusive goal   he said 
Villanueva said Berhow s mother packed corn dogs  grapes and homemade cookies into his backpack before school that morning  evidence that  even the mother apparently was unaware of what was going to transpire  
The two slain students were a 16 year old girl and 14 year old boy  Two other girls  aged 14 and 15  and a 14 year old boy were wounded 
Federal agencies were working to unlock Berhow s cellphone  which could contain clues to his plans  Villanueva said 
The scene at Saugus High School was reminiscent of other mass shootings at U S  schools  including Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  where a former student with an assault rifle killed 17 people on Feb  14  2018

Donald Trump promised he would help embattled small farmers caught in the crossfire of his trade war with China  But big farms so far have been the main beneficiaries of the billions of dollars being distributed in aid payments 
Half of the Trump administration s latest trade war bailout for farmers went to just a 10th of recipients in the program  according to an analysis of payments by an environmental organization  The study asserted that payouts have been skewed toward larger operations and wealthier producers 
The top 1  of beneficiaries from the trade aid received 13  of the money distributed in the first round of payments under this year s Market Facilitation Program  with an average payment of more than  177 000  But the bottom 80  of recipients received an average payment of  5 136  according to the Environmental Working Group  which analyzed records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act 
The analysis echoes the findings of an assessment of last year s trade aid program that also found benefits were tilted toward large farms  That s likely to stoke criticism of the cost of the  28 billion bailout and accusations of inequities 
Senate Democrats earlier this month issued a report arguing Trump s trade aid favors Southern  NYSE SO  farmers at the expense of their counterparts in the Midwest and Northern Plains  growers of cotton over soybeans  and large producers over smaller ones 
 America s farm safety net is broken   Anne Weir Schechinger  a senior analyst with Environmental Working Group  said in a statement   Instead of helping small farmers that have been hurt by the Trump administration s trade war  Trump s Agriculture Department is wantonly distributing billions of taxpayer dollars to the largest and wealthiest farms  
The U S  Department of Agriculture defended the program in a statement issued through a spokesman  saying the administration  is committed to helping all farmers  regardless of their size  deal with the economic impacts of retaliatory tariffs and unfair trading practices  
Controversy over the trade aid has grown as the scale of payments has escalated and U S  farmers have become increasingly dependent on federal aid  The farm rescue is now more than twice as expensive as the 2009 auto industry bailout  which ultimately cost taxpayers  12 billion  Almost 40  of projected U S  farm profits this year will come from trade aid  disaster assistance  federal subsidies and insurance payments  according to the American Farm Bureau Federation 
The trade aid program came up in Wednesday s Democratic presidential debate as moderator Rachel Maddow pressed candidate Pete Buttigieg on whether he would continue the rescue subsidies if he is elected  Buttigieg responded he would  but we won t need them because we re going to fix the trade war  
Farmers and rural residents are a critical Trump constituency as the president enters a re election campaign and a fight to stave off impeachment 
The Trump administration announced an additional  16 billion round of trade aid for farmers this year as the dispute with China drags on  That s on top of a  12 billion pledge in 2018 
This year s payments are being made in three tranches  The Environmental Working Group analysis looked at payments made in the first tranche  from Aug  19 through Oct  31  totaling about  6 billion 
At least three farms have already received more than  1 million in aid from this year s first tranche  Smith   Sons  a cotton and sorghum farm based in Bishop  Texas  was paid  1 5 million  according to the group  Forty five farms were paid more than  500 000 
The program caps payments at  250 000 per person  But Schechinger said the limit can be skirted through partnerships that allow cousins  nieces and nephews living in distant cities to receive the aid payments 
 The caps really don t apply to very many people   she said

175615,397131,SO,Democrat Warren vows to use  every tool  to combat white nationalist violence,news,"By Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Tuesday if elected to the White House she would use  every tool  at her disposal to combat white nationalist violence  beginning with directing the FBI and Justice Department to put a renewed focus on domestic terrorism 
Warren  one of 18 Democrats vying for the party s nomination to take on President Donald Trump in November 2020  said U S  law enforcement agencies have prioritized investigating international terrorism since the September 2001 attacks  even as the FBI logged more than 7 000 hate crimes in 2018 
The Massachusetts senator said recent racially motivated attacks at a South Carolina church  a white supremacist rally in Virginia  a Pennsylvania synagogue and a Walmart  NYSE WMT  in Texas  should have been prevented 
 They are incompatible with our values and have no place in American life   Warren wrote on the website Medium 
Warren said the Trump administration had  chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and affiliated violent extremists  while the president  openly stoked these fires  
She cited Trump immigration adviser Stephen Miller  who as a Senate aide promoted anti immigrant views and had ties to white nationalist websites  according to a cache of his emails obtained recently by the Southern  NYSE SO  Poverty Law Center  SPLC   a civil rights group 
The White House has defended Miller  telling the New York Times that SPLC  libels  slanders and defames conservatives  
Warren said the nearly 18 000 police and law enforcement agencies in the United States should adopt standard metrics to track hate crimes and white nationalist groups  Federal prosecutors should handle such cases since localities often lack the training or resources and prosecutions should be standardized  she said

Warren said her plan to expand background checks would help prevent individuals associated with violent or militant groups from purchasing firearms and changes in policing tactics could rebuild trust in law enforcement within communities targeted by racially motivated attacks

175638,397154,SO,3 Homebuilder Stocks To Consider After Upbeat July Home Sales,opinion,"Sales of previously owned US homes rose in July  possibly indicating that lower mortgage rates are finally stimulating sales after a sluggish spring selling season  July marked the first increase in sales in 17 months with existing home sales rising 0 6  year over year  While housing has started to turn in a positive direction  the trade war and the inverted bond yield remain headwinds for the housing market  However  the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  has gained 29 3  YTD  outpacing the broader S P 500 s 14 2  gain  Let s see what homebuilding stocks have stood out from the crowd 
LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH   is a company that focuses on converting renters of apartments and single family homes into homeowners by offering homes at affordable locations  The homebuilding company has skyrocketed 77 8  year to date  LGIH reported its second quarter results in early August and beat our earnings estimate by 12 35   The company generated  461 8 million in revenue  jumping 10  from Q2 2018  At the end of Q2  the company now owns and controls 54 191 lots  LGIH reaffirmed their fiscal 2019 guidance of EPS between  7 00  8 00 and believes it will have between 105 115 active selling communities 
 Looking ahead to Q3  consensus estimates call for EPS to increase 26 32  to  1 92 per share on the back of a 29 66  revenue surge to  493 2 million  Positive revenue and earnings growth are projected for LGIH through fiscal 2020  The stock is currently trading right around the industry average at 11 9X its forward earnings  which can provide investors with a fair entry point into a stock that looks poised to continue its massive 2019 run  LGIH is sitting at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH   is the eighth largest public homebuilder in the United States  Meritage Homes builds and sells single family homes for first time  move up  luxury  and active adult buyers across the Western  Southern  NYSE SO  and Southeastern United States  MTH is an additional homebuilder that has skyrocketed in 2019  up 76 9  YTD  In Q2  the company reported a 22  increase in orders  reflecting a healthy demand for entry level homes  along with a 5  increase in closings  The company also beat earnings by 27 18  with a reported  1 31 per share  MTH s financial services generated  4 16 million  increasing 7  from the prior year s quarter  The company gave a fiscal 2019 guidance of  3 4  3 6 billion in home closing revenue and 8 700 9 100 home closings  They expect yearly EPS to come in around  5 20  5 50 
Our consensus estimates anticipate MTH to bring in  3 5 billion in fiscal 2019 and EPS of  5 26 for fiscal 2019  The company has beaten our earnings estimates three out of the past four quarters with an average EPS surprise of 13 48   MTH is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and has had its estimates revised upwards the past 60 days across the board  establishing the stock as a standout in the homebuilding industry 

NVR  NYSE NVR   is engaged in the construction and sale of single family detached homes  townhomes and condominium buildings  all of which are primarily constructed on a pre sold basis  The company operates in two business segments  Homebuilding and Mortgage Banking  NVR s Q2 earnings and revenue beat our estimates by 17 59  and 6 83   respectively  coming in at  1 8 billion and  53 09 per share 
NVR is a unique company because they use something called land purchase agreements to acquire their buildable lots  They put down a small deposit in exchange for the right to purchase the lot  They don t actually buy the lot itself until it has signed a purchase agreement for a home to be built  making the building process much less capital intensive  This also makes the company much more capable of successfully navigating rough markets  For example  NVR actually gained market share during the financial crisis while other homebuilders were left scrambling and selling buildable lots at fire sale prices 
Q3 consensus estimates forecast NVR s bottom line to rally 7 87  to  52 08 per share on the back of a slight revenue increase of 0 17  to  1 81 billion  NVR s stock has surged 50 8  this year  and earnings boast an average EPS surprise of 20 41  over the past four quarters  Earnings estimates have been revised upwards for Q3  earning the stock a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Falling mortgage rates  low unemployment  and upbeat July home sales make it prime time to consider adding a homebuilder to a portfolio  Furthermore  NVR s unique business model and proven resilience to rough economic climates make it a homebuilder stock that can bolster a portfolio

175640,397156,SO,Proprietary trading firm agrees to pay over  67 million to resolve spoofing charges,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Tower Research Capital LLC has agreed to pay nearly  67 5 million to the U S  Commodities Futures Trading Commission to settle charges that it and three former traders manipulated U S  futures markets 
The proprietary trading firm agreed to pay to resolve charges through a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department to resolve charges the company and three former traders engaged in unlawful activity while placing orders that benefited Tower and prompted  32 6 million in market losses  according to statements from U S  authorities 
The total to be paid includes about  43 1 million in restitution and disgorgement and a  24 4 million civil monetary penalty  the largest total monetary relief ever ordered in a spoofing case  the CFTC said its statement 
This is the latest in a surge of U S  actions on spoofing  a practice in which traders place orders they intend to cancel to move prices to benefit their market positions 
 Free markets are not open and fair when people criminally manipulate them   U S  Attorney Ryan Patrick of the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Texas said in a separate Justice Department statement 
The three traders   New Yorkers Kamaldeep Gandhi and Krishna Mohan and Chinese citizen Yuchun  Bruce  Mao   engaged in a scheme to defraud other market participants from about March 2012 to December 2013  The traders fraudulently placed orders to buy and sell equity index futures contracts with plans to cancel before execution  authorities said 
Gandhi pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to engage in wire fraud  commodities fraud and spoofing in 2018  Mohan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in wire fraud  commodities fraud and spoofing  also in 2018  Both are scheduled for sentencing in February 2020

175641,397157,SO,Fed sees climate change shaping economy  policy,news,"By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The U S  central bank signaled on Friday it may be getting ready to join international peers in incorporating climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability  and may even take it into account when setting monetary policy 
 To fulfill our core responsibilities  it will be important for the Federal Reserve to study the implications of climate change for the economy and the financial system and to adapt our work accordingly   Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in remarks released at the start of the Fed s first ever conference on climate change and economics 
The Fed  she said  will need to look at how to keep banks and the financial system resilient amid risks from extreme weather  higher temperatures  rising sea levels and other effects of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
And increasingly  she said   it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability  
Brainard s comments mark a shift for the Fed  which lags other major central banks that have made climate change an explicit part of their financial stability remits  Her talk  the first she s given in her five year tenure at the Fed that even mentions the subject  suggests she and her colleagues are taking the risks and costs of global warming seriously 
The U S  central bank s attention to global warming comes even as President Donald Trump s administration denies it exists  Trump on Monday notified the United Nations that the United States will in 12 months leave the Paris Climate Accord  under which 195 nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to prevent catastrophic planetary warming 
Scientists are in broad agreement that carbon dioxide from cars  power plants and other human sources are behind the climate change that s already making powerful hurricanes  severe drought  and other weather extremes more frequent 
RISING RISKS  SLOWING ECONOMIES
The San Francisco Fed s conference  so oversubscribed that a webcast has been created to meet demand  gave policymakers a crash course in research that could change how the Fed forecasts economic growth  regulates banks  and even sets interest rates 
Papers presented at the conference showed how climate change has crimped growth and presented ideas on how policy  including monetary policy  can be used to mitigate harm 
University of Southern  NYSE SO  California professor Hashem Pesaran showed that rising average temperatures and volatile precipitation   both effects of climate change   have already slowed U S  economic output in recent decades 
Meeting Paris Accord goals  the paper found  could limit losses to per capita U S  GDP from planetary warming over the next 80 years to 3  or less  versus 14  if goals are not met 
Swedish central bank economist Conny Olovsson used an economic model to show losses to economic growth from imposing a carbon tax   an objection often raised by politicians and industry   would be dwarfed by the economic losses projected if carbon dioxide remains largely untaxed and global warming continues unchecked 
In a third paper  Nicholas Muller  a professor at Carnegie Mellon University  outlined how the Fed might factor environmental circumstances into monetary policy by  for example  keeping rates lower when pollution levels were increasing  to encourage consumption before they got worse  and higher when pollution was declining  to depress spending until the environment improved 
Fed policymakers appeared receptive to the ideas 
 Climate change is an issue we can t afford to ignore   San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at the start of the conference  a day that also marked the one year anniversary of a fire 150 miles north of San Francisco that killed 85 people and destroyed 14 000 homes  a conflagration blamed in part on climate change   This is not a hypothetical risk of the future   the risks are here  we have to deal with them  ",2019-11-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/feds-brainard-says-climate-change-poses-profound-risks-2016545,2016545

175651,397167,SO,U S  farmers to leverage land as farm economy deteriorates  survey,news,"By P J  Huffstutter
DALLAS  Reuters    As the U S  China trade war drags on  more farmers are expected to take out debt against the land they own   their collateral of last resort   to keep their operations going  according to a survey of lenders 
The survey found that bankers are increasingly worried about farmers facing cash flow problems  46  of bankers expect an increase in loans secured by farmland for the 2019 20 growing year  up from 37  for the previous period 
The poll by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp  Farmer Mac  and trade group the American Bankers Association  ABA  was released this week at the ABA s annual agricultural banking conference 
The concern comes as the U S  farm economy deteriorates  Farmland is the key pillar of equity in the U S  agricultural heartland  which has been suffering from lingering weakness in commodity prices and loss of key export markets due to President Donald Trump s trade disputes 
Previously  bankers had been focused on commodity prices falling and decreases in overall farm income  said Jackson Takach  chief economist for Farmer Mac  which provides a secondary market for a range of loans made to borrowers in rural America 
 But this year  for the first time  it was liquidity   Takach said in an interview with Reuters 
One key concern among lenders is that farm profits have continued to fall even as the survey found some bankers are seeing farm family expenses rising  in part due to an increase health care expenses  said Jim Chessen  chief economist for the ABA 
About 57  of farm loan customers were profitable in 2019  according to the survey  but more than 82  of farm bankers said their customers  profits were dwindling   with the biggest economic woes being felt in Midwest and Southern  NYSE SO  states among dairy  grain and livestock producers 
Takach and Chessen said bankers are focused on whether or not farmland values will continue to hold steady  According to the survey  nearly of half of the respondents said they expect land values in their areas to decline in 2020 
For bankers  one key concern has been the amount of farmland that could come up for sale in the coming months and whether that could trigger an across the board fall for land prices  But there has been little sign so far of land supply outstripping demand  said F  Howard Halderman  president of Halderman Real Estate and Farm Management in Wabash  Indiana




 There hasn t been a big increase in inventory coming on the market and that has helped keep prices stable   Halderman said ",2019-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-farmers-to-leverage-land-as-farm-economy-deteriorates-survey-2019614,2019614
175652,397168,SO,Test administrator to plead guilty  parent faces sentencing over U S  college scam,news,"BOSTON  Reuters    A former college entrance exam administrator is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday to participating in a vast college admissions cheating and fraud scheme  the same day a wealthy parent is set to face sentencing for his own role in it 
Federal prosecutors in Boston say that Igor Dvorskiy accepted about  10 000 in bribes per student to allow a corrupt test proctor to secretly take SAT and ACT college entrance exams on their behalf or correct their answers 
His plea will take place hours before title insurance company executive Toby Macfarlane faces sentencing for conspiring to bribe University of Southern  NYSE SO  California employees to secure the admission of his children as fake athletic recruits 
The two men are among 52 people charged with participating in a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools 
William  Rick  Singer  the consultant  pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients  children as fake athletic recruits 
The 35 parents charged since March include  Desperate Housewives  star Felicity Huffman  who was sentenced to a 14 day prison term after pleading guilty  and  Full House  star Lori Loughlin  who is fighting the charges 
Dvorskiy  a former director of a private school in Los Angeles  served as a compensated test administrator for the companies that run the SAT and ACT college entrance exams  prosecutors said 
He is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to commit racketeering as part of an agreement to cooperate with authorities in the ongoing investigation  which has been dubbed  Operation Varsity Blues  
Macfarlane pleaded guilty himself in June to conspiring to commit mail fraud  Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to sentence him to a year in prison 
Prosecutors said Macfarlane paid  400 000 in sham consulting fees to Singer  some of which he passed on to USC coaches as bribes  and  50 000 to an account controlled by an official who participated in the scheme 
Those payments helped facilitate the admission of his daughter and his son to USC as fake soccer and basketball recruits  prosecutors said ",2019-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/test-administrator-to-plead-guilty-parent-faces-sentencing-over-us-college-scam-2019630,2019630

175682,397198,SO,New York lawyer is source of  500 000 paid to Trump attorney Giuliani,news,"By Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK  Reuters    A supporter of U S  President Donald Trump paid the president s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani  500 000 on behalf of a company co founded by a Ukrainian American businessman who helped Giuliani investigate Trump s political rival Joe Biden  the supporter s lawyer told Reuters on Thursday 
Reuters first reported the payment  last month but at the time Giuliani declined to disclose the exact source  He would only say that it was not foreign in origin and that it was payment for services he rendered to the company of the businessman  Lev Parnas 
The payment attracted attention because of Parnas  role in helping Giuliani investigate former U S  Vice President Biden  a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election  and his son  Hunter Biden  who was a director of Ukrainian energy company Burisma 
Parnas was arrested last month on unrelated campaign finance charges 
Charles Gucciardo  a personal injury lawyer from Long Island  paid the money to Giuliani Partners LLC  a management and consulting firm  on behalf of Fraud Guarantee  Parnas  company  according to Randy Zelin  a lawyer for Gucciardo  He said the money was a loan to the Boca Raton based company  whose website says it aims to help clients  reduce and mitigate fraud  
 Mr  Gucciardo invested because he believed that Mr  Giuliani   the former Mayor of New York City  former United States Attorney for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  and the first name in cybersecurity   was in front of  behind and alongside the company   Zelin said  adding that his client s politics are irrelevant 
The New York Times first reported late on Wednesday that Gucciardo paid the  500 000 
Gucciardo gave  50 000 to a pro Trump political action committee America First Action in June 2018 
Zelin said the terms of agreements with Fraud Guarantee allow Gucciardo to convert the loan into an equity stake in the company 
Federal prosecutors are examining Giuliani s interactions with Parnas and another associate  Igor Fruman  who also was indicted on campaign finance charges  a law enforcement source told Reuters last month  Parnas and Fruman pleaded not guilty 
The men are accused of making illegal donations to political candidates  The donations included a  325 000 contribution to America First Action  according to the indictment 
Giuliani is a central figure in a Democratic led U S  House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into whether Republican Trump abused his office for political gain when he pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens

175695,397211,SO,Top Santa Anita vet says track is safest in U S ,news,"By Rory Carroll
ARCADIA  Calif   Reuters    The Santa Anita Park s top veterinarian said drug reforms instituted at the race track have made it the safest in the country even though 36 horse fatalities have occurred at the venue this year 
The high number of deaths at the famed Southern  NYSE SO  California track  which will host the Breeders  Cup on Friday and Saturday  since the season began in last December  prompted public backlash and government investigations 
Racing at the track was canceled for more than three weeks in March and the track s owners responded by banning the use of drugs that can mask existing injuries in horses on race days  which can lead to breakdowns 
There was also talk of moving the Breeders  Cup to another venue but Dionne Benson  chief veterinary officer for track owners The Stronach Group  said there was no safer place to hold it 
 If you are looking at the United States  there are no stricter set of medication regulations than we have here   Benson told Reuters at the track on Wednesday 
 These horses and this track are probably examined more than any in the country so I am comfortable that we have done quite a bit and that the horses are safer here   she said 
Benson  who took the position in May  said the track will have a record number of vets on hand for the Breeders  Cup and that all of the race horses will undergo vigorous evaluations before they are given the green light to compete 
Due to investigations by the Los Angeles County district attorney and the California Horse Racing Board  necropsy reports for the fallen horses have not been released to the public  making it difficult to pinpoint the exact causes 
Benson said Santa Anita introduced changes which are already producing results 
 A lot of what we ve done has been based on what we think will help  Things like changing the medication and taking more control over training   she said 
 We didn t have the luxury of waiting to figure out if there was a single thing we could do that will improve it  We had to start making improvements and we have definitely improved  
Since the new rules were implemented in March  fatality rates in racing at the track are down over 50  and more than 70  in training  she said 
Despite the progress  two horses  a mare named G Q Covergirl and a filly named Bye Bye Beautiful  perished at the track on Friday and Sunday  respectively 
 As a general rule we are down overall but that doesn t mean that those two horses didn t matter   she said 
 They certainly mattered to us  I know our vets lost sleep over them 
 That s one of the parts of the job  You wonder if there is something you could have done better or could have done differently 
 If you take any snapshot in time you can make something look bad  we have to see what happens over the long run and over the long run in these six months  we ve seen a difference  ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/top-santa-anita-vet-says-track-is-safest-in-us-2008142,2008142

175701,397217,SO,Firefighters make gains against wildfire in Southern California farm country,news,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Firefighters began to get the upper hand on a destructive wildfire in a Southern  NYSE SO  California farming region on Saturday  taking advantage of lighter winds as authorities let some evacuated residents return home 
The Maria fire erupted on Thursday near the community of Santa Paula  about 70 miles  110 km  northwest of downtown Los Angeles  and it has since charred 9 400 acres  3 800 hectares  of dry brush and chaparral  officials said 
Firefighters have scrambled to protect tens of millions of dollars worth of citrus and avocado crops in harm s way  as well as oil industry infrastructure 
The blaze  which was 20  contained on Saturday  is the most pressing emergency facing California firefighters  with several other blazes in the state largely contained 
More than 10 000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the blaze 
But authorities allowed people in two residential areas to return home on Saturday and they had plans to further lift evacuation orders  said Ventura County Fire Captain Brian McGrath 
 We re taking advantage of the good weather we have right now   McGrath said by phone 
The fire has destroyed three structures but not caused any injuries  he said 
Southern California Edison has told state authorities that 13 minutes before the fire started  it began to re energize a circuit near where flames first erupted  said a spokesman for the utility  Ron Gales 
Southern California Edison had shut off power in the area because of concerns that an electrical mishap could spark a wildfire  The utility and fire officials have said the cause of the blaze is still under investigation 
On Friday evening  moist breezes from the Pacific Ocean aided firefighters battling the Maria Fire 
By Saturday morning conditions were dry again  although winds were relatively weak  said National Weather Service meteorologist Lisa Phillips 
The Maria Fire erupted after fierce Santa Ana desert gusts howled across much of Southern California  Santa Ana winds and similar gusts in Northern California have intensified a number of wildfires in the state this fall

Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Great Southern Bancorp is 10 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 2 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 1  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Great Southern Bancorp has an S TA ratio of 0 06  which means that the company gets  0 06 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 05  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Great Southern Bancorp looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 1 5  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Great Southern Bancorp  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Great Southern Bancorp a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

ARCADIA  Calif   Reuters    Vino Rosso won the  6 million Breeders  Cup Classic on Saturday at Santa Anita Park in a race that was marred by the death of another horse 
Vino Rosso stormed across the finish line in a rout but Mongolian Groom never made it that far  having been pulled up after suffering an injury to his left hind limb 
The four year old gelding was taken from the track in an equine ambulance after being shielded from the crowd of 67 811 by a large green screen 
Favorite McKinzie  5 2  was a distant second and Higher Power  9 1  finished third 
Mongolian Groom  15 1  was in contention early in the 11 horse race on the fast dirt surface but slowed near the top of the final stretch 
Jockey Abel Cedillo pulled him up and veterinarians rushed to attend to the stricken horse 
 Mongolian Groom sustained an injury in the Breeders  Cup Classic today and was immediately attended to by an expert team of veterinarians   Breeders  Cup spokesperson Jim Gluckson said in a statement 
Gluckson said the veterinarians could not repair the damage and recommended a  humane euthanasia  
Gluckson said an independent evaluation into what caused Mongolian Groom to break down would be launched and the results would be made public when it is complete 
 We are committed to working with our partners in the industry to continue to advance safety reforms  with the well being of our athletes in mind  
No horses were injured through the first 11 Breeders  Cup races on Friday and Saturday although several were scratched by veterinarians prior to their starts 
Santa Anita Park has been under intense scrutiny following the spate of horse deaths at the famed Southern  NYSE SO  California track since late December  The death of Mongolian Groom raised the toll to 37 
The race track implemented a series of reforms around drug use and brought in a record number of veterinarians prior to the start of the event 
Animal rights activists protested outside the venue on both days  saying the sport is tantamount to animal cruelty and calling for it to be banned 
Horse safety officials this week said the track was the safest in the United States 
ACTIVIST OUTRAGE
Opponents of the sport responded to the latest death of a racehorse with outrage 
 Ignore everything else you ve heard and read about  safety  and horseracing   said Patrick Battuello of activist group Horseracing Wrongs 
 If they can t prevent a kill at this track  on this day    with the whole world watching and vigilance at an all time high    they can t prevent  at least not in any meaningful way  kills period  
 It s inherent to what they do  And it must end  Now  
Mongolian Groom was trained by Enebish Ganbat and owned by Mongolian Stable  which is best known for producing 2015 Breeders  Cup Turf Sprint winner Mongolian Saturday 
The death overshadowed Vino Rosso s impressive win  which was the first in the Classic for trainer Todd Pletcher and jockey Irad Ortiz 
Pletcher has won 11 Breeders  Cup races in total and Ortiz  who picked up four victories this weekend  has notched a total of nine wins at the world championships  which attracts horses from around the world 
Pletcher acknowledged that tensions were running high in the horse racing community as this year s Breeders  Cup approached

175709,397225,SO,Activists call for halt to U S  horse racing,news,"By Rory Carroll
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Animal rights groups on Sunday called for an immediate halt to horse racing following the high profile death of a gelding in Saturday s Breeders  Cup Classic at Southern  NYSE SO  California s Santa Anita Park 
Four year old Mongolian Groom injured his left hind leg going into the final turn of the nationally televised  6 million race  was taken away from the track in an ambulance and later euthanised 
Thirty seven horses  including three in the last nine days  have died at the famed race track since late December  shining a spotlight on a sport that lacks national regulation pertaining to the misuse of drugs  a leading culprit in horse fatalities 
In April  Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced an investigation into why at that time 23 horses had died at Santa Anita over a three month period 
The results of the investigation have yet to be released  leading to frustration on the part of activists  who protested outside her office demanding answers on Thursday 
The Breeders  Cup  the sports richest event with some  30 million up for grabs over its two days  changes venues every year and its board had considered moving it from Santa Anita in light of the fatalities 
But in June it voted to keep it at Santa Anita as planned after track owners the Stronach Group implemented new rules governing the use of race day medications and hired a record number of veterinarians to examine the horses prior to their starts 
 The decision to hold the Breeders  Cup at Santa Anita before the results of investigations into the spate of recent deaths was ill advised   Kitty Block  CEO of the Humane Society of the United States  said in a statement 
 We believe that a suspension of racing at this track is warranted until the investigations of those deaths  and now the death of Mongolian Groom  are completed and released  
Animal rights group PETA went further  calling for a halt to horse racing nationwide 
 If the racing industry and state officials truly want to save horses  lives  they will suspend trainers and veterinarians of horses who die pending full investigations  install safer synthetic surfaces and CT scan equipment at all tracks  and ban all drugs in the two weeks before a race   said PETA senior vice president Kathy Guillermo 
 All racing nationwide must be suspended until these measures are put in place   she added 
 Any reluctance to do so will lead to more deaths and the self destruction of horse racing  
WHIPPING BAN
A video of the race released by PETA shows jockey Abel Cedillo whipping Mongolian Groom as he came around the final turn on the fast dirt surface before stopping and raising his left hind leg off the ground 
 So even if he was in pain and wanted to slow down  he could not have done so   Guillermo said 
 Striking horses during racing must be banned now  
The California Horse Racing Board has proposed a measure that would greatly limit the use of the whip  The measure is currently open for public comment 
Backers of the Horse Racing Integrity Act  federal legislation that would curtail the use of drugs and establish national oversight  said they hoped Saturday s tragedy would prompt Congress to act 
 American horse racing is at its greatest crossroads in history  and the death of Mongolian Groom underscores the need for Congress to pass the Horseracing Integrity Act   said Marty Irby of Animal Wellness Action 
The Breeders  Cup and the Stronach Group support the bill but is opposed by Churchill Downs  home to the Kentucky Derby  a state represented by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 
McConnell has yet to announce his position on it 
California Senator Dianne Feinstein had said the Breeders  Cup would be  critical test  for the future of horse racing in the state prior to the event 
On Saturday the Breeders  Cup said measures had been put in place to ensure its athletes were racing under the  safest and most transparent conditions possible  
 The death of Mongolian Groom is a loss to the entire horse racing community   the Breeders  Cup said in a statement 
 Our equine and human athletes  safety is the Breeders  Cup s top priority  We have worked closely with Santa Anita leading up to the World Championships to promote enhanced equine safety

175730,397246,SO,Trump tweet  political divisions fuel rising discourse about new U S  civil war,news,"By Julia Harte
MIDDLETOWN  Va   Reuters    Sporting a Confederate flag shirt near a field clouded by cannon smoke  where blue  and gray clad soldiers reenacted a Civil War battle from 155 years ago  Larry Caldwell Piercy  Jr  said he sees a new war looming in the United States   and a role for himself in any fighting 
 It would be all guerrilla warfare  not this open field style kind of thing   he said  gesturing at the reenactment of the 1864 Battle of Cedar Creek in Middletown  Virginia  earlier this month   I would probably be an officer in that effort  
Piercy  62  is one of the motorcycle riders known as the  mechanized cavalry  of the Sons of Confederate Veterans  which has an estimated 30 000 members and describes itself as a  non political heritage organization  that preserves the history and legacy of soldiers in the pro slavery Confederacy in the 1861 1865 Civil War 
He is also a fierce supporter of President Donald Trump 
As Democrats push to impeach Trump and controversy rages over whether to remove monuments to Confederate generals like Robert E  Lee and Stonewall Jackson  Piercy warned a new civil war is brewing 
 You look into rural areas  and we re not seen  but there s a lot of us that ll come out of these hills if it keeps getting worse  Probably every Sons of Confederate Veterans member out there      
The Sons of Confederate Veterans  which limits membership to men with Civil War veteran ancestors  is not seeking to secede from the nation or to revive slavery  both Southern  NYSE SO  causes in the 1861 1865 Civil War  But they say they are trying to preserve the honor of the Confederacy by celebrating its flag  monuments  and other symbols that are widely criticized as tributes to institutional racism 
  CivilWar2  trended on Twitter in September after Trump quoted a pastor in a Twitter post saying it would  cause a Civil War like fracture  in the United States if he were removed from office 
The next day  the right wing Oath Keepers militia affirmed Trump s tweet in its own Twitter post   This is the truth  This is where we are  We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war  Like in 1859  
Mary McCord  who led the Justice Department s national security division from 2016 until May 2017  noted the response from the Oath Keepers and other pro Trump armed groups  and said members of the U S  militia movement have shown they are ready to take action based on the president s comments 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE
While there is no evidence that radical groups on the right or left are organizing a military campaign to plunge the country into civil war  a number of attacks in recent years have raised concerns about a surge in political violence 
A woman was killed when a white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd of counter protesters at a rally of right wing extremists in Charlottesville  Virginia  in 2017 
In August  a suspected white nationalist shot dead 22 people at a Walmart  NYSE WMT  store in El Paso  Texas  shortly after posting an anti Hispanic manifesto online 
Violent rhetoric about an impending civil war is on the rise  said J J  MacNab  a fellow specializing in anti government extremism at George Washington University s Program on Extremism   It used to be just the militia guys saying this stuff  and now it s gone totally mainstream   she said 
She pointed to a YouTube video posted in June that drew 1 4 million views  The video detailed how the electrical grid in  major leftist cities  could be taken down  and concluded that another civil war was inevitable and would be won by the right wing 
Georgetown University s Institute of Politics and Public Service this month released a poll that found a majority of Americans think political  racial  and class divisions are worsening  and that the average voter believes the United States is two thirds of the way to the edge of a civil war 
Trump s supporters at the Cedar Creek reenactment said Democratic opposition to the president had inflamed old rifts in U S  society and pushed some to extreme positions 
 You got some Sons of Confederate Veterans members that would start shooting tomorrow   said Jake Jennette  79  a reenactor portraying General Lee 
He and his friend Wayne Newnam  who represented Lee s lieutenant general Jubal Early  said they used to be part of the group but left because they didn t like the violent turn that some members had taken 
Dave Clarke  who manned a table distributing Sons of Confederate Veterans literature and merchandise at the reenactment  said violent white supremacists had misappropriated the Confederate flag  and that he had faith in the U S  system of government to resolve differences peacefully 
 There s probably people here who ve got AK 47s in their trunks but that s not the answer  We ve been there and done that  That s not the way   Jennette said  tears coming to his eyes as he recalled his own military service in Vietnam and his son s tour in Afghanistan 
He too supports Trump and believes the best way to avoid a war would be the  total annihilation of the liberals  at the ballot box when Trump seeks a second four year term in the 2020 election 
Newnam  70  said he thought the United States had healed from the Civil War by the 1920s but is  regressing  to a state of polarization  He mainly blamed liberal resistance to Trump for the divide  but acknowledged that some of Trump s tweets have not helped 
 The resentment was already there  and it s easy to drum it up again   said Newnam   Social media has allowed people to be nasty to other people without having to face them  Maybe the Trumpster has brought that out a little  God knows some mornings I wish he d sleep a little later   he added  chuckling ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-tweet-political-divisions-fuel-rising-discourse-about-new-us-civil-war-2006347,2006347

Murray Energy Corp  filed for Chapter 11 protection in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Ohio bankruptcy court  The miner    the largest privately owned U S  coal company    said it reached a restructuring agreement with a group of lenders  according to a statement on Tuesday 
The move comes more than a year after the Trump administration s efforts to subsidize struggling nuclear and coal fired power plants failed  shot down by Trump s own appointed energy regulators  Some of those plants were Murray Energy s customers  Robert Murray  a big donor to Trump s campaign  was instrumental in setting his energy agenda and has hosted multiple fundraisers 
On Tuesday  the company named Robert Moore as president and chief executive officer of Murray Energy  It also said it plans to finance operations during the Chapter 11 with its available cash and a  350 million debtor in possession financing facility  Under the restructuring agreement  the lender group will form a new entity    called Murray NewCo    that will acquire the company s assets 
The company s collapse underscores how deeply cheap natural gas and renewable energy resources have cut into coal s share of the U S  power market  Cloud Peak Energy Inc   Cambrian Coal Co   Blackjewel LLC and Blackhawk Mining LLC have all filed for bankruptcy this year  Their downfall mirrors waning demand for fuel that as recently as 2003 accounted for more than half of all U S  power generation 
Murray warned in 2017 that the shifts in the industry could push it into bankruptcy  The company initially chose to avoid that route and persuaded creditors to ease its debt load somewhat  But analysts said this left the company at a disadvantage with rivals because it remained saddled with high costs and interest expenses 
Robert Murray  who began working in coal mines at 16 to support his family  founded his St  Clairsville  Ohio based company in 1988 and has been one of the industry s biggest cheerleaders 
He led the fight against President Barack Obama s clean air rules  filing numerous legal challenges and calling the Democrat  the greatest enemy I ve ever had in my life   His company donated  1 million to a political action committee backing Trump s agenda in the 2018 election

175734,397250,SO,Virginia state elections offer early political test ahead of 2020 U S  race,news,"By John Whitesides
FREDERICKSBURG  Va   Reuters    The off year elections for the Virginia state legislature are often a quiet  little noticed interlude before the frenzy of the U S  presidential campaign  But not this year 
Democrats are pouring money and star power into races that could give the party complete control of the legislative and executive branches of Virginia state government for the first time in more than a quarter century  State Republicans  meanwhile  say the Democratic led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has fired up the Republican base 
The results next Tuesday could provide an early gauge of the staying power of the grassroots anti Trump movement that propelled Democrats to victory in last year s midterm congressional elections  particularly in suburban swing districts that are common in Virginia and will be vital again in the 2020 White House race 
 No pressure  but the rest of us in the United States of America are counting on you   Democratic presidential contender Beto O Rourke told volunteers recently in Fredericksburg  a town rich in Civil War history 50 miles  80 km  south of Washington D C   before they headed out in a heavy rain to knock on voters  doors 
Other Democratic White House contenders  including U S  Senators Cory Booker  Elizabeth Warren  Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar  have visited the state to offer support  Former Vice President Joe Biden  and current Republican Vice President Mike Pence  are scheduled to make visits this weekend 
Virginia is one of only four states holding legislative elections this year and the only one where partisan control of the legislature is considered at risk 
Democrats hold a 20 19 majority in Virginia s Senate  while Republicans have a 51 48 majority in the House of Delegates  with one vacancy in each chamber 
Two conservative Southern  NYSE SO  states   Kentucky and Mississippi   will have elections for governor on Tuesday  and Trump will visit both in the days before the vote  A third  Louisiana  will hold its election for governor on Nov  16 
The outcome in Virginia is certain to play a role in determining the fate of gun restrictions pushed by Democratic Governor Ralph Northam after a mass shooting that killed 12 people in Virginia Beach in May  and in the once a decade process of redrawing legislative lines that will begin after the 2020 census 
The Virginia results also will offer bragging rights for both national parties and hints about the mood of voters ahead of next year s general election between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee 
O Rourke  a former congressman from Texas  called the Virginia election  a preview  of next year s elections  when control of the White House  Congress and more state legislatures will be up for grabs 
 What happens here will help define what is possible in 2020   he said in an interview 
A SHIFT TOWARD DEMOCRATS
Virginia has been shifting to Democrats for at least a decade  powered by an influx of new residents and exploding growth in diverse suburban areas around the state s cities and Washington D C 
Public opinion polls have found moderate suburban voters  particularly women  to be resistant to Trump and the most conservative elements of the Republican agenda  In a mid October Reuters Ipsos poll  58  of suburban women disapproved of Trump  compared to 47  from rural areas and 68  from urban areas 
Republicans have not won a statewide office in Virginia since 2009 and a Republican presidential nominee has not won the state since George W  Bush in 2004 
In this cycle  state Democratic candidates lead Republicans in fundraising  according to the Virginia Public Access Project  and also are contesting more legislative races than Republicans 
Trump looms large over the election 
 All of the momentum we are seeing in these state elections  in fundraising and in volunteers  stems back to the anti Trump energy   said Democratic House candidate Joshua Cole  who is running again in a district that includes parts of Fredericksburg  after losing in 2017 by 73 votes 
Austin Chambers  president of the Republican State Leadership Committee  said the party s candidates have tried to focus on local issues that affect their communities  But the impeachment inquiry into Trump has cranked up Republican interest in the election  he and other Republicans said 
 Impeachment has really fired up our base  and I don t think there are a ton of things out there firing up the Democratic base   said Pete Snyder  a Republican businessman and former candidate for lieutenant governor in Virginia 
Gaining more House seats will not be an easy task for Democrats after they racked up big wins in 2017  when House control was decided by one seat  That race was tied in the actual vote count and ultimately decided by drawing the name of the winning candidate from a bowl 
Ben Tribbett  a Virginia based Democratic consultant  said he did not think the party s grassroots enthusiasm matched the intensity of 2017  Trump s first year in office  with the 2020 Democratic nominating race to find a challenger to Trump taking some of the spotlight 
 You aren t seeing the same crowds out canvassing   Tribbett said 
Patrick Cronin of Springfield  a technology director for a government consulting firm  said he had been motivated to volunteer for Democratic candidates by both Trump and the tie breaker finish in the 2017 battle for House control 
 I can t believe our state was decided by a coin flip   Cronin said   I want to see it turn blue  ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/virginia-state-elections-offer-early-political-test-ahead-of-2020-us-race-2007470,2007470

LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The wildfire that forced celebrities and thousands of others to flee some of the poshest neighborhoods in Los Angeles this week also forced a hasty roundup of scores of horses in the area 
One of them was Prince Toby  a 16 year old horse who belongs to the Hammarberg family of the upscale Pacific Palisades neighborhood 
When the fire broke out in the early hours of Monday  the Hammarbergs evacuated to a hotel  Animal rescue authorities under a police escort went to get Toby at his home in a nearby canyon 
Prince Toby is now being sheltered at the Hansen Dam Horse Park stables in the nearby San Fernando Valley  along with 125 other horses evacuated from the fires  
Louise Hammarberg  a mother of two who designs posters and campaigns for Hollywood movies  said Prince Toby  usually a mellow horse   is a little antsy  
 He is probably not loving it and missing his friends  They are used to being together and here he is in a strange place with strange horses   Hammarberg  a Swedish national who has been living in Los Angeles since she was 17  said after visiting her horse 
Prince Toby was at a stable in the canyon when the Getty fire ignited on Monday morning near the Getty Center museum  forcing evacuations in Brentwood  Pacific Palisades and other neighborhoods 
 We weren t allowed up in the canyon  but he was taken out of there by a hauler and a police escort  because people weren t allowed  so I guess that is why they needed the police to take them out   Hammarberg said

Workers from Los Angeles  Animal Services Department tending to the animals at the Hansen Dam stables said they would welcome any horse that needs shelter for as long as necessary 
 We are going to keep this place open if we need  if anybody needs this space  The stalls are here for these horses that are being evacuated   said Lucy Ruiz  an animal technician at the Animal Services Department  
Authorities have had a lot of practice evacuating horses  as wildfires become more frequent and intense  which the state says is largely a function of climate change  More than 200 horses were hauled to safety in the Saddleridge Fire near the San Fernando Valley earlier this month 
One of the area s worst fires  the December 2017 Thomas fire  which swept through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties  killed at least 54 horses  authorities said 
Southern  NYSE SO  California is one of the largest horse racing centers in the United States  with its sunny climate allowing horses to run year round  Moreover  the canyons and foothills are an inviting terrain for recreational riders

175738,397254,SO,California firefighters ready for battle again as Santa Ana winds whip up new wildfires,news,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Fast moving Santa Ana winds are expected to blast through Southern  NYSE SO  California on Wednesday  whipping up new wildfires after a brief respite for firefighters on Tuesday 
The National Weather Service  NWS  issued a rare  extreme red flag  warning for wildfires 
 I don t know if I ve ever seen us use this warning   said NWS forecaster Marc Chenard   It s pretty bad  
The Santa Ana winds blowing westward off the desert and mountains into Los Angeles and Orange County are expected to reach sustained speeds of 50 to 70 mph Wednesday and into Thursday  Chenard said 
Firefighters got ready to do battle again after a day of light breezes that helped them gain ground against a blaze displacing thousands of Los Angeles residents near the Getty Center museum  Strike teams and equipment were posted on standy at strategic points throughout the state 
City arson investigators said on Tuesday the Getty fire was likely to have been caused by a broken tree branch being blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning 
Electricity remained cut off to roughly half a million homes and businesses in northern and central California on Tuesday as a precaution by the state s largest utility 
The NWS s Storm Prediction Center said that a critical or extreme fire danger existed for more than 34 000 square miles of California  encompassing some 21 million people 
Governor Gavin Newsom  who has accused utilities of failing to adequately modernize and safely maintain their power systems  paid a visit to the Getty fire zone on Tuesday afternoon 
 This is a challenging time   Newsom told reporters at a command center in the University of California s Los Angeles campus 
At the start of the day  firefighters in Los Angeles and those battling a much larger conflagration in northern California s Sonoma County wine country took advantage of lighter winds to make headway before hazardous winds reemerged 
Fire officials worried that high winds forecast to gust to 70 miles  113 km  per hour or more would lift embers from smoldering hot spots and carry them into unburned vegetation  re igniting and spreading flames anew 
Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said extremely high winds could also force water dropping helicopters  a vital component of the firefighting arsenal  to be grounded 
GAINING GROUND
An army of some 1 100 firefighters battled the Getty fire Tuesday in a narrow window of slower winds and consolidated those gains a day after flames and embers spread over scrub covered slopes around expensive homes on the city s west side 
By early Wednesday  crews had managed to confine the blaze to about 650 acres  263 hectares  while carving solid containment lines around 15  of its perimeter 
In northern California  where firefighters struggled for a sixth day against a 76 000 acre blaze in Sonoma County s wine making region  high wind forecasts prompted Pacific Gas and Electric Co  N PCG  to impose a new round of blackouts for nearly 600 000 homes and business 
That included about 400 000 customers blacked out in a power shut off that PG E instituted days earlier  the company said 
Early Wednesday  PG E announced that it had restored about 73 percent of the 970 000 or so customers affected in earlier shutoffs 
Utilities serving Southern California s more highly urbanized areas have imposed smaller scale outages 
Announcing preliminary findings of its Getty fire investigation  the Los Angeles Fire Department said the blaze probably started when a tree branch snapped off in high winds landed on power lines  producing sparks and  arcing  that ignited nearby brush 
The lines  which are operated by the city s Department of Water and Power  DWP   remained intact  the statement said 
PG E has been implicated in the Sonoma County blaze  dubbed the Kincade fire  The utility acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire broke out near a damaged PG E transmission tower at about the time a live high voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned 
The company  whose mass power shutdowns have drawn harsh criticism from the governor  filed for bankruptcy in January  citing  30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 
Citing progress made against the Kincade fire  Newsom said the number of evacuees in northern California had diminished from 190 000 at the peak of that blaze to 130 000 on Tuesday 
Property losses from the Kincade  listed at 15  contained  were put at 189 homes and other structures  double Monday s tally 




The size of the Getty fire s evacuation zone was reduced by roughly 3 000 homes on Tuesday but residents of about 7 000 dwellings remained displaced  fire officials said  At least a dozen homes have been destroyed so far ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/california-firefighters-ready-for-battle-again-as-santa-ana-winds-whip-up-new-wildfires-2007526,2007526

175764,397280,SO,Saudi brokered deal to include Yemen s southern separatists in government   sources,news,"By Stephen Kalin
RIYADH  Reuters    A preliminary deal between Yemen s Saudi backed government and southern separatists to end a power struggle in Aden will see the separatists included in a new technocrat cabinet and both sides  forces placed under government control  sources said 
The Saudi brokered arrangement  an advanced version of which was seen by Reuters  is expected to be announced in coming days at a Riyadh ceremony attended by Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 
While the UAE backed Southern  NYSE SO  Transition Council  STC  has a rival agenda to Hadi s government   demanding self rule in the south   they are both part of the Western backed coalition that intervened in 2015 after the Iran aligned Houthi movement ousted Hadi from the capital Sanaa 
The two sides fell out in August  with the separatists seizing Aden and trying to extend their reach in the south  The fighting opened a new front in Yemen s multi faceted war and complicated U N  peace efforts 
Under the deal  a new cabinet comprising 12 ministers each from the north and south should be formed within 30 days  according to the preliminary agreement and a Saudi official who briefed reporters late on Friday 
A source familiar with the agreement and a foreign diplomat said the STC would have some seats for the first time  but no specific portfolios have been reserved  indicating that key details remain to be worked out 
According to the arrangement  all troops that entered Aden  Abyan and Shabwa after Aug  1 should leave within 15 days to locations determined by the coalition  Medium and heavy weapons are to be placed in a coalition controlled military camp 
Security forces from all sides will come under the interior ministry and military troops under the defense ministry  Police and general security will take control of Aden 
The Saudi led coalition will head a joint committee to monitor implementation 
 It s not easy to implement but we are serious about implementing it on the ground   said the Saudi official  speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement 
Yemen s information minister tweeted on Saturday that the agreement had been  initialed  and would be officially signed within two days 
MESSAGE TO HOUTHIS
Resolving the power struggle in the south and easing Houthi Saudi tensions would aid U N  efforts to restart peace talks to end Yemen s five year war  which has killed tens of thousands in one of the world s poorest countries 
The Saudi official said the deal would  send a strong message to the Houthis and the Yemenis that Saudi Arabia is in Yemen not to control territory or to take its gas and oil  but to support the state  its institutions  its unity and to target Al Qaeda and Daesh  Islamic State  and eliminate Iranian intervention in Yemen  
Saudi Arabia has been trying to refocus the coalition on fighting the Houthis on its southern border  The group has repeatedly launched missiles and drone strikes against Saudi cities during the conflict  widely seen as a proxy war with Iran 
Saudi forces took control of Aden after Emirati troops withdrew last week as the UAE  Riyadh s main coalition partner  scales down its presence in Yemen 
The Saudi official said Abu Dhabi had  supported  and  played a role  in recent mediation efforts  without providing details 
He said the power sharing deal was  an opportunity for the Houthis to see that Saudi Arabia would like to be a peacemaker in Yemen    while Iran is trying to escalate the situation in the region

175768,397284,SO,Netanyahu says Iran seeking means to attack Israel from Yemen,news,"By Dan Williams  NYSE WMB 
JERUSALEM  Reuters    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran on Monday of seeking the means to launch precision guided missiles at Israel from Yemen  a signal that the war torn Gulf Arab country could come under pre emptive Israeli attack 
Netanyahu made his allegations  which were short on details  as he hosted a senior U S  delegation and following days of unusually voluble warnings in Israel that war could break out with Iran or its allies on more than one front 
Neither Iran nor the Yemeni Houthi fighters it sponsors had an immediate response to Israel s allegation  The Houthis use missiles and drones in their war against a coalition led by neighboring Saudi Arabia but there is scant public indication they possess weapons capable of traveling the some 2 000 km  1 240 miles  to Israel 
 Iran wants to develop precision guided missiles that can hit any target in Israel within five to ten meters   Netanyahu said in a speech in Jerusalem 
 Iran hopes to use Iran  Iraq  Syria  Lebanon and Yemen as bases to attack Israel with statistical missiles and precision guided missiles  That is a great  great danger   he said 
Earlier  addressing reporters ahead of meetings with U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top White House adviser Jared Kushner  Netanyahu reiterated Israeli suspicions  shared by Washington  that Iran has been trying to refit the rocket arsenal of Lebanon s Hezbollah with precision guidance systems 
 They seek also to develop that  and have already begun to put that in Yemen  with the goal of reaching Israel from there too   said Netanyahu  who has urged the Trump administration to step up sanctions on the Iranians over their nuclear program and regional activities 
Aides would not elaborate on whether Netanyahu  in his remarks with Mnuchin at his side  meant to say that missile conversion facilities were being installed in Yemen or that missiles capable of reaching Israel were already there 
An Israeli government source held out the prospect that Israel could take action   This will cause Israel to be extremely vulnerable and this is something that we cannot just sit by and watch happening   the source said 
With Israel in political deadlock after inconclusive elections in April and last month  Netanyahu has cited growing security concerns in urging his strongest rival  ex general Benny Gantz  to form a broad coalition government 
 This is not a spin  this is not a line  this is a real thing that is happening as the power balance in the Middle East changes   Netanyahu said   We need a national unity government  
Israel s armed forces chief briefed Gantz about regional threats on Oct 16 and  last week  issued a public statement describing Israel s northern and southern fronts as  tense and fragile and  liable to  deteriorate into conflict  
When Israel refers to its northern front  it means Lebanon and more easterly Syria   Southern  NYSE SO  front  usually refers to the Gaza Strip  in the southwest  where Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants receive Iranian funds  Yemen is to Israel s southeast

175778,397294,SO,Southern First  SFST  To Report Q2 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Southern  NYSE SO  First  SFST  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for Southern First Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7  
Revenues are expected to be  19 42 million  up 11 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern First 
For Southern First  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern First will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern First would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern First doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southern-first-sfst-to-report-q2-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200443277,200443277
175784,397300,SO,Horse racing  Breeders  Cup trainers confident in safety of Santa Anita,news,"By Rory Carroll
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Leading trainers competing at next month s Breeders  Cup are confident that Santa Anita will be safe for their horses despite a surge of deaths at the famed Southern  NYSE SO  California racetrack since December 
Thirty four horses have perished at the Stronach Group owned venue over the past 11 months with the latest being three year old gelding Satchel Paige on Saturday 
Santa Anita earlier this year hired a consultant to study the track surface and the California Horse Racing Board also investigated but the exact cause of the spate of fatalities remains unknown 
Asked by Reuters if he or any of the owners he works for were hesitant to compete at Santa Anita  Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert said  not really  
 It was tough on everybody but I really feel that hasn t even crossed any of my clients  minds   he said on a call with reporters on Wednesday 
 We changed some things here for the better  The surface    they are working on that 
 I think it was a wake up moment for racing  We need to do a better job and I think trainers and everybody involved are being more conscientious than before   said Baffert  a 15 time winner who has earned a total of  28 8 million at the annual  two day event 
In light of the fatalities  the Stronach Group and state regulators have instituted reforms at the venue including placing strict limits on the use of any pain or anti inflammatory medication and treatment  which can mask injuries 
Whips will still be permitted at this year s Breeders  Cup although a whipping ban has been proposed by the California Racing Board 
 It has been concerning for sure watching from afar on the east coast   trainer Chad Brown said 
 I ve been keeping a close eye on it     but  ultimately I didn t avoid running any horses at the Breeders  Cup due to this issue 
 We feel confident in Santa Anita s management that the track will be safe and I support everything they ve been doing to try to improve the situation  
Baffert said he believes the races  which are expected to draw protesters  will put horse racing and Santa Anita in a positive light 
 Everything is going to be good  We re going to get some good  positive vibes out of this whole thing

175787,397303,SO,Democratic senator asks whether Trump interfered with court case on Turkey s Halkbank,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A top Democratic senator on Thursday questioned whether President Donald Trump interfered with a criminal investigation of Turkey s Halkbank  which has been accused of conspiring to evade U S  sanctions against Iran 
Oregon Senator Ron Wyden  the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee  wrote to U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking if Trump or anyone acting on the president s behalf had asked Mnuchin to  handle  intervene  or otherwise engage with Turkish concerns related to Halkbank  or with Halkbank generally  
Wyden said he was launching an investigation to examine the relationship between Halkbank and Trump administration officials  The letter cited an Oct  16 Bloomberg report that Trump told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in April that Mnuchin and U S  Attorney General William Barr would handle the Halkbank issue 
Wyden said he expected an answer by Nov  20 
U S  federal prosecutors in Manhattan earlier this month charged Turkey s second largest state bank with fraud and money laundering  among other sanctions related offenses  using sham food and gold transactions to get around U S  sanctions 
Halkbank has denied the charges 
The U S  court case has further strained tensions between Turkey and the United States  which have been at odds over a number of issues  including Ankara s Syria incursion and purchase of a Russian missile defense system 
The charges against Halkbank are the latest development in a U S  criminal case that became public in 2016 with the arrest in Miami of Reza Zarrab  a Turkish Iranian gold trader accused of playing a central role in the sanctions evasion scheme 
Mehmet Hakan Atilla  a Halkbank deputy general manager  was arrested in New York the following year  He was sentenced to 32 months in prison following his conviction and was released and returned to Turkey earlier this year 
Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for U S  prosecutors at Atilla s trial 
Before pleading guilty  Zarrab hired Rudy Giuliani  a longtime associate of Trump  to try to negotiate a deal between the U S  and Turkish governments to secure his release 
Zarrab said that Iran  with the help of Halkbank and Turkish government officials  including Erdogan  used a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold  food and medicine to get around U S  sanctions 
Turkish officials raised Halkbank in their discussions with American counterparts last week  U S  Vice President Mike Pence told a press conference in Ankara following the talks  which were focused on Syria 
Pence said the Turks were told this was a matter for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  whose prosecutors brought the criminal case

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern National Bancorp 
For Southern National Bancorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern National Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern National Bancorp would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of  12 12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern National Bancorp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-southern-national-bancorp-sona-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200441368,200441368

175814,397330,SO,Wildfire threatens homes  prompts evacuations in California,news,"By Gene Blevins
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A wildfire raced up a steep hillside to threaten scores of homes in the Los Angeles coastal enclave of Pacific Palisades on Monday  prompting evacuations as water dropping helicopters and firefighters swarmed the area to battle the flames 
Live aerial video footage broadcast by KABC TV showed tall flames raging along a ridge line at the edge of a neighborhood  burning perilously close to several homes as authorities urged residents to flee 
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said on the broadcast that winds were relatively light  helping to keep the blaze in check by reducing the amount of burning embers blown into the air 
Still a pall of thick white and brown smoke was visible for miles around the fire  which scorched an estimated 30 acres of steep slopes thick with dry brush and chaparral 
Large  repeated water drops from helicopters kept the fire from advancing into a neighborhood closest to the flames  and the fire appeared to have been largely subdued within an hour  with no injuries or serious property damage reported 
Initially  a mandatory evacuation was ordered for about 200 homes  as ground teams and helicopters worked on putting out hot spots and carving containment line around the fire zone s perimeter 
However  at around 8 p m   0300 GMT   the Los Angeles Fire Department said   all evacuation orders have been lifted from the Palisades fire  residents in the impacted area can return home  
 Everyone in high fire danger areas should be cautious and ready to quickly evacuate   it added 
Earlier  residents who had been trying to help douse the blaze with garden hoses from their backyards were seen scrambling for cover at one point when a large clump of vegetation burst into heavy flames 
The blaze in Pacific Palisades  located between Santa Monica and Malibu about 18 miles  29 km  west of downtown Los Angeles  came about two weeks after a major wind driven wildfire scorched nearly 8 000 acres  3 200 hectares  along the northern edge of Los Angeles  damaging or destroying dozens of structures and prompting evacuations of some 23 000 homes 
Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Butler said forecasts called for strong  dry Santa Ana winds to return Southern  NYSE SO  California on Thursday

175822,397338,SO,U S  lawmakers  others condemn Trump for  lynching  comment on impeachment probe,news,"By Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump on Tuesday again waded into America s fraught racial history by labeling the impeachment inquiry against him a  lynching    language that conjured memories of decades of killings of thousands of black people   drawing swift bipartisan condemnation   All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here   a lynching  But we will WIN   Trump wrote on Twitter  referring to the impeachment inquiry  in the Democratic led House of Representatives focusing on his request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival  Democrat Joe Biden  Lynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans  most of them black  between the 1880s and 1960s  as African Americans struggled for their rights as U S  citizens in the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern  NYSE SO  states fought in vain to maintain black slavery   The president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history  It s irresponsible for him to do so  and I hope that he will apologize   said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries  who is black  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  a Republican  said   Given the history in our country  I would not compare this to a lynching  That was an unfortunate choice of words   McConnell added that he viewed the House inquiry as  an unfair process  that is denying Trump  procedural safeguards   Democrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of stoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely white core of conservative Republican voters  noting his comment in 2017 that there were  very fine people on both sides  at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville  Virginia in which a counter protester was killed  Some Republican allies agreed with Trump s use of the word lynching   It shows a lot of things about our national media  When it s about Trump  who cares about the process  as long as you get him  So  yeah  this is a lynching in every sense  This is un American   Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  whose home state of South Carolina has a large black population  told reporters  Trump has a long and controversial history on race including decades old allegations of discrimination in his family s real estate business  He also championed the death penalty for five black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1989 in New York s Central Park  used an expletive to describe African countries in 2018  and singled out black athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the national anthem while protesting racial inequity   HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES  Trump s lynching comment was immediately condemned by critics as unbecoming of a president   For him to say something like that was disgusting  reflects his insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this country   said Representative Barbara Lee  who said she was not surprised or shocked by Trump s comments but  just very  very disappointed    For Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a lynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black people lynched   murdered   throughout our nation s history in acts of racism and hatred   said Karen Baynes Dunning  interim president of the Southern Poverty Law Center  which advocates for equal opportunity and fights bigotry   The impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump s request during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival  former vice president Joe Biden  Biden is a leading contender to become the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump  Biden said on Twitter that Trump s use of the word was  abhorrent  and  despicable   Biden  however  said in 1998 the impeachment of President Bill Clinton could be seen as a  partisan lynching   Biden apologized in a tweet late on Tuesday  saying it  wasn t the right word to use and I m sorry about that   Senator

175843,397359,SO,Former congressman subpoenaed over interactions with Giuliani  WSJ,news,"By Jan Wolfe
 Reuters    A grand jury has issued a subpoena related to an investigation by federal prosecutors into President Donald Trump s lawyer Rudy Giuliani  seeking documents from former U S  Representative Pete Sessions about his dealings with the former New York mayor and associates  the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday 
Citing people familiar with the matter  the Wall Street Journal reported that Giuliani is the primary focus of the subpoena  which seeks documents related to his business dealings with Ukraine and his involvement in efforts to oust the U S  ambassador in Kiev 
Several media have reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Giuliani s actions regarding Ukraine as part of a case involving two of his business associates  Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman 
The two men  who helped Giuliani investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden and his businessman son Hunter  were arrested last week over what prosecutors called a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro Trump election committee and other political candidates 
There is no indication that Sessions  a longtime friend of Giuliani  is a target of the investigation  the Wall Street Journal reported 
Sessions spokesman Matt Mackowiak confirmed to Reuters that he was cooperating with federal prosecutors 
 Mr  Sessions is cooperating with the U S  Attorney from the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York and will be providing documents to their office related to this matter over the next couple of weeks as requested   Mackowiak said 
He would not comment on the content of the subpoena 
Asked about the reports of a federal investigation  Giuliani told Reuters   I never did any lobbying for anyone  If they want to ask me I m happy to prove it  But they haven t  ",2019-10-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/former-congressman-subpoenaed-over-interactions-with-giuliani-wsj-1996809,1996809
175844,397360,SO,Trump ex Russia adviser Fiona Hill testifies in impeachment inquiry,news,"By Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Donald Trump s former Russia adviser testified for more than nine hours on Monday behind closed doors  the latest witness summoned in the impeachment inquiry against the U S  president over his request that Ukraine investigate a political rival 
The Democrats  rapidly progressing inquiry could prompt the House of Representatives to approve articles of impeachment   formal charges   leading to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office 
Fiona Hill  former senior director for European and Russian Affairs on Trump s National Security Council  recounted a July 10 meeting in Washington that she attended with senior Ukrainian and U S  officials  including U S  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland  according to a person familiar with her testimony 
Hill said Sondland raised the matter of investigations  which she and others took as a reference to a probe into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter  who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company  said the person  who spoke on condition of anonymity 
Alarmed at what she heard  Hill said she left the meeting and was advised to see National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg  the person said 
Hill said Sondland appeared to be coordinating with Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  the person said 
The meeting happened about two weeks before a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against the Bidens  the call at the center of the investigations 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin told reporters Hill  who spoke to the House Intelligence Committee and two other panels   was a remarkably thorough and authoritative witness  who recalled  particular events and particular meetings  
As they have done in the past  Republican lawmakers who have shown little inclination to remove Trump complained that the hearings were closed to the public and that transcripts were not being released 
The pace of the House Democrats  investigation quickened on Monday as they lined up additional witnesses to testify in closed sessions 
Michael McKinley has agreed to appear voluntarily for a closed transcribed interview on Wednesday  just days after he announced his resignation as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
Also  a person familiar with the proceedings confirmed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper would be interviewed by the committees on Friday 
Trump has denied wrongdoing in his dealings with Ukraine 
Adding to the almost dizzying number of developments  the Wall Street Journal reported federal investigators for at least the past couple of months have been questioning witnesses as they look into Rudy Giuliani s business dealings in Ukraine  Giuliani has been acting as Trump s personal lawyer 
Justice Department officials in Washington referred a request for comment to the U S  District Court in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  where a spokesman declined to comment 
Giuliani faces a Tuesday deadline to produce documents related to the Ukraine matter subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee  He has not said whether he will comply 
The former New York mayor has defended his actions as proper in his role as Trump s lawyer 
 UNFOUNDED  FALSE CLAIMS 
The Trump administration s removal in May of Marie Yovanovitch as U S  ambassador to Ukraine may have figured in Hill s testimony 
On Friday  Yovanovitch testified she had been ousted based on  unfounded and false claims  after coming under attack by Giuliani  Giuliani had been working to get Ukraine to investigate Biden  a former vice president and contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election 
Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U S  ally to dig up dirt on a domestic rival after withholding  391 million in U S  security aid  Zelenskiy agreed to investigate and Trump eventually allowed the aid 
The British born Hill  who left her White House job shortly before the July 25 call but remained on the payroll into August  had advocated a tough U S  approach on Moscow even as Trump was more accommodating toward Russian President Vladimir Putin 
The White House demanded Hill limit her testimony to the contents of the July 25 telephone call and warned she could not discuss internal deliberations or diplomatic communications about the conversation  according to a letter dated Monday from a White House lawyer to Hill s attorney that was seen by Reuters 
In the letter to attorney Lee Wolosky  White House Deputy Counsel Michael Purpura cited the doctrine of executive privilege  which is intended to protect communications between the president and close advisers to ensure candid  private advice 
Purpura acknowledged that because Trump released the summary of his call with Zelenskiy  it was not covered by executive privilege  But  he wrote  Trump had not waived executive privilege applying to internal deliberations surrounding the call or to other classified materials 
Representatives for Wolosky and the White House did not immediately respond to a requests for comment on the letter 
On Thursday  committees are scheduled to receive testimony from Sondland  the U S  ambassador to the EU 
Sondland  a Trump backer and not a career diplomat  participated in a text message exchange with Bill Taylor  the top U S  diplomat in Ukraine  Democrats say it reveals concern among aides that Trump s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden was improper 
Sondland is expected to be asked why he relayed from Trump to other diplomats that the president said no  quid pro quos  connecting the Biden investigation with the U S  aid  Quid pro quo is a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor 
WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIMONY
As talks continue over whether the whistleblower from within the U S  intelligence community who prompted the inquiry will testify  Trump weighed in on Twitter  demanding the person testify and the individual s identity be revealed 
Negotiations between representatives for the whistleblower and congressional committees were deadlocked over Senate Intelligence Committee requests that the individual provide testimony in person  while the House committees were willing to exchange questions and answers in writing  according to two people familiar with the negotiations 
The House panels also are scheduled this week to hear from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl  a top aide to Pompeo 
Lawmakers also may debate whether to seek to compel testimony from Giuliani  On Thursday  two Giuliani associates   Ukraine born Lev Parnas and Belarus born Igor Fruman   who helped him with his efforts to investigate the Bidens   were charged with scheming to violate U S  campaign finance laws ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-exrussia-adviser-fiona-hill-testifies-in-impeachment-inquiry-1996916,1996916
175845,397361,SO,Yemeni government  separatists seen inking deal to end Aden standoff this week,news,"DUBAI  Reuters    Yemen s Saudi backed government and southern separatists are expected on Thursday to announce a deal to end a power struggle in the southern port of Aden that fractured an Arab coalition battling the Iran aligned Houthi group  officials said 
The UAE backed separatist Southern  NYSE SO  Transition Council is nominally allied to the Saudi backed government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi  but the two sides fell out in August  with the separatists seizing control of Aden 
Saudi Arabia has hosted indirect talks between them to rebuild the coalition fighting against the Iran aligned Houthi movement that expelled Hadi s government from the capital Sanaa five years ago 
Fighting between pro Hadi forces and the separatists had opened a new front in the multi faceted war and complicated United Nations peace efforts 
Riyadh has been trying to refocus the coalition on fighting the Houthis on its border  The Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drone strikes against Saudi cities during the conflict  widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran 
Two officials in Hadi s government told Reuters the pact to end the Aden standoff would be signed in Riyadh on Thursday 
STC leader Aidarous al Zubaidi  who has been involved in the month long talks in the Red Sea city of Jeddah  headed to Riyadh on Wednesday  according to a post on his Twitter account 
The deal calls for a government reshuffle to include STC  which seeks self rule in the south  and the restructuring of armed forces under Saudi supervision  they said 
Saudi forces took control of Aden after Emirati troops withdrew last week  The move seemingly paved the way for ending the crisis that had exposed differences between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over how to proceed in the wider war that has been in military stalemate for years 
The UAE already scaled down its presence in Yemen in June as Western pressure mounted to end the conflict that has pushed millions to the brink of famine  But Abu Dhabi retains influence through thousands of Yemeni troops it armed and trained 
Hadi s government has asked the UAE to stop supporting STC  Abu Dhabi criticized Hadi s government as ineffective and distrusts Islamists with whom he is allied 
Resolving the power struggle in the south and easing Houthi Saudi tensions would aid U N  efforts to restart peace talks to end the war that has killed tens of thousands 
The Houthis last month offered to stop missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia if the coalition ended air strikes on Yemen  Riyadh has said it views the offer  positively  
The group  which controls Sanaa and most big urban centers  extended the offer after claiming responsibility for a Sept  14 assault on Saudi oil processing facilities  Riyadh rejected the Houthi claim of responsibility and blames Iran for the attacks  a charge Tehran rejects 
The Houthis deny being puppets of Iran and say they are fighting a corrupt system  pointing to the standoff in Aden as proof Hadi is unfit to rule ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/yemeni-government-separatists-seen-inking-deal-to-end-aden-standoff-this-week-1996923,1996923
175846,397362,SO,UAW  GM leaders have a deal to end strike  now workers will decide,news,"By Ben Klayman DETROIT  Reuters    General Motors Co  NYSE GM  and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday for a new four year labor deal  moving closer to ending a costly month long strike that shut down GM s most profitable factories in a test of wills over the future of U S  auto industry jobs  Neither the UAW nor GM released details of the deal  which is subject to ratification by UAW members  a process that could last up to two weeks  A new contract is expected to include commitments by the automaker to invest billions in U S  vehicle factories to build new generations of electric vehicles  as well as U S  electric vehicle battery plants  Union leaders worry that a shift to electric vehicles could cost thousands of jobs at engine and transmission factories  The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event  Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines  eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states  For his part  U S  President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown  Ohio  that she had targeted for closure  Trump spoke individually with Barra and UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday  spokesmen for GM and the union confirmed  The White House declined to comment on the discussions  Details of GM s last offer emerged over the weekend and Reuters had reported that the company boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about  9 billion from its previous offer of  7 billion  That figure is unchanged in the final agreement  a person briefed on the matter said   The deal also would create or retain 9 000 UAW jobs  a  substantial  number of which will be new  the source said  GM in September said its initial offer would support 5 400 jobs   and a majority of those would be new jobs  If the contract is ratified  UAW workers who have been living on  250 a week in strike pay are expected to get one time signing bonuses  as well as increases to base pay  The union had also pushed for temporary workers at GM plants who earned less than permanent UAW employees to get an easier path to full time wages and benefits  GM shares closed 1 1  higher at  36 65 on Wednesday after rising as much as 2 6  during the day  Shares of some auto parts suppliers also rose after the UAW announced the tentative deal  The cost of the strike   and how quickly those costs can be recovered   will be a focus for investors as the automaker and its major suppliers report quarterly results over the next several days   Analysts have estimated the strike cost GM more than  2 billion in lost production  though some of that could be made up through overtime work  The strike halted production of GM s large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles   key drivers of the company s global profit   POLITICAL EVENT The deal is not done yet  The union s national GM council will decide whether to accept the agreement during a meeting on Thursday  Then UAW members at GM will vote on the agreement  The strike continues at least until Thursday s meeting  the UAW said in a statement  The strike began on Sept  16  with about 48 000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay  greater job security  a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits  Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close  and the use of temporary workers  GM s revised offer that emerged over the weekend also included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by  1 000 to  9 000  GM also proposed 3  pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four year contract and 3  and 4  lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively  It agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent and give those workers a  3 000 ratification bonus  The final agreement is similar to that offer on pay and bonuses  but includes some enhancements  the person briefed on the matter said  The automaker said during the talks that it had offered  solutions  for the Lordstown assembly plant and a large assembly plant in Detroit Hamtramck that were targeted for closure  A group affiliated with electric truck maker Workhorse Group had proposed acquiring the Lordstown plant  GM also said it had proposed a  union represented battery cell manufacturing site in the U S   GM was considering using the Detroit Hamtramck factory to build a new line of electric trucks  sources said   These proposals could have changed or been dropped in the final days of the talks  If the deal is approved by the workers  the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  FCA   covering many of the same issues  The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM  A successful ratification is not a sure thing as workers during the 2015 talks initially rejected a deal with FCA before eventually approving a revised offer  SHARING THE REWARDS  This year s talks have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union   For GM and the UAW  the bargaining came at a time of industry uncertainty following nine years of strong sales and robust profit  fueled by the trucks and SUVs built by UAW workers  GM s Barra and President Mark Reuss joined the bargaining on Tuesday  indicating a deal was close  Union leaders said the rewards of GM s recovery from its 2009 bankruptcy had not been shared fairly  Inflation adjusted wages for all U S  auto workers have fallen 16  since 2010  and UAW workers at the Detroit Three have received only two base wage increases of 3  in the past nine years  according to CAR  
GM management  on the other hand  sees UAW wages as 26  higher than the average for non union auto factories in the Southern  NYSE SO  United States  High absenteeism and rich health benefits add to the cost burdens at a time when U S  vehicle sales are projected to decline and automakers are funding investments in electric vehicles ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/gm-uaw-reach-tentative-deal-to-end-strike-1997392,1997392
175847,397363,SO,EU criticizes  unlevel playing field  in Mozambique election,news,"MAPUTO  Reuters    A European Union observer mission to Mozambique s election raised the alarm on Thursday over unfair conditions and unjustified use of state resources by the ruling party  as well as widespread violence 
Results are not in yet from Tuesday s presidential  legislative and provincial poll  But its outcome will test a fragile peace deal between the ruling Frelimo party and its old civil war foe turned opposition rival Renamo 
Any reports of irregularities or fraud are likely to put the two month old agreement at risk 
 An unlevel playing field was evident throughout the campaign   the EU mission said in a statement   The ruling party dominated the campaign in all provinces and benefited from     incumbency  including unjustified use of state resources  and more police escorts and media coverage than opponents  
The election is widely expected to return President Filipe Nyusi to power  and extend his party s decades long rule over a southern African nation set to become one of the world s main gas exporters 
Very few results have yet trickled out  although an official at the electoral commission said they may start coming out on Friday    the law allows 15 days in total after the vote 
Under the peace deal  Renamo will be able to choose governors for the first time in any provinces it wins  instead of them being appointed by the central government in Maputo  Yet there are fears of unrest if it fails to win any 
The electoral campaign has already been marred by violence 
 Inter party violence was prevalent as well as mistrust between the main political parties and a lack of confidence that the electoral administration      was  independent   the EU said  adding that there was also little public trust in the independence of the police 
The run up to the vote was marred by sporadic violence  including the killing of an election observer and attacks from a breakaway group of Renamo fighters  with one person reported killed 
African observer missions were more sanguine  with both the African Union team lead by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and the Southern  NYSE SO  Africa bloc SADC praising the poll for being peaceful and well organized 
 We commend  the electoral commission  and the state for conducting successful  peaceful and orderly elections   SADC mission chief Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri told journalists 
 Parties and people must be patient and remain committed to Peace as the results are being compiled for validation   said Muchinguri Kashiri  who is Zimbabwe s defense minister 
The former rebel movement Renamo seeks to control its traditional heartlands in central and northern provinces but it faces the waning popularity of its candidate  Ossufo Momade  and a challenge from younger opposition party  the MDM 
Momade warned against any manipulation of the results on Tuesday ",2019-10-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/eu-criticizes-unlevel-playing-field-in-mozambique-election-1998367,1998367

175874,397390,SO,The migrant caravans  A common road toward different fates,news,"By Mica Rosenberg  Delphine Schrank and Kristina Cooke
 Reuters    The images were dramatic  Central American migrants moving northward en masse through Mexico   men  women and children walking up to 30 miles a day  some hitching rides or catching freight trains 
The caravans of 2018 and early 2019 were not the first of their kind   but they were  all told  the largest and most visible  gaining attention and size partly because U S  President Donald Trump repeatedly warned of their approach 
The first major wave started small in spring 2018  in southern Mexico  as migrants on separate journeys gradually coalesced  seeking safety in numbers and guidance from a nonprofit group on the route  Within days  hundreds became more than a thousand  Filthy  dehydrated and exhausted  they arrived in Oaxaca state  spilling into a tiny town square where they paused to rest 
Only a fraction of them that spring made it the rest of the way  A couple hundred migrants crossed the border near Tijuana to seek asylum 
But the appeal of caravans grew as word spread about them through Central American neighborhoods  social media and WhatsApp  In October  a group formed in Honduras ballooned to 7 000 or more by the time it reached southern Mexico  its numbers boosted by TV coverage  Participants called it  the exodus   Trump called it an  invasion    a term that would resonate before and after the U S  mid term elections   
 Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern  NYSE SO  Border   he tweeted in October   Please go back  you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process  This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you  
Where Trump and many of his supporters saw a security threat  many migrant advocates saw a humanitarian crisis  the result of violence  persecution and poverty in migrants  homelands  
The caravans poured fuel on the fierce political debate over which  and how many  immigrants ought to be allowed into the United States  That debate has only escalated in the run up to the 2020 elections  as Trump seeks to keep his core promise to literally wall off the border to migrants 
But in the months since the largest caravans reached the U S  border and dispersed  public attention has mostly moved past them and the migrants who took part 
Reuters  journalists  who followed the caravans on the ground from their inception  continued to keep track of migrants to see where  and how  they ended up  Facing an increasingly complex and shifting constellation of U S  policies aimed at reducing immigration  many landed in uncertain territory  Many remain there 
Reuters chose to profile six migrants from three Central American countries  based largely on their varying backgrounds   male and female  young and older  gay and straight  Reporters  photographers and videographers followed them though detentions  deportations  family separations and course changes  as well as hopeful  if fragile  beginnings in the United States

175877,397393,SO,Aramco hopes to repair remaining damage from attacks by end November,news,"By Olesya Astakhova
KHURAIS FIELD  Saudi Arabia  Reuters    Oil major Saudi Aramco hopes to fix by the end of November the last four key pieces of equipment damaged during attacks last month  in a move to allow it to fully regain production capacity  company officials said on Saturday 
The mid September attacks on the Abqaiq and the Khurais plants caused damage that halved the crude output of the world s top oil exporter by shutting down 5 7 million bpd of production  driving a spike in oil prices 
Yemen s militant Houthi group claimed responsibility but a U S  official said the attacks originated from southwestern Iran and Riyadh blamed Tehran  Iran  which supports the Houthis in Yemen s war  has denied involvement 
Aramco restored oil production of around 10 million barrels per day within 10 days and said it was on track to regain its maximum capacity of 12 million bpd by the end of November 
Thousands of people have been working to restore full production of the key source of revenues for the kingdom  Saudi Arabia is preparing to float a small stake in Aramco this or next year in one of the world s biggest share sales ever 
At Abqaiq  the attacks hit five oil processing towers and three were still being restored  Khalid Buraik  vice president of Aramco s Southern  NYSE SO  Area Oil Operations  told several media invited to the facilities on Saturday  Abqaiq is the world s biggest oil processing facility and has 18 towers 
Buraik said he expected the three towers to be fully repaired within six weeks 
The attacks on Khurais damaged four of five towers  Three had been repaired  said a local senior manager who asked not to be named because he is not allowed to speak to media 
Khurais can process around 1 5 million bpd of crude and Abqaiq around 7 million  though it usually works well below its capacity at around 5 million 
Aramco s current crude oil production capacity stands at 11 3 million bpd  Saudi officials have said  some 0 7 million below the normal level  The kingdom produces just under 10 million bpd as it caps its output as part of an OPEC agreement ",2019-10-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/aramco-hopes-to-repair-remaining-damage-from-attacks-by-endnovember-1995484,1995484

175880,397396,SO,Saudis take control of Yemen s Aden to end stand off between allies,news,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI  Reuters    Saudi Arabian forces have taken over control of Yemen s southern port of Aden as part of efforts to end a power struggle between the Saudi backed Yemeni government and southern separatists  four sources familiar with the matter said 
Last week the United Arab Emirates  Riyadh s main partner in a Saudi led coalition battling Yemen s Houthi group  started withdrawing troops from Aden  seemingly to pave the way for a deal to end the local standoff 
The UAE backed separatists are part of the Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to try to restore the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi  which was ousted from the capital  Sanaa  in 2014 by the Houthis  who are aligned with Iran 
The Yemen conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran  The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system 
In August  the separatist Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC   which seeks self rule in the south  turned on Hadi s government and seized its interim base of Aden  sparking wider clashes that opened a new front in the war 
Saudi Arabia has in the past week deployed more forces to replace Emirati troops at Aden airport and military bases in the city  two Yemeni officials told Reuters 
An official handover to a Saudi commander took place last week under which he would oversee security in the city and its suburbs  two other sources familiar with the matter said 
The coalition spokesman and the Emirati government did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Saudi Arabia has been hosting indirect talks for a month between Hadi s government and separatist leaders  Sources had said the two sides were close to agreeing a Saudi proposal to give the STC seats in the cabinet and place separatist forces under government command 
Hadi s government has asked the UAE to stop arming and training separatist forces while the UAE has said Hadi s government is ineffective and distrusts Islamists with whom he is allied 
Saudi Arabia may have decided to unify the forces behind Hadi before responding to an offer by the Houthis to stop aiming missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia if the coalition halts air strikes on Yemen 
Iran  which Saudi Arabia blames for an attack on its oil facilities claimed by the Houthis  has said it views the Houthi offer  positively  
Progress on both tracks would boost United Nations efforts to restart peace talks  The war has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine 
The UAE was already scaling down its presence in Yemen as Western allies  some of which provide the coalition with arms and intelligence  pressed for an end to the war  and as tension with Iran grew ",2019-10-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/saudis-take-control-of-yemens-aden-to-end-standoff-between-allies-1995799,1995799
175881,397397,SO,Trump ex Russia adviser Fiona Hill testifies in impeachment inquiry,news,"By Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Donald Trump s former Russia adviser testified for more than nine hours on Monday behind closed doors  the latest witness summoned in the impeachment inquiry against the U S  president over his request that Ukraine investigate a political rival 
The Democrats  rapidly progressing inquiry could prompt the House of Representatives to approve articles of impeachment   formal charges   leading to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office 
Fiona Hill  former senior director for European and Russian Affairs on Trump s National Security Council  recounted a July 10 meeting in Washington that she attended with senior Ukrainian and U S  officials  including U S  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland  according to a person familiar with her testimony 
Hill said Sondland raised the matter of investigations  which she and others took as a reference to a probe into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter  who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company  said the person  who spoke on condition of anonymity 
Alarmed at what she heard  Hill said she left the meeting and was advised to see National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg  the person said 
Hill said Sondland appeared to be coordinating with Mick Mulvaney  the acting White House chief of staff  the person said 
The meeting happened about two weeks before a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against the Bidens  the call at the center of the investigations 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin told reporters Hill  who spoke to the House Intelligence Committee and two other panels   was a remarkably thorough and authoritative witness  who recalled  particular events and particular meetings  
As they have done in the past  Republican lawmakers who have shown little inclination to remove Trump complained that the hearings were closed to the public and that transcripts were not being released 
The pace of the House Democrats  investigation quickened on Monday as they lined up additional witnesses to testify in closed sessions 
Michael McKinley has agreed to appear voluntarily for a closed transcribed interview on Wednesday  just days after he announced his resignation as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
Also  a person familiar with the proceedings confirmed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper would be interviewed by the committees on Friday 
Trump has denied wrongdoing in his dealings with Ukraine 
Adding to the almost dizzying number of developments  the Wall Street Journal reported federal investigators for at least the past couple of months have been questioning witnesses as they look into Rudy Giuliani s business dealings in Ukraine  Giuliani has been acting as Trump s personal lawyer 
Justice Department officials in Washington referred a request for comment to the U S  District Court in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  where a spokesman declined to comment 
Giuliani faces a Tuesday deadline to produce documents related to the Ukraine matter subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee  He has not said whether he will comply 
The former New York mayor has defended his actions as proper in his role as Trump s lawyer 
 UNFOUNDED  FALSE CLAIMS 
The Trump administration s removal in May of Marie Yovanovitch as U S  ambassador to Ukraine may have figured in Hill s testimony 
On Friday  Yovanovitch testified she had been ousted based on  unfounded and false claims  after coming under attack by Giuliani  Giuliani had been working to get Ukraine to investigate Biden  a former vice president and contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election 
Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U S  ally to dig up dirt on a domestic rival after withholding  391 million in U S  security aid  Zelenskiy agreed to investigate and Trump eventually allowed the aid 
The British born Hill  who left her White House job shortly before the July 25 call but remained on the payroll into August  had advocated a tough U S  approach on Moscow even as Trump was more accommodating toward Russian President Vladimir Putin 
The White House demanded Hill limit her testimony to the contents of the July 25 telephone call and warned she could not discuss internal deliberations or diplomatic communications about the conversation  according to a letter dated Monday from a White House lawyer to Hill s attorney that was seen by Reuters 
In the letter to attorney Lee Wolosky  White House Deputy Counsel Michael Purpura cited the doctrine of executive privilege  which is intended to protect communications between the president and close advisers to ensure candid  private advice 
Purpura acknowledged that because Trump released the summary of his call with Zelenskiy  it was not covered by executive privilege  But  he wrote  Trump had not waived executive privilege applying to internal deliberations surrounding the call or to other classified materials 
Representatives for Wolosky and the White House did not immediately respond to a requests for comment on the letter 
On Thursday  committees are scheduled to receive testimony from Sondland  the U S  ambassador to the EU 
Sondland  a Trump backer and not a career diplomat  participated in a text message exchange with Bill Taylor  the top U S  diplomat in Ukraine  Democrats say it reveals concern among aides that Trump s pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden was improper 
Sondland is expected to be asked why he relayed from Trump to other diplomats that the president said no  quid pro quos  connecting the Biden investigation with the U S  aid  Quid pro quo is a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor 
WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIMONY

175882,397398,SO,Oxford Industries  OXM  Beats Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Oxford Industries  OXM  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 28 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 56   A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of the Tommy Bahama  Lilly Pulitzer and Southern  NYSE SO  Tide clothing lines would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of 1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Oxford Industries  which belongs to the Zacks Textile   Apparel industry  posted revenues of  281 97 million for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 70   This compares to year ago revenues of  272 63 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Oxford Industries shares have lost about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for Oxford Industries 
While Oxford Industries has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Oxford Industries was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 93 on  312 28 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 56 on  1 15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

175883,397399,SO,Euro Area   At Inflection Point,opinion,"Recession risk remains low despite a tougher external environment  which will remain a defining feature for the growth outlook in the coming years  Expansionary fiscal policies and rising wages should support domestic demand 
Many fragilities are lingering in the background and labour market resilience is an important precondition for the expansion to continue 
Underlying inflation pressures continue to build  supporting a gradual uptrend 
We expect no ECB policy rate changes until the end of 2021 
Fires burning on many fronts 
Economic activity in Europe missed expectations in 2018  as a rougher external environment took its toll on the open euro area economy  While weaker external demand has been an important driver behind the slowdown  the euro area was also hurt by a number of sector  and country specific factors  These included the introduction of new emissions test standards that hit European carmakers  disruptions due to the French  gilet jaune  protests  political uncertainty in Italy on the back of the escalating budget fight and transport problems due to a low water level in the Rhine river 
Amid ongoing subdued readings in leading indicators  questions about an impeding recession have intensified  Although we expect the expansion pace in the euro area to slow down further in 2019  we still see the risk of an imminent recession as low  We expect a less favourable external environment will remain a defining feature for the growth outlook in the coming years  but many of the temporary factors will start or have already started to unwind and domestic demand remains an important backbone of the ongoing expansion  Hence  we expect the euro area economy to grow by 1 2  in 2019 and 1 4  in 2020  before moderating back to potential at 1 3  in 2021 
At the start of 2019  the quarterly growth pace already picked up some speed to 0 4  q q  but we remain sceptical that the economy can maintain its current momentum for the remainder of the year  as the export outlook remains cloudy  In 2020  the economic fundamentals should remain relatively firm  underpinned by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and a strong labour market  while the growth rate will also get an  artificial  boost from a larger number of working days in several countries 

  but expansion is not yet out of fuel
Since the beginning of 2013  private consumption has been the main driver of the recovery  Still  private consumption growth was slower than we previously expected as households responded to the growth moderation by increasing precautionary savings  while there were also some knock on effects from the car production issues mentioned above  That said  we still see scope for consumer spending growth to hold up in light of robust demand for credit  low borrowing costs and rising real wages amid abating inflation pressures  Expansionary fiscal measures in some countries should further contribute to disposable income growth  An important factor here remains the resilience of the labour market situation  Although we could see employment growth slowing somewhat in line with the slackening growth  we still expect the unemployment rate to reach 7 5  in 2020  with nominal wage growth at 2 3  remaining at the highest rate in 10 years 

The outlook for investments  on the other hand  remains more mixed  Investment spending so far has remained quite resilient to the manufacturing weakness  not least of all due to strong activity in the construction sector  Favourable financing conditions  high capacity utilisation  at 83  in Q1  and somewhat higher public investments should help underpin investment growth in our view  However  despite these positive factors  elevated global uncertainty  declining profit margins and lower sales expectations might induce firms to adopt a  wait and see  strategy  While the ongoing slowing of investment growth will take its toll on import growth  we still expect net exports to remain a drag on growth in light of the adverse global trade environment and a weaker growth outlook in key export markets  not least of all China  the US and Turkey 

Many fragilities lingering in the background
Although we think the expansion will continue  it remains a fragile one  with the euro area facing multiple headwinds  As mentioned above  the strength of the employment consumption relationship is an important factor underpinning domestic demand  However  strong wage growth is increasingly outpacing GDP growth  raising the risk that firms react by starting to cut staffing and thereby weaken the  motor of growth   From the external side  the biggest risk  in our view  stems from further escalation in the US China trade war and US tariffs on European car imports  which could further weigh on sentiment and investments  However  risks also loom from a disorderly Brexit and a re play of the Italian budget fight in the autumn spilling over to tighter financial conditions  Progress on reforms to strengthen the EMU has been disappointing so far and momentum is likely to remain lacklustre even after the EU parliamentary elections  leaving questions about how to address the next crisis 

Core inflation pressures continue to build
After headline inflation reached 1 8  in 2018 on the back of a strong rise in oil prices  we expect inflationary pressures to abate in the coming years to reach 1 5  in 2019 and 1 4  in 2020  However  with regard to monetary policy  the key inflation metric remains the inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices  Overall  underlying inflation pressures are still subdued  averaging only 1 0  in 2018  However  with the economic expansion continuing  unit labour costs rising and firms  margins increasingly being squeezed  the structural conditions for a pass through from wages to prices remain in place  We see scope for core inflation reaching rates of 1 3 1 4  by year end  see Inflation under the microscope  simmering  not boiling  

ECB policy normalisation postponed
ECB opened for an easing bias at the March meeting by announcing a new series of liquidity operations  TLTROs  and extended rate forward guidance to the end of this year  on the back of a sustained slowdown that extended into 2019  With ECB entering easing mode  we no longer expect any changes in the policy rate until the end of 2021  as the lack of strong inflationary pressures and only moderate euro area growth outlook do not warrant policy tightening  However  our baseline does not include new accommodative monetary policy either  Further stimulus measures could be warranted if we see a deterioration of economic fundamentals that stands to jeopardise the rise in core inflation  see also Guns  and not bazookas  dominate ECB s crisis arsenal   The market based inflation expectations  5y5y  illustrating the expected inflation from 5 years to 10 years  are trading close to all time lows  The ECB has previously stepped up its policy stimuli when inflation expectations were at much higher levels  which has led to the market speculating about the next stimuli measure 

In sum  compared to the Big Picture published in December  the normalisation bias to a tighter monetary policy has been replaced with a neutral to easing bias  should the data warrant it  

The European Game Of Thrones
The European parliamentary elections have brought the starting shot for the European  Game of Thrones  to play out in the coming months  where a range of top EU positions will be up for grabs  Informal rules about the balance of power between Northern and Southern  NYSE SO  member states will guide the political  horse trading  
Over the coming weeks  discussions will intensify over the choice of EU Commission president  Current frontrunners are Germany s Manfred Weber  the Netherlands  Frans Timmermans and Denmark s Margrethe Vestager  see more here   That said  financial markets are equally  if not more  interested in the new ECB president 
The nationality of the next EU Commission president will have important implications for the ECB presidency succession when Mario Draghi steps down in October  With Germany seemingly preferring to secure the Commission presidency  this could pave the way for a more moderate consensus candidate from France or Finland to take over the reins at the ECB  We would expect such policy continuity to be seen as a positive calming factor for markets  Almost irrespective of the new ECB president  we do not expect a sudden shift in the ECB s current monetary policy outlook  however the responsiveness and innovative qualities of the next ECB president would be instrumental in shaping the policy response in the next crisis ",2019-06-14,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-area--at-inflection-point-200431578,200431578
175884,397400,SO,ECB President Succession In Focus,opinion,"Our analysis of eurozone central bankers  communication shows nationality matters  but not really in the ECB s board  And once the appointment is made  the national bias won t be as significant as many ECB watchers think these days
When European leaders meet in Brussels this week  they won t only be discussing ways to further deepen the monetary union but also scratching their heads on how to best fill the top European jobs 
An already complex musical chairs game has become even more convoluted as it also includes replacing the ECB president Mario Draghi  In the past  the ECB president was appointed in an exclusive process but due to the timing of Mario Draghi s term ending   31 October  the position has been included in the bigger game  Nationalities  gender  political affiliations and previous jobs  everything matters 
As hard as it may be for market participants and ECB watchers to understand  leaders will first choose the next president of the European Commission before appointing Draghi s successor 
No real front runners as the presidency is part of horse trading 
Given the deadlock in the talks up until now and particularly the increasing differences between France and Germany  chances have increased that this week s summit won t tell us  who is who  in European politics 
We think it s very hard not seeing one of the Spitzenkandidaten as the next European Commission president  While the German politician Manfred Weber has the backing of the largest party in the European Parliament   the EPP  there is growing resistance against Weber  This could open the door for the Danish born Competition Commissioner for the EU  Margrethe Vestager or the centre left Dutch politician Frans Timmermans  If Weber doesn t get the job  chances of another German  Jens Weidmann  to take over Mario Draghi s seat increase 
In any case  while many observers believe this round of European musical chairs would bring both France and Germany a top job each  a scenario in which neither country gets one should no longer be excluded 

We think it s very hard not seeing one of the Spitzenkandidaten as the next European Commission president

Zooming in on the next ECB president  there is no real news on a front runner  It still looks as if Draghi s successor will emerge from the group of Germany s Jens Weidmann  France s Francois Villeroy de Galhau or Finland s  Oli Rehn and Erkki Liikanen plus the outsider or compromise candidates including Klaas Knot  Ardo Hansson or Benoit Coeur   While the European Treaties  only  say that the ECB president  as well as all other Executive Board members  should have  recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters   it s hard to imagine any candidate without central bank experience 
Does nationality really matter 
Officially  nationality shouldn t matter  However  given that the Draghi succession has now become part of the bigger European horse trading  nationality will matter 
We all know of the prejudices about core European hawks and Southern  NYSE SO  European doves  To lift the issue of nationality out of the cocktail party sphere to a more analytical level  we find that that there is indeed a significant difference in terms of topics that central bankers discuss  Southern European Governing Council members are much more concerned with growth related issues  while Northern European Governing Council members have more of a tendency to discuss monetary issues like inflation and price stability 
However  surprisingly  this national bias tends to disappear in the ECB s Executive Board  as our analysis finds that ECB board members discuss less diverging themes based on their background 
Governing council members see clear differences between South and North in terms of topical discussion in speeches

ECB executive board members have less clear divisions in terms of themes discussed in speeches

   Leaving the national passport at the door
Even if the European musical chairs game currently looks set to continue after this week  giving all commentators more time and material to gossip and engage in tea leaf reading on who will get which job  the ECB presidency remains the most important nomination for markets 

The results of our analysis give hope that even though nationality will matter during the appointment process  the national bias won t be as significant as many ECB watchers think these days

Now that the ECB has moved towards a new easing bias  opening the door for rate cuts and other monetary action  any Draghi successor will not only be questioned and tested on  whatever it takes  but also on the continuation of the latest dovish shift  In this regards  we could see marginal differences between a more hawkish new president  let s call him Jens Weidmann  and a more dovish president  let s call him Benoit Coeure  This difference won t be apparent in the pace of normalisation but rather in the depth and determination of additional easing 
In the broader sense of things  the results of our analysis give hope that even though nationality will matter during the appointment process  the national bias won t be as significant as many ECB watchers think these days  Chances are much higher that the ECB president will be presidential  leaving his or her national passport behind at the security control of the EuroTower on 1 November this year

175894,397410,SO,PG E Warns of Huge Power Shutoff as California Becomes Tinderbox,news," Bloomberg     Bankrupt utility owner Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG  issued an unprecedented warning that it may cut power in almost 30 California counties to avoid wildfires as hot  arid winds leave the region dry as a tinderbox 
The move may affect more than 600 000 customers across Northern and Central California  including Santa Clara  San Mateo  Napa and Alameda counties  according to a statement Tuesday  The shutoff could begin when winds peak early Wednesday and last through mid Thursday 
 This is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we ve seen in our territory in recent years   Michael Lewis  senior vice president of PG E Electric Operations  said in the statement   It could take several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed  
PG E and other California utilities have been taking aggressive measures to keep equipment from sparking blazes after power lines ignited catastrophic fires in 2017 and 2018  For PG E  the stakes are especially high  It already faces an estimated  30 billion in wildfire liabilities  Another major blaze sparked by its equipment could upend the company s restructuring plans 
The National Weather Service has posted red flag warnings in parts of six western states  meaning the fire danger is high  In California  the warnings ring the Bay Area including Napa County  where the Tubbs fire killed at least 22 and destroyed more than 5 600 structures in October 2017

175896,397412,SO,Earnings Preview  Oxford Industries  OXM  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Oxford Industries  OXM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the Tommy Bahama  Lilly Pulitzer and Southern  NYSE SO  Tide clothing lines is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 7  
Revenues are expected to be  277 26 million  up 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oxford Industries 
For Oxford Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oxford Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oxford Industries would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oxford Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-oxford-industries-oxm-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200428709,200428709
175897,397413,SO,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Southern First  SFST ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Southern  NYSE SO  First  SFST  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this holding company for Southern First Bank is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Southern First is 17 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 1  
Cash Flow Growth

175898,397414,SO,Honduran president s brother promised  El Chapo  protection  witness says,news,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK  Reuters    Mexican drug lord Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman tried to give  1 million to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez s election campaign after being promised protection for his cocaine shipments  a witness at Hernandez s criminal trial in New York said Tuesday 
Amilcar Alexander Ardon  a former mayor and confessed killer and narco trafficker  testified before jurors in the U S  Southern  NYSE SO  District Court of New York in the second week of the trial of Juan Antonio  Tony  Hernandez  the president s brother 
Tony Hernandez  a lawyer and former Honduran congressman  is accused of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and possessing illegal weapons 
He has pleaded not guilty  His defense attorneys said on Tuesday that Ardon s testimony was not backed by any physical evidence 
The president has denied taking money from Guzman or other drug traffickers  
Ardon testified that Tony Hernandez had promised El Chapo that his cocaine shipments through the Central American country would be protected if his brother won the presidency in 2013 
In response  Guzman offered to give  1 million to the 2013 campaign to elect Juan Orlando Hernandez  now the president  Ardon told jurors  In a later meeting  Ardon said  El Chapo handed the money to Tony Hernandez 
Guzman was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a sentence of life in prison  One of his lawyers  Jeffrey Lichtman  has denied that his client paid Juan Orlando Hernandez 
Ardon  who was once mayor of the town of El Paraiso  had first testified about the payment on Monday  but on Tuesday offered more detail about the discussions between Guzman and Tony Hernandez leading up to it 
Ardon turned himself in to U S  authorities in March and is cooperating with prosecutors  He admitted on Monday that he had been responsible for 56 murders 
Responding to the allegations  President Hernandez tweeted Tuesday   CONFESSED KILLER of 56 people who lives with a profound hate and thirst for vengeance against me  The conspiracy is CLEAR among confessed criminals who have nothing to lose  
In addition to protection for his drug shipments  Ardon said  Guzman wanted assurances that his partners in the country   drug trafficking brothers Luis and Arnulfo Valle  and Ardon   would not be extradited to the United States 
Juan Orlando Hernandez won the presidency in 2013  and took office in January 2014  When the Valle brothers were arrested in 2014  Ardon said he personally conveyed Guzman s displeasure to the president 
 I told Juan Orlando Hernandez that was the reason he had been paid the  1 million  to protect the Valles   he said  The president countered that he had no obligation to anyone  and offered to give the money back  Ardon said 
U S  prosecutors have said Tony Hernandez  with the protection of his brother  moved tons of cocaine into the United States  some of it stamped with his initials  and took part in two drug related murders 
The administration of U S  President Donald Trump has supported Juan Orlando Hernandez  a conservative  as a staunch ally in the fight against drug trafficking  In Honduras he has faced mounting popular opposition since he was sworn in for a second term in January 2018 despite allegations of electoral fraud ",2019-10-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/honduran-presidents-brother-promised-el-chapo-protection-witness-says-1993652,1993652

175901,397417,SO,Trump s fast tracking of oil pipelines hits legal roadblocks,news,"By Scott DiSavino and Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration s effort to cut red tape and speed up major energy projects has backfired in the case of the three biggest U S  pipelines now planned or under construction  All three have been stalled by successful legal challenges by environmental groups alleging the administration failed to apply the regulatory scrutiny required under the law  The Republican administration tried to accelerate permits for two multi billion dollar natural gas lines and jumpstart the long stalled Keystone XL crude oil pipeline that would start in Canada  Judges halted construction on all three over the past two years  ruling that the administration granted permits without conducting adequate studies or providing enough alternatives to protect endangered species or national forests  The delays have caused the two giant gas pipelines   Dominion Energy Inc s Atlantic Coast and EQM Midstream Partners LP s Mountain Valley   to increase their cost estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars  according to the companies  The Atlantic Coast pipeline may never be completed unless the U S  Supreme Court overturns a lower court decision blocking its planned route  analysts said  Lawsuits alleging regulatory lapses are not new  but they were unsuccessful during the administration of Trump s predecessor  Democrat Barack Obama  Plaintiffs lost five separate lawsuits alleging regulatory failures during Obama s administration  according to a Reuters review of court filings for major interstate gas pipes built since 2010   Environmental groups definitely have been going after these pipelines more aggressively   said Amy Vazquez  Houston based partner at the law firm of Jones Walker  who specializes in energy litigation   It s probably because they re having a fair bit of success   The White House declined to comment  An Energy Department spokeswoman did not comment on the litigation but said the administration remains committed to streamlining energy infrastructure development  D J  Gerken  senior attorney with the Southern  NYSE SO  Environmental Law Center in Asheville  North Carolina  represented the Sierra Club and other environmental groups in cases challenging the Atlantic Coast pipeline  He said the administration s rush to help industry move faster invited the legal challenges   Pressure from the utilities that stand to benefit from this project and the Trump administration produced flawed permits   he said   MYSTERIOUS  REGULATORY REVERSAL In the case of Dominion s 600 mile  966 km  Atlantic Coast gas pipeline  from West Virginia to North Carolina  the U S  Forest Service originally expressed skepticism about the project in 2016 when Obama was president  requesting alternative designs  But after Trump took office  the Forest Service changed course  and issued permits and a waiver for the line to cross the Appalachian Trail on national forestland in Virginia  Petitioners including the Sierra Club  an environmental advocacy organization  sued the Forest Service  alleging the agency violated three federal acts in issuing a construction permit   In December 2018  the U S  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Forest Service decisions  with Judge Stephanie Thacker noting in her ruling that  the Forest Service s serious environmental concerns that were suddenly  and mysteriously  assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company s deadlines    The court said the Forest Service lacked authority to allow Dominion to build across the Appalachian Trail  which is administered by the Department of Interior  The Forest Service declined to comment  In July  in another Atlantic Coast case brought by groups including the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife  the Fourth Circuit vacated a U S  Fish and Wildlife Service permit  Chief Judge Roger Gregory ruled that the agency  in  fast tracking  decisions  lost sight of its mandate to protect threatened species  The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service declined to comment  Atlantic Coast s original cost estimate of  6 billion to  6 5 billion has risen to  7 billion to  7 5 billion  the company said  The projected completion has shifted from late 2019 to late 2021  The U S  Supreme Court in October agreed to hear the Appalachian Trail case and could overrule the decision halting construction across that route  Dominion has stopped construction on the pipe since December 2018  Spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company is confident the high court will rule in its favor and  uphold the longstanding precedent allowing pipeline crossings of the Appalachian Trail   RISING COSTS  LEGAL RISKS The Fourth Circuit appeals court also stopped work on EQM s 303 mile  488 km  Mountain Valley gas pipe from West Virginia to Virginia in June 2018  agreeing with the Sierra Club and other plaintiffs that permits issued by the Army Corps violated West Virginia rules related to stream crossings  The state has since altered its rules  and the U S  Army Corps of Engineers is in the process of issuing new permits for this pipeline and Atlantic Coast  But the Sierra Club is still challenging a Fish and Wildlife Service permit in a case that also is being heard by the Fourth Circuit  EQM originally expected to complete Mountain Valley by the end of 2018 at a cost of  3 5 billion  The company said publicly that it expected the pipeline  which is mostly complete  will cost up to  5 billion and enter service in mid 2020  Diana Charletta  chief operating officer at EQM  said that recent court decisions  have brought uncertainty and a high level of scrutiny to the agencies  decisions   Officials at both Dominion and EQM dispute that approvals were fast tracked  Dominion pointed out that it filed its application to build Atlantic Coast in 2014   I don t think any person can look at the regulatory review process for Atlantic Coast pipeline and say that it was fast tracked   said Ruby  the Dominion spokesman  EFFORT TO REVIVE KEYSTONE STALLS TC Energy Corp s  8 billion Keystone XL pipeline  originally blocked by Obama in 2015  was revived by Trump in 2017 with the issuance of a presidential permit for the line  which would ship crude from Canada to the U S  Gulf Coast  Federal Judge Brian Morris in Montana blocked work on the pipe in November 2018  citing a lack of due diligence by federal regulators regarding greenhouse gas emissions and Native American land rights  The Trump administration tried to circumvent that ruling by rescinding its original presidential permit and issuing a new one in March  That second permit now faces legal challenges from Native American groups  TC Energy said it continues to monitor U S  legal and regulatory issues while it plans construction   We are committed to Keystone XL as it remains an important project for our company and for North America   said Terry Cunha  spokesman for TC Energy  
Canadian producer Suncor Energy said in early September that the uncertain U S  political landscape makes it unclear that the pipeline will be built   That s one a lot of people are doing soul searching about right now   said Suncor CEO Mark Little ",2019-10-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/trumps-fasttracking-of-oil-pipelines-hits-legal-roadblocks-1993776,1993776
175916,397432,SO,This 7 Stock  Never Go Down  Portfolio Pays 6  Today,opinion,"Where s the market going from here  Well  if you own these seven  never go down  dividend payers  you probably don t care 
My readers are often asking for safe income ideas  For stocks that pay dividends and never drop in price  It s a very difficult task  but not quite impossible 
For most long term investors who want big dividends I m talking 6   7  and even 8   current yields I recommend a combination of a contrarian and  No Withdrawal  approach  This consists of buying safe dividend paying bonds and funds when they are out of favor and holding them through any market turbulence 
Big dividends are the rubber duckies of the investing world  Wall Street hysteria may push their prices underwater for weeks at a time  but as the months and years pass these stocks bounce back to the surface  Omega Healthcare Investors   NYSE OHI  performance during 2008 shows this in action  OHI entered the infamous year paying nearly 7   making it the ideal stock for a No Withdrawal Portfolio 
OHI  A No Withdrawal Favorite
Yes  OHI did drop sharply in late 2008  This was traumatic for shareholders who second guessed themselves and sold at the worst possible time  in early 2009   Which begs the question I hear most 
Brett  can you recommend dividend stocks that would hold up in a 2008 type environment 
In other words  can I name dividend stocks that won t drop in price in October 2008  December 2018 and so far brutal May 2019 
I can  Here are my top seven  never go down  plays today 
Pivoting From  No Withdrawal  to  Never Go Down 
In the long run  months and years   fundamentals drive stocks  This is why safe dividends and dividend growers are the way to go  They will outperform non payers and measly payers over any meaningful time period 
But in the short run  days and weeks   there are  technical  factors that matter more  And I m not talking about chart patterns  waves or other mythical models  I m talking about good old fashioned supply and demand 
We can talk yields  cash flow  profits and business growth but  to be brutally honest  it matters little in the short term  Ever buy a stock with great fundamentals  only to see its price languish for many months  Of course you have   We all have   We got the big picture story right  but our timing was off 
Well  how d your portfolio do last week  Probably not as well as the seven stocks and funds I m about to list 
These are my current Never Go Down dividend plays  They all pay  and they re all up during a brutal May  This is an impressive sign of  relative strength   which means they are acting better than the overall market  Why  Because investors and money managers want these income streams no matter what happens in the trade war the main headline driving the May drop 
For lack of a better word  these are  momentum income  buys  At current prices they are still in hot demand  So  prices will rise in the months ahead while these stocks and funds continue to pay their dividends 
The upward price motion you ll see for the rest of 2019 is what the quants call  momentum   It s a real thing and it can be a useful tool  even to us income investors  The important thing to remember is that momentum doesn t last forever  and when it starts to fade it s time to sell 
How long will these shares stay hot  In my experience they should be as bulletproof as we could reasonably hope for in the coming months  This means  by the end of this year  they will all be trading at higher prices  regardless of broader market action   And these dividends will be paid out while their shareholders wait for stock gains  too 
PIMCO s Dynamic Income Fund  PDI  has made a mockery of May s mayhem  The 8 3  payer has returned a steady 2 6  month to date 
PDI Says Tariffs No Problem
Now the fund trades at a rich 14  premium to its net asset value  NAV   which would remove it from No Withdrawal contention  But over a shorter timeframe we don t care we re going to collect the monthly distribution  enjoy the price gains and drop the fund when its momentum starts to slow down 
Outfront Media  NYSE OUT  is a real estate investment trust  REIT  that owns advertising space such as billboard and transportation displays  At a glance this sounds a bit  old school  but Outfront is increasingly updating its offerings to make them digital and easily customizable  Shares pay 5 8  today but Wall Street is slowly waking up to the renewed viability of this cash cow 
Out in Front of the Broader Market
Community Healthcare Trust  NYSE CHCT  is another REIT  and I ve had my eye on it for a while now   Between us friends  it s too small for me to formally recommend   But what s not to like  The healthcare landlord is constantly growing its dividend and management regularly buys shares for personal accounts  Thanks to 15 straight quarterly dividend raises  shares now yield 4 3  
15 Straight Quarterly Dividend Raises  Unstoppable
W P  Carey  NYSE WPC  leases out business space to individual tenants  Its portfolio is diversified across 1 186 properties  a wide range including industrial  automotive  construction and warehouse properties 
I recommended the stock to my Contrarian Income Report subscribers because I believed that recent acquisition of fellow REIT CPA 17 would help turbocharge WPC s FFO and dividend growth  So far  so good on that front because the assets acquired are spinning off 7  in annual cash   And so far  so good for CIR subscribers  who have enjoyed 27 4  total returns in just five months   Shares pay 5  today 
The Tariff Proof Industrial Landlord
Och Ziff Capital  NYSE OZM  is a publicly traded hedge fund  Wait  what  If you thought hedge funds were dinosaurs  then you missed the generous 61  dividend raise that this T Rex dished mid May  which brings its yield to 5 4    If you have any investor friends who doubt the all encompassing power of dividend growth  show them the  dinosaur  that delivered 32  returns May to date 
Powered By a 61  Dividend Increase
CVR Energy  NYSE CVI   which refines oil and makes fertilizer  is a favorite  billionaire buy  according to a recent Kiplinger list  At a glance it s easy to see why the stock pays 6 8  today thanks to a generous 50  dividend raise last August  CVI is the lone May loser on our list  but barely  It s poised to rally when the broader markets bounce back 
A Resilient Billionaire Favorite
Finally  Independence Realty Trust  NYSE IRT  is an apartment REIT that focuses on  secondary  Midwest and Southern  NYSE SO  markets like Austin  Indianapolis and Raleigh Durham  Its focus on niche markets with positive population and employment trends has helped fill 94  of the firm s apartments  The landlord tripled its dividend in early 2018 and the stock yields 6 6  today

175923,397439,SO,Credit Suisse defeats lawsuits over huge U S   volatility  crash,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge on Wednesday dismissed three lawsuits accusing  Credit Suisse  Group AG  S CSGN  of misleading investors about a complex product for betting on stock market swings  and causing huge losses when it lost 96  of its value in one harrowing day 
U S  District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said Credit Suisse had warned investors about risks in its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange Traded Notes   XIV Notes    and the investors did not show that the Swiss bank intended to defraud them 
Torres adopted U S  Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn s recommendation on Aug  16 that the lawsuits be dismissed 
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to similar requests 
The XIV notes were among several investment casualties on Feb  5  2018  when the Standard   Poor s 500  SPX  dropped 4 1  and a surprise increase in market turbulence punished investors betting on low volatility 
Investors said the price of the notes sank that day to  4 22 from  108 37  a plunge exacerbated by Credit Suisse s huge purchase of futures contracts  roughly a quarter of the entire VIX futures market   to benefit from the higher volatility 
Credit Suisse soon redeemed the notes at  5 99 each  and according to the investors reaped between  475 million and  542 million of profit in doing so at their expense 
The investors said Credit Suisse concealed their impending distress by failing to regularly update the price of the notes  or warn when it sold 16 28 million of the notes just a week earlier  on Jan  29  that the prices were vastly inflated 
Torres  however  found no reason to upset Netburn s findings that Credit Suisse was simply taking advantage of market conditions  and was not trying to saddle investors with losses 
 Judge Netburn did not clearly err in concluding that  notwithstanding the size of the January sale  the innocent explanation for the large volume of XIV notes sales in January 2018 was more plausible than the inference that Credit Suisse engaged in those sales in order to later cause a liquidity crash   Torres wrote 
Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam  a defendant in one of the lawsuits  had called the XIV notes  legitimate   and that investors accepted the risks they would not be successful

175925,397441,SO,College football notebook  One play  two injured for Purdue,news,"A pair of key Purdue offensive players were injured on the same play on Saturday against Minnesota 
Quarterback Elijah Sindelar went down with a shoulder injury after being sacked from behind by Minnesota defensive lineman Tai yon Devers  while sophomore wide receiver Rondale Moore was injured when his leg buckled on a pass route  Both had to be helped off the field  and Moore was eventually carted off the sideline to the locker room 
As of Saturday night  Purdue had yet to give any updates on the injuries  Sindelar returned to action Sunday for the first time since sustaining a concussion in Purdue s victory over Vanderbilt on Sept  7 
Minnesota won the game  the Big Ten opener for both schools  38 31 
  Wide receiver Devon Williams  NYSE WMB  is transferring to Oregon    not Oregon State as that school announced Thursday    after an apparent change of heart 
Williams  who left the Southern  NYSE SO  California program two games into the season  made the announcement on Twitter on Friday  And while Oregon State did not announce Williams  commitment  the football program s Twitter account shared Williams  tweet 
Williams  the No  1 rated high school athlete in the 2018 recruiting class  will have three years of eligibility remaining after sitting out the rest of the 2019 season  He played in one game this season  catching one pass for 11 yards against Stanford on Sept  7 
  The Maryland Terrapins were without wide receiver DJ Turner in Friday s 59 0 loss to Penn State  a decision coach Michael Locksley says was to let Turner focus on  non football things  
That apparently refers to a DUI charge for Turner related to an early morning traffic stop on Sept  20  according to The Washington Post  The senior wideout was also charged with reckless driving and disobeying an officer  among other violations  the Post reports  citing state public judiciary logs 
Turner has four catches for 84 yards this season for Maryland  2 2   He also has three punt returns for 107 yards and a TD and one kickoff return of 22 yards

175929,397445,SO,Trump administration rejects new protections for iconic Alaska tree,news,"By Yereth Rosen
ANCHORAGE  Alaska  Reuters    An iconic Alaska tree that is dying off from rising forest temperatures and diminished winter snowpack was deemed ineligible by U S  wildlife officials on Friday for special protection under the U S  Endangered Species Act 
The Trump administration  though acknowledging that climate change is a factor in the decline of the yellow cedar  rejected a petition to list the tree as a threatened species under the landmark environmental law 
The trees  which can grow to be more than 1 000 years old  are mostly found in the coastal temperate rain forests of southeastern Alaska and British Columbia  though some stands occur as far south as northern California 
Environmentalists seeking the threatened species listing were trying to secure new safeguards for the trees in Alaska  where a long running die off extending across more than 1 500 square miles is concentrated 
A 2016 University of Alaska led study found at least 70  of the trees had been lost in the hardest hit areas 
Scientists blame the die off on human caused climate change  stemming from rising levels of heat trapping greenhouse gases in Earth s atmosphere 
Warmer then normal temperatures have converted much of winter s precipitation from snow to rain in southeastern Alaska  ironically exposing yellow cedar s shallow roots to freeze damage from soil less insulated by snowpack  scientists say 
But the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  which has jurisdiction over Endangered Species Act protections for plants as well as animals  determined that the die off is not widespread enough to justify a threatened listing 
The yellow cedar decline likely peaked in the 1970s and 1980s  and the current status of the die off affects only 6  of the species  range  the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement   Therefore  it is not having population level effects on the species   the service said 
Larry Edwards of Alaska Rainforest Defenders said the decision misses the long term picture 
 It s not just the concern about the present but looking ahead  as the climate continues to warm   Edwards said 
The die off has become an obvious part of the landscape 
 You see stands of dead stems on the mountainsides   said Edwards  who lives in Sitka   If you go up and look  those stems are yellow cedar  
The yellow cedar  actually a type of cypress and not a cedar  is prized for its high value timber and its significance to indigenous cultures of the Pacific Northwest 
Denial of the yellow cedar listing proposal comes as the Trump administration is seeking to expand logging in southeast Alaska s Tongass National Forest and to revise Endangered Species Act rules in a way that environmentalists say will weaken protections under the law 
The yellow cedars could benefit instead from selective logging that thins the forest  planting of seedlings and development of a new browse resistant strain  that would make seedlings less palatable to deer   the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement 
The yellow cedar was one of a dozen imperiled plants and animals for whom Endangered Species Act petitions were denied on Friday  including the Berry Cave salamander in eastern Tennessee  the Panamint alligator lizard in California and the Southern  NYSE SO  hognose snake in the Carolinas  Georgia and Florida 
The Trump administration has now declined protection for 74 species and granted safeguards to 18  the fewest of any president at this point in an administration  according to the Center for Biological Diversity ",2019-10-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-administration-rejects-new-protections-for-iconic-alaska-tree-1992293,1992293
175945,397461,SO,BIP Or SO  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Utility   Electric Power sector might want to consider either Brookfield Infrastructure Partners  BIP  or Southern Co   SO   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Southern Co  has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BIP has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BIP currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 93  while SO has a forward P E of 17 84  We also note that BIP has a PEG ratio of 1 24  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SO currently has a PEG ratio of 3 96 
Another notable valuation metric for BIP is its P B ratio of 0 94  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SO has a P B of 1 83 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BIP s Value grade of B and SO s Value grade of C 
BIP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than SO  so it seems like value investors will conclude that BIP is the superior option right now ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bip-or-so-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200423858,200423858
175946,397462,SO,Is Great Southern Bancorp  GSBC  A Good Value Investor Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Great Southern  NYSE SO  Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ GSBC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Great Southern Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 33  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 78  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Great Southern Bancorp s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 85 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 04  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Great Southern Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 50  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often  overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Great Southern Bancorp  P CF ratio of 8 59 is lower than the Zacks Banks and Thrifts industry average of 13 73  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Great Southern Bancorp currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Great Southern Bancorp a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 7  which is better than the industry average of 12 04  Clearly  GSBC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Great Southern Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of B  This gives GSBC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one upward revision in the pastsixty days compared to no downward revisions  while the full year estimate has also seen one upward revision compared to no downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate increased 4 63  in the past two months  whereas the full year estimate rose 4 81   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Great Southern Bancorp  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGreat Southern Bancorp is

175950,397466,SO,Can Value Investors Consider Southern First  SFST  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Southern  NYSE SO  First Bancshares  Inc    NASDAQ SFST   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Southern First has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 58  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Southern First s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 16 52 over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  Southern First has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 38  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Southern First stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Southern First has a P S ratio of about 2 97  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Southern First currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Southern First a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Southern First might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B  This gives SFST a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  Both the current quarter and full year estimates have seen one upward versus no downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has shot up 2 7  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Southern First Bancshares  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSouthern First is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among Top 39  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 instils investors  confidence the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a strong industry and strong Zacks ranks and favorable analyst

point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Southern National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 45  so it is fair to

year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the full year consensus estimate has risen by 1 5  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Southern National Bancorp of Virginia  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2

175952,397468,SO,No  4 LSU packs potent passing for trip to Vandy,news,"No  4 LSU will test its suddenly powerful passing attack in the Southeastern Conference when the Tigers begin their conference season Saturday at Vanderbilt in Nashville  Tenn 
The Tigers  3 0  have sandwiched easy wins over Georgia Southern  NYSE SO  and Northwestern State around a tougher one at then No  12 Texas two weekends ago 
Joe Burrow has completed 83 3 percent of his throws for 1 122 yards  with 11 touchdowns and two interceptions  in the Tigers  new  faster  more wide open attack  Nine players  led by wide receivers Justin Jefferson  19 catches  374 yards  four TDs  and Terrace Marshall Jr   16 229 6  have at least four catches 
LSU is second nationally in passing at 436 3 yards per game  Marshall is tied with Oklahoma State s Tylan Wallace for the most TD receptions in the nation 
 Obviously lights out right now on offense throwing the football   said LSU coach Ed Orgeron   We ve got to get better running the football  
The Tigers have rushed for an un LSU like 3 6 yards per carry  However  they re allowing just 2 4 per attempt 
LSU clung to a 17 14 lead against Northwestern State last Saturday before running back Clyde Edwards Helaire s 3 yard scoring run with 3 27 left in second quarter provided the first of 48 unanswered Tiger points to end the game 
Even with that scoring blitz  Orgeron found a way to motivate LSU for Saturday 
 On Tell the Truth Monday  we had on offense one of the things we must and will improve is that we were only eight out of nine in red zone scoring   Orgeron said 
 I said   Well  isn t that action a little much   And they said   No  coach  we re supposed to be nine out of nine   Setting the LSU standard of performance is very high  Our players have set it  Our coaches have set it  
Last Saturday s bye week was a pause on Vandy s brutal opening schedule  featuring games against Georgia and at Purdue 
Vanderbilt  with Ball State transfer quarterback Riley Neal at the helm  has been unable to get going offensively  despite having a trio of standouts    running back Ke Shawn Vaughn  tight end Jared Pinkney and wideout Kalija Lipscomb  The Commodores  0 2  0 1 SEC  are averaging just 15 points and 358 yards in two games 
 Ke Shawn Vaughn     he s probably going to be an NFL player   Orgeron said   And also Jared Pinkney  the tight end  Those two guys will play in the NFL  
Neal is 38 of 60 for 463 yards  with two touchdowns and one interception 
A major culprit on Vandy s offense has been an inexperienced  banged up offensive line  However  left tackle Devin Cochran    the team s best lineman    could see his first action Saturday 
However  the  Dores may have bigger issues 
Vanderbilt allows 36 points and 509 5 yards per game  and it hasn t recorded a sack  It gave up 8 1 yards per rush against Georgia  and 9 8 yards per pass vs  Purdue 
It is also the country s most penalized team at 11 5 flags per game 
  I m  disappointed in our discipline  all the way around   coach Derek Mason said after the 42 24 loss to Purdue   Our inability to stay onsides on defense really impacted this game  
Mason said a trio of players    running back Jamauri Wakefield  linebacker Colin Anderson and wide receiver Amir Abdur Rahman    will miss the rest of the season because of injuries  They haven t been full time starters  but their absences will affect the team s depth 
The teams haven t met since LSU s 27 3 win in Nashville in 2010

175953,397469,SO,Yemen Houthi drones  missiles defy years of Saudi air strikes,news,"By Lisa Barrington and Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI  Reuters    At a weapons exhibition in July in Yemen s Houthi controlled capital Sanaa  military officials whipped silken sheets off what they said were newly developed drones and missiles 
The theatrical gesture revealed the proud slogan  Made in Yemen  spray painted onto the weapons  bodywork 
The moment was a celebration of sorts for Yemen s Houthi fighters  Despite years of air strikes against them  the militia now boast drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia  the result of an armament campaign pursued and expanded energetically since Yemen s war began four years ago 
Whether or not the Iran aligned group carried out Saturday s crippling raid on a Saudi oil plant    as it asserts    its capabilities mean it can feasibly claim responsibility for the strike  a humiliating blow against its top adversary 
Much remains unclear about the attack  Some Western officials believe responsibility lies with Iranian backed militias in Iraq  or Iran itself 
What is certain is that Houthi weapon capabilities have evolved rapidly in the past couple of years in accuracy and distance  analysts  U N  data and Houthi media indicate 
Their growing abilities also exemplify the threat Iran s other regional allies   be they in Iraq  Syria or Lebanon   pose to their foes and the global powers that seek to contain them 
In one unverified Houthi video  a covert launch vehicle rises robotically out of the desert floor and fires off missiles thousands of feet into a clear blue sky  before retracting into its hiding place 
ACCURACY
 They are getting better on accuracy   a Saudi based security source said   The message they re sending is  We are getting through and we are hitting the right locations  
 As these technologies   long range drones or cruise missiles   spread  it really adds to the distance of warfare  It also adds to the deniability of the perpetrator   said James Rogers  assistant professor in War Studies at University of Southern  NYSE SO  Denmark 
The Houthis  growing military clout has checked Saudi ambitions in Yemen  Riyadh leads a coalition that intervened in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi  which the Houthis ousted from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 
The Houthis have built their arsenal using local manufacturing  foreign expertise and parts smuggled in from Iran  their ally  and elsewhere  They also took over large swathes of Yemen s conventional military  including Scud missiles  when they seized the capital in late 2014 
The Saudi led coalition said in June the Houthis had fired 226 ballistic missiles and 710 606  projectiles  during the war 
This proliferation has taken place despite a years long air and sea blockade on Houthi controlled parts of Yemen and years of strikes the coalition say are against weapons depots  drone manufacturing locations and military communications hubs 
The Houthis  reach has been getting longer 
A new type of Houthi drone appeared in mid 2018 which the U N  has said can fly up to 1 200 1 500 km  745 to 932 miles    putting Riyadh  Abu Dhabi and Dubai within range 
A 2018 study of Houthi s military by Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the clearest example of direct Iranian help with advanced Houthi weaponry was the Burkan 2 H medium range ballistic missile 
He said wreckage from 10 Burkan missiles suggested they were smuggled into Yemen in pieces and welded back together by a single engineering team  whose  fingerprint non factory welding technique  was found on all the missiles 
Iran denies arming the Houthis and says it played no part in Saturday s strike  which raised already simmering tensions in the region between Tehran and its Gulf and U S  adversaries 
DRONES  MISSILES  ROCKETS
President Hassan Rouhani said the attacks were carried out by  Yemeni people  in response to the Yemen war 
The Houthis  who have this year also hit smaller oil targets and airports in southern Saudi  said they carried out the Aramco strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles 
The U N  says the Houthis  arsenal now also includes anti ship cruise missiles  waterborne improvised explosive devices  ballistic and cruise missiles and rockets 
The group seized some of the Yemeni armed forces  arsenal when it invaded Sanaa in 2014  But none of these had the range seen today  said Jeremy Binnie  Middle East and Africa editor for Jane s Defence Weekly 
Analysis of weapons captured or seen in Houthi images show a combination of home grown designs  entire foreign items and components brought in from outside to upgrade existing stock  a January 2018 U N  panel of experts report said

A Western diplomat said there are noticeable reductions in Houthi attacks after big coalition strikes  but new supplies seem to keep coming in and home grown production continue 
 You see this everywhere where you have Iranian groups   one of the first things will be to try to get their local manufacturing capability up and running  That might start with very basic artillery rockets and then progress   Binnie said 
Iran and the Houthis have close relations  and analysts say some of their weapons technology resembles Iranian designs  A Houthi delegation visited Tehran in August and the two sides exchanged ambassadors for the first time 
A senior regional official  who has close ties to Iran s decision makers  told Reuters around 35 senior Houthi fighters were on that trip and received missile and drones training 
The coalition has said Lebanon s Iran backed Hezbollah has experts on the ground in Yemen assisting the Houthis  Hezbollah has denied that it helps the Houthi war effort 
The Houthis also indicated that Saturday s attack on Aramco was made possible by on the ground informers 
 It came after an accurate intelligence operation  advance monitoring and cooperation from honourable and free people inside  Saudi    the group s military spokesman said ",2019-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/yemen-houthi-drones-missiles-defy-years-of-saudi-air-strikes-1980125,1980125
175954,397470,SO,No  2 Alabama wary of Southern Miss passing attack,news,"No  2 Alabama  after giving up 324 yards through the air last week at South Carolina  will face one of the nation s top passing attacks when it hosts Southern  NYSE SO  Mississippi on Saturday afternoon in Tuscaloosa  Ala 
The Golden Eagles  2 1  threw for 514 yards in their win over Troy last week and are averaging 347 passing yards per game    12th nationally 
Quarterback Jack Abraham has completed 71 1 percent of his passes for 990 yards  and USM has three receivers with more 200 yards  including All Conference USA candidate Quez Watkins  who got all of his in one game  He missed the first two games while suspended before snagging seven passes for 209 yards in his 2019 debut last week 
Jaylond Adams has 18 catches for 257 yards  Jordan Mitchell has 16 for 295 
The key to their success is simple  Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said 
 It s because they ve got good skill players and got a good scheme   Saban said   They throw the ball all over the perimeter and make you play in space all the time  
Eagles coach Jay Hopson calls Adams and Watkins the best tandem he has had in his four seasons at USM 
 But there are five or six guys out there who are dangerous guys   Hopson said   We might have seven  That s a good thing to have offensively  We have plenty more that can go to the house  
Alabama  3 0  is giving up an average of only 194 passing yards per game  but will be without one of its top pass rushers with defensive end LaBryan Ray out with a foot injury 
 We re doing some further testing to see what the situation is with his foot   Saban said   but it is undetermined right now how long he will be out  
True freshman Justin Eboigbe has been listed as Ray s backup  He could become the second true freshman on the Tide defensive front  joining nose guard DJ Dale 
Saban said he saw all around improvement in the 47 23 victory over South Carolina  but penalties are an issue  Alabama is tied for 102nd nationally  7 67 penalties per game  after being flagged 11 times for 92 yards at South Carolina  The Gamecocks declined one penalty  and a second penalty on the same play negated another 
Three penalties were for false starts on offense  two for substitution infractions on defense 
 We shot ourselves in the foot on both sides of the ball   Saban said 
Still  the Tide were able to amass 571 yards in offense  mostly on the passing of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa  28 of 36 for 444 yards and five touchdowns   Running back Najee Harris and receiver DeVonta Smith each had a pair of touchdown receptions 
The Tide s running game netted only 76 yards  but that followed a 318 yard effort in the 62 10 rout of overmatched New Mexico State  For the season  Alabama is averaging 179 7 yards per game rushing 
Tagovailoa  a junior  is closing on the school record for career touchdown responsibility  He is at 74  66 passing  eight rushing   just six behind leader AJ McCarron  who was responsible for 80 scores  77 passing  three rushing  from 2010 13 
 We ve got to make sure we play great in all phases    offensively  defensively and special teams   USM s Hopson said   It s no secret we re playing an outstanding football team  a great football team

NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  prosecutors urged a Manhattan federal judge to reject Michael Avenatti s request to subpoena  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   calling it a  fishing expedition  unrelated to a criminal case accusing the embattled lawyer of extortion 
In a letter late on Monday  prosecutors said they and Nike had already turned over 3 360 pages of documents to Avenatti  and the added materials he wanted were irrelevant to his knowledge or state of mind when he allegedly broke the law 
Prosecutors accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits  unless the athletic wear company paid him more than  20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe 
Avenatti appeared to be on  a mission to uncover evidence that he speculates might show payments  that he asserts  without explanation  might be unlawful  to unidentified  other  players   prosecutors told U S  District Judge Paul Gardephe 
They called the proposed subpoena  a fishing expedition for material without relevance to the forthcoming trial  
Avenatti  48  became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  in lawsuits involving U S  President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen 
 I look forward to a jury hearing the real truth as to what happened as opposed to the fairytale scripted by Trump s DOJ   Avenatti said in an email on Tuesday  referring to the U S  Department of Justice 
Avenatti s lawyers have said their client was entitled to present  evidence of broader misconduct directed by Nike across amateur basketball  in his defense  which a subpoena could help unearth 
Nike has denied Avenatti s claims  and in a letter made public on Friday  opposed a subpoena   It is Mr  Avenatti  not Nike  on trial   the company s lawyers wrote 
Avenatti also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about  300 000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract 
Federal prosecutors in Southern  NYSE SO  California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud  bank fraud and other crimes  saying he stole millions of dollars from clients 
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to the various charges

175972,397488,SO,What Is Causing Extremely Bizarre Weather Patterns To Hammer The Middle ,opinion,"The middle of the country has never seen anything quite like this  As 2019 began  the central portion of the nation was relentlessly hammered by bitter cold and massive snow storms  and many were hoping for better things once spring arrived  But then in March the flooding began  and it hasn t stopped since  In fact  this is already the longest we have seen flooding along the Mississippi River since 1927  and there is no end in sight  By the time it is all said and done  all of the old records will probably be completely shattered  Meanwhile  powerful storms continue to pound the heartland every few days  Over the weekend  huge storms struck the middle of the country on Friday  Saturday and Sunday  and more are expected on Monday  So what is causing such extremely bizarre weather to happen  Is there a reason why weather patterns have shifted so dramatically  or is all of this just a really  really strange coincidence 
Nobody can possibly claim that what we are witnessing is  normal   According to the the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  the last year has been the  wettest 12 month period in recorded history  for the lower 48 states 

The continental United States just recorded its wettest 12 month period in recorded history  while also moving one step closer to being drought free  according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  

Needless to say  all of this wet weather has caused a tremendous amount of flooding  and at this point this is the longest lasting Mississippi River flood since 1927 

Mississippi River flooding has been ongoing for three months or longer in some locations  making it the longest lasting flood there since the Great Flood of 1927  the worst flood in modern history on the lower Mississippi River 
Take Vicksburg  Mississippi  for example 
The Mississippi River went above flood stage there on Feb  17  and has remained in flood ever since  The National Weather Service said this is the longest continuous stretch above flood stage since 1927 at Vicksburg 

And since there is no end in sight for the flooding  all of the old records may end up being broken by a very wide margin 
Very weird weather is happening out west too  In fact  several feet of snow just fell in the mountains of California 

Parts of California still resemble a scene out of winter  with a series of storms bringing several feet of snow to mountain areas  ahead of a  significant  severe weather threat across the nation s midsection 
The National Weather Service said that a series of Pacific storms are bringing heavy rain  mountain snow  and gusty winds across the West  A winter storm warning was issued Wednesday night that will run through Friday morning for the southern Sierra Nevada 

In every year there are moments of bad weather  But that isn t what we are talking about  In 2019  it is as if we are being hit with a sledgehammer day after day after day 
Of course this has been absolutely disastrous for agricultural production  At this point  U S  farmers have planted less than half the corn that they were expected to plant by now  For much more on this  please see my previous article entitled  Total Catastrophe For U S  Corn Production  Only 30  Of U S  Corn Fields Have Been Planted   5 Year Average Is 66   
We like to think that we are not vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather thanks to all of our advanced technology  but that is not true at all 
And over the weekend  things got even worse 
Starting on Friday and Saturday  a string of immensely powerful storms devastated communities all over the Midwest 

A plethora of tornado reports began rolling in Friday in Nebraska and Kansas  On Saturday  almost a dozen were reported in Texas and Oklahoma  In Texas  the National Weather Service Abilene San Angelo concluded that an EF2 tornado with winds of up to 135 mph damage homes in San Angelo 
Dru Lewis was hunkered down with his family as the storm battered his home 
 There was a suction   from under the door  I could feel it   he said   Then all the windows just exploded  It was just chaos from there until the storm died down  

Then on Sunday  more huge storms produced literally dozens of tornadoes across the region 

Severe thunderstorms continued to rumble across parts of the U S  Sunday  damaging buildings in Louisiana after spawning more than three dozen reports of tornadoes across five states 
Several homes and businesses were damaged and power lines and trees were down throughout Evangeline Parish  Louisiana  after severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes moved through the area early Sunday morning  The town of Ville Platte  about 76 miles northwest of Baton Rouge  was especially hard hit 

Unfortunately  there is still more to come  In fact  an entirely new weather system will hit the middle of the country on Monday 

On Monday  a new system will develop off the High Plains and slide east into the Southern  NYSE SO  Plains  The dry line will interact with an increasingly moist and unstable air mass that will develop across parts of Texas  Oklahoma and Kansas 
Unfortunately  that means very favorable conditions for violent severe weather in parts of this region 

We are being told that the storms on Monday could affect nearly 50 million people 
For a long time I have been warning that global weather patterns are dramatically changing  but at first a lot of people wanted to argue that it wasn t true 
Well  these days the number of people that want to claim that I am wrong has gone way down 
Of course throughout all of human history weather patterns have always been changing  and so change isn t something that is new 
But the changes that we are witnessing in our time appear to be taking an apocalyptic turn  and nobody is exactly sure what is going to happen next ",2019-05-20,Michael T.

175973,397489,SO,3 Reasons Why Southern First  SFST  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Southern  NYSE SO  First  SFST  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this holding company for Southern First Bank a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Southern First is 17 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Southern First is 62 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 33  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 28 5  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Southern First  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Southern First a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Southern First is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-southern-first-sfst-is-a-great-growth-stock-200423535,200423535
175980,397496,SO,Seven U S  states  District of Columbia sue to block SEC rule change,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Seven U S  states and the District of Columbia on Monday sued to block rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  that would allow brokers to recommend products that benefit them as long as they disclose the conflict 
The package of rules  approved in a vote by the SEC  require brokerage firms to disclose potential conflicts of interests in the fees investors pay and the commissions brokers earn when giving financial advice 
The rules  which will be implemented by June 30  2020  also require brokers to have a higher standard to meet a client s best interest when recommending stocks  mutual funds and other financial products 
In a filing in the U S  District Court in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  the states of New York  California  Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  New Mexico  Oregon and the District of Columbia argued that the rule change is  arbitrary and capricious  
 Among the harms they will suffer  Plaintiffs will lose revenue from the taxable portions of distributions from their residents  investment and retirement accounts that are worth less because of expensive conflicts of interest in investment advice   the states wrote in the court filing 
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The SEC s vote comes at the end of a 10 year battle over regulations on the investment advice industry  Last year  lobby groups successfully sued to overturn the similar fiduciary standard proposed by the Labor Department 
Republican appointed SEC Chairman Jay Clayton called the rule changes  long overdue   but investor advocates have said the rules remain too vague in their definition of  best interest  and do not address all investment advice conflicts ",2019-09-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/seven-us-states-district-of-columbia-sue-to-block-sec-rule-change-1974067,1974067
175981,397497,SO,U S  credits Mexico  Central America for sharp drop in border arrests,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Monday credited Mexico and Central American countries with helping to cut U S  border arrests by nearly 60  from a record high earlier this year but then lashed out at a federal judge for ruling against a strict anti asylum policy  With President Donald Trump s anti immigration policy shaping up as an issue in his 2020 re election campaign  Mark Morgan  the acting commissioner of U S  Customs and Border Protection  said that 64 000 people were detained or turned back at the southwest border in August  That was down 22  from July and 56  from a high mark in May  Even so  the total was the highest for any month of August in more than a decade  as Central American migrants have headed north in record numbers  many seeking asylum from impoverished countries with some of the highest murder rates in the world  A decade ago  migrants were mostly Mexican  But in recent years they have been overtaken by Central Americans  mostly from the so called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  The Trump administration has been pressuring all of those countries to do more to keep people from reaching the U S  border  threatening Mexico with tariffs unless it complied  The United States has persuaded Guatemala to become a so called safe third country that would accept asylum seekers  though the deal has yet to be ratified by Guatemala s government  in a bid to reduce the strain on the United States  Washington is working with Honduras on a similar agreement   The United States has failed to persuade Mexico to do the same  Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard reiterated Mexico s rejection of the status on Monday after Morgan said talks were ongoing for a  cooperative agreement  with Mexico to help stem the tide of migrants   In the meantime  Mexico has agreed to keep Central American asylum seekers just south of the U S  border pending their U S  court appointments and has deployed National Guard officers to halt them   Ebrard is to meet with U S  officials on Tuesday to discuss Mexico s efforts  He said last week that Mexico does not expect the United States to threaten tariffs at this time   Right now Mexico has been doing a great job for us  and  frankly  we re very appreciative  but we ve also been very  pretty rapidly changing the regulations  the rules   Trump told reporters at the White House  Earlier on Monday  a U S  judge dealt Trump a setback  ruling that an injunction against a restrictive rule on asylum seekers should apply nationwide  The rule  unveiled on July 15  requires most immigrants who want asylum in the United States to seek asylum first in a third country they had traversed on their way  San Francisco based U S  District Judge Jon Tigar had previously issued a nationwide injunction blocking the rule  But the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed it to only border states within its jurisdiction   California and Arizona   and sent the question back to Tigar  On Monday  Tigar ruled it should apply across the entire border  pending a trial on the underlying legality of the Trump administration rule  In a statement on Monday evening  the White House said the ruling  is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers   adding that the administration hopes the Supreme Court will set aside the injunction in its entirety   Morgan criticized Tigar for his ruling and what he called  unprecedented judicial activism   He lamented that with each new administration policy to  address this crisis  we end up getting enjoined  It s very  very frustrating  but we re just going to keep going   Opponents of Trump s immigration policy praised the judge s ruling  saying that previously  asylum seekers could be arbitrarily barred  based on where they happened to cross the border

175985,397501,SO,Factbox  Will sparks fly  Five things to watch at the third Democratic debate,news,"By Ginger Gibson
 Reuters    Leading Democratic White House contenders Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will share the stage for the first time on Thursday when the top 10 candidates for the party s presidential nomination meet in a debate in Houston 
Twenty Democrats continue to vie for their party s nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020  but party rules about polling and fundraising resulted in only half of them qualifying for the debate in Houston 
All of the top 10 Democrats will debate on one night  allowing voters to take stock of the leaders side by side 
Here are some key moments to watch for during the debate 
THE TOP THREE
The condensed debate stage will generate some first time matchups  but arguably the most anticipated is the one between former Vice President Biden  the leader in most opinion polls  and U S  Senator Warren of Massachusetts  who is nipping at his heels 
The two exemplify the ideological divide between the moderate and liberal wings of the Democratic Party  and the central question voters face in the 2020 primary race  Between pledges to restore pre Trump normalcy  or embark on ambitious reform  what is a better ticket to defeat Trump in the November 2020 election 
Warren s recent gain on U S  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in polls has also raised speculation that the two friends and progressive allies could abandon their agreement to not criticize one another 
 In Detroit  those two somewhat teamed up to defend the progressive flag of the party  Given the state of the race today  I will keep an eye on whether Sanders decides to draw a sharper contrast with Warren   said Joel Payne  a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016 
For U S  Senator Kamala Harris of California and South Bend  Indiana  Mayor Pete Buttigieg  the debate presents a narrowing set of chances to break through into the top tier 
Buttigieg  needs a moment  he needs to engage in the way that people like and that shows that he s the kind of person who  for example  could take on Trump   said Bob Shrum  a political science professor at the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California and former Democratic strategist 
HOURS WITHOUT A GAFFE 
Biden enters the his third debate atop the field  even after his first two debate performances were criticized as lackluster  while his campaign has had to fend off questions about repeated misstatements on the campaign trail 
In the second debate in July  Biden fully embraced his role at the race s centrist  criticizing his opponents for pulling the field to the left 
At that time  Biden benefited from the chorus of other moderates joining his defense  But now  those candidates are off the stage and Biden may have to make the centrist case himself 
Biden  76  has also faced questions from some voters about his age and whether he has the stamina to make it through a lengthy and taxing presidential race  In Houston  he will be standing next to Sanders  78  the oldest candidate in the field 
 Biden will likely continue to take a page from Donald Trump in 2016  If you ll remember  Trump essentially  just treaded water in the debates   said Payne 
 He never won any debate but he managed to stay above the fray  Biden is likely hoping that he can ride a similar strategy to get through a splintered Dem primary  
WHAT DOES SHE STAND FOR 
The candidate who has benefited the most from the debates so far is Harris   but after a well reviewed performance in the first round  she watched the lead she amassed dwindle by the second debate when she pulled off a less than stellar showing  Heading into the third debate  she is struggling to break through to the top of the field 
A September Reuters Ipsos poll found that Harris and Buttigieg were tied with 4  support of Democrats and independents   a big drop for the senator  who once registered at 10  
In the first debate she attacked  In the second debate she was attacked  Now  she is under pressure to articulate what she stands for 
 In the second debate she was not very effective when she was challenged  I myself can t quite figure out what her message is other than I was a prosecutor and I can prosecute Trump   which is a pretty thin message   Shrum said 
CLOSING WINDOW
For the candidates in the bottom half  such as former U S  Housing Secretary Julian Castro  U S  Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey and business leader Andrew Yang  the debate provides one of their only chances to try to change the public perception of their candidacy 
One way to do that is to try and land a blow on leading rivals  such as when Harris effectively attacked Biden over his record on race at the first debate in Miami 
But ultimately  since most of these low polling candidates have positioned themselves between the Biden represented centrist establishment and the left wing led by Warren and Sanders  they will struggle to gain momentum unless Biden declines  experts say 
The window is closing  Shrum warns 
 For those folks to break through  Biden has to fade and if he s going to fade  he has to start doing this in this debate because he has shown incredible resilience   Shrum said 
DUELING OVER HEALTHCARE
What the nation s healthcare system should look like has proven to be the most divisive topic during the first two debates 
That could remain the case on Thursday  after the latest government report showed on Tuesday that the share of Americans without health insurance rose for the first time in a decade last year 
About 27 5 million Americans  or 8 5  of people  did not have health insurance in 2018  an increase of almost 2 million from the year before when 7 9  of people lacked coverage  the Census Bureau report found   Read story  
The most liberal candidates like Warren and Sanders are advocating a complete government takeover of health insurance  a system that would eliminate private insurance and raise taxes 
But the more centrist wing of the party  led by Biden and joined by Klobuchar  say that a public option should be available to whoever would like to have it but should not be mandated  Biden argues that the national electorate is not interested in a government takeover of health insurance ",2019-09-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/factbox-will-sparks-fly-five-things-to-watch-at-the-third-democratic-debate-1975920,1975920
175986,397502,SO,Britain won t run out of toilet paper but fruit could be in short supply after Brexit,news,"By Alistair Smout and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON  Reuters    Britain is unlikely to run out of essentials like toilet paper in the event of a no deal Brexit but some fresh fruit and vegetables could be in short supply and prices might rise  warned supermarket bosses on Thursday 
Retailers John Lewis  and Co Operative Group  and the government s reluctant publication of a report late on Wednesday  shed light on what shoppers might expect to find  or not find on supermarket shelves after October 31 
The government has demanded that supermarkets prepare for a potentially chaotic no deal Brexit by stockpiling food  but supermarket bosses say it is almost impossible to store fresh food for any length of time and people might not find everything they want on the shelves 
Steve Murrells  Chief Executive of the Co op  said that the firm had secured extra storage space but he expected shortages in some fresh food and subsequent price rises 
 We are very clear on where we think inflation will come through  which will be  in the main  fruit   he said 
 We would be stockpiling the essential items that you would expect  Water  toilet paper  long life cans  
Murrells said that fruit like apples  pears  blueberries and strawberries might have to be transported more expensively via air freight from the Southern  NYSE SO  hemisphere to avoid congested ports 
The availability of vegetables in Britain is also at risk as the European Union provides some 86  of lettuces and 70  of tomatoes  according to the British Retail Consortium  BRC  
 Clearly    in short life fresh produce that s imported from Europe  that would be harder  if the flow of stock is interrupted   Rob Collins  the managing director of John Lewis  supermarket group Waitrose  told reporters 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on Oct  31  and has said he will not ask for a delay despite lawmakers voting that he seeks one to avoid a no deal Brexit 
The  Operation Yellowhammer  report on the worst case scenario released by the government pointed to potential problems snarling up cross Channel trade routes and disrupting supplies of fresh food 
John Lewis Chairman Charlie Mayfield said the assessment chimed with what his department store and supermarket group expected from a no deal scenario 
 The publication of the Yellowhammer documents gives a bit more insight  but frankly I don t think it tells us anything particularly new that we didn t already know   Mayfield told reporters after warning that the impact of a no deal Brexit could be  significant  
Mayfield went on to say that the continuing uncertainty meant that consumer confidence had taken a battering and John Lewis was seeing a reluctance by consumers to make big ticket purchases in its department stores 
David Potts  Chief Executive of grocer Morrisons  agreed that consumer confidence was weak but the grocer is somewhat shielded from any Brexit chaos as two thirds of what it sells is British 
While supermarkets say they are restricted in what goods they can stockpile  there might be some solace in the fact that they say so far  customers have shown little sign of panic buying ",2019-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/britain-wont-run-out-of-toilet-paper-but-fruit-could-be-in-short-supply-after-brexit-1976496,1976496
175992,397508,SO,NFL notebook  Pats  Raiders reportedly were unaware of AB civil matter,news,"Neither the New England Patriots nor the Oakland Raiders were aware of rape allegations involving Antonio Brown until a civil sexual assault lawsuit was filed by Britney Taylor  ESPN reported Thursday 
Representatives for Brown and Taylor have had discussions over the past few months but agreed to keep those discussions confidential before the suit was filed  sources told ESPN 
The confidentiality agreement could provide an explanation for Brown not notifying the Raiders nor the Patriots before he signed with New England on Monday 
The NFL plans to meet next week with Taylor  according to ESPN  Taylor  Brown s former trainer  filed the lawsuit with the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Florida  accusing the wide receiver of sexually assaulting her on three occasions 
  Quarterback Sam Darnold is out indefinitely with mono and will not play Monday when the New York Jets host the Cleveland Browns  But that s only the beginning of the bad news spreading for New York 
Darnold could wind up missing more than just one game  coach Adam Gase said  and he has already lost weight  The Jets play the New England Patriots in Week 3 before a bye the following week 
Le Veon Bell played his first NFL game in 20 months last week  and the new Jets running back appeared to hold up fine  Gase said Bell would not practice because of a sore shoulder  and ESPN s Adam Schefter reported Bell was scheduled for an MRI exam  ESPN s Jeremy Fowler reported the exam was  mostly precautionary  and didn t show any major damage or tears 
  Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr  accused New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams  NYSE WMB  of encouraging  dirty hits  and said the coach s tactics cost him much of the 2017 season 
Beckham injured his ankle in a 2017 preseason game against the Browns  whose defense was coached by Williams  The receiver  then with the New York Giants  eventually broke the ankle and missed 12 games that year 
 I had players on this team telling me that s what he was telling them to do  take me out of the game  and it s preseason   Beckham told reporters   So you just know who he is  That s the man who s calling the plays  
  San Francisco rookie edge rusher Nick Bosa plans to play Sunday at Cincinnati  49ers general manager John Lynch said 
Bosa hasn t practiced this week due to ankle soreness  Lynch said the No  2 overall pick in April s NFL draft aggravated his injury on the first snap in last week s 31 17 win at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
 He ll work kind of limited throughout the week  but he s fully intending on playing   Lynch said on 95 7 The Game  via the San Francisco Chronicle   As far as the snaps  we ll kind of see how that goes

175993,397509,SO,Lepidico  Acquisition  Rights Offer And Gulf Fluor Alliance,opinion,"Lepidico  AX LPD  has  this week  announced a trio of transformative initiatives  The first of these is an all share offer to acquire Desert Lion  V DLI   according to which LPD will pay 5 4 shares for every one Desert Lion share  The second is a supply and marketing alliance with Gulf Fluor for the supply of sulphuric acid  including the provision of land for the construction and operation of Lepidico s Phase 1 Plant project in Abu Dhabi  The third is a one for nine renounceable rights issue involving the issue of up to 372 9m new shares in Lepidico at A 0 029 share to raise A 10 8m 

Full integration de risks investment proposition
In contrast to its relationship with Grupo Mota at Alvarr es  the proposed Desert Lion merger will transform Lepidico into a fully integrated mining and processing entity by providing it with a direct  controlling interest in a lepidolite deposit under an awarded mining licence  In conferring ownership of a mine  the merger will therefore de risk Lepidico as an investment proposition from a strategic perspective as well as from an operational perspective  since its L Max plants will not then be dependent on a single source of lepidolite supply 
Advantages of locating Phase 1 plant in Abu Dhabi
Specific operating advantages for Lepidico of locating its Phase 1 plant project in Abu Dhabi include the fact that sulphuric acid can be piped directly from Gulf Fluor s plant to Lepidico s L Max plant  land rents and labour are cheap relative to Sudbury and it offers world class  established infrastructure  including power  gas  water  developed roads  storage and logistics hubs that have easy access to multiple ports and airports  Finally  Abu Dhabi also has a  plug and play  approach towards new industrial developments  which means that the approvals and permitting process is expected to be completed within three months 
Valuation  6 84c share pending 
It is our intention to update our forecasts and valuation shortly to account for this trio of new developments  In our last report  entitled Alvarr es resource increases 290   published on 12 April 2019  we estimated that execution of a 7t hour  5 000tpa  Phase 1 plant would result in free cash flow to Lepidico of A 71 2m per year once steady state production had been achieved  which we valued at A 0 0684 share  after assuming US 30m  A 41 8m  of equity funding at the then prevailing share price of 3 1c  Note that this valuation did not ascribe any value to the Phase 2 plant or other development options 


Business description
Lepidico provides exposure to a portfolio of lithium assets via its wholly owned properties  JVs and IP in Australia  Canada and Europe  Uniquely  it has successfully produced lithium carbonate from non traditional hard rock lithium bearing minerals using its registered L Max process technology 
Three transformative announcements
Lepidico has  this week  announced three transformative initiatives to develop its business 
An all share offer for Desert Lion  TSXV  DLI   whereby LPD will pay 5 4 shares for every one  1  Desert Lion share  representing a 38  premium based on the closing prices of Lepidico and Desert Lion shares on 3 May or a 39  premium based on the 10 trading day volume weighted average price of the share  and valuing the latter at A 20 3m  C 19 2m  US 14 2m  at the time of writing 
A supply and marketing alliance with Gulf Fluor for the supply of sulphuric acid  including the provision of land for the construction and operation of Lepidico s Phase 1 Plant project in Abu Dhabi 
A one for nine renounceable rights issue involving the issue of up to 372 9m new shares at A 0 029 share and 186 5m new listed options  exercisable at a price of A 0 05 share in three years  time  in Lepidico to raise A 10 8m  Investors should note that Edison calculates a Black Scholes valuation for the options  using Lepidico s annual historical share price volatility  of 1 4c apiece  ie equivalent to a value of 0 7c per share  there being half a new option issued per new share  
Proposed Desert Lion acquisition
Background
Desert Lion Energy is an emerging lithium development company and early stage producer focused on building Namibia s first large scale lithium mine  Its lithium projects are located in Namibia approximately 210km west of Windhoek  240km east of the deep water port of Walvis Bay and 25km south of the mining town of Karibib  which provides the project with a reliable source of skilled and semi skilled labour and logistical support  The company s historical Rubicon and Helikon lithium mines are located within a 301km2 prospective land package and have been variously operated for the ceramics  glass and battery industries since the 1960s  The project site is accessible year round by road and has access to power  water  rail  port  airport and communication infrastructure 
A summary of the company s resources  currently defined to NI 43 101  but not JORC 2012  standards  at its historic Rubicon and Helikon deposits is as follows 

The mineral resource estimate described in Exhibit 1 was prepared by independent consultants The MSA Group  Pty  Ltd of South Africa  and was estimated in accordance with Canadian NI 43 101 requirements and reported to the TSX V on 12 October 2018  Drilling at Rubicon in support of the mineral resource estimate comprised 142 diamond and RC holes on a general 50m x 50m grid  totalling over 10 000m  including 35 channel samples  At Helikon 1  diamond and RC holes were drilled on a staggered 40m x 20m grid  with 50 holes drilled over a total of 3 760m  including 36 channel samples  At Helikons 2 5  a total of 71 diamond drill holes were completed  totalling 7 700m and including 28 channel samples taken at Helikon 2  3 and 4  In addition to the hard rock deposits  a mineral resource of 69 4kt at a grade of 0 95  Li2O was reported for the Rubicon slimes in the indicated  89 6  of the total by tonnage  and inferred  10 4   categories  Lepidico is of the opinion that there is sufficient information to undertake a JORC Code 2012 compliant mineral resource estimate  Nevertheless  as a matter of priority  it is Lepidico s intention  once the merger is completed  to undertake a programme of drilling to further increase the density and confidence of the data to a level to enable classification of a JORC Code 2012 compliant resource in the measured and or indicated categories in order to facilitate a subsequent ore reserve estimate 
Lithium mineralisation at Rubicon and Helikon is contained within highly fractionated and well zoned LCT type pegmatites in the Karibib Pegmatite Belt  The main lithium minerals present are  predominantly  lepidolite with petalite and  minor  amblygonite  While Desert Lion s original business plan was predicated on using conventional roasting technology  as part of its due diligence process  Lepidico conducted metallurgical test work with its technology partner  Strategic Metallurgy  that showed the lepidolite mineralisation at Rubicon and Helikon to be amenable to concentration and conversion to battery grade lithium carbonate using Lepidico s proprietary L Max  hydrometallurgical process technology  In the case of the sample in question  test work demonstrated 94  lithium extraction from concentrate and production of lithium carbonate with 99 8  purity 
On 1 November 2018  Desert Lion published the results of a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on its Namibian Lithium project  For an initial capital expenditure of US 275m  it calculated that the project had a pre tax NPV8 of US 144m and a pre tax internal rate of return of 29  at a lithium carbonate price of US 13 000 t 
Finally  Desert Lion also has a non binding offtake agreement for lithium hydroxide with German multi national BASF 
Strategic rationale
Under the terms of its agreement with Grupo Mota at Alvarr es  announced on 9 March 2017   Lepidico undertook expenditure of at least  250 000 over an 18 month exclusive period with the goal of defining a JORC compliant mineral resource of  1Mt at a grade of 1 5  Li2O  which it achieved in December 2017   In return  Lepidico has an exclusive  pre emptive right for three years in which to effect a commercial relationship with Grupo Mota regarding the supply of ore concentrate from Alvarr es to Lepidico and or the right for Lepidico to develop and operate a lithium mica mining and concentration project there  By contrast  the Desert Lion merger will create a fully integrated mining and processing entity by providing Lepidico with a direct  controlling interest in a lepidolite deposit under an awarded mining licence  In conferring ownership of a mine  the merger will therefore de risk Lepidico as an investment proposition from a strategic perspective  It will also de risk it from an operational perspective  since its L Max plants will not then be required to be dependent on a single source of lepidolite supply 
While either deposit  Alvarr es or Rubicon Helikon  could support Lepidico s Phase 1 plant for c 14 years  both hold out the possibility of doubling the project life from c 14 years to 25 30 years and or simultaneously expanding it  While the costs of mining mica in Namibia may be expected to be lower than the equivalent costs in Portugal  the potential to blend ore from two different sources together also creates the possibility of lowering operating costs at the process plant as well 
In addition  while its historical Rubicon and Helikon mines are located within a 301km2 prospective land package  Desert Lion holds a strategic land package of over 1 000km2 of contiguous  exclusive prospecting licences covering a large portion of the underexplored  highly prospective Karibib and Southern  NYSE SO  pegmatite belts that contain numerous lithium caesium tantalum  LCT  type occurrences 
Finally  a sample of c 20 000t of Desert Lion lepidolite has already been transported to Perth for processing in Lepidico s pilot plant 
Valuation considerations
Pursuant to the transaction  Lepidico anticipates issuing 633 8m shares to Desert Lion shareholders  equivalent to 18 9  of LPD s currently outstanding capital   see Exhibit 5   implying an equity acquisition value of A 20 3m  C 19 2m  US 14 2m  at the time of writing  This compares to Desert Lion s balance sheet as at end December 2018  the last date for which Desert Lion s financial statements were available   as follows 

As at 31 December 2018  Desert Lion had 89 1m shares in issue  resulting in a book value of 12 8 Canadian cents per share  Since that date  Desert Lion has 
issued 16 7m shares to repay C 3 3m in debts in March April 2019  and
issued 11 5m shares in payment of C 1 1m in debts in April 2019 
This takes shares in issue  excluding any warrant and or option exercises  etc  to 117 2m 
In the year to 31 December 2018  Desert Lion made a loss of C 13 6m  in this case  largely financed via changes in working capital  before C 15 3m of expenditure in investing activities 
Inherent in the consideration payable by Lepidico for Desert Lion is C 7 8m in goodwill  relative to DLI s December 2018 balance sheet   However  it can be seen that consideration is otherwise relatively close to the value of assets acquired less unearned revenue and the liability related to DLI s convertible  Unearned revenue is secured against broken lepidolite stockpiles  old tailings not included in the resource  and   assuming the Chinese lithium carbonate price recovers   these stocks may be rehandled and shipped  thereby offsetting the prepayment and possibly providing some modest revenue  In the meantime  DLI has a C 5m  face value  convertible note with AIP Asset Management  of which C 4m is convertible at the exchange ratio into 108m Lepidico shares post deal close  with the balance of C 1m being due in cash in December 2020 
Alternatively  consideration could be expressed as US 103 53 per attributable tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent resource acquired  including Rubicon slimes   This is a premium to the average value of US 53 84 t for non spodumene  non brine lithium deposits that Edison calculated in its annual report  Gold stars and black holes  Analysing the discount  From resource to sanction  published in January 2019  However  it is broadly consistent with the value of US 130 16 t calculated for non spodumene  non brine lithium in the measured category of resources  Excluding all other assets therefore  Lepidico s purchase consideration of DLI could be said to discount an approximately 100  increase in the size of the latter s resource or the resource s being upgraded into the measured category in its entirety 
By contrast  applying the values calculated in our report  Gold stars and black holes  Analysing the discount  From resource to sanction  published in January 2019  to DLI s resource  including the Rubicon slimes  implies a value  attributable to the company  of between C 6 4m and C 10 0m  cf the C 6 3m book value at which those assets are held on the balance sheet   see Exhibit 2   As such  and given the other assets being acquired  eg banks of flotation cells  mills  a mining lease  water bores  roads etc   as well as DLI s resource upside and upgrade potential and the contribution that it is able to make to Lepidico s L Max plant feed  the consideration being paid by LPD for DLI could be described as full  but fair 
Timing
A comparison of Lepidico s and Desert Lion s share prices  in US cents  since June 2018 would suggest that the timing of the merger is propitious from Lepidico s perspective 

Supply and marketing alliance with Gulf Fluor
In addition to its proposed merger with Desert Lion  on 7 May  Lepidico also announced a supply and marketing alliance with Gulf Fluor for the supply of sulphuric acid and land for the construction and operation of Lepidico s Phase 1 plant project  Gulf Fluor operates a large industrial plant in the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi  ICAD  and is the largest producer of sulphuric acid  a critical reagent in the L Max process  with an output rate of 140 000tpa in the region  In addition  it owns a large parcel of land in ICAD  on which it is proposed that Lepidico could construct its Phase 1 plant project   has its own dedicated wharf and offers marketing expertise for chemical by products of the process 
Specific operating advantages for Lepidico of locating its Phase 1 plant project in the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi therefore include  but are not limited to  the following 
Sulphuric acid could be directly piped from Gulf Fluor s plant to Lepidico s L Max plant without the need for land hauled transportation 
ICAD land rents and labour are cheap relative to Sudbury in Canada  the alternative location under consideration  
ICAD offers world class  established infrastructure  including power  gas  water  developed roads  storage and logistics hubs that have easy access to multiple ports and airports 
ICAD is capable of supplying all of the consumables and services  eg gas and labour  that Lepidico s Phase 1 plant would require at a cost that has been identified as being lower than in Sudbury  Among other things  for example  Lepidico has identified a lime plant  also a key reagent for L Max  almost directly opposite its proposed site at ICAD 
Gulf Fluor can provide marketing knowledge and relationships for a number of by products of Lepidico s chemical processes in the region  eg sulphate of potash  or SOP  and amorphous silica  
ICAD itself provides a ready market for a number of L Max and S Max  products  eg in the form of the cement industry situated there  
Logistics costs for shipping concentrate from both Namibia and Portugal to ICAD are estimated to be lower than to Sudbury 
ICAD has adopted a  plug and play  approach towards new industrial developments  an environmental baseline study has therefore already been conducted for the site in question and the approvals and permitting process is expected to be completed within three months 
A number of key Lepidico personnel  including the managing director  Joe Walsh  have worked in Abu Dhabi in the past and report a good working relationship with Gulf Fluor already 
Apart from the obvious  eg fiscal  employment  economic  etc   advantages for Gulf Fluor and the United Arab Emirates in Lepidico locating its Phase 1 plant project in ICAD include 
The  effective  reinvestment of petro dollars into electric vehicle technology   arguably a natural hedge 
The opportunity for Gulf Fluor to diversify from its industrial chemicals base into speciality and battery metals 
Consequences of recent initiatives on feasibility study and development
Within the last few months  Lepidico has undertaken a number of initiatives that will affect the timing of its feasibility study on the Phase 1 plant project  These include 
The extension of the Phase 1 plant project feasibility study to incorporate an LOH Max  circuit for the production of lithium hydroxide  cf lithium carbonate from the L Max plant alone  
The evaluation of a plant development at ICAD

Lepidico s ICAD trade off study is anticipated to be complete in the second half of 2019  The engineering required to incorporate an LOH Max circuit into the plant is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019  Ore reserve delineation  mine design and scheduling at Alvarr es is expected to be finalised in early 2020  Once these studies are completed  they will then be incorporated into the final feasibility study in early 2020 at the same time that Lepidico will be seeking to finalise its offtake and financing arrangements 
Sudbury
Until the ICAD trade off study is complete  however  the feasibility study will continue to contemplate the base case scenario of locating the plant in Sudbury  Moreover  while the approvals and permitting process in particular favours the near term development of the Phase 1 plant project at ICAD  in the longer term  Lepidico remains convinced of the benefits of developing a plant at Sudbury  with sulphuric acid being supplied by the two major nickel miners in the region  Vale and Glencore  LON GLEN   To this end  it is continuing to establish acid and lime supply agreements as well as navigating the permitting and approvals process in Sudbury at the same time as pursuing a scoping study for a full scale plant to follow the Phase 1 plant 
1 9 renounceable rights issue
In addition to its other announcements  on 7 May Lepidico announced that it is undertaking a 1 9 renounceable rights offer at a price of 2 9 Australian cents per share to raise A 10 8m via the issue of 372 9m new shares  plus half a warrant per share exercisable at 5 Australian cents per share at any time before the third anniversary of the date of issue   The offer is underwritten in the sum of A 3 0m by the lead manager and underwriter to the offer  CPS Capital Group  Relative to its pre announcement last  closing  price of 3 8c on 3 May  the 2 9c subscription price implies an ex rights price of 3 71c per share  excluding any value ascribed to the warrants  and therefore a value attributable to the rights of 0 81c share  Investors should note that Edison calculates a Black Scholes valuation of the options  using Lepidico s annual historical volatility  of 1 4c apiece  ie equivalent to a value of 0 7c per share  there being half a new option issued per new share  
Any entitlement not taken up pursuant to the offer will form the Shortfall Offer  whereby the related shares will be offered to investors at a price of 2 9c for up to three months following the closing date of the renounceable offer  currently 29 May  subject to extension  
The funds raised from the offer s  are anticipated to be applied as follows 

Lepidico has been advised that Galaxy Resources  its largest shareholder with a c 11 02  shareholding  intends to take up its full entitlement under the offer  Its second largest shareholder  Strategic Metallurgy  is currently understood not to be contemplating taking up its entitlements  This is not a surprise  given that it is a small  specialised metallurgical consulting firm and it is also consistent with its past approach to similar rights issues  However  its principal  Gary Johnson  is understood to intend to take up his rights  In addition  Lepidico s financial adviser  Bacchus Capital  has informed management of its intention to take up its rights under the entitlement offer 
Following completion of the offer and the proposed merger acquisition of Desert Lion  Lepidico will have the following number of shares in issue 

Valuation
It is our intention to update our forecasts and valuation shortly to account for all of these new initiatives  In our last report  Alvarr es resource increases 290   published on 12 April 2019  we estimated that execution of a 7t hour  5 000tpa  Phase 1 plant would result in free cash flow to Lepidico of A 71 2m per year once steady state production had been achieved  which we valued at A 0 0684 share  after assuming US 30m  A 41 8m  of equity funding at the then prevailing share price of 3 1c share  Note that this valuation did not ascribe any value to the Phase 2 plant or other development options ",2019-05-10,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lepidico-acquisition-rights-offer-and-gulf-fluor-alliance-200419982,200419982

Two Yemeni officials said the Saudi statement came after the talks  in the Red Sea city of Jeddah  reached a dead end and both sides were gathering troops to prepare for further battle 
Leaders of the Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC   backed by Abu Dhabi  rejected the inclusion of their forces under the authority of the Saudi backed government  they said 
The STC has tens of thousands of fighters armed and trained by UAE s armed forces 
 The situation is headed towards war  so be ready people of the south    Talks have failed  war is declared   the STC s Security Belt forces said in a twitter post early on Friday 
The talks also stalled over the separatists  role in the government  after the separatists asked for the vice president position along with two major ministries  Yemen s current vice president is Ali Mohsen Al Ahmar  a politically powerful army general allied with Hadi 
BREAKAWAY MOVEMENT
Yemen s information minister  Moammar al Eryani  declined to give details on the talks  but said  the STC s demands mean legitimizing taking up arms against the State  
 We cannot accept the existence of armed groups outside the government s authority  it is against the constitution and the law   Eryani added 
Abu Dhabi and an STC spokesman did not immediately respond to Reuters  requests for comment 
The breakaway movement is part of the Saudi led coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore Hadi s government which was ousted from power by the Houthis in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 
But the separatists seek independence and turned on the government in early August and captured Aden  its interim base  Southern fighters have clashed with government forces elsewhere in the south as they tried to extend their reach 
On Thursday  the separatists organized a rally in Aden where thousands of Yemenis gathered in support of the UAE  The Gulf state last week openly intervened to support the separatists by launching air strikes on government forces as they tried to recapture Aden  forcing them to withdraw 
Saudi Arabia called on both sides to refocus on battling the Houthis  who hold the capital Sanaa and most major urban centers  Saudi ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al Jaber on Friday urged both sides to commit to the dialogue and avoid bloodshed 
But both sides are gathering troops and preparing military hardware for battle  local officials said  In the oil producing Shabwa province  government forces have been preparing to recapture the neighboring Abyan region and the port city Aden ",2019-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/talks-to-end-violent-south-yemen-power-struggle-stall-officials-1972143,1972143

176031,397547,SO,Can Southern Co   SO  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Southern Co   SO   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this power company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 5 35   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Southern Co  Was expected to post earnings of  0 24 per share  but it reported  0 25 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 17   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 07 per share  while it actually produced  1 14 per share  a surprise of 6 54  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Southern Co In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Southern Co  Has an Earnings ESP of  0 10  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-southern-co-so-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200409621,200409621
176032,397548,SO,Southern Co   SO  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Southern Co   SO  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 78 billion  down 9 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 41  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co 
For Southern Co The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Southern Co  Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern Co  Would post earnings of  0 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering a surprise of  4 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern Co  Appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southern-co-so-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200410201,200410201

176038,397554,SO,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Kansas City Southern  KSU  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for KSU that show why this railroad company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For KSU  shares are up 5 62  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 0 67  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 21  compares favorably with the industry s 3 08  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Kansas City Southern have risen 17 74   and are up 16 69  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 10 88  and 12 34   respectively 
Investors should also take note of KSU s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  KSU is averaging 1 026 701 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with KSU 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KSU s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 78 to  6 83 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that KSU is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Kansas City Southern on your short list ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-kansas-city-southern-ksu-is-a-great-choice-200412265,200412265

 If we re going to help prevent mass tragedy  we need to keep guns off the black market  We need to help local  state and federal law enforcement better coordinate responses to potential threats of mass violence   said a Republican committee aide  who requested anonymity ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/us-house-targets-convergence-of-mass-shootings-hate-crimes-1967222,1967222
176046,397562,SO,Yemeni separatists arrest dozens of government loyalists in Aden,news,"ADEN  Reuters    Southern  NYSE SO  Yemeni separatists said they arrested dozens of government loyalists in Aden on Saturday after President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi s forces withdrew from the port city following air strikes by the United Arab Emirates 
The outbreak of hostilities between Yemen s Saudi backed government and the UAE backed separatists is the latest twist in a multi faceted war in Yemen pitting several factions and armies against each other 
The separatists and Hadi s government are nominal allies in a Saudi led coalition fighting Yemen s Iran aligned Houthi movement in a broader regional conflict 
On Thursday  UAE warplanes bombed Yemeni government forces in Aden  shifting the balance of power in a month long battle between the separatists and Hadi for control of the city and southern Yemeni provinces  Hadi s forces withdrew from Aden after the air strikes  which killed at least 45 soldiers 
After the pull out  forces of the separatist Southern Transitional Council raided homes and businesses  arrested  scores  of pro government activists  politicians and clerics  accusing them of  terrorism   STC officials and witnesses said 
On Saturday  an edgy calm returned to Aden but separatist fighters were patrolling the streets and seen carrying out more arrests across the city  four residents told Reuters 
Hadi s government said the arrests were  politically motivated   An STC security source denied this  saying dozens of  terrorists and outlaws  had been rounded up 
Though a key part of the anti Houthi coalition  the UAE has been hostile to Hadi as his government includes Islamists seen as close to the Muslim Brotherhood  which the Gulf state has sought to neutralize cross the Middle East and North Africa 
Abu Dhabi has armed and trained tens of thousands of separatists who seek to restore the South Yemen republic which merged with the north in 1990 
A suicide bomber on a motorcycle killed six separatist fighters on the outskirts of Aden on Friday in an attack claimed by Islamic State militants 
Saudi Arabia has called for a summit to end the conflict over Aden  which has thwarted U N  efforts to end a war that has driven Yemen to the brink of famine and is seen as a proxy struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia for regional dominance 
The Saudi led  Sunni Muslim coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis  who ousted Hadi s government from power in the capital Sanaa in northern Yemen  The conflict has been largely stalemated on the ground since then ",2019-08-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/yemeni-separatists-arrest-dozens-of-government-loyalists-in-aden-1967798,1967798
176047,397563,SO,NASCAR notebook  Hamlin comfortable as playoff favorite,news,"If you tout Denny Hamlin as a favorite to win the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship this season  don t expect the driver of the No  11 Joe Gibbs racing Toyota to contradict you 
 We certainly have a great shot   Hamlin said Saturday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina  site of Sunday s Bojangles  Southern  NYSE SO  500  6 p m  ET on NBCSN  MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio    I like our chances each and every weekend against anyone  
Recent results back up that assertion  Hamlin picked up his fourth victory of the season Aug  17 at Bristol Motor Speedway  where he passed Matt DiBenedetto with 11 laps left and pulled away for the win  Hamlin has accumulated 23 playoff points  tied for second in the series with Joe Gibbs racing teammate Martin Truex Jr  and six behind leader Kyle Busch  another teammate 
 We won t have as many points at Kyle  unless we win the next two races  but we ll be close   Hamlin said   Certainly  closer than we ve ever been as far as playoff points are concerned  That s obviously very crucial to get you past those first couple rounds  if you have a bad race  
Hamlin hasn t had many bad races recently  He s riding a string of six straight top five finishes that includes victories at Pocono and Bristol 
Consequently  winning the next two events isn t that far fetched  especially considering his record at Darlington  where Hamlin has two Cup victories and an average finishing position of 6 2    not to mention five wins and nine top fives in 11 NASCAR Xfinity starts 
 I want to win as many races I can  especially after not winning any last year   Hamlin said   We want to take advantage of every single opportunity we can to win  and certainly over the last eight weeks  when you look at what we consider our best finishing position potential  it s all been a string of  1s   I think certainly we want to capitalize on every single one  
Missing postseason a blessing for Johnson 
Sure  Jimmie Johnson wants to qualify for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs this year 
And  certainly  he d like to keep intact his unique streak of advancing to the NASCAR postseason every year there has been a postseason 
Realistically  though  the seven time series champion faces an uphill battle if he hopes to race for the title this year  In the throes of an 83 race winless streak  Johnson is 18th in the standings  26 points behind Daniel Suarez in 16th and 24 behind Clint Bowyer in 17th 
Johnson would have to pass both drivers in the next two races to claim the 16th and final playoff spot  provided there are no new winners among those behind him in the standings  That s a tall order 
Should Johnson s enviable playoff streak end  however  there might be a silver lining  He and new crew chief Cliff Daniels would have 10 races to work on improvements for 2020  the final year of Johnson s contract with Hendrick Motorsports 
 It s really about building this team and getting it right for the next year    for the 2020 season and getting back to Victory Lane   Johnson said   The goals kind of stay the same  but we all know the pressure is looming on us heavily right now to make the playoffs  If that pressure does go away  then I think we will be able to speed up the learning process amongst each other 
 I hope it doesn t go away  because that means we made the playoffs and have to stay alive in the playoffs  We d much rather have this pressure and keep evolving as a team than have it go away  
Clearly  keeping the playoff streak alive is the preferable outcome  and the driver of the No  48 Chevrolet hopes to make the next two races memorable 
 It s a story   Johnson said   I get it  Believe me  I want to keep my playoff streak alive  and I want to be a factor in the playoffs  I want to know what the outcome is  but it s not that I want to hurry up and get through it and have it go away  I want to race  I want to get out there and earn another victory and earn my way into these playoffs 
 That s what we re all here for  So  my optimism again  comes from that I just know where this team is right now  and I know where it s going  Unfortunately  we don t have any more time left  but we re going to finish up the year strong and that brings me a lot of excitement regardless of how the Playoffs unfold  
Newman  No regrets about Bristol battle with DiBenedetto
With roughly 40 laps left in the Aug  17 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway  Matt DiBenedetto held a 1 6 second lead over second place Denny Hamlin when DiBenedetto caught Ryan Newman s No  6 Ford  the last car on the lead lap 
DiBenedetto struggled to overtake Newman  generally regarded as one of the toughest drivers in the series to pass  Contact between the two vehicles tightened the handling of DiBenedetto s No  95 Toyota  whose lead had shrunk to  8 seconds by the time he cleared Newman s Mustang 
With 11 laps left  Hamlin caught and passed DiBenedetto for the win  spoiling a Cinderella story for the driver who had been told by Leavine Family Racing earlier in the week that his option wouldn t be picked up for 2020 
As might be expected  Newman received his share of criticism on social media  even though he was locked in close battle for a playoff spot and was fighting to stay on the lead lap 
 I think Kyle Busch would tell you the best  there s always going to be haters   Newman said on Friday at Darlington Raceway   I did what I needed to do to be competitive  I haven t seen any replays  I don t know exactly how he hit me twice in two separate straightaways in the right rear going down the straightaway 
 If I pinched him  or if he didn t give himself enough room or what  but in the end there was nothing intentional by me  Fans can choose whatever they want    I mean  there are thousands of fans that have come to Bristol to see crashes for years  so I m sorry I let them down  
Asked whether he felt a need to talk to DiBenedetto about the incident  Newman demurred 
 No  there s no reason to   he said

176048,397564,SO,NASCAR notebook  Earnhardt Jr  enjoys up close look at Xfinity competition,news,"DARLINGTON  S C    Dale Earnhardt Jr  has always had an eye for talent 
After all  Earnhardt helped launched Brad Keselowski s career by putting him in one of his NASCAR Xfinity Series cars  The same goes for Chase Elliott 
But on Saturday afternoon at Darlington Raceway  Earnhardt got a closer than usual look at the level of talent in the Xfinity Series and came away impressed  Competing in the Sport Clips Haircuts VFW 200 at the 1 366 mile track    his only start of the year    Earnhardt took particular note of the drivers who raced him side by side 
 I got to race with Brandon Jones a little bit  had a lot of fun racing him   Earnhardt said after scoring a fifth place finish   Got to run with a few guys  Everybody out there really impressed me  
In fact  that was the main takeaway for Earnhardt  who swapped positions with six time Xfinity winner Christopher Bell on several occasions during the race 
 The Xfinity Series has kind of always been the little brother to the Cup Series  but these cars are so challenging   Earnhardt said   Big respect to these guys that do it every single week  Even those cars that we re lapping  I know those damn cars aren t driving good  Those guys have their hands full  so big respect to everybody in this field from the front to the back  
Earnhardt also got a chance to feel out his own JR Motorsports equipment  which hasn t been performing to its usual consistently high standards this season 
 If I had to guess what our issue is  it s front aero  getting a little more downforce on the front half of the car   Earnhardt said   We couldn t get our car to turn the way we needed to  and we had to unhook the back to do that  and that s not what you want to be doing 
 So If I had to guess right now  I d say we have to get the front of the car to work better aerodynamically  
As much as he enjoyed the experience  Earnhardt said that Saturday s 200 miles around Darlington will probably be his last  preferring to try his hand at Homestead Miami Speedway next year 
For Earnhardt  the  Track Too Tough to Tame  is now the  Track Too Tough to Race  in his only start of the year 
 This place is too tough    the kids can have it   Earnhardt said

Bowman played the part to the hilt with regular social media releases  sporting a long haired wig and bushy mustache 
 It s been fun  for sure   Bowman said   I think I m pretty shy and keep to myself at times  so I had to get into character a little bit there during that photo shoot  It s been fun to do  We have one picture per day for the whole week  so that s been neat  It s been a lot of fun 
 When I have the wig  mustache  aviators and Tim Richmond fire suit  I m just not me anymore  I guess  in character  would be the best way to say that  It took me a minute for sure during the photo shoot  I was like   Man  this is awkward   but it was pretty cool

176049,397565,SO,Saudi Arabia struggles to hold Yemen coalition together as allies face off,news,"By Stephen Kalin and Ghaida Ghantous RIYADH DUBAI  Reuters    Saudi Arabia is struggling to hold together a military coalition fighting Iran aligned Houthis in Yemen after local allies turned on each other in a power struggle that has strained Riyadh s alliance with its main regional partner  the United Arab Emirates  The UAE  the second power in the coalition  has openly intervened on behalf of southern separatists battling the Saudi backed government for control of the south  launching air strikes on government forces trying to regain their interim seat of power in Aden port  The escalation risks further fracturing the Saudi UAE alliance and emboldening the Houthi movement  which the coalition was formed to fight  The United Nations is trying to restart talks to end the 4 1 2 year conflict  largely seen as a proxy war between rival powers Saudi Arabia and Iran  WHAT S HAPPENING IN SOUTHERN YEMEN  UAE backed separatists  who seek self rule in the south  seized Aden  base of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi s government  in early August after they accused a party allied to Hadi of complicity in a Houthi assault on their forces  The two sides were nominal allies under the Western backed  Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthi group  which ousted Hadi from power in the capital Sanaa in 2014  But they have rival agendas   Saudi Arabia and the UAE called for talks to resolve the crisis  Hadi s government insisted that separatists first cede control and that the UAE stop supporting southern fighters it has armed and trained   The separatist Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC  said it would not withdraw until the Islamist Islah party and northerners are removed from power in the south  STC fighters tried extending their reach in the south but were repelled by government forces  Those forces tried to retake Aden but retreated when UAE warplanes attacked them  Abu Dhabi said it targeted  terrorist organizations    The UAE criticized Hadi s government as ineffective and called for a more inclusive one as separatists reinforced their positions in Aden  Hadi  who resides in Riyadh  asked Saudi Arabia to stop what he called UAE interference   Saudi Arabia finds itself in a quandary  Aggressive Saudi action to rein in the STC could trigger a civil war within a civil war in which Riyadh s allies are far from sure to prevail   the International Crisis Group said in a recent brief   Conversely  failure to act or offering what the government considers overly generous concessions to the STC     could sow dissent within the Hadi government and Islahi ranks   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE COALITION  Saudi Arabia formed the alliance to neutralize the Houthis  who it feared Shi ite Muslim Iran would use to build influence along its border  The current crisis makes it harder for Riyadh to weaken the Houthis  who hold most major urban centers and point to the Aden standoff as proof that Hadi cannot rule   The Houthis  meanwhile  stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia  twice hitting energy assets in the world s top oil exporter  The UAE  which led the coalition s limited gains in the war  scaled down its presence in Yemen in June as Western criticism of the coalition mounted  saddling Saudi Arabia with an unpopular war  The Sunni Muslim allies joined forces in Yemen and beyond to contain common foe Iran and Islamist movements they see as a threat to their dynastic rule  Abu Dhabi and Riyadh said their alliance remains strong  but differences emerged as the UAE moved to protect its image and interests  The UAE drawdown aimed to cast Abu Dhabi as the more mature partner and peacemaker  diplomats said  as Western allies pressed for an end to the war that has killed tens of thousands and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine  Abu Dhabi said its decision was a natural progression given a U N  sponsored truce in the contested main port of Hodeidah in the west  which the coalition twice tried to seize last year  It said this new stage required political  not military tactics  Diplomats say it was because the UAE accepted there could be no military solution due to global criticism of coalition air strikes that have killed civilians and the humanitarian crisis  Heightened U S  Iran tensions  which risk triggering a war in the Gulf  precipitated the move  HOW DID IT REACH THIS POINT  The UAE built a force of 90 000 Yemeni fighters  including thousands of separatists  to battle the Houthis and Islamist militants  It was those forces who expelled the Houthis from the south  where the movement has no traction  But the war  which has been in military stalemate for years  revived old strains between north and south Yemen  separate countries that united into a single state in 1990  This is not the first separatist uprising  They briefly seized Aden in January 2018  Riyadh and Abu Dhabi helped end that standoff as the focus of the war shifted to Hodeidah  the Houthis  main supply line and a lifeline for millions  As military options faded  the UAE focus switched to U N  efforts toward a political solution  While Saudi Arabia wants to remove the Houthi threat and secure its borders  the UAE s main concern has been stamping out Islamist militants and securing Red Sea shipping lanes  analysts say  Abu Dhabi now supports a reshuffling of Hadi s government to include the STC and weaken the hold of Islah  which it sees as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood  Riyadh tolerates the party because it props up Hadi  who has no personal power base  
But the STC may not have broad support  Its move risks igniting infighting in the main area under coalition control and emboldening Islamists militants like Al Qaeda and Islamic State  among Yemen s many destabilizing forces ",2019-09-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/saudi-arabia-struggles-to-hold-yemen-coalition-together-as-allies-face-off-1968299,1968299

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kansas City Southern 
For Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO   the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kansas City Southern will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kansas City Southern would post earnings of  1 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A teenage girl from New Zealand sick with measles visited Disneyland and other popular tourist stops across Southern  NYSE SO  California earlier this month  possibly infecting others  local government health officials warned 
The alert comes amid the worst outbreak of measles in the United States in a quarter century  with more than 1 200 cases reported across 30 states since October 2018  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is looking to identify others who are at risk for measles and may have been exposed to a non resident measles case that traveled to Los Angeles County while infectious   the health department said in an advisory on Friday night 
The Orange County Health Care Agency said that the girl was in Southern California from Aug  11 to Aug  15 
During her stay in Southern California the girl visited the Universal Studios Theme Park and several destinations in Hollywood and Santa Monica  Los Angeles health officials said  adding that anyone who was also at those locations may be at risk of developing measles 
Orange County health officials said she visited Disneyland in Anaheim on Aug  12 and stayed at the nearby Desert Palms Hotel  There was no information on her current condition 
So far in 2019 a total of 16 measles cases have been reported among Los Angeles County residents  and 11 infected people are known to have traveled through the county 
The CDC said earlier this week that there had been a 1 8  increase in the number of cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly virus in the United States between Aug  8 and Aug  15 
The disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000  meaning there was no continuous transmission for at least a year  CDC officials say the United States risks losing its measles elimination status if the current outbreak  which began in October 2018 in New York state  continues until October 2019 
Measles  considered one of the most contagious viruses in the world  infects 90  of exposed people who have not been immunized  according to the Los Angeles County Health Department

176079,397595,SO,U S  to seek death penalty for accused Pittsburgh synagogue shooter,news,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
 Reuters    U S  prosecutors will seek the death penalty for a Pennsylvania man accused of bursting into a Pittsburgh synagogue last year with a semi automatic rifle and shooting 11 people to death  according to court papers filed on Monday 
Robert Bowers  46  shouted  all Jews must die  as he fired on congregants gathered for Sabbath services at the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct  27  authorities said 
Bowers  who is from a Pittsburgh suburb  has pleaded not guilty in U S  District Court in Pittsburgh to a 63 count indictment and is awaiting trial though a trial date has not been set  The charges include using a firearm to commit murder and obstruction of free exercise of religious belief resulting in death  the court filing said 
 Robert Bowers expressed hatred and contempt toward members of the Jewish faith and his animus toward members of the Jewish faith played a role in the killings   prosecutors said 
The massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue was the deadliest attack ever on Jewish Americans in the United States 
The synagogue is a fixture in Pittsburgh s historically Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill  which is home to one of the largest and oldest Jewish populations in the United States 
Bowers targeted that location  to maximize the devastation  amplify the harm of his crimes and instill fear within the local  national and international Jewish communities   prosecutors said in court papers 
An attorney for Bowers  death penalty specialist Judy Clarke  did not return calls or an email seeking comment 
 DRAWN OUT AND DIFFICULT 
The Tree of Life synagogue hosted multiple Jewish congregations and  according to the New York Times  some people who worshipped there have opposed the possibility of the death penalty for Bowers 
According to the newspaper  Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of New Light congregation  which met at Tree of Life  said in a letter to U S  Attorney General William Barr that  a drawn out and difficult death penalty trial would be a disaster with witnesses and attorneys dredging up horrifying drama and giving this killer the media attention he does not deserve  
Perlman did not immediately return an email seeking comment 
Among those killed were a 97 year old woman and a married couple in their 80s  Two civilians and five police officers were wounded before the gunman  who was armed with an assault style rifle and three handguns  was shot by police at the synagogue and surrendered  He has been held in jail since then

176080,397596,SO,U S  to states  School lunch changes none of your business,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    As schools begin reopening their doors to children nationwide  the U S  government has told a federal judge that states have no power to sue over new rules they say make school meals less healthy 
In a Monday night court filing  the government said New York  five other states and Washington  D C   could not sue based on speculation that changes to the federally funded National School Lunch Program could cause health problems for children and require more spending on treatment 
The government also said the states lacked power to sue under a doctrine known as  parens patriae   Latin for  parent of the nation   because it allegedly would not protect children from harm 
 This rule recognizes that a state has no legal interest in protecting its citizens from the federal government  and that only the United States  not the states  may represent its citizens and ensure their protection under federal law in federal matters   U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a filing in the federal court there 
The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James  who led the state coalition  did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment 
New York  California  Illinois  Minnesota  New Mexico  Vermont and the District of Columbia sued Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on April 3 over changes in the school lunch program  which feeds more than 30 million  mostly lower income children 
The states accused Perdue of acting arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring dietary guidelines and scientific research when he allowed fewer whole grains and more sodium in meals  easing rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama 
Among the changes were halving the required amounts of whole grains to be served  giving schools more flexibility to serve foods with refined grains such as noodles and tortillas  and delaying or shelving targets for sodium intake 
Schools were also permitted to serve low fat chocolate milk  rather than fat free milk 
Berman called the new rules only  minimum requirements   and said states remained free to enact stricter requirements 
He also said the states offered no proof that children at 4 100 schools exempted from earlier whole grain rules suffered adverse health consequences 
Excessive sodium intake has been linked to heart disease  high blood pressure and stroke  Relatively higher refined grain consumption has been linked to type 2 diabetes  heart disease and obesity

BOSTON  Reuters    Actress Lori Loughlin on Tuesday waved off concerns about a potential conflict involving the lawyers who will defend the  Full House  star and her husband against charges of participating in a U S  college admissions scam 
Federal prosecutors have accused Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli of paying  500 000 to get their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California through bribery as purported crew recruits 
They are among 51 people charged since March with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure admission of their children to top universities 
Prosecutors claim they did so with the help of William  Rick  Singer  a California college admissions consultant who has pleaded guilty to helping bribe university sports coaches to present clients  children as fake athletic recruits 
Both Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty 
At Tuesday s hearing  a federal magistrate judge questioned Loughlin and Giannulli about whether they were aware of the risks posed by their decision to be jointly represented by the law firm Latham   Watkins 
U S  Magistrate Judge M  Page Kelley told them the choice could hamper their individual defenses  For example  if one wanted to testify at trial  their lawyers might not want that because it could hurt the spouse s defense  she said 
 You need to have the undivided loyalty of counsel   she said 
But the judge said she would allow Loughlin and Giannulli to waive the conflict after both confirmed they wanted to continue being represented by Latham 
 My clients do have a united front   William Trach  a lawyer at Latham  said 
Prosecutors had also previously questioned whether Latham needed to be disqualified as it counted USC as a client  but Assistant U S  Attorney Eric Rosen said that was no longer an issue after the firm ceased working for the school 
The judge withheld immediately ruling on whether another  smaller firm retained by Giannulli may need to be disqualified because it also represents a cooperating witness  but Kelley said she likely would allow the conflict to be waived

176094,397610,SO,U S  charges reverse mortgage lender Live Well s ex CEO with fraud,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  government on Thursday charged the founder of reverse mortgage provider Live Well Financial Inc with engineering a  140 million fraud by inflating the value of its bonds  in what he called a  self generating money machine  
Michael Hild  44  who was also Live Well s chief executive  generated more than  24 million of compensation tied to the scheme  which ran from September 2015 to May 2019  according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan who announced the charges 
Founded in 2005  Live Well said it would close on May 3 and terminate its employees  after authorities said the Richmond  Virginia based company failed to repay lenders sitting on tens of millions of dollars of losses 
Live Well later took a  141 million writedown  and was put into Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 1 following a request by three lenders  affiliates of  Flagstar Bancorp Inc   N FBC   Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd  SS 601398  and South Korea s Mirae Asset Financial Corp 
Hild  who lives in Richmond  was charged with bank fraud  securities fraud  wire fraud and two conspiracy counts  Three counts carry maximum 30 year prison terms 
Live Well s former Chief Financial Officer Eric Rohr and head trader Darren Stumberger pleaded guilty to related charges and are cooperating 
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against the men and Live Well  Rohr and Stumberger partially settled 
Steven Feldman  a lawyer for Hild  declined to provide immediate comment  Lawyers for Rohr and Stumberger declined to comment  Live Well s lawyer was not immediately available for comment 
Reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 or older to borrow against equity in their homes  Loan balances become due when the homeowners die  move or sell their homes 
Hild was accused of scheming to persuade an outside pricing service to stop publishing its own valuations of Live Well bonds  and instead to use Live Well s preferred valuations 
Prosecutors said this induced Live Well s lenders to extend more credit than its bonds could support  allowing its reported portfolio to swell tenfold to  500 million in 16 months 
Authorities said Live Well held an emergency meeting in January 2017 after a nosy lender asked to spot check bond valuations  threatening to expose the scheme 
The SEC said Rohr suggested that Hild find a dealer who was  willing to be slimy  by corroborating wrong valuations 
 I feel like I m about to throw up right now   Rohr allegedly said 
The next day  Hild said he feared that allowing a spot check risked letting  the genie out of the bottle   the SEC said

176100,397616,SO,The Energy Report  04 05 19,opinion,"Taking A Pause
Oil prices are in pause mode as the traders try to decide whether they should add to gains after the best upward move in a decade or take profits  While the fundamental picture is still very bullish  the market wants more information before they take prices to the next level 
The big 7 2 million barrel increase in crude oil supply this week is the main reason for the pause  That number was impacted by the shutdown of The Houston Shipping Channel  so the trade wants to know how much of that supply increase was real and how much was due to transitory factors 
Today the jobs report will be the major news that could cause movement in the oil  but the larger issue of stagnating U S  shale oil production may take center stage with the release of the Baker Hughes rig count  The Rig count has fallen 4 weeks in a row and oil rigs are at the lowest level since April 2018 to 833  Low oil prices have caused many shale producers to cut spending and many are not able to change from cut mode to expansion unless prices go substantially higher 
Oil traders also need to watch progress on the U S  China trade talks  Bloomberg reported that both China and the U S  claimed progress in talks to end their trade war  with President Xi Jinping pushing for a rapid conclusion and President Donald Trump talking up prospects for a  monumental  agreement that may still be some weeks away 
While it seems like we are closer to a deal  at the same time it feels like the negotiations will never end  Still if the market gets a sense that a deal is in place  it will add 3 to 5 dollars to the oil price quickly  That may go even higher if the Trump Administration does not grant waivers to buyers of Iranian oil  While some of those buyers are finding alternatives  if Trump gets Iran to zero exports it will be very bullish  There are more signs that Trump will not extend waivers  but he has until May 5th to decide 
RBOB and Heating oil look solid  Demand for products are strong and should get stronger  Talk of a slowdown in the U S  economy and global economy has been overstated  A good job report today may reinforce that and cause a rally in products next week 
It is a free for all  Yes  Free Natural Gas  Bloomberg s Naureen S  Malik writes  Natural gas drillers in West Texas are getting some relief from negative prices after a key pipeline was repaired  but they re still giving the fuel away  Gas for next day delivery at the Waha hub in the Permian Basin  the world s biggest oil patch  traded at zero cents per million British thermal units Thursday  according to Intercontinental Exchange Inc  That s actually an improvement  Prices in the region plunged to minus  9 on Wednesday as work on a Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   conduit choked off flows from the play to Southern  California  Though Permian gas is paring losses after the pipeline was fixed late Wednesday  producers there aren t out of the woods yet  Rising oil prices are poised to exacerbate the basin s glut of gas  which is pumped as a byproduct of crude drilling in the play  
Negative prices may persist until new conduits come online  and the next major project    Kinder s Gulf Coast Express    isn t slated to start up until October  While explorers can burn off some excess gas  the process is frowned upon by regulators and environmentalists 
Equity investors are now starting to show signs of concern about negative Permian prices  Shale driller Encana Corp  fell as much as 5 6 percent on Wednesday  and  the only fundamental factor of note was Waha gas prices   Greg Pardy  a Toronto based analyst for RBC Capital Markets  said in a note to clients  Encana didn t immediately respond to a request for comment 
Additional pipeline maintenance may keep West Texas gas prices under pressure  RBC analyst Christopher Louney said in a separate note Thursday  NET Midstream LLC s NET Mexico pipeline has reported that maintenance at the Agua Dulce gas hub in Texas may affect exports across the southern U S  border ",2019-04-05,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-040519-200404201,200404201
176101,397617,SO,Gold Faded On Less Dovish Fed Talks  Lingering Brexit Saga And Mixed US Economic ,opinion,"Gold  XAU USD spot  closed around 1291 55 in the US session Friday  edged down almost  0 05  on Goldilocks US NFP job report and higher USD  Overall  Gold is almost flat in April  till day   but slumped almost  2 23  in the last two months  Feb March  after a surge of around  10 46  Q3 2018 and January 2019 amid safe haven flow on the US China trade war  Trump s Fed tantrum and subsequent plunge of the US stock market 
In mid February Gold made the 10 months high of 1346 79 on Fed s patience  Since then Gold slips and made a 3 month low of 1280 93 on 3rd March on hawkish Fed talks and steady US core PCE inflation at  1 9   near Fed s symmetrical target of 2  
Even after Fed s surprising dovish hold on 19th March  Gold failed to make any significant surge and made a high of 1324 57 and again slipped to a low of 1281 02 on 4th April amid mixed US economic data and less dovish Fed talks coupled with lingering Brexit saga  negative for the EUR and GBP  positive for the USD   In March the US dollar index  DXY  made a 3 month high of 97 71  jumped almost  1 16  after a surge of  0 61  in February 
In brief  the market was expecting the Fed may cut at least once in late 2019 and may also launch a different version of QQE  like YCC  in line with BOJ   But overall talks from the Fed was less dovish than the market was expecting as the Fed has no such intention of any rate cut or launch QE 4 despite intensifying pressure from Trump   Co  who is now publicly advocating for an immediate rate cut by  0 50   rollback of Fed s hike in Sep and Dec 18  with a launch of QE 4  bond buying   Subsequently Gold came under stress 
Gold was also undercut by signs of soft US global inflation amid the concern of synchronized global contraction  while got some boost after Trumps  announcement of a new Fed governor Moore and Cain  both of whom are known dove and will certainly advocate for rate cuts and even launch of QE 4 in line   spirit of Trump   Co  Moreover  Cain is also a fan of the gold standard 
Talking about a deluge of Fed talks in the last week  Atlanta Fed s Bostic said late Friday after the Goldilocks US NFP report   On the whole  the US labor market today is strong   Bostic  an FOMC voter this year looked optimistic and not in a mood to cut either 
On Thursday  4th Apr   Fed s Mester  a known hawk  looked surprisingly more hawkish as she sees scope for the US rate to move  a bit higher  if the US economy performs well as expected despite fears of a global slowdown  
The Cleveland Fed President Mester said in a speech   I supported the FOMC to keep the present levels of US rates at  2 40   between 2 25 to 2 50    with no urgency to make any changes now  I expect a slowdown in the US economy this year  but the slowdown showed in recent  soft  economic data from factory activity to business  consumer confidence  and inflation to be temporary  I am biased to either keeping rates where they are or moving them up a little bit  If my likely outcome comes to pass then I think rates might have to go up a bit from where they are  But as you know the economy could evolve in a different way than I m expecting as my most likely outcome  
On Fed s QT  B S tapering   Mester clarified   The Fed will be making decisions on how to transition its  4 trillion in assets to mainly U S  Treasuries at upcoming meetings   Mester added in an optimistic note   Business contacts in the district covered by my bank  which spans Ohio as well as parts of Pennsylvania  Kentucky  and West Virginia  report that business has picked up after slowing late last year  That strength could offset a slowdown sees in Europe and China  But uncertainty over the US China trade talks could still weigh on business spending  
Overall  it now seems that to counter growing interference and to protect the central bank  autonomy   almost all the Fed s hawks and doves are now  united  and publicly talking for the same neutral stance that they are not interested in debate for a cut and launch QE 4 at this moment as the current US global economic and geopolitical scenario is calling for a  neutral  monetary policy 
On 29th March  the White House CEA NIC Kudlow said that while there is  no emergency   the Fed should cut rates to protect the US economy from slowing down  Kudlow argued he wants the Fed to cut its rate by 0 50   immediately  as the US has  no inflation and the EU and China is in a deep recession   thanks to Trump trade war  Dow got more boost after Kudlow s rate cut comments 
Kudlow said in an interview   I am echoing the president s view   he s not been bashful about that view   he would also like the Fed to cease shrinking its balance sheet  And I concur with that view  Looking at some of the indicators   I mean the economy looks fundamentally quite healthy  we just don t want that threat  There s no inflation out there  so I think the Fed s actions were probably overdone  Globally  there s a lot of weakness out there  Europe   Eurozone  is  virtually in a recession  China  is    very  very  very soft as we negotiate on trade  In the absence of inflation  with some of these global threats  our view is at some point     I wouldn t mind seeing the Fed drop their target rate  
But Kudlow reiterated that the Trump has no plans to try to replace Powell as Chair of the Fed  As a reminder  Trump said last year that the Fed and Powell have  gone crazy  with rate hikes and he was  not happy  with Powell s  loco  decision to continue hiking throughout 2018  which he thinks a primary reason for the December stock market crash 
On Friday  Kudlow was asked about Trump s epic comments about the Fed and its chair Powell  Kudlow said   we all know the Fed is independent  The president is not dictating policy to the Fed  He didn t say anything remotely like that   Kudlow added   Trump would like the Fed to stop shrinking the B S and I am just echoing Trump s view on Fed policy  
Talking about Trump s unusual interference in Fed and bellicose comments about Powell  a report published a few days ago said that the Fed Chair Powell received a phone call from President Trump on March 8 as Dow tumbled on the concern of an imminent recession  Trump often made the Fed and Powell as a scapegoat for any plunge in the US stock market for their previous hawkish monetary policy of dual QT  both rate hikes and B S tapering  
Although after the December market crash  Trump largely refrained from criticizing Powell publicly  Trump s Fed Powell criticism has continued privately  Trump blasted Powell at three meetings in the last week  blaming the US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin for recommending Powell for the Fed Chair job 
But Trump signaled privately that he may have no choice but to leave Powell  whom he picked to lead the Fed  Trump said in an interview as recalling  he told Powell   I guess I m stuck with you   On Wednesday  the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari said   Presidents are free to say what they want  I can tell you with great confidence that my colleagues and I don t pay any attention  
But Powell   Co may be forced to pay attention of Trump s bellicose comments and that may be the primary reason behind the Fed s sudden flip flops in March about its own dot plots and B S tapering  QT   Powell might be influenced after Trump s dinner diplomacy in early February  In any way  after forcing  influencing  the Fed to stop its  loco   dual QT  prematurely  Trump is trying to influence the Fed to launch QQE 4  rate cuts  YCC  NRIP  and bond buying if required to fight a deeper recession slowdown   The Fed fund futures were also indicating 2 rate cuts by H2 2019 and H1 2020 
But the Fed is now not talking about any rate cuts  at least publicly and downplaying the recent partial bond yield curve inversion  Almost all the influential FOMC policymakers are now emphasizing Fed s neutral monetary policy stance at this moment and depending on H1 2019 data  June   the Fed could publish their revised dot plots and economic projections in its June policy meeting 
On Friday  after the US NFP job report  which may keep the Fed in neutral mode  in a bizarre presser comments  Trump said   The Fed really slowed the US economy down and thus it should lower rates  now   The Fed should move to quantitative easing  QE  instead of quantitative tightening  QT   
Trump basically said instead of sticking with its  pause patience  stance  the Fed should  drop cut  interest rates and launch QE 4 despite his confidence on the US economic strength as he also said   The country is doing unbelievably well  economically  
The US President Trump said in a White House presser before flying to Southern  NYSE SO  Mexican border   Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates  I think they really slowed us down  There s no inflation  I would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing  very little if any inflation  And I think they should drop rates  and they should get rid of quantitative tightening  You would see a rocket ship  Despite that  we re doing very well  
Trump s rate cut comments were echoed by his CEA Kudlow  who said in an interview  
 There is no need for the Fed to raise rates without inflation  The US economy could do with a rate cut  The Fed has to keep in mind that the US economy is seeing supply side growth  Herman Cain and Stephen Moore  Trump s candidates for the two vacant Fed board governor posts  are very capable people and they share administration view that strong growth isn t necessarily inflationary  Trump thinks the Fed went too far with rate hikes  The White House is not trying to damage the Fed s independence  but the Fed could use some new thinking on how supply side influences the economic outlook  President Trump is not pressuring the Fed  but is expressing a point of view  
Kudlow clarified   We have a point of view  the president has the point of view with which I concur  and that point of view is that  the  Fed went too far  with rate hikes  and we re concerned not about the immediate  economy   The immediate economy looks good   this is a precautionary view on our part  We have not had a strong economy like this in several decades   I don t want any threats to it if possible  
On 29th March  Quarles  largely a neutral  centrist owlish  Fed policymaker looked like a hawk and argued for further rate hikes  The Fed Vice Chairman  for regulatory supervision   Quarles  Trump s nominee  said the Fed may need further rate hikes at some point given an optimistic  economic  outlook  Quarles offered an optimistic view of the US economy and said more rate increases may be needed if recent positive trends in productivity and investment continue 
Quarles said   I am inclined to dismiss the recent data as a bit odd and inconsistent with underlying strength  wage gains that should be boosting households  and a rise in productivity I feel could be persistent and lead to stronger growth down the road  
Quarles said in a speech   In regard to policy  I am very comfortable remaining patient at this point and monitoring the incoming data  That said  my sense is that further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point  a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy s growth potential and momentum  In the language of Central Banking  my  own  estimate  is  of the neutral policy rate remains somewhat north of where we are now  
Acknowledging that the US economic growth has slowed down a bit  at least temporarily  Quarles clarified   That said  I remain optimistic about the outlook for the US economy  and I think that we have the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead  Looking past the near term data  I see many reasons to expect relatively strong growth in the coming years  supported by gains in the productive capacity of the economy  
Further even supporting the present neutral stance of the Fed  Quarles argued that the central bank should not be in an indefinite  hold   neutral  mode and should be data dependent  for a broader period   and should not make its decision based on only some recent soft data  which may be transient 
Quarles said   I prefer a framework where we make it clear that we are focused on broad trends  elsewhere I have used the aviation analogy that we should not  chase the needles  on the instrument panel  We should be clear that  while we will respond to clear and durable evolution in these broad trends  we are not reacting to every piece of volatile data  
On 29th March  the Dallas Fed President Kaplan said he will wait for more economic data in the next few months before taking any rate movement decision  Kaplan  a known Fed neutral hawk  said   I am waiting for more domestic economic data to help me make up my mind whether the Fed needs to make any adjustments on its current policy stance  Let s see how the economy will unfold the next couple of months  
Even the Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  1 known evergreen Fed dove  is not ready to cut at this moment and said   It is premature  to think about cutting rates in response to  current  economic data and market indicators  
On 28th March  Another influential FOMC member and the so called  neutral guru   Williams  NYSE WMB  downplayed the current bond yield curve inversion panic and said  the US Recession risks in 2019 or 2020 are not elevated  the US economy is in a very good place and yield curve inversion points to modest growth instead of an outright recession  Overall  Williams sounded less dovish than the market expected 
The NY Fed President Williams said   The most likely case was for US economy to grow 2   with low unemployment  in 2019 20  and the probability of recession this year or next was not elevated relative to any year  There are a lot of reasons to think that it has been a recession predictor for reasons in the past that kind of doesn t apply today  And  it only tells us that growth will be pretty modest  
On a question above monetary policy setting  Williams said   Short term interest rate is around neutral  Meanwhile  any development in the economy  whether it s on the employment side or on the inflation side  that moved in a persistent way away from our objectives  one way or the other would be a reason to rethink the path of policy going forward  
Williams further clarified   I m not as worried about a recession as some of my colleagues in the private sector  I still see the probability of a recession this year or next year as being not elevated relative to any year  
On the same day  Fed s Bullard  a known evergreen dove  surprisingly sounded more optimistic and less dovish  He said the recent spate of soft US economic data is probably temporary  premature to contemplate rate cut 
The St  Louis Fed President Bullard said   The spate of weaker data is probably mostly temporary  And  the notion of a rebound in the second quarter is a good forecast  Thus it s premature to contemplate a rate cut here   you do not want to watch the data closely  and you won t really know that until you get to the July time frame   that would be the next time to revisit monetary policy  
Bullard said he is expecting a relatively weak Q1  but he wasn t sure exactly how soft it would be and he added  the revision to Q4 growth came in about as expected  So the three quarter trend is still around 2   which is not too bad  and then I d expect some strengthening in the second half of the year  A clear picture of the health of the economy in the second quarter won t be available until July  That would be the next time you d revisit the stance of monetary policy  It s one thing to say the economy is slowing  It is another thing to say how fast  
Bullard is mainly a contrarian policy maker and thus despite being one the first Fed officials to express concern with the flattening inverting yield curve  Bullard said the recent inversion of some parts of the yield curve was not an important signal on its own  
On the current bond yield curve inversion debate  Bullard clarified   I think you would have to get a wider variety of spreads to be inverted   the 2 year 10 year in particular  and it would have to stay inverted and be meaningfully inverted for a while  a matter of months or even quarters  before you would say it that it was sending a negative signal that s in the same sense that it did historically  
Thus Bullard is now arguing for 2s5s inversion in a meaningful way  say for 3 continuous months  for a definitive signal of an economic recession  which not happened till date  The recent low of 2Y US bond yield was at  2 162   while that of the 10Y was around 2 340   i e  the 10Y yield is still higher by around  18 bps 
Bullard also pointed out   The Fed s monetary policy normalization process in the US is at an end and we have gone as far as we can  Hopefully  we ended the normalization at the right moment as the inverted yield curve has been a reliable signal in the past  
On 26th March  Fed s George also sounded less dovish and pointed out more time and evidence needed to separate signal from noise 
The Kansas City Fed President George said in a speech   The weakness in Q1 growth could reflect transitory factors such as the government shutdown  financial volatility  an unusually harsh winter  and heightened policy uncertainty  But over the medium term  the generally positive outlook of the US economy has several prominent downside risks  The biggest risks come from slower growth abroad  particularly in China  the Euro area  and the United Kingdom  Together with waning  U S   fiscal and monetary stimulus  they represent a stronger headwind than my baseline forecast  Right now  data are noisy and more time and evidence are needed to separate the signal from the noise  
Finally  George concluded   The US economy s fundamentals still appeared sound and that job growth would likely rebound from a weak performance in February  Domestic factors  including the waning effects of US government stimulus  also contributed to a median projection by Fed policymakers falling to 2 1  growth for 2019 My outlook calls for growth to slow to trend  with moderating job gains and low inflation  In these circumstances  monetary policy can take a wait and see approach  
In the last few days  the US bond yield curve steepened to some extent and out of the so called inversion  especially after China s Premier downplayed the current spate of economic slowdown and sounded very optimistic about the Chinese economic prospect  This  along with China s  300B stimulus and a rebound in March manufacturing PMI data above boom bust line  contraction  of 50 0 surprisingly coupled with less dovish Fed talks has certainly helped the US bond yields USD and Gold slips 
On early Monday  Gold is currently trading around 1297 82  almost at the session high and surged by around  0 48  as USD slumped around  0 14  on strength in Yen amid less dovish BOJ Kuroda talks  The BOJ chief Kuroda sounded quite optimistic on the Japanese core inflation prospect and said Japanese core CPI is to gradually accelerate toward 2  
The BOJ Governor Kuroda maintained his optimistic view on the Japanese economy in a speech at a quarterly meeting of regional BOJ bank branch managers  He said Japan s economy was expected to continue expanding moderately  even though slowdown overseas is affecting exports  Kuroda said   The core consumer inflation is expected to gradually accelerate toward 2  as the output gap remains positive and medium  to long term inflation expectations heighten  
But for now  the BOJ will continue to expand the monetary base until the headline CPI exceeds 2  target stably  And  short  and long term interest rates will be kept at current very low levels for an extended period of time 
On Monday the BOJ governor Kuroda said   The BOJ will keep Japanese interest rates at current very low levels for an extended period of time  Japan s economy expanding moderately  though overseas slowdown affecting exports  output  The consumer inflation  CPI  is moving around 0 5 1  and Japan s financial system maintaining stability 
 The BOJ will maintain QQE with YCC for as long as needed to achieve a 2  inflation target in a stable manner  The BOJ will continue expanding monetary base until CPI stably exceeds 2  and will keep short  long term interest rates at current very low levels for an extended period of time   The market was expecting that the BOJ may cut in the coming days  but that was not the case 
The USD was also affected BY higher EUR  GBP on renewed soft smooth Brexit optimism  As per the report  the British Theresa May  may  offer some customs union compromise  May s earlier  red lines   to Labor party chief Corbyn to break the present Brexit deadlock  However  officially May is still adamant that if there is no acceptable Brexit deal by the British Parliament by the next few days  Brexit may never happen at all 
The Japanese Yen was also higher on stock market risk aversion amid lingering suspense about the US China trade truce and an unusual 24 7 effort by Trump admin to save Dow by trying to be more optimistic on China trade deal than the reality on the ground 
On Sunday weekend  the White House CEA Kudlow looked quite guarded about the actual progress of the US China trade truce  In an interview  Kudlow said   Trade negotiations with China got closer and closer  We made good headway last week when Vice Premier Liu He was here  And talks will continue this week with a lot of teleconferencing  A lot of very difficult topics for the first time are on the table and being resolved  But I have guarded optimism  may  maybe more than guarded optimism so we re  we re gaining on it  
Kudlow also said   Great progress was made on the IP theft  And good progress was made on the forced transfer of technology  on the ownership  But there are still issues outstanding issued including enforcement related issues  But in each and every place   A  they ve acknowledged their problems  That was a very big hurdle  And  B  what wasn t on the table is on the table  now   and  C  we re getting closer and closer  
As a reminder  on Friday  Chinese trade talks with the USTR have concluded for the day after a marathon 4 hour 45 minute session  closing the 10th round of talks  The US government said  the overall meetings were productive and made progress on numerous key issues  but significant work still remains  And thus both negotiations teams will be in continuous contact to resolve those outstanding issues  The subjects of the negotiation in the latest round of talks were issues of alleged IP theft  forced technology transfer  by China  and others such as non tariff barriers  agriculture  services  purchase  and enforcement  
Elsewhere  China s state run news agency earlier reported that progress was made during talks in Washington that ended Friday  though  the remaining issues are all hard nuts to crack  
Gold was also boosted by a report that China has expanded its gold reserves for the fourth straight month  adding to optimism that central banks globally will continue to build higher gold holdings amid a synchronized global contraction and subsequent rate cuts  The PBOC added around 11 2 tons of Gold in its reserve in March  followed by 9 95 tons in February  11 8 tons in January and 9 95 tons in December  The addition of Gold by PBOC may be a sign that the Fed may relent ultimately to Trump s pressure and may also cut in the coming days to support the US economic growth ahead of the US Presidential election in 2020 
This may be just like in India  where the RBI flip flops in a span of 6 months  after resignation of the hawkish governor Patel and appointment of Das  government  yes man   policy dove  and cut twice in a rare consecutive manner to boost lending and lower interest rate for the MSME personal loans ahead of the election from 11th April 
In brief  in various instances  the central bank autonomy  independence  and credibility are now at stake  including the Fed  amid intensifying political interference by the lawmakers  Presidents  PMs   which is positive for the Gold  And thus Gold is hovering within a narrow range  Although Powell   Co is trying to look brave and politically independent  they are also bound to blink to Trump  their political boss 
Technical view  Gold
Technically  whatever may be the narrative  now price   time action suggests that gold has to sustain over 1305 1307 for a further rally to 1315 1325  1345 1355 and 1366  1375 1395 1415 in the near term  under bullish case scenario  
On the flip side  sustain below 1300 1297  Gold may fall to 1285 1275  1260  1250 and 1235 1210 1180 1160 in the near term  under bear case scenario

176102,397618,SO,RBA Focused On Housing Data,opinion,"The Aussie dollar is failing to find any luck among traders  there are concerns about the upcoming Federal elections in Australia  This comes in the midst of speculations that the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to change its stance towards the monetary policy 
Property prices are tumbling and households have tightened their belt towards their spending  Remember  in Australia  the household spending accounts nearly 60 percent toward the gross domestic product  The government has promised the tax cuts and cash handouts  these factors are likely to support consumer spending 
It is widely expected that the bank is going to cut the interest rate  but I think it may be a little too early to say that  The economic picture does look soft  but it doesn t show that the economic conditions are dire 
Housing market data is the key matrix for the central bank and if the Reserve Bank of Australia sees the data is deteriorating further  it may pull the trigger on the interest rate cut  This may happen as soon as August  The upcoming home loans number  due tomorrow  may provide a better picture of this 
In terms of economic data for this week  we have RBA s Debelle s speech on Wednesday and the banks  financial stability review on Friday  Both have the ability to bring some swings for the currency

Between now and the May 18 when the nation will head to the polls  we are expecting more weakness for the currency  Newspoll shows that Labour is leading the game for the time being  But the lead margin is narrow and it hasn t improved much either if you compare this to the previous month figure  Speculators are seeing an opportunity here and we can see that the leveraged funds have increased their short positions  The yield on the government 3 year bond has dropped by three basis points  and on the 10 year it declined nearly four basis points

176103,397619,SO,Great Southern Bancorp  GSBC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Great Southern  NYSE SO  Bancorp  GSBC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 7  
Revenues are expected to be  50 30 million  up 8 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Great Southern Bancorp 
For Great Southern Bancorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Great Southern Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Great Southern Bancorp would post earnings of  1 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 21  delivering a surprise of  10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Great Southern Bancorp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/great-southern-bancorp-gsbc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200405570,200405570

The ninth seeded Medvedev had 10 aces overall and won 90 percent of his first serve points during a standout performance on the hardcourt in Mason  Ohio 
The win catapults Medvedev to No  5 in the world rankings  It was the Russian s third straight final    he lost to Nick Kyrgios in Washington and Rafael Nadal in Montreal earlier this month 
 Three weeks in a row in the finals   Medvedev said during a post match television interview   It would not be a good feeling if I lost three finals in a row  I m just relieved and I m so happy  
Medvedev furiously smashed his racquet during the final game against the 16th seeded Goffin  He said it was because he was cramping up and feared he wouldn t be able to finish off the Belgian in straight sets 
 I started feel cramps at 5 3  First time in three weeks I started cramping    probably the nerves and rallies   Medvedev said   Yesterday  my coach told me it has been 24 days in a row where I played tennis 
 I started cramping quite hard  Last game  it is 15 40 and I am cramping and it is going to be 5 all and I m in a bad position  I made four serves he couldn t return and three of them were aces  just unbelievable  
The three aces gave Medvedev his fifth career victory and came one day after he outplayed top seeded Serbian Novak Djokovic in an impressive three set comeback in the semifinals 
Medvedev finished with 21 winners and 14 unforced errors 
Goffin was plagued by 28 unforced errors    including seven double faults    while having 20 winners  He won 66 7 percent of his first serve points 
 He s super solid  He doesn t miss  It s like playing against a wall   Goffin said afterward   Just playing cross  cross  wait for the ball  His pace is not too fast  not too slow  It s quite a special pace to play against him  And then you receive bombs coming from his serve  and then he doesn t miss 
 That s why everybody is struggling  because he s so consistent  now with more confidence

176115,397631,SO,Yemen separatist chief in Saudi Arabia for talks on Aden standoff,news,"RIYADH  Reuters    The leader of southern Yemeni separatists has arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks aimed at ending a standoff in Aden port between the separatists and Yemen s Saudi backed government  who had been nominal allies under a Sunni Muslim military coalition 
Saudi Arabia  the coalition leader  called for a summit after the separatists on Aug  10 took over Aden  interim seat of the government  in a move that fractured the alliance  The ousted Yemeni government and coalition partner the United Arab Emirates traded blame over the crisis late on Tuesday 
It was not clear if a delayed meeting involving both Yemeni sides would go ahead after the separatists extended their grip on the south on Tuesday by seizing government military camps in nearby Abyan 
The separatist fighters are part of the Saudi led alliance that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis  who ousted President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014  His government rebased to Aden 
However  the UAE backed separatist Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC  has a rival agenda to Hadi s government  which has refused to participate in any talks unless the southern forces reverse what it calls a coup 
HADI GOVERNMENT  UAE TRADE ACCUSATIONS
The standoff has complicated efforts to end the ruinous war and has exposed differences between regional allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE  which in June scaled down its presence in Yemen while still backing thousands of southern separatist fighters 
STC chief Aidaroos al Zubaidi arrived in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah late on Tuesday for the talks  the STC said 
Hadi s government asked Abu Dhabi  which has called for dialogue  to stop funding and arming separatist forces 
 If it were not for the full support provided by the United Arab Emirates     this rebellion would not have happened  This scheme of fragmentation continues and is escalating despite calls for de escalation led by Saudi Arabia   said a government letter to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday 
The UAE responded by reaffirming its commitment to the coalition and criticizing the  weak performance  and  ineffectiveness  of Hadi s government and its inability to engage in constructive dialogue with other Yemeni parties 
 It is not appropriate for the Yemeni government to hang its political and administrative failure on the UAE   Abu Dhabi s deputy permanent U N  representative said in New York  His remarks were carried on state news agency WAM on Wednesday 
The STC said it would hold Aden until elements of the Islamist Islah  which the UAE regards as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood  and northerners are removed from power positions in the south  It also wants a say in Yemen s future 
Yemeni sources have said the delayed summit could discuss reshuffling Hadi s government to include the STC  which seeks self rule in the south and blames Islah  a key Hadi ally  of being complicit in a Houthi assault on southern forces earlier this month  The Islah party denies the charge 
The Houthis point to Aden as proof that Hadi is unfit to rule  The group  which holds Sanaa and most big urban centers  has recently stepped up attacks on Saudi cities

176117,397633,SO,Graphic  Factory woes grip swing states that flipped for Trump in 2016,news,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A slowdown in U S  manufacturing is hitting jobs in states that flipped to Donald Trump in the 2016 election and that will be key to the Republican president s re election prospects in 2020 
Trump is telling voters across the country that the economy is booming and jobs are growing  But the blow to factory employment is more pronounced in places like Pennsylvania  Ohio and Wisconsin than in the rest of the country 
While the overall U S  economy is still growing at a healthy clip thanks to robust consumer spending  the weakness in the manufacturing dependent areas that helped propel Trump to the White House could complicate his prospects in the November 2020 election 
Following is a look at how the manufacturing downturn is playing out in a number of states that could decide whether Trump gets a second term as president 
FACTORY SLOWDOWN
Payrolls at U S  factories grew strongly in 2018  helped by a strong domestic U S  economy  But more recently  job growth at factories has slowed across the country  rising 0 3  in the six months through July compared with a 0 9  gain in the prior six months   
Factories have been hit by weaker overseas markets  a U S  China trade war and an investment slowdown economists attribute in part to worries about trade tensions 
The blow is falling more heavily on big manufacturing states in the U S  Midwest and Northeast  regions that have shed factory jobs in droves since the 1980s even as manufacturing expanded in Southern  NYSE SO  states where wages are often lower 
In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  factory employment is falling  while hiring is weaker in Ohio and Iowa than in the rest of the country 
Payroll growth in Michigan s factories has been similar to that of the rest of the rest of the country  although it showed signs of weakening this week when United States Steel Corp said it would lay off hundreds of workers in the state 
Together  those states account for five of the six states that voted for former Democratic President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012 and for Trump in 2016  Trump won the states after pitching himself as a business savvy pragmatist who would put American jobs first  All are considered swing states in 2020  Trump only narrowly won Pennsylvania  Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016  
HEARTLAND STEEL
Florida is the sixth state that Trump flipped  But like several other Southern U S  states with large manufacturing workforces  its factory payrolls are expanding more quickly than the national average 
In Pennsylvania  manufacturing employment fell 1 5  in the six months through July to 561 400  the biggest decline among any state with at least 200 000 manufacturing workers  according to Labor Department data 
Wisconsin s factory payrolls shrank 0 9  over the same period  the third steepest fall among big factory states behind New York  which declined 1 2  
The divergence between the Rust Belt states and the Southern states could owe partly to steel and aluminum tariffs introduced by Trump that aimed to protect U S  producers from foreign competitors but which also disrupted supply chains  analysts said 
Many of the nation s largest metal factories are in Rust Belt states  Several big steel factories in Pennsylvania have announced layoffs this year  including a subsidiary of Ampco Pittsburgh Corp and the U S  subsidiary of Russian steel company Novolipetsk Steel PAO  known as NLMK 
The steel industry is also experiencing weaker demand for industrial goods as the global economy has slowed  Manufacturing employment in Indiana  the U S  state with the largest steel industry  fell 0 5  in the six months through July 
 Tariffs are part of the story   said Tessa Conroy  an economist at the University of Wisconsin Madison  ",2019-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/graphic-factory-woes-grip-swing-states-that-flipped-for-trump-in-2016-1961126,1961126

176119,397635,SO,How Venezuela s Loss Is Turning Into Shell And BP s Gain,opinion,"Apart from oil prices climbing to their multi month highs  there is another reason to be excited about energy majors Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc   NYSE BP    the loss of oil exports from Venezuela  Let s jump into the details to find out how 
The Decimation of Venezuela s Oil Industry
Years of mismanagement and alleged government corruption resulted in the destruction of Venezuela s energy industry  With the country tethering on the verge of political and economic collapse  oil output has dwindled by more than 50  since 2016  Venezuela currently churns out around 1 1 million barrels per day  the least since the 1950s 
Restrictive financial sanctions imposed by the United States on the Maduro regime and periodic power blackouts throughout the country has further strangulated the Latin American nation s struggling energy sector  In fact  analysts believe it s only a matter of time before the embattled OPEC producer   exempt from the cartel s output cut pledge   sees its daily crude production plunge below 1 million barrels 
Trump Administration s Sanctions Disrupts Exports 
Expectedly  the ongoing production disruptions have led to a plunge in Venezuela s oil exports to multi decade lows  Further  as part of the U S  sanctions on the government in Caracas  American companies have been restricted to conduct business with Venezuela s state run oil firm PDVSA  This has affected the purchases of crude oil from Venezuela and the sales of refined products to the crisis stricken country 
Til recently  PDVSA exported roughly 500 000 barrels per day of crude to the American shores  while buying refined products  like diluents  to blend the Venezuelan oil  which is of the  heavy crude  variety  However  since Washington s freeze on PDVSA s export proceeds  Venezuelan oil supplies to U S  have steadily declined   falling to zero during the week ended March 15  To put this in context  U S  imported around 514 million barrels per day of crude from Venezuela in 2018       
Disruptive for U S  Refiners
The loss of Venezuela s heavy grade oil has put the U S  refiners in a fix   
Despite the U S  being one of the largest producers of oil globally  a number of domestic refiners   especially those located along the Gulf Coast s vast refining sector and in the Midwest   prefer to import crude from countries like Mexico  Canada and Venezuela  This is because most of the refining units in the region were constructed or modified about a decade ago i e  prior to the shale revolution 
At the time  these facilities were configured to process the heavy sour grades of oil coming from outside suppliers  In fact  it was then thought that the U S  would need substantial quantities of such crude from other nations to meet the demand and consequently  many refineries in these regions upgraded their units to run heavy crude 
On the other hand  around 95  of the domestically produced oil from shale plays in recent years are of the  light sweet  variety   not the one the Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries are set up for  As such  these facilities still prefer to import the heavier crude from outside rather than use the locally available type from formations like the Permian and Bakken 
Of the total oil imports of United States  nearly two thirds are heavy crude type and Venezuelan supplies constituted about 10  of that 
How Are the Refiners Substituting Venezuelan Crude 
The downstream operators seemed to have settled on the Mars crude for now  Mostly scooped up from the offshore Gulf of Mexico fields  this variety  produced chiefly by integrated majors Shell and BP  has seen its demand take off lately 
Named after the Mars development   a joint venture between Shell and BP situated around 130 miles from the coast of New Orleans   it is a type of U S  heavy oil that is currently being used by the refiners as a replacement of the Venezuelan imports  With top refiners like Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO   and Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   buying more of Mars  price of the grade recently touched five year highs  Shell s trading division has also been busy selling Southern  NYSE SO  Green Canyon  a grade close to Mars  to another downstream player Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   
What Next 
With the Venezuelan turmoil unlikely to be resolved anytime soon amid the power tussle between U S  backed opposition leader Juan Guaido and President Nicolas Maduro  a near term reversal of the export embargo looks bleak  Meanwhile  other heavy oil supplying countries to Gulf Coast refineries   Mexico and Canada   are also plagued by certain issues like production decline and pipeline bottlenecks  Therefore  U S  refiners are currently left with no option but to depend on Gulf of Mexico crude grades like Mars  thereby benefiting dominant players like Shell and BP  Both the companies currently carry Zacks Rank  3  Hold

What s Next for Oxford Industries 
While Oxford Industries has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Oxford Industries was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

176122,397638,SO,Yemen s separatists clash with government forces in Shabwa  sources,news,"ADEN  Reuters    Southern  NYSE SO  Yemeni separatists clashed with government forces in the southern oil producing province of Shabwa on Thursday  local officials and residents said  in the latest violence between nominal allies that has strained an Arab military coalition 
The United Arab Emirates backed separatists earlier this month took over Aden port  interim seat of Yemen s Saudi backed government  and last week they extended their control to neighboring Abyan 
Both sides are part of a Saudi led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran aligned Houthi group that ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 
But the separatists  the Southern Transitional Council  STC   who seek self rule in the south  turned on the government after accusing a party allied to Hadi of being complicit in a Houthi attack on southern forces 
Saudi Arabia has called for a summit to end the standoff  which has complicated U N  efforts to end the war in Yemen  But Hadi s government said it would not participate until the separatists cede control of sites they have seized 
The standoff has exposed differences between regional allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE  which in June scaled down its presence in Yemen while still backing thousands of southern separatist fighters ",2019-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/yemens-separatists-clash-with-government-forces-in-shabwa-sources-1961603,1961603
176123,397639,SO,Here s Why Southern Co   SO  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Southern Co   SO   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Southern Co  Currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SO that show why this power company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For SO  shares are up 0 04  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 34  compares favorably with the industry s 0 76  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Southern Co  Have risen 15 81   and are up 14 98  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 14 09  and 10 26   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to SO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  SO is currently averaging 4 585 957 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with SO 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SO s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 01 to  3 03 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that SO is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Southern Co  On your short list ",2019-03-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-southern-co-so-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200402334,200402334
176124,397640,SO,Two men arrested in California and Wisconsin for alleged workplace threats,news,"By Peter Szekely
 Reuters    Two men in California and Wisconsin who had large firearms caches have been arrested in separate incidents for threatening attacks on their workplaces  authorities in the two states said  following a spate of recent mass shooting threats and three deadly attacks since July 
In Southern  NYSE SO  California  Long Beach police said they arrested Rodolfo Montoya  37  on Tuesday  a day after he threatened to attack the hotel where he worked because he was upset over an employment related issue 
Police said they found an arsenal that included illegal high capacity magazines and an assault rifle at Rodolfo s home in nearby Huntington Beach after they were notified of the verbal threat by a fellow employee of the Long Beach Marriott 
 Because this was reported  I firmly believe many lives were saved   Police Chief Robert Luna said at a news conference 
Montoya was being held on  500 000 bail after being charged with manufacturing and distributing assault weapons  possessing an assault weapon and making a criminal threat  police said 
It was not immediately clear whether Montoya  who the Los Angeles Times said worked at the hotel as a cook  was represented by a lawyer 
In Wisconsin  31 year old Kevin Pinkham was arrested on Tuesday after telling a co worker at the Eau Claire distribution center where he worked on Aug  15 that  I m going to shoot this place up   according to a criminal complaint 
An investigating officer concluded that  multiple employees at Menards Distribution Center feared for their life based on the defendant s threats   the complaint said 
The complaint said Pinkham denied making the threats  but admitted having replied to a text from his girlfriend who asked if he was having a bad day   No  I m just going to kill everyone   He told investigators he was only joking  the complaint said 
Police said they found several rifles  handguns and ammunition at Pinkham s home  as well as a loaded Walther 9mm pistol in his car 
Pinkham  who was charged with making terrorist threats and disorderly conduct  was being held on a  10 000 cash bond and was scheduled for a court appearance next Tuesday  His attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment 
Meanwhile in Mount Clemens  Michigan  a 30 year old man identified as Cory Fraser was to be arraigned in court on Thursday accused of threatening to shoot 200 police officers 
Fraser was arrested on Wednesday after a former classmate told authorities that Fraser was very upset when they spoke on Monday  stating that local police were biased against him and saying he was angry only six officers were wounded during a shooting last week in Philadelphia  according to prosecutors 
Fraser is charged with making a false threat of terrorism and faces 20 years in prison if convicted  Macomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith said in a statement 
The arrests come amid a slew of threats in the past week to carry out mass shootings and follow mass shootings since late July that killed at least 34 people in Gilroy  California  El Paso  Texas  and Dayton  Ohio ",2019-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/two-men-arrested-in-california-and-wisconsin-for-alleged-workplace-threats-1961699,1961699
176125,397641,SO,Is Southern  SO  Stock Outpacing Its Utilities Peers This Year ,opinion,"For those looking to find strong Utilities stocks  it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers  Is Southern  SO  one of those stocks right now  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Utilities peers  we might be able to answer that question 
Southern is a member of the Utilities sector  This group includes 120 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of  6  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst

176143,397659,SO,Oxford Industries  OXM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Oxford Industries  OXM  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the Tommy Bahama  Lilly Pulitzer and Southern  NYSE SO  Tide clothing lines is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14  
Revenues are expected to be  302 96 million  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oxford Industries 
For Oxford Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oxford Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oxford Industries would post earnings of  0 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 14  delivering a surprise of  17 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oxford Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oxford-industries-oxm-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200399850,200399850

take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  QEP Resources  Q4 Earnings and Sales Miss Estimates QEP Resources reported fourth quarter 2018 loss per share   excluding special items   of 13 cents  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break even earnings and the prior year earnings of  1 13  The underperformance stemmed from lower production volumes and higher operating expenses Moreover  quarterly revenues of  410 5 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  451 million  Sales were also down from the year ago figure of  429 million Divestment UpdateThe company announced that it has aborted its divestment plan of Williston Basin assets to Vantage Acquisition Operating Company  QEP Resources plans to divest Permian Basin gas midstream infrastructure in the first six months of 2019  Moreover  plans to divest other midstream infrastructure assets in the region along with non core assets in the company s portfolio are underway Volume Analysis Overall fourth quarter production of the company came in at 11 627 2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent  Mboe   down 2  from the year ago period  While volumes of natural gas fell 18  year over year to 28 1 billion cubic feet  Bcf   that of natural gas liquids jumped 4  to 1 188 9 thousand barrels  Mbbl   Notably  oil volumes  which increased 10  from the prior year quarter to 5 749 9 Mbbl  49 5  of total output   partially offset total production decline  The fall in fourth quarter output was caused by a decline in oil production from the Williston Basin and decreased gas production due to lack of activities in the Haynesville Cotton Valley  Moreover  the divested assets of Uinta Basin negatively affected total output    With the company shifting its focus toward Permian Basin  included in its Southern  NYSE SO  Region assets   equivalent production from the area jumped 71  year over year to 4 368 7 Mboe  The rise was supported by higher gas capture rates due to the completion of midstream infrastructure  At the end of the quarter  the company was operating four rigs in the region  Total Southern Region production improved 19  year over year to 7 819 4 Mboe  However  production from Northern Region assets fell 31  year over year to 3 807 8 Mboe  primarily due to the divestment of Pinedale properties Realized PricesQEP Resources  net realized natural gas price in the quarter was  2 69 per thousand cubic feet  marginally down from the year ago level of  2 70  Net oil price realization declined 5  year over year to  48 98 per barrel

year quarter Operating Expenses Total operating expenses in the quarter increased to  1 525 6 million from  461 8 million a year ago  The rise was primarily due to a surge in impairment costs  which was partially offset by decreasing lease operating costs  along with transportation and processing expenses Capital ExpenditureCapital investment  excluding acquisitions  decreased nearly 49 4  year over year to  188 4 million in the fourth quarter  mainly due to a fall in drilling and completion activities in Permian and Williston basins  along with Haynesville Cotton Valley In full year 2018

Business description
Hellenic Petroleum  ELPE  operates three refineries in Greece with a total capacity of 341kbd  and has sizeable marketing  domestic and international  and petrochemicals divisions 
Investment summary
Flexible  complex European refiner
Hellenic Petroleum operates three refineries in Greece with a total capacity of 341kbd and has sizeable marketing  domestic and international  and petrochemicals divisions  Two of the refineries  Aspropyrgos and  lefsina  are complex  integrated and provide significant flexibility of feedstocks throughput  The third  Thessaloniki  is small and simple but houses Hellenic s petrochemicals units  which have significant Greek and Mediterranean sales  and complements Hellenic s refining system  In addition to refining and petrochemicals  ELPE is active in the fuels marketing  power and gas sectors  It is looking to build out its renewable power generation capacity over the course of the next five years 
Strategy  Growing renewables investment
Hellenic s strategy continues to evolve  with the aim of increasing refining competitiveness through energy efficiency initiatives  procurement optimisation and leveraging digital technology across all group activities  In addition  over the next five years c  300 400m of capex is earmarked for growth projects  This includes conversion unit debottlenecking  margin improvement and investment in the group s renewables strategy  We believe this will include investment in the Greek wind  solar and biofuel sectors  We expect management to provide details of precise investments  margin expectations and power generation capacity in due course  Management estimates that the combination of competitiveness improvement and growth projects described above could deliver an incremental  150 200m in EBITDA post investment which  combined with management s anticipated IMO 2020 impacts  has the potential to deliver group adjusted EBITDA in excess of  1bn beyond 2020 
Blended valuation of  9 22 share
Edison s valuation of ELPE is based on a blend of three approaches  DCF  FY19 P E multiple and FY19 EV EBITDA multiple  ELPE trades at an FY19e P E of 8 7x relative to European peers of 9 2x  and 5 7x FY19e EV EBITDA relative to 5 3x  ELPE s premium EV EBITDA could reflect its peer leading dividend yield  Dividends to be paid in FY19 include a  0 25 share special dividend based on DESFA sale proceeds  Key sensitivities include refining margins assumptions  both short  and long term  A  10  move in benchmark margin has a  8  move in our valuation 
FCF to be directed towards debt reduction and dividends
We expect ELPE to be significantly free cash flow  FCF  generative in the absence of major upgrade spend  with FY19 FCF of  535m and FY20 FCF of  626m  Excess cash generation and DESFA sales proceeds offer the ability to de leverage and fund a special return to shareholders of  0 25 share to be paid in FY19  While opportunities exist to maximise margins through optimisation of existing installed capacity as macro conditions evolve  we expect decisions on major upgrades or expansion to be deferred until completion of the sale of a majority stake in the company 
Risks and sensitivities
A tender process is currently underway for the sale of a 50 1  stake in Hellenic  binding offers are expected in early 2019 and are likely to act as key valuation benchmarks for the equity market  Competition remains robust within the refining sector with more than 2mmbd of new refining capacity ramping up from Q418  potentially putting a cap on margins and driving down Middle Eastern crude differentials  We see this as a threat to small  lower complexity refineries in high cost jurisdictions 
A year to IMO 2020   laying out the options
IMO 2020 overview
Stronger controls on the sulphur levels in vessel exhaust gases will come into effect in January 2020 as environmental legislation for shipping catches up with existing policy in other heavy industry  On 1 January 2020  shippers will be compelled to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of less than 0 5   from current 3 5   for all international shipping outside certain emission control areas  specific coastal areas impose stricter limits  As of today  c 80  of fuel within the global shipping fleet is heavy HSFO rather than low sulphur marine fuel  or distillate based light fuel oils  It is widely expected that shippers will shift to using ultra low sulphur fuel oil  ULSFO 0 5    or MGO 0 5  as an alternative driving a significant expansion in the gasoil to HSFO price spread from the start of 2020  With c 3 5mmbd of HSFO currently being produced within the global refining complex  we expect IMO 2020 to have a significant impact on crude and product price spreads 
Forecasts from integrated oil companies and the IEA show the anticipated shift in product demand post IMO 2020  The IEA estimates a slightly slower transition away from HSFO  on the basis of non compliance in the shipping sector during the early years of IMO 2020 implementation 

Options for the shippers
In order for shipping companies to be compliant with IMO 2020 there are three main options under consideration  which we describe below  Industry experts estimate that the shift in fuel cost for the industry as a whole will cost c US 60bn per annum over the period 2020 23  In general  the shipping industry is keen to pass this cost on to the charterer  while testing alternative solutions such as exhaust gas cleaning systems and LNG in order to remain competitive 
Installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems  scrubbers 
Scrubbers offer an  instant fix  for the shipping industry  but are possibly the least environmentally friendly option  Increased fuel consumption  resultant higher CO2 emissions and water pollution and lack of industry experience are key considerations  However  at a cost of c US 7 10m per ship  and with the ability to continue to operate on HSFO 3 5   there is potentially a significant advantage available to shippers that deploy this solution and exploit deeply discounted fuel costs 
The payback period for investment in scrubbers will depend on the size of vessel and the discount at which HSFO 3 5  trades relative to compliant fuels  Industry experts estimate a payback of less than a year assuming a c US 200 mt  metric tonne  differential between HSFO 3 5  and ULSFO 0 5  
Other major downsides of the use of scrubbers include the costs of maintenance  operation and cleaning  loss of vessel capacity  and potential fines if performance fails to meet specification 
Retrofitting vessels to LNG fuel
LNG retrofits are considered a high capex option that provides certainty of emissions compliance  but the lack of fuelling infrastructure at major ports is currently a major deterrent  Hapag Lloyd estimates the cost for conversion to LNG at US 25 30m per ship 
Shift to compliant fuels
The current preferred option among the shipping industry is to switch to compliant fuels such as ULSFO 0 5  or MGO 0 5   meeting the requirements of IMO 2020  The price impact on charter rates will be significant and shippers are devising various formulas by which they can pass on higher fuel costs to customers while remaining competitive and maintaining margins  Hapag Lloyd estimates the cost per 20 foot equivalent unit  TEU  could be an incremental  128 to  415 depending on transport route and underlying fuel prices 
How refiners are reacting to a shift in feedstock pricing and product demand
Increasing crude flexibility
Feedstock accounts for c 80  of refining costs and crude flexibility remains a key lever when looking to maximise margins in the face of crude price and product demand volatility  Most refineries are configured to operate within a relatively narrow quality window  which may limit their ability to exploit lower priced crudes without affecting plant performance 
Heavily discounted sour crudes may present an opportunity for complex and flexible refineries able to increase sour feedstock while limiting HSFO residues  Refineries dependent on light sweet crude feedstock are likely to be less robust  in the absence of hardware changes  assuming a material widening of the sweet sour crude spread 
With IMO 2020 on the horizon  we expect refiners to have been through the process of analysing crude flexibility within plant tolerances  and scoping plant upgrades in order to assess the potential returns  Refineries are likely to be assessing crude flexibility within existing facility constraints  but pressing the button on large capital projects  such as cokers or deep conversion units  which can cost billions of dollars and take many years to engineer and construct  is unlikely to occur until there is greater visibility of the direct impact of IMO 2020 given the uncertainties 
ELPE s refining capacity  complexity and flexibility
ELPE operates three refineries that together account for 341kbd capacity and 65  of the Greek refinery output  A composite Nelson complexity index of 9 2 gives an indication of the complex s flexibility and ability to produce a high percentage of light products from every barrel  The refineries are linked  allowing better integration to best take advantage of their strengths of location  size  storage and complexity 
The complex has a high degree of flexibility  since 2014 it has been able to flex its gasoline yield between 20  and 24   while middle distillates have been between 50  and 58  of yield  working at full capacity   Fuel oil yields are fairly low  10 13   and there are no plans to undertake large projects to add further units to the complex at this time  The company has a large storage capacity  41 8mmbbl  and can take advantage of trading opportunities 
ELPE s low fuel oil yield and complexity should ensure the group is well placed for IMO 2020 and the anticipated switch in demand from HSFO 3 5  to ULSFO 0 5  and MGO 0 5   ELPE plans minimal changes to crude processing at Elefsina and Thessaloniki ahead of IMO 2020 as neither refinery produces HSFO  Aspropyrgos  on the other hand  presents an opportunity to reduce high sulphur feed and replace this with lower sulphur crudes  switching current output from 24  HSFO to just 4  HSFO 

Options may exist to take advantage of heavily discounted high sulphur crudes  however  desulphurisation is a catalyst intensive and expensive process  which is likely to limit the appeal to upgrade sour crudes unless we see a material widening of the sweet sour  Brent Dubai  spread 
The graphs below show ELPE s current group level bias towards heavy crude feedstock  high middle distillate output and low fuel oil output  Current HSFO yield stands at 10 12  

Refinery  Integration and flexibility
Aspropyrgos refinery is the largest in Hellenic s portfolio and is one of the most modern refineries in Europe  it was built in 1958   Significant upgrades were completed in 1986  residue conversion project  FCC  mild hydrocracker  visbreaker and CCR units   1999  capacity increased to 148kbd  and 2004  upgrade of conversion units   From 2014  heat and power have been supplied by natural gas  rather than fuel oil   reducing costs and increasing flexibility  The result is a refinery able to produce high levels of gasoline  It is connected to Elefsina via pipeline 
Elefsina is Hellenic s most complex refinery and has a refining capacity of 100kbd  A  1 4bn upgrade in 2012 added a 39kbd hydrocracker  a 20kbd thermal cracking unit  flexicoker  which gasifies coke for internal heat and power generation and reduces the need to export sell coke produced elsewhere in the refinery  and a vacuum distillation unit  increasing the Solomon complexity to 13 9 from 1 5  and the Nelson complexity to 11 3   Its large storage capacity  20 7mmbbl   coastal location and connections  to Aspropyrgos refinery and crude terminals at Pachi and Megara  make it a good trading and logistics hub  The refinery can take heavy  high sulphur crudes and products  As a result  its middle distillate yield is over 75  
Thessaloniki is the smallest and simplest refinery  hydroskimming  type and has a storage capacity of 8 8mmbbl  It is the only refinery in Northern Greece  Aspropyrgos and Elefsina make up a southern Greek hub  and supplies both the domestic market and neighbouring countries  A 2011 upgrade renovated distillation units  increased storage capacity and added a 15kbd CCR unit  Thessaloniki also provides feedstock  including residues  to the Southern  NYSE SO  hub and reforms naphtha from Elefsina  to gasoline  

ELPE s refineries are at the smaller end in comparison to European refinery capacities  but we note that the combination of ELPE s two more complex refineries  integrated through pipeline connection  would equate to a combined capacity towards the top end of the group ",2019-03-22,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hellenic-petroleum-imo-2020-on-the-horizon-200400075,200400075

176153,397669,SO,Southern Yemeni separatists tell Saudi Arabia  evict Islah or lose the war,news,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON  Reuters    Yemen s southern separatists vowed on Wednesday to keep control over Aden  warning the only way out of the impasse that has fractured a Saudi led military alliance was for Islamists and northerners to be removed from positions of power in the south  The separatists  supported by coalition member the United Arab Emirates  effectively took over Aden  the temporary seat of the Saudi backed Yemeni government  over the weekend by seizing government military bases   Giving up control of Aden is not on the table at the moment   Saleh Alnoud  British based spokesman for the Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC   told Reuters in an interview   We are there to remain   but to remain for a positive reason  to maintain stability   Alnoud said   The Western backed  Sunni Muslim alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Iran aligned Houthi movement that ousted President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014  His government relocated to Aden  Southern fighters are a major component in the coalition  But the war has revived old strains between north and south Yemen   formerly separate countries that united into a single state in 1990 under then President Ali Abdullah Saleh  The crisis has exposed a rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE as Abu Dhabi places national interests over their strategic alliance  distancing itself from Yemen and leaving Riyadh to deal with a messy war in the fractious Arabian Peninsula nation  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted on Wednesday that Abu Dhabi was committed to its allies and  our shared goals of peace   stability in the region   Abu Dhabi has echoed Riyadh s call for dialogue among Aden s warring parties but stopped short of asking the southern forces that it funds and arms to cede control  In the interview  Alnoud said that to end the stand off  the Islamist Islah party   a backbone of Hadi s government that the UAE sees as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood   should be ousted from posts of influence along with any northern politicians   The STC accuses Islah of being complicit in a Houthi missile strike on southern forces earlier this month  a charge the party rejects  The coalition has promised military action against the separatists if they do not vacate government sites   Islah has been at the heart of this   Alnoud said    That would be a very good start if Islah was removed from the whole of the south and allow southerners to govern themselves   he said   We consider the government was infiltrated or controlled by the Islah   One possible way out  Alnoud said  would be to hand over responsibility for security of barracks to the STC s Security Belt or Aden Police   The Yemen war has been in military stalemate for years  Saudi Arabia and the UAE have come under pressure from Western allies  including those that supply them with arms  to end a conflict that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine  The UAE in June scaled down its presence in Yemen  leaving behind thousands of southern forces it has built and trained  A Yemeni official told Reuters the separatist takeover was approved by the UAE and aimed at removing Islah forces  which Saudi Arabia tolerates despite UAE concerns because the party props up Hadi s government   Abu Dhabi now seems to be reconsidering the wisdom of Saudi foreign policy under MBS  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman   which has produced few tangible victories of note   the New York based Soufan Center said in a briefing on Wednesday  A MESSAGE FOR MBS  While the UAE can exit Yemen while maintaining influence through southern forces  Saudi Arabia cannot walk away without neutralizing the armed Houthi movement on its borders    Now that the Saudis are left alone   I don t think they know how to get out   said a Gulf source familiar with Yemen policy   The Saudis must accept that five years of Hadi government is a failure   Alnoud said southerners would no longer accept being sidelined   The Saudis need to make a decision  do they want to win the war against the Houthis  If they do  then they need to recognize us   STC   to govern and manage the south even in the transition period   he said  Riyadh called for a summit over Aden without setting a date  Hadi s vice foreign minister  Mohammed al Hadhrami  told Reuters on Wednesday they would not attend unless the UAE stops backing separatist fighters following the  coup    We cannot go and meet   if  the separatists  stay in control of Aden and don t withdraw from positions   he said   Alnoud had a message for Saudi Prince Mohammed   I would say to MBS  if you really want to win the war  the southerners have been credible partners  have shown they can engage constructively    but in return they need to keep the south clean from these corrupt Islah affiliated officials   Alnoud said U N  peace efforts needed to catch up with events  The United Nations is struggling to implement a stalled peace deal in the main port city of Hodeidah and ease tensions between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis to enable political talks on a transitional governing body to end the war   Southerners need to be given the power to govern themselves and southerners need to be engaged as an equal partner in the peace process   Alnoud said   We can still be part of Yemen  Hadi can still be president but the south is to be ruled and governed by southerners    So will the south break away  
 I am not trying to avoid saying we will break away because that is a real possibility now   Alnoud said  adding one option was for two governments  one in the north and one in the south   Reporting and writing by Guy Faulconbridge with additional reporting by Stephen Kalin in Riyadh and Lisa Barrington in Dubai  Editing by Ghaida Ghantous  Mark Heinrich and Gareth Jones ",2019-08-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/southern-yemeni-separatists-tell-saudi-arabia-evict-islah-or-lose-the-war-1954809,1954809
176154,397670,SO,Peru court orders indigenous governor of mining region to six years in prison,news,"LIMA  Reuters    A Peruvian court ordered the arrest of the indigenous governor of a mineral rich southern region after sentencing him to six years in prison on Wednesday for leading 2011 deadly protests against a Canadian open pit silver project 
Walter Aduviri  39  the governor of Puno and an indigenous Aymara leader  was found guilty in absentia by a criminal court of disturbing public order  the office of the judiciary said on Twitter 
Aduviri did not appear at the trial and ignored a previous judicial order to be held in jail ahead of it 
His current whereabouts are unknown  leaving it unclear who has been governing the highland region rich in gold  silver  tin  lithium and uranium  Agustin Luque  the deputy governor of Puno  was expected to replace him in office 
One of Aduviri s attorneys  Aldo Valdivia  said he continues to deny any wrongdoing and is at an undisclosed  safe harbor  while he resists a judicial process he considers unfair 
A trained accountant and a self avowed admirer of indigenous President Evo Morales in neighboring Bolivia  Aduviri spent most of 2018 as a fugitive of a sedition conviction before being acquitted on appeal and winning the governor s race in October regional elections 
The new sentence was a blow one of the more radical local leaders in the country s mineral rich south  a bastion for opposition to politics dominated by Lima elites where many clamor for a greater share of mining proceeds 
However  the ruling might also fuel anti mining sentiment in a region that is already simmering with protests against an industry that drives about 15  of the country s economic growth and 60  of its export earnings 
Aduviri plans to file an appeal as soon as he receives official notification of his sentence   We ll take it to the Supreme Court   Valdivia said  arguing there was no direct proof Aduviri had organized the protests 
Known as the  Aymarazo   in reference to the Aymara Indians like Aduviri who have led opposition to a Canadian miner Bear Creek Mining Corp s plans to tap a silver deposit in Puno  the 2011 protests left five dead in clashes with police and led the government to rescind the company s authorization to operate 
Aduviri told Reuters in an interview last year that he and other anti mining activists had been unfairly targeted by the country s justice system for exercising their constitutional right to protest 
Peru is the world s No 2 copper  zinc and silver producer and the sixth largest gold producer  But conflicts over the country s most robust industry have blocked billions of dollars in potential investments in the past decade 
In recent weeks  opposition to Southern  NYSE SO  Copper Corp s  1 4 billion Tia Maria project by farmers who fear it will contaminate crops has triggered clashes in the region of Arequipa  suspending copper shipments from an important minerals port for weeks as protesters seized key infrastructure 
On Monday  a fresh strike against another mining project    Anglo American   LON AAL  PLC s  5 billion Quellaveco project   got underway in the neighboring region of Moquegua  with some local media reporting protesters had occupied roads 
Residents in Moquegua have complained that Anglo American is not meeting its commitment to hire local labor for the mine s construction  a charge the company has denied 
Aduviri is an outspoken critic of Peru s decades old business friendly economic model and has opposed Bear Creek s efforts to revive its silver project  calling it  impossible  
While he has not said whether he supports Plateau Energy Metals Inc s plans to build a lithium and uranium mine in Puno  he has called for the Peruvian state to nationalize strategic resources   a move beyond his powers as governor ",2019-08-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/peru-court-orders-indigenous-governor-of-mining-region-to-six-years-in-prison-1955314,1955314
176155,397671,SO,Tens of thousands rally in Yemen s Aden to support separatist takeover,news,"By Fawaz Salman
ADEN  Yemen  Reuters    Tens of thousands of Yemenis rallied in Aden on Thursday in support of separatist forces who took over the southern port  the temporary seat of Yemen s Saudi backed government  in a move that exposed rifts in a Sunni Muslim military coalition 
The United Arab Emirates backed southern separatists seized control of government military bases last weekend  fracturing the Saudi led alliance battling the Iran aligned Houthi group and complicating U N  peace efforts to end the war 
Demonstrators demanded recognition of southerners  right to self rule in Aden  where the government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi is based after being ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014 
Many traveled into Aden from other southern provinces on Wednesday  sleeping overnight in the central parade square  One man held up a battered old identity document from former South Yemen and many waved the South Yemen flag 
 We call on the international community and the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to respect the southern people as a key partner in stemming the Persian tide in the region and fighting terrorism to achieve   regional and global stability   said a statement to mark the rally 
The separatists are a major component of the Western backed alliance that intervened in Yemen against the Houthis in March 2015  but have a rival agenda to Hadi s government  The war has revived old strains between north and south Yemen  formerly separate countries that united into a single state in 1990 
The rally statement  issued by civil society groups and unions  accused Hadi s government of mismanagement  saying it had become  a guillotine at Yemenis  necks  
The Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council  STC  took over Aden after accusing the Islah party allied to Hadi of being complicit in a Houthi missile attack on southern forces earlier this month  a charge the party denies 
A local official told Reuters that separatist forces had moved away from the nearly empty presidential palace and central bank  There was no sign yet they had quit the military camps 
An STC spokesman said on Wednesday they would keep control unless the Islamist Islah and northerners were removed from positions of power in the south 
Hadi s government has called the move a  coup   The UAE has echoed a Saudi call for dialogue to exit the crisis but did not call on southern forces it funds and arms to cede control 
Riyadh wants to host a summit to resolve matters  Hadi s government said it would not participate until STC forces withdraw and asked Abu Dhabi to stop backing them 
The UAE  Saudi Arabia s main military ally on the ground for most of the war  has scaled back its presence in Yemen since June amid Western pressure to end the war  It said it will continue to back some 90 000 Yemeni forces made up of southern separatists and coastal plain fighters 
The UAE pull back and the Aden crisis come as the United Nations tries to reduce tensions throughout the country to pave the way for peace talks  The Houthis  who control Sanaa and most big urban centers  point to Aden as proof that Hadi is unfit to rule and cannot be a serious partner in any negotiations 
 We respect the masses gathered in our beloved south today  Anyone who does not respect the multitudes in the north and south who reject Hadi and his followers must be sick and deranged   Houthi deputy foreign minister Hussein al Azzi tweeted 
The United Nations says the war  which has killed tens of thousands and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine  needs an inclusive political solution ",2019-08-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-yemens-aden-to-support-separatist-takeover-1955928,1955928

 I just heard about the incident  We are trying to verify it  We will collect details and look into it  As of now we have no information   he said 
More than 500 local leaders and activists have been detained in the past 12 days of the crackdown 
Malik had worked for the paper for the past three years in the restive town of Tral  which is a hotbed of militancy in a decades old Kashmiri separatist movement 
Malik s father said he was told by an officer at the Awantipora police station on Thursday morning that there were  orders from the top  to arrest his son but the local police did not know the reason  They declined to release him 
Wiping away her tears  Malik s mother  Haseena  told Reuters   We curse the day he chose to become a journalist  
Both parents spoke to Reuters in Srinagar  where they were hoping to see officials to plead for their son s release

176177,397693,SO,Disgraced money manager Jeffrey Epstein dead in apparent suicide,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch and Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK  Reuters    Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on Saturday after an apparent suicide in the New York jail cell where he was being held without bail on sex trafficking charges  and a source said he was not on suicide watch at the time of his death 
Epstein  66  was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center and transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead  the Federal Bureau of Prisons  which operates the lower Manhattan jail  said in a statement 
The source  who was not authorized to speak on the record  said Epstein  a well connected money manager known for socializing with politicians and royalty  was found hanging by his neck 
The FBI and the Department of Justice s Inspector General were opening investigations  U S  Attorney General William Barr said  adding that he was  appalled  to learn of his death in federal custody 
 Mr  Epstein s death raises serious questions that must be answered   Barr said in a statement 
Last month  Epstein was found unconscious on the floor of his jail cell with marks on his neck  according to media reports  and officials were investigating that incident as a possible suicide or assault 
Even so  Epstein had recently been taken off suicide watch  a special set of procedures for inmates in danger of taking their own life  according to the source  who said the financier was in a cell by himself when his body was found 
Aja Davis  a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner  said she could not say how Epstein died before her office examined the body 
Epstein was arrested on July 6 at a New Jersey airport on return from Paris  He pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14  from at least 2002 to 2005  an indictment that followed years of sexual abuse allegations against him 
SUICIDE WATCH
It was not immediately clear why Epstein was taken off suicide watch  and officials did not respond to requests for comment 
At the MCC  two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes  but that procedure was not followed overnight  according to the source  who was not authorized to speak on the record 
In addition  every 15 minutes guards are required to make another check on prisoners who are on suicide watch 
Guards are required to remove any prisoner placed on suicide watch from the Special Housing Unit where Epstein was housed  according to a Twitter post by Preet Bharara  a former U S  Attorney for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York 
The unit is used to separate inmates such as accused sex offenders from the general population for their protection 
Last month  a judge refused to release Epstein on bail to allow him to live under 24 hour guard in his opulent townhouse on Manhattan s Upper East Side  The financier was appealing that ruling 
After Epstein s arrest  prosecutors said a search of his townhouse  conducted under a warrant  uncovered evidence of hundreds  and perhaps thousands  of nude photographs of  what appeared to be underage girls   including some photos cataloged on compact discs and kept in a locked safe 
In a court filing on July 25  the government said it was pursuing an  ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals  in connection with the case 
That investigation  in the U S  Attorney s office in Manhattan  will continue despite Epstein s death  a different source familiar with the matter said 
FRIEND OF TRUMP  CLINTON
Over the years  Epstein has counted President Donald Trump and former Democratic President Bill Clinton as his friends  and  according to court papers  Britain s Prince Andrew  None of them was mentioned in the indictment against Epstein 
The charges were announced more than a decade after he pleaded guilty in Florida to state prostitution charges in a deal with prosecutors that has been widely criticized as too lenient 
One of the Florida prosecutors  Alexander Acosta  resigned as U S  labor secretary in July as the deal came under fresh scrutiny after Epstein s arrest in New York 
His death came a day after the unsealing of a court filing in which a woman who accused Epstein of keeping her as a sex slave said one of the financier s associates had instructed her to have sex with at least a half dozen prominent men 
The claim by Virginia Giuffre came in a deposition that was included in about 2 000 pages of documents related to her defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell  the associate whom Giuffre said helped Epstein procure girls for sex 




Lawyers for Maxwell did not respond to several phone and email requests for comment ",2019-08-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/disgraced-us-financier-jeffrey-epstein-dies-by-suicide--media-reports-1951910,1951910

176179,397695,SO,Saudi rallies round exiled Yemen leader after UAE backed separatists seize Aden,news,"By Mohammed Mukhashef and Fawaz Salman
ADEN  Reuters    Saudi Arabia threw its weight behind Yemen s exiled president on Monday  as United Arab Emirates backed southern separatists controlling the port of Aden held firm against Riyadh s calls to vacate government sites 
A Saudi led alliance of Sunni Arab states has fractured after more than four years fighting on behalf of an ousted Yemeni government against the Iran aligned  Shi ite led Houthi movement that controls the capital and most populous areas 
In recent days  the UAE armed separatists have cast off an alliance with President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi s government and seized much of Aden  which had been his main base 
The UAE  Saudi Arabia s main military ally on the ground for most of the war  has drawn down forces since June 
Saudi Arabia and UAE rulers met in Mecca on Monday  in an apparent effort to stop further damage to their alliance that would boost their common enemy the Houthis 
Saudi Arabia s King Salman bin Abdelaziz and his son  the kingdom s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  discussed the situation with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan  state run Saudi TV said 
The Saudi king and crown prince both met Hadi on Sunday  also in Mecca 
The separatist leader  Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council president Aidaroos al Zubaidi  said his group still supports the coalition against the Houthis and would attend a proposed emergency summit in Saudi Arabia 
But he did not commit to withdrawing his forces from government buildings they seized on Saturday after clashes that killed 40 people including civilians 
SAUDI STILL SUPPORTS HADI GOVERNMENT
Riyadh made clear it still backs the government led by Hadi  who has mainly lived in Saudi Arabia since fleeing Yemen s capital in 2014 
The coalition said it hit a separatist area on Sunday and threatened more attacks if the southerners did not leave 
Residents said fighting has ended since the separatists seized government military bases and surrounded the nearly empty presidential palace in Aden on Saturday 
 It is quiet now but people are still worried  We don t know where matters are heading   Aden resident Adel Mohammed told Reuters on Monday  He said power and water supplies had been restored  but could be disrupted again 
Local media quoted an official at Aden s airport as saying flights had resumed on Sunday 
Zubaidi said the separatists  who want an independent south Yemen  had no choice but to seize Aden following a deadly Houthi missile strike on southern forces earlier this month 
The separatists accuse a party allied to Hadi of being complicit in that strike  which it denies 
 We were left with two options  defend ourselves or surrender to the eradication of our just cause and souls   Zubaidi said in a statement from Aden late on Sunday 
The rift in the coalition complicates U N  efforts to implement a stalled peace deal in the main port city of Hodeidah to pave the way for broader talks to end the war 
The southern separatists and UAE forces played a major role on the ground in a coalition attempt to seize Hodeidah and cut off supply lines to Houthi held areas 
The four and a half year old war has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine 
The UAE has trained thousands of southern fighters who answer to Zubaidi  a militia leader who emerged from relative obscurity in 2015 after helping purge the Houthis from Aden 
Violence has escalated in other parts of Yemen after the Houthis stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities

NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  prosecutors on Monday criminally charged a junior analyst at  RBC  Capital Markets with insider trading  saying he bought options in a digital printing company after learning it was in talks to be acquired by an RBC client 
Bill Tsai  23  who graduated last year from New York University s Stern School of Business  was charged with one count of securities fraud  carrying a maximum 20 year prison term 
Prosecutors said Tsai  of New York  misappropriated nonpublic information to more than triple his investment in Electronics for Imaging Inc over a three week period  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges 
Tsai was arrested on Sunday and it was unclear whether he had a lawyer  He could not immediately be reached for comment 
RBC  part of Royal Bank of Canada  TO RY   said it had suspended Tsai and has a  zero tolerance approach to any breach of the law or our code of conduct   It was not accused of wrongdoing 
Tsai was accused of buying Electronics for Imaging call options after learning it was negotiating a takeover by private equity firm Siris Capital Group LLC  an RBC client 
According to a criminal complaint  Tsai began purchasing the options on March 29  using a personal trading account he had concealed from RBC  and sold them less than two hours after the  1 6 billion merger was announced on April 15 
Electronics for Imaging s share price rose 29 3  that day  and prosecutors said Tsai generated a  98 750 profit on his options  for which he had paid  28 410 
 His profits were not the result of trading acumen  diligent research  or blind luck   U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement

176186,397702,SO,Murray falls to Gasquet after long singles layoff,news,"Scotsman Andy Murray s long awaited return to singles play Monday at the Western   Southern  NYSE SO  Open in Cincinnati didn t go as well as he or his fans might have expected with a 6 4  6 4 first round loss to Frenchman Richard Gasquet 
Gasquet ended a five match losing streak to Murray  who moved cautiously and struggled with his serve during the match after working his way back from a second hip surgery in January  It was Murray s first competitive singles round since Jan  14 
 I think I did OK   said Murray  32   I think there were a lot of things I would like to have done better in the match  but you also have to be somewhat realistic  in terms of what you can expect  
Gasquet used a series of drop shots to take the first set and was also helped when Murray lost his service in the opening game  After falling behind 2 0 in the second set  Murray came close to breaking Gasquet in the fourth game but failed to do so 
  Richard  uses all of the angles on the court   Murray said   He s one of the best at doing that  So I was having to move quite a lot laterally  and I didn t move forward particularly well  Like when he drop shotted  there was a few times I didn t even run to the ball  didn t react to it  and that s nothing to do with my hip  That s just me not running for a ball  which I did do better at the end of the match  
The former world No  1  who tearfully announced seven months ago in Australia that his career could be over  has recently played in doubles competitions  including with his brother Jamie at the Citi Open in Washington  where they lost in the quarterfinals 
 You could see that it was not the Murray of before  but that s to be expected   said Gasquet  33 
Murray  who has plummeted to No  324 in the singles rankings  teamed with Feliciano Lopez to win doubles at the Fever Tree Championships title in London in June  and he played doubles with Pierre Hugues Herbert and mixed doubles with Serena Williams  NYSE WMB  at Wimbledon in July 
He plans to play only doubles and mixed doubles at the U S  Open 
Murray lost in the first round of the Australian Open in January before undergoing a hip resurfacing surgery that he hoped would ease the pain that had plagued him for the previous 20 months 
Murray won the 2013 and 2016 Wimbledon titles as well as the 2012 U S  Open  He also won Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016 
Overall  Murray has won 45 career singles titles  including nine in 2016  and made 11 Grand Slam finals appearances

176198,397714,SO,Metals Mining Industry Outlook  Growth Prospects Healthy,opinion,"The  industry primarily includes companies that produce non ferrous metals  including copper  gold  silver  cobalt  molybdenum  zinc  aluminium  uranium  etc  These metals are used by a wide range of industries such as the aerospace  automotive  packaging  construction  industrial machinery  electronics  transportation  jewelry  chemical  as well as nuclear energy 
Let us take a look at the three major themes in the industry The Mining   Non Ferrous industry is subject to fluctuations based on changes in global economic conditions and metals  end use markets  Metal prices have been affected by a gamut of factors  including a stronger U S  dollar  interest rate hikes and U S China trade war apprehensions  Since the industry cannot control the prices of these products  it focuses on improving sales volumes  operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs  Over the past few years  miners have trimmed capital spending and focused on cost reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies  The industry is currently plagued with escalating production costs  Labor is a major component of input costs for the mining industry  The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce that led to a spike in wages  Moreover  labor related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues  Miners are feeling the pinch of higher fuel prices  Electricity outages and shortages in several countries are adding to the woes  To minimize fuel price volatility and secure supply  companies are opting for alternate energy sources  Resources are getting depleted  supply from old mines is declining and there is a lack of development of new mines  Further  development projects are inherently risky and capital intensive  Meanwhile  demand for non ferrous metals remains high given their wide usage in primary sectors  such as transportation  electricity  construction  telecommunication  energy  information technology and materials  Demand is also increasing due to requirement from emerging markets  and economic activity in the United States and other industrialized countries  So  there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply that could aid in bolstering metal prices  which bodes well for the industry in the long haul  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects
The Zacks Mining   Non Ferrous Industry is a 10 stock group within the broader Zacks  Sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  94  which places it at the top 37  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  
We will present a few stocks that one can retain given their growth prospects  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and the current valuation first 
Industry Lags S P 500 and Sector on Shareholder Returns 
The Mining  Non Ferrous Industry has underperformed the S P 500 as well as its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively dipped 31 7  in the past year  while the Basic Materials Sector declined 12 9   On the contrary  the Zacks S P 500 has gained 2 5   during the same period 
One Year Price Performance

Mining  Non Ferrous Industry s Valuation
On the basis of trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining  Non Ferrous stocks  we see that the industry is currently trading at 5 3X compared with the S P 500 s 10 5X  The Basic Materials sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA is at 8 0X  This is shown in the charts below

Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 17 6X  as low as 4 6X with a median of 8 7X 
Bottom Line
In addition to infrastructure growth in emerging economies  Global GDP growth is expected to underpin continued demand for mining products  Moreover  continued improvement in end use sectors like automotive  aerospace  construction and packaging  among others  bodes well for metals

176211,397727,SO,As U S  college admission process opens  scandal weighs on low income students,news,"By Matthew Lavietes NEW YORK  Reuters    Christine Bascombe  a New York City high school student who dreams of attending Cornell University  says she was devastated last spring to hear that dozens of rich parents had committed fraud to get their children into elite colleges   The 16 year old  who will enter her final year at Brooklyn s Williamsburg Charter High School in the fall  says nearly every waking hour is dedicated to earning a spot in the Ivy League school   Sometimes you can work your hardest and still not get what you want   said Bascombe   And you feel even more powerless when you realize that these people are committing fraud to get into the schools you want to get into   Bascombe is one of thousands of high school students who last week began submitting applications for admission to U S  universities for the 2020 21 school year  an annual rite for seniors that begins each August 1   This year s  Common Application  cycle is the first since the cheating scandal was exposed in March  More than 30 wealthy parents  including Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and prominent figures from the financial industry  were among the nearly 50 people charged in the scandal  They were accused of paying a California consultant millions of dollars to help their children get into Yale  the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California and other prominent schools through fraudulent means  Interviews with more than a dozen low income students and college advisers suggest the scandal heightened questions about fairness of the admissions process  and shook the confidence of some who hope to beat the long odds of getting into a top school  The acceptance rates at Harvard or Yale  for example  are around 5  to 6   and about 14  of those who apply to Cornell are accepted  Most of the students interviewed said they were not surprised the admissions system was tilted in favor of the wealthy  But they were outraged and felt further disadvantaged by revelations of how blatant the manipulation was in the bribery scandal  Several belong to an eight year college enrichment program run by the Henry Street Settlement  a New York nonprofit  The program helps first generation Americans and lower income students maximize their admissions potential    I feel like not much is going to change   said Khemasia Pierce  a 17 year old who hopes to attend the University of Rochester   Anyone can be bought with the right number   A recent Pew Research Center study indicates that wealthy students still have an edge in admissions  even as most top U S  universities say they want to increase socioeconomic diversity  The percentage of U S  undergraduates from poverty backgrounds increased 8 points from 1999 to 2016  the study found  Yet at the most selective universities  the percentage of low income students increased by just 3 points while the percentage of admissions of students from the wealthiest households rose by 4 points   WHAT WE ALL EXPECTED   As of the 2017 2018 school year  there were 4 298 universities in the United Sates  according to the National Center for Education Statistics  But as higher education has become more accessible to Americans  admission to the country s top 50 universities has become much more competitive  And some wealthy parents were willing to bribe their childrens  way in  either by hiring stand ins to take or correct college entrance exams or through payments to college sports coaches to fabricate athletic credentials  Saffronia Traore Rogers  17  said she has  been grinding  to make the grade to get into her top choice of Dartmouth College  another Ivy League school   This just makes it feel like even if I do this  it won t work  It keeps me in a constant loop of anxiety   Anthony Abraham Jack  an assistant professor of education at Harvard University  said money and privilege can still play a role in who gets into the top schools   This cheating scandal showed us what we all expected  but we were never able to observe   said Jack  whose research specializes in lower income and minority undergraduates  Harvard was one of eight colleges involved in the scandal  On Wednesday  student body presidents at four universities caught up in the scandal   USC  UCLA  Stanford and Yale   in an op ed in the Los Angeles Times called for dismantling  deeply rooted institutional barriers  that put low income students at a disadvantage   The real scandal is about the millions of kids who will never have an equitable chance in an extremely complex  competitive and costly process   the students wrote  When Pierce learned about the scandal  she said her efforts to get into a top school suddenly felt pointless   Everyone complains about how  black people go to jail  and  they sell drugs       but when we try to better ourselves  you take away spots and opportunities for us   Pierce said  Many students make personal sacrifices in the belief that the system will reward hard work over privilege   During her junior year  Bascombe gave up a beloved theater program in exchange for a second math course at the advice of her guidance counselor   While it was  heartbreaking  to give up a class that provided an escape  she said   I had to focus on making my transcript really good   Several schools involved in the scandal have launched investigations and rolled out reforms aimed at preventing fraudulent admissions  raising the prospect of a more fair process going forward  For Bascombe  the scandal was not enough to abandon her Cornell dream    I know this happens and I can t do anything to control it   Bascombe said   The only thing I can do is prove my place and continue to do what I do

176214,397730,SO,CFB notebook  Schools not required to report injuries,news,"The NCAA declined to implement standardized injury reports in college football for the 2019 season as a potential response to the rise of legal sports wagering 
The NCAA Board of Governors made the announcement Wednesday after studying the issue through an ad hoc committee and determining that  player availability reporting is not a viable option at this time  
While gamblers crave information on injured players  college programs have no obligation to report the nature or status of injuries and potentially can run into problems because of student privacy laws  The NCAA  in its Wednesday announcement  even avoided calling it an  injured list   similar to how professional sports leagues approach the issue 
  Freshman cornerback Chris Steele was on the field with the Southern  NYSE SO  Cal Trojans on Tuesday after the NCAA ruled him immediately eligible as a transfer from Florida 
Steele does not have to sit out a season and can play in 2019  coach Clay Helton said  The Trojans are thin in the secondary  and Steele was ranked as high as 11th at cornerback in the 2019 recruiting class 
Steele signed with Florida in January  breaking his commitment to USC after the Trojans posted a 5 7 record in 2018  But the California native did not last long in Gainesville  Fla  His father told the Los Angeles Times that Steele wanted to leave Florida after the university denied his request for a room change following an accusation of sexual battery against his roommate 
  Tennessee s top returning defensive lineman  Emmit Gooden  will miss the season because of a torn ACL sustained in Tuesday s practice  coach Jeremy Pruitt said 
Gooden  a senior  made 33 tackles  including seven for loss and a sack  last season in 12 games  one start  after transferring from junior college  The Volunteers  coming off a 5 7 season  were looking to Gooden to help lead a defensive line that lost all three starters from last season and lacks depth 
Gooden has a redshirt year available and plans to return in 2020  Pruitt said

176217,397733,SO,El Paso massacre upends white nationalists  normalization strategy,news,"By Jim Urquhart and Nick Brown
RUSSELLVILLE  ARK   Reuters    Two years ago  America s white nationalist movement stunned the country  Neo Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville  Virginia  had turned deadly when a far right protester drove a car through a crowd  killing one and injuring dozens  Some movement leaders regrouped  Instead of stoking outrage  they set out to build support with another tack  Looking normal 
The larger goal was what many white nationalists call  Phase 2    gaining mainstream acceptance for far right ideas widely rejected as repugnant and getting white nationalists into positions of influence  The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that  for many groups  would increasingly replace confrontational rallies 
 The strategy is internally focused now   having families get together   said alt right blogger Brad Griffin  a self avowed white nationalist from Montgomery  Alabama  He fondly recalled a river tubing trip he organized in 2018 for friends who had attended a local white nationalist conference  The goal of such low key gatherings  he said  is to spread far right ideology away from the public spectacle of a public protest   It s a lot more fun to do that than to go out and tangle with Antifa    members of America s far left  anti fascist  movement    and get hit with piss balloons in the street   
 INTERACTIVE   
Griffin spoke in an interview before last weekend s massacre in El Paso  Texas   an event that has scrambled the calculus for the movement s aspiring normalizers 
On Saturday  authorities say  21 year old Patrick Crusius shot and killed 22 people and wounded two dozen more shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a  Hispanic invasion  of the United States  
The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement  Donald Trump  The U S  president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015   including his repeated use of the word  invasion  to describe immigration along the U S  Mexico border 
On Monday  Trump issued his most forceful disavowal of white supremacism to date   In one voice  our nation must condemn racism  bigotry and white supremacy   Trump said in response to the weekend s shootings   These sinister ideologies must be defeated  
After Charlottesville  the lie low approach was seen as a necessity by some in the movement  Many white nationalist groups were sued and lost access to social media  which has caused them to avoid public confrontations  said Heidi Beirich  who studies far right groups for the Southern  NYSE SO  Poverty Law Center  a nonprofit civil rights organization that tracks extremists 
 We haven t seen many rallies since Charlottesville   she said  The combination of bad press  prosecutions and lost access to social media  has  depressed people in the movement  and created a sense that  maybe the softer approach is the way to go  
The shootings  and Trump s repudiation  leave the normalizers in a difficult  perhaps impossible spot  Their gambit was always a stretch  
A Reuters photojournalist has observed the approach up close   at a children s nursery in a  church  run by the Ku Klux Klan  KKK   a restaurant and bar that caters to white supremacists in Georgia  a barbecue held in Arkansas by the ShieldWall Network  a self avowed neo Nazi group with dozens of members  Even as they described their hopes of mainstreaming  many members of these and other groups also voiced the violent tropes that animate the movement 
 WIDER IMAGE photo essay    
One is the so called Great Replacement conspiracy theory  common in white nationalist circles  which holds that leftist elites are engineering the replacement of white majorities globally through policies that encourage mass migrations as white birth rates decline  The manifesto tied to the El Paso shooting referenced the replacement theory in explaining why the shooter chose to kill Hispanic people  
Asked in a May interview how whites could regain demographic dominance  ShieldWall s leader  Billy Roper  told Reuters that promoting a higher birth rate among white people is helpful  but  bullets  would be faster  Roper said his organization doesn t advocate anything illegal but that he  couldn t disagree  with the goals of the mass shooter who murdered 51 people at two Muslim mosques in Christchurch  New Zealand in March  That killer  too  had cited the replacement theory as a motive 
In a phone interview after the Texas massacre  Roper said he didn t support the killings  But the victims  Roper said   were just pawns in the Jewish game of demographic replacement of whites   adding that such  cultural conflicts  are an  unfortunate fact of modern life  in an increasingly diverse nation moving closer to racial  balkanization  
The strategy of trying to couch such extreme views in mainstream rhetoric is not new  One of the highest profile examples of the normalization tack is that of David Duke  a former KKK grand wizard who traded the klan s signature white robes and pointy hats for a business suit  adopted more mainstream conservative talking points  and made the runoff election for Louisiana governor in 1991  Duke lost by a wide margin but drew support from about half the state s white voters 
The normalization effort is also not universal  Some far right groups are still known for confrontation  including the Proud Boys  who last October fought with people protesting a Republican Club event in New York City 
Members of the National Socialist Movement  a neo Nazi group  carry guns and other weapons  left  as they gather in a parking lot before attending a rally at the state capitol in Little Rock  Arkansas  in November 2018  The group was protesting what it called the  white genocide  taking place in South Africa 
In Draketown  Georgia  Pat Lanzo runs a restaurant and bar that white supremacists have claimed as their own  Lanzo insists the Georgia Peach Oyster Bar is merely a celebration of free speech  
 We re not racist   he said   We hate everyone equally   
The decor inside his bar is filled with the kind of racist tropes that remain a hard sell with mainstream America  His menus feature a drawing of a Klan member relaxing on a hammock made of two lynched black corpses tied together at the feet  And Lanzo has rented his property to neo Nazis and klan members for cross burnings  a traditional show of force by the KKK in the American South 
The image scrubbing by today s white nationalists belies a long history of violence by far right ideologues  In the ten years ending in 2018  murderers motivated by far right ideology took the lives of 124 people in 62 incidents  according to the U S  Extremist Crime Database  a collaboration of criminal justice researchers from multiple universities  The statistics include white supremacists but also those with other far right agendas that are not focused on race  such as anti government militants 
Thomas Robb  the national director of The Knights Party  a group formerly named the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan  said the movement should think beyond confrontations and rallies 
 When the rally s over  what do you do   said Robb in an interview before the El Paso shootings   Our goal isn t so much to get membership  but influence  When people come to our website  they see responsible people who aren t using the  N word  in every sentence   Instead  Robb said  the aim is to  speak like Corporate America  as a way to make far right ideas more palatable to a broader audience  
White nationalists have always debated whether putting  reasonable clothing  on their movement would get them further than street clashes and violence  said Mike German  a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice  a left leaning policy institute  But the approach appears to have gained momentum under Trump in part because of the president s racially divisive rhetoric  said German  who previously spent years undercover with white nationalists as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  
 Before  white nationalists were trying to shove their way into the mainstream   German said   Now  they re being invited in   
It s far from clear whether many true believers are ready for life in the mainstream  
This past April in Russellville  Arkansas  a lakeside college town  three members of the ShieldWall Network gathered to rent a houseboat and cruise around Lake Dardanelle  A Reuters photojournalist went with them  
Moods were light  they toasted one another with Fireball whiskey shots  laughed when one of them dropped his phone in the lake and cooed as another cuddled with his pregnant wife  Later that night  the group would initiate a new recruit  Nicholas Holloway  and burn wooden swastikas 
Two months later  in June  Holloway and two other ShieldWall members on the boat that day   Julian Calfy and John Carollo   were arrested for allegedly beating a gay man and holding a gun to his head after luring him to Calfy s home with a false dating advertisement  according to police reports  Calfy remains in jail  while the other two members are free on bail  according to a spokesman for the Pope County  Arkansas  Sheriff s Office  Each is charged with third degree battery  first degree terroristic threatening and first degree criminal mischief in connection with the attack  
Neither the defendants nor their attorneys could be reached for comment  
Griffin  the alt right blogger  condemned the El Paso shooting in stronger terms than other extremists who spoke to Reuters  calling it and other mass shootings by avowed white nationalists  insane tragedies  
At the same time  Griffin said he supported resegregation of the races  echoing one of the core principles of the manifesto that authorities tied to the Texas shooter 
The continuing violence  he said  undermines any attempt by the movement to gain more mainstream acceptance  At this point  he said  most white nationalists would rather just  stay out of the debate  ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/el-paso-massacre-upends-white-nationalists-normalization-strategy-1949918,1949918
176220,397736,SO,State Department suspends employee with white nationalist links,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  State Department has suspended a foreign affairs official assigned to its energy bureau  a department source said on Thursday  a day after his links to a white nationalist group were revealed 
The State Department declined to name the official  The Southern  NYSE SO  Poverty Law Center  a nonprofit civil rights organization best known for tracking U S  hate groups  identified him as Matthew Gebert 
Gebert did not respond to several attempts by Reuters to reach him 
The SPLC said in a report published on Wednesday that Gebert hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online under a pseudonym 
In a May 2018 podcast  Gebert said whites  need a country of our own with nukes and we will take this thing lickety split   according to SPLC 
 I am not able to confirm anything from this podium   State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told a briefing for reporters when asked whether Gebert had been placed on leave 
A pair of shootings at the weekend in Texas and Ohio has renewed attention on white nationalism and extremism within the United States 
The massacre in the predominantly Hispanic city of El Paso  Texas is being investigated as a hate crime and act of domestic terrorism  while the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the shooter in Dayton  Ohio also explored violent ideologies 
Democratic presidential front runner Joe Biden on Wednesday accused U S  President Donald Trump of fueling white supremacist beliefs that have been blamed for several U S  mass shootings

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
China Stocks Burst into Bull Market  5 Top Picks
On Feb 25  China stocks officially entered the bull market territory with major indexes registering record gains  Chinese investors indulged in profit taking on Feb 26 after registering phenomenal gains  While naysayers expressed doubts over the current rally  optimists think that this minor correction is the ideal entry point for investors 
The major catalyst for Monday s gains was President Trump s decision to postpone additional tariffs slated to be levied on  200 billion of Chinese imports starting Mar 1  Further  China s government is implementing stimulus and undertaking wide ranging reforms to rejuvenate its economy  These factors make it the ideal time to invest in China stocks to capitalize on the ongoing rally

Stimulus  Financial Reforms to Power Long Lasting Gains
Till recently  Chinese authorities had stuck to an austere stance on stimulus  This led to fixed asset investment declining from more than 20  to below 6   However   aggregate financing to the real economy  increased by 4 64 trillion yuan   685 billion  in January 
Analysts at credit market research firm CreditSights think January 2019 witnessed the  fastest single month growth since records began in 1992   The surge in financing was spearheaded by state owned banks which increased lending by 3 57 trillion over last month 
This indicates a significant shift in stance  possibly an attempt to address the recent economic weakness  Meanwhile  the prospect of widespread financial sector reforms boosted brokerage stocks on Feb 25  Gains were powered by president Xi Jinping s comments at a politburo meeting where he said that China will intensify financial reforms and work toward opening up the financial sector

176223,397739,SO,U S  Steel Mills Reach Capacity Rate,opinion,"According to the American Iron and steel Institute s  AISI  weekly steel production report  U S  steel mills churned out steel at a capacity utilization rate of 81 1  for the year through March 2 
Adjusted year to date production by U S  steel mills for the year through March 2 reached 16 4 million tons  up 6 9  from the 15 4 million tons produced during the equivalent period in 2018  when capacity utilization was 75 7   
As cited by the Department of Commerce throughout its Section 232 investigation of steel and aluminum imports  a capacity rate of at least 80  is deemed a measure of a healthy industry sector 
For the week ending March 2  production reached 1 9 million net tons  up 5 9  year over and up 1 0  from the previous week  Capacity rate for the week ending March 2 hit 82 8  
By region  in the week ending March 2  the U S  produced 

Northeast  212 000 net tons
Great Lakes  716 000 net tons
Midwest  208 000 net tons
Southern  NYSE SO   717 000 net tons
Western  74 000 net tons

The United States Trade Representative  USTR  recently submitted its annual Trade Policy Agenda and Annual Report  which noted the impact of Chinese steel overcapacity on the U S  steel sector 
 The domestic steel industry lost 14 100 American jobs in 2015 and 2016   the report stated   Capacity utilization of American steel mills was only 69 4 percent in 2016  a level that inhibited efficient operations and discouraged American steel companies from investing in research and development  Meanwhile  China and other steel producing nations dramatically increased their production capacity   despite growing evidence of global overcapacity  By 2016  China had enough capacity to produce as much steel as the rest of the world combined  
The USTR report also criticized the World Trade Organization for its pushback with respect to the U S  s invocation of national security to impose the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum  The report states that multiple WTO members are  urging the WTO to overrule the United States  determinations concerning its own essential national security interests regarding trade in steel and aluminum under Section 232  
 Such a decision by the WTO to second guess U S  national security determinations would threaten serious damage to the multilateral trading system   the USTR report states   The United States intends to fight vigorously these efforts to impinge its national sovereignty

176241,397757,SO,Explainer  UAE military drawdown raises stakes in south Yemen,news,"By Ghaida Ghantous
DUBAI  Reuters    Attacks on Yemeni forces that form a core component of the Saudi led military coalition in the south of the country risk further destabilizing Aden  seat of the government  and complicating United Nations peace efforts 
The Iran aligned Houthi movement  which the alliance has been battling for more than four years  launched a missile attack on United Arab Emirates backed Security Belt forces in the southern port city  a coalition stronghold  that killed 36 soldiers on Thursday 
The strike on a military parade was the worst violence to hit Aden since southern separatists forces  including Security Belt units  clashed with the Saudi backed government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2017 in a power struggle 
Analysts say the Houthis may be testing any weaknesses in the coalition following the UAE military drawdown in the south and western coast announced in June  which appears to have also emboldened Islamist militant groups in Yemen who carried out separate deadly attacks on southern forces last week 
WHY IS ADEN SIGNIFICANT 
The Houthis have stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities  but this is the first serious attack by the group on Aden since it was captured by the coalition in 2015 
The Western backed  Sunni Muslim alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis after they ousted Hadi s government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 
The Houthis  who hold most urban centers including Sanaa and the main port of Hodeidah  have no traction in the south  where the UAE has armed and trained some 90 000 Yemeni troops drawn from southern separatists and coastal plains fighters 
The Houthis appear to be testing dynamics on the ground after the UAE withdrew some troops and hardware from the area  the only territory seized by the coalition in the war and where Saudi Arabia holds less sway 
 There seems to be an attempt to test where and how the balance of power can shift   said Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group think tank 
The attacks on southern security forces are also likely to heighten tensions between southern separatists and Hadi s government over who should control southern Yemen 
The war has revived old strains between north and south Yemen  formerly separate countries that united into a single state in 1990 under slain former President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
The Southern  NYSE SO  Transitional Council blames Hadi s government for the area s security and economic woes and has instigated protests in the past  Adding to tensions  southern forces were hit in two attacks within two days claimed by Islamic State and al Qaeda  among Yemen s many destabilizing forces 
The Council on Thursday called for restraint following the parade attack  which killed a Security Belt commander who was a leader among southern separatists  after many of its followers took to social media to threaten northerners in Aden 
WHY IS THE UAE SCALING DOWN ITS PRESENCE 
There are many reasons  war fatigue  Western criticism and rising Iran tensions that pose a risk closer to home 
Abu Dhabi says its decision has been in the making for months and was a natural progression after a ceasefire went into effect last December in Hodeidah  which became the focus of the war last year when the coalition tried to seize it 
Diplomats say the UAE accepted there could be no military solution due to global criticism of coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and a humanitarian crisis that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine 
Pressure by Western allies  including those that supply arms and intelligence to the coalition  to end the war that has killed tens of thousands  and heightened U S  Iran tensions  which risk triggering a direct confrontation in the Gulf  added impetus to the UAE decision 
A senior Emirati official said the UAE remained part of the coalition and would not leave a vacuum in Yemen as it continues to back the local forces it has built up to combat the Houthis and Islamist militant groups 
Diplomats have said Abu Dhabi s move is building momentum for a U N  sponsored nationwide truce in the Arabian Peninsula nation this year  but that this would require a de escalation of tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia 
WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND 
Seven months on from the Stockholm pact  there has only been a unilateral Houthi withdrawal from Hodeidah ports  It has yet to be matched with a redeployment of coalition backed forces that would pave the way for a full pullout by both sides 
U N  envoy Martin Griffiths is shuttling between Yemen  Saudi Arabia and the UAE to salvage the deal  the first major breakthrough in peace efforts in over four years and a gateway to launching talks on a political framework to end the war 
A major sticking point in the Sweden pact remains agreeing on who would ultimately control Hodeidah amid deep mistrust among all parties  The port handles the bulk of Yemen s commercial and aid supplies and is critical for feeding the long impoverished country s 30 million population 
If broader political talks on a transitional ruling body materialize they would have to include Yemen s fractious parties  including southern separatists ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer-uae-military-drawdown-raises-stakes-in-south-yemen-1945405,1945405

the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in

Corp    NYSE KT   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Bet on Emerging Markets with These Great StocksEmerging market investments suffered in 2018 following worries over trade conflict and global growth  This is why the MSCI Emerging Markets Index shed nearly 25  of its value between Jan 29 and Oct 29  A recovery of sorts followed during the last two months of the year  but the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM  has still lost more than 18  year to date The category has rebounded this year  with the EEM up 8 6  year to date  In contrast  the S P 500 is up 10 9  over the same period  Does this mean that market watchers critical of investing in emerging markets are correct  In reality  there are several compelling reasons to invest in the category at this point  This is why it would make good sense to pick up select emerging market stocks Great Defensive Play  Valuations AttractiveAt first glance  this argument looks fallacious  but historical trends  when looked at closely  suggest otherwise  According to Jim Paulsen of the Leuthold Group  emerging market stocks have consistently beaten their developed counterparts during the last years of the market and economic cycles  Paulsen was referring specifically to the three bull markets since the mid 1990s Further  according to Charles Shriver of T  Rowe Price  emerging market stocks are significantly cheaper than their U S  counterparts  While the S P 500 currently has a forward price to earnings ratio  the metric stands at 12 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index Shriver also points that it is cheaper when considering historical trends since its current price to book ratio is 1 64  The stock has traded above this level for more than 60  of the time during the last 15 years      Faster Economic Growth  Dovish Fed Boost ProspectsAccording to economists from Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   GDP growth for emerging markets as a whole will come in around 4 6  this year  This compares favorably to expectations of 2 5  for the United States and 3 5  for the global economy as a whole Further  analysts at Franklin Templeton think emerging markets will regain their earnings growth momentum in 2019 following the slowdown encountered last year  The Fed s new found dovishness will also play its part in raising the attractiveness of emerging markets A softer approach from the Fed will weaken the dollar  benefiting emerging market stocks in the process  This is because emerging markets typically export commodities  whose price goes up when the dollar starts to decline And in case the United States and China are able to settle their trade dispute  emerging markets will move even higher  The jury is out on whether Trump will receive all the concessions he is demanding  But market watchers largely feel that a deal will be struck soon since it is the best outcome for both parties Our ChoicesMarket watchers and experts feel that emerging market stocks could strongly rebound this year  Attractive valuations and faster economic growth are just some of the factors working in their favor  At the same time  they make for great defensive plays and will benefit from a dovish Federal Reserve Adding emerging market stocks to your portfolio looks prudent  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM

176244,397760,SO,Telecom Stock Roundup  CenturyLink  Arista Trump Earnings Estimates   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a gradual uptrend on optimism over a likely long term solution to the trade war  The bilateral trade talks between the United States and China continued in Washington over the past week as both sides signaled intentions to resolve their differences  The overall equity markets seemed to ride on the positive vibes  and the stock market euphoria propelled the telecom stocks to newer heights After President Trump proposed to extend the Mar 1 deadline to reach a sweeping agreement to end the trade skirmishes  Chinese president Xi Jinping instilled faith in investors with his willingness to strike a full scale accord  He also gave hints to walk the extra mile when he met U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to seek a mutually agreeable solution to the trade dispute  A probable meeting between the top leaders of both the countries is also in the cards in the near future Although no apparent breakthrough has yet been made  the Trump administration maintained that the talks have been quite fruitful  Higher level meetings are scheduled to continue through the end of the week as Mnuchin and Lighthizer meet with Chinese vice premier Liu He to iron out the differences  Although specific discussions relating to restrictions for technology products have remained muted throughout  the industry cheered the positive developments Meanwhile  Chinese government officials and Huawei founder have upped the ante against the alleged unfair treatment meted to its CFO Meng Wanzhou  As the trial date for her probable extradition from Canada to the United Sates is drawing close  the argument that her case is politically motivated is gaining ground in China  On the other hand  the United States is moving closer to give the final touches to an executive order that could offer sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry observers feel that it could ultimately serve as a knell to some Chinese telecom firms and make it virtually impossible for them to operate in the U S  shores if the bill is passed by President Trump  However  the proposed executive order is facing stiff opposition from rural telecom service providers that use low cost Chinese equipment like that of Huawei Regarding company specific news  earnings primarily

176251,397767,SO,Pact is reached in Mozambique but prospects for peace still uncertain,news,"By Emma Rumney and Alistair Smout
JOHANNESBURG  Reuters    With a handshake  Mozambique s leaders hope to close the book on a decades long conflict on Tuesday  But an election in October and new causes of violence mean lasting peace is far from assured 
After fighting on opposite sides of a civil war that erupted following independence from Portugal and killed more than one million people between 1977 and 1992  the ruling Frelimo party and former guerrilla movement Renamo signed a ceasefire that ended the worst of the bloodshed 
However  violence has flared periodically in the years since  especially around elections 
Analysts say the new accord  encompassing a permanent end to hostilities  constitutional changes and the disarming and reintegration of Renamo fighters into the security forces or civilian life  offers the best hope yet for a lasting solution to the conflict 
     All of us have to be optimistic  because if nobody believes in peace  there will be no peace   said Felipe Donoso  head of mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Mozambique 
President Filipe Nyusi and Renamo leader Ossufo Momade  who will sign the deal  both hope it would score them political points ahead of presidential  parliamentary and provincial elections on Oct  15 
The poll could make or break the agreement  experts said  It will be the first time Renamo  now the country s main opposition party  can compete for provincial governorships  satisfying demands for political inclusion and control over areas they dominate 
The governorships offer a chance for Renamo to demonstrate that it is a functioning political party with the capacity to govern effectively  said Edward Hobey Hamsher  senior research analyst at British based risk consultancy Verisk  NASDAQ VRSK  Maplecroft 
He and other experts interviewed by Reuters cited this as a main reason the agreement might succeed where its predecessors had failed 
    However  if Renamo does not achieve its election goals of winning governorships and feels cheated by Frelimo  the accord could quickly come undone 
 Then the whole thing will collapse   said Joseph Hanlon  a visiting professor at the London School of Economics 
Already  there have been accusations of voter registration fraud 
The disarmament process will be far from complete by the time of the election  So far about 50 out of more than 5 000 Renamo fighters have been registered  a process that started last week in Gorongosa  where Renamo s headquarters are located 
But only a handful of guns were handed over  and Renamo will likely hang onto its heavier and better weapons at least until after the poll  and could sell some them to other groups  analysts said 
Both Frelimo and Renamo contain groups of hardliners unenthusiastic about the process  A Renamo general and an uncertain number of other fighters have in recent weeks disavowed Momade  threatening violence and refusing to give up their weapons while he remains in charge 
 They are now completely outside of the peace agreement   said Johanna Nilsson  a Sweden based academic   The fact Renamo cannot control them is of course problematic  
PEACE WITH BENEFITS
The split between Renamo and Frelimo has defined Mozambique since the 1970s  when the country was a front in the Cold War 
But while a lasting peace deal has been a long time in the making  analysts say the rivalry between the former foes is no longer the primary conflict threatening the country 
An Islamist insurgency in the impoverished north is stretching the government s military resources and increasing the imperative for an accord with Renamo 
Since 2017  Islamist attacks have killed more than 250 people  The roots of that crisis could hold lessons for the government as it attempts to deal with Renamo 
Located on Southern  NYSE SO  Africa s Indian Ocean coast  Mozambique is one of the world s least developed nations but is starting to tap huge coal and natural gas deposits with foreign investors 
Residents in the Cabo Delgado region remain mired in poverty  even as a growing number of multinational corporations head there to develop one of the biggest offshore gas finds in a decade   estimated to be worth at least  30 billion 
 Poverty is the fuel of the present violence in northern Mozambique   said Eleanor Beevor  a research analyst at the London based International Institute for Strategic Studies     
 The grievances around this inequality could become much worse if ordinary people don t benefit from the growing oil and gas industries in northern Mozambique  
Adriano Nuvunga  director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Development  CEDE  in Maputo  said a lack of economic opportunities in Renamo s central heartland could also fuel violence  much as it has in the north 
 This peace  it needs to bring benefits   he told Reuters 
Mirko Manzoni  the United Nations special envoy for Mozambique who has been closely involved in the negotiations  said most Renamo fighters just want a way to provide a future for their families 
 We would like to make sure this is the last reintegration   he said   So we are really trying    to make sure the reintegration will provide a prospect better than guns  ",2019-08-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/pact-is-reached-in-mozambique-but-prospects-for-peace-still-uncertain-1946685,1946685

176269,397785,SO,Sixteen U S  Marines arrested on suspicion of human trafficking,news,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Sixteen U S  Marines were arrested on Thursday at their base in Southern  NYSE SO  California on suspicion of drug related offenses and the smuggling of undocumented migrants along the U S  Mexico border  U S  military officials said 
The arrests at Camp Pendleton stemmed from a separate investigation of two other Marines arrested earlier this month on human trafficking charges filed by federal prosecutors in San Diego  a base spokesman said 
Those two Marines  Lance Corporals Byron Darnell Law II and David Javier Salazar Quintero  were also stationed at Camp Pendleton  about 55 miles  88 km  north of San Diego  according to the spokesman  Marine First Lieutenant Cameron Edinburgh 
 Information gained from the previous investigation gave way to this string of arrests   Edinburgh told Reuters 
The Marine Corps said that in addition to the Marines arrested on Thursday  eight others were detained for questioning on unrelated alleged drug offenses 
The 16 taken into custody were all part of the 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton  one of the largest Marine Corps bases in the United States 
None one of those arrested or detained on Thursday was serving in support of the military s mission along the border with Mexico  the Marine Corps said 
Unlike Salazar and Law  the Marines faced prosecution under the military justice system but no formal charges have been brought against them as yet  Edinburgh said 
The precise nature of the alleged wrongdoing was not disclosed  but Edinburgh said the troops were suspected of involvement in the smuggling of undocumented immigrants into the United States from Mexico and various unspecified drug related offenses 
The two Marines arrested July 3 on charges of transporting aliens for financial gain were arrested by U S  Border Patrol agents several miles north of the border along a highway in San Diego County

176271,397787,SO,Trump tells black lawmaker to clean up  disgusting  rat and rodent infested  district,news,"By David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump hit out at a prominent African American critic on Saturday  calling him a  brutal bully  who should concentrate on cleaning up his  disgusting  rat and rodent infested  Baltimore district rather than criticizing the work of U S  immigration officers on the Mexican border 
Trump s target in a series of early morning tweets was U S  Representative Elijah Cummings  Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee  who has called Trump a racist and sharply criticized his immigration policies 
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to Trump by calling Cummings a champion for civil rights and economic justice and added in a tweet   We all reject racist attacks against him and support his steadfast leadership  
On Thursday  the committee voted 23 16 along party lines to allow Cummings to issue subpoenas to White House officials  including Trump s daughter Ivanka Trump and son in law Jared Kushner  deepening a probe into potential violations of government record keeping laws 
Later Saturday  Trump signaled his anger with Cummings  committee efforts  writing in another tweet that the Democrat  spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through  Oversight   
Trump  a Republican  took aim at Cummings  criticism of his administration s Mexican border policies 
 Rep  Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully  shouting and screaming at the great men   women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern  NYSE SO  Border  when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous  His district is considered the Worst in the USA         Trump tweeted 
  T he Border is clean  efficient   well run  just very crowded  Cumming District is a disgusting  rat and rodent infested mess  If he spent more time in Baltimore  maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous   filthy place   he said 
In another tweet  Trump questioned why so much money was spent on Cummings  district  which covers the downtown area of the city of Baltimore  about 40 miles  64 km  northeast of Washington   when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States  
 No human being would want to live there  Where is all this money going  How much is stolen  Investigate this corrupt mess immediately   Trump wrote 
 COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE 
Last week  Cummings slammed Trump s acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan over conditions of U S  Mexico border facilities that house migrants 
 You feel like you re doing a great job  right   Cummings asked during a congressional hearing   What does that mean  What does that mean  When a child is sitting in their own feces  can t take a shower      None of us would have our children in that position  
Trump s attack follows his broadside two weeks ago against four congresswomen of color  which the Democratic controlled U S  House of Representatives condemned as racist 
Cummings responded to Trump on Twitter 
 Mr  President  I go home to my district daily  Each morning  I wake up  and I go and fight for my neighbors  It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch  But  it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents   he said 
Cummings also highlighted a letter he co signed to the president this week expressing  profound disappointment  at his failure to work to lower drug prices 
Baltimore Mayor Bernard Young called Trump s rhetoric  hurtful and dangerous  
 It s completely unacceptable for the political leader of our country to denigrate a vibrant American City like Baltimore  and to viciously attack U S  Representative Elijah Cummings a patriot and a hero   he tweeted 
Many Democrats running for president came to Cummings  defense on Saturday  with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling Trump s tweets  ugly and racist  They re purposefully designed to turn us against one another  
Cummings represents Maryland s 7th congressional district  which according to 2010 census data was 54 6  black  had a median household income of  51 018  and a college graduation rate of 35 7

176277,397793,SO,China Zhongwang Tumbles After U S  Charges Billionaire Owner,news," Bloomberg     China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd  fell as much as 21  in Hong Kong after the aluminum firm s billionaire owner was charged by U S  prosecutors with evading  1 8 billion in American anti dumping tariffs 
Liu Zhongtian  the former president and chairman of Zhongwang  Asia s largest aluminum extrusion company  lied to U S  customs agents to avoid duties imposed in 2011 on certain types of aluminum imported into the U S  from China  according to a statement Wednesday from U S  Attorney Nicola Hanna in Los Angeles after a grand jury indictment was unsealed 
The company s decline in the first ten minutes of trading wiped out this year s gain and saw shares touch their lowest since 2016 
 This indictment outlines the unscrupulous and anti competitive practices of a corrupt businessman   prosecutors said in the statement 
Liu  55  is believed to be in China  said Thom Mrozek  a spokesman for the U S  attorney 
The aluminum extrusions were disguised when they were shipped to the U S  as pallets to qualify them as finished goods and avoid customs duties of as much as 400   according to the prosecutors  The company and Liu are accused of orchestrating bogus sales of the 2 2 million imported pallets  which were actually stockpiled in Southern  NYSE SO  California because there was no demand for them 
A Hong Kong based spokeswoman for Zhongwang  which is based in Liaoyang  Liaoning on the mainland  declined to comment 
Liu and the company would direct that aluminum melting facilities be built and acquired to reconfigure the pallets into a form with commercial value  according to the indictment 
Money Laundering
Prosecutors also allege Liu was behind a  massive  money laundering scheme  One of his associates was charged with evading income taxes on more than  9 million he received in 2015  He took a plea deal in exchange for cooperation with federal investigators  prosecutors said 
Hundreds of millions of dollars were allegedly funneled through shell companies  which were then directed to aluminum companies in the U S  that Liu ran  according to the indictment 
Zhongwang  controlled by Liu  has run into other regulatory issues in the U S  In 2016  the Commerce Department found that it withheld information during its investigation of the company s aluminum shipments and impeded proceedings  Zhongwang President Lu Changqing said then that his firm didn t participate in the inquiry because it stopped making the products cited in early 2015 
The Commerce Department findings came just as Liu was seeking to buy Cleveland based aluminum parts maker Aleris Corp  in what could have been China s biggest ever purchase of an overseas metals processor  The deal was terminated a year later  after it failed to get approval from U S  regulators 
Trump Administration
The case pre dates the Trump administration s introduction of steel and aluminum tariffs last year  But it illustrates the problem those tariffs were meant to address 
The U S  initiated its global tariffs in large part because U S  producers argued they were unable to compete with a flood of Chinese aluminum and steel onto international markets  Beyond producing a mountain of those metals  Chinese companies were consistently finding ways to evade U S  anti dumping tariffs of as much as 400  and other efforts to address the economic threat  according to the U S  firms 
Canada and Mexico agreed earlier this year to do more to block the trans shipment of Chinese metals destined for the U S  as part of a deal with the Trump administration to remove the tariffs  But they are still in place on steel from other major U S  allies including the European Union and Japan 
Meanwhile  Trump s trade war with China and the tariffs he has imposed on some  250 billion in imports has led to new efforts by Chinese  U S  and other companies to find a way around those import taxes  mostly by relocating production ",2019-08-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/china-zhongwang-tumbles-after-us-charges-billionaire-owner-1941768,1941768

registered on the first two days of this trading week as investors returned from the week long Lunar New Year holiday  Notably  January witnessed record inflows from foreign investors Currently  a number of factors are propelling Chinese equities higher  Ongoing U S  China trade negotiations have created fresh optimism about a deal which at the least could stave off another bump in tariffs The Fed s newly found dovish stance is also working in favor of emerging markets  This is why adding select China stocks to your portfolio would make for a smart move Largest Monthly Gain Since Last January  Record Foreign InflowsIn January  Chinese equity markets registered their strongest monthly performance in a year  The Shanghai Composite Index increased 3 6   the highest since January 2018  This represents a strong recovery from 2018 s decline  which led the reverses among the world s key financial markets   In January  foreign inflows into Chinese equities amounted to  9 85 billion or 66 4 billion yuan  The largest single month foreign investment on record poured in through the Hong Kong stock exchange trading link  This was also a major reason for the strong performance of Chinese equities last month Attractive Valuations Drive Gains  Foreign InflowsAccording to global investment giant Fidelity International  China s equity market currently represents a great opportunity because of its  very  very attractive  valuations  This in turn is largely responsible for the strong foreign inflows According to Wind Financial Information  the CSI 300 s trailing 12 month price

priced in  Fed s Dovishness  Trade Talks Boosting GainsThe Fed s new found dovishness is believed to be another major factor for China s recent equity market upsurge  A rate hike in March looks unlikely at this point  And the process of balance sheet reduction could also end sooner than expected  Such a soft stance is helping to prop up emerging market equities Further  there is new found optimism about U S  China trade ties  On Feb 12 U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer arrived in Beijing to pursue the next round of high level trade negotiations  Though conflicting signals

176280,397796,SO,Southern Co   SO  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"The market expects Southern Co   SO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 24 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  52 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 92 billion  down 12 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co 
For Southern Co The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  9 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Southern Co  Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern Co  Would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 14  delivering a surprise of  6 54  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern Co  Appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southern-co-so-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200387477,200387477

fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Just these few criteria narrowed

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Huaneng Power has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Southern Co  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This means that HNP s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
HNP currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 37  while SO has a forward P E of 16 15  We also note that HNP has a PEG ratio of 0 94  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SO currently has a PEG ratio of 3 59 
Another notable valuation metric for HNP is its P B ratio of 0 66  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SO has a P B of 1 78 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HNP s Value grade of A and SO s Value grade of C

Industry s ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to tangible book ratio  P TBV   which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next   The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P TBV of 1 51X  above the median level of 1 50X  over the past five years  This compares with the highest level of 2 14X and lowest level of 1 13X over this period However  the industry is trading at a discount when compared with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P TBV ratio for the S P 500 is 10 28X and the median level is 7 84X  Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM

He passed at a hospital in Manhattan  after a short illness  his wife Lucinda Franks told the Times  He would have turned 100 on July 31 
His family was not immediately available for comment early Monday

In the early 1990s  Morgenthau took a broad approach to his jurisdiction and went after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International  BCCI  in a scandal with global implications 
He indicted the bank and two foreign business figures on a variety of charges the he said constituted  the largest bank fraud in world financial history   The Middle East backed bank was eventually shut down around the world as some  20 billion disappeared from its books

On Saturday  a local district official told Reuters that at least 13 people were killed in a town near Hawassa city  275 km  170 miles  from the capital Addis Ababa  while hospital authorities said on Friday that four protesters had died of gunshot wounds in the city itself 
State affiliated Fana Broadcasting said that the Federal Security Council had decided to put security in the Hawassa city administration and some districts of the Southern  NYSE SO  Nations  Nationalities  and Peoples   SNNP  region under a temporary federal security force led command post 
It said the SNNP regional state had requested help from the federal government and the decision would take effect on Tuesday  Hawassa is the capital of the state but some Sidama   who make up the largest group in the region   want it as the capital of their own new entity 
The threat of large scale violence in Hawassa was largely averted after a Sidama opposition party agreed last Thursday to delay declaring their own region and accept a government offer to hold a referendum in five months 
The Sidama threat to unilaterally declare a new region posed a direct challenge to the authority of the federal government in Addis Ababa that oversees nine regions in the Horn of Africa country of 105 million people 
Regional states in multi ethnic Ethiopia are able to choose their official working language and enjoy limited powers over tax  education  health and land administration 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  appointed by the ruling coalition last year  has won praise for political reforms in what was once one of the continent s most repressive nations

176312,397828,SO,Trump s new anti asylum rule faces court test in California,news,"By Daniel Trotta and Kristina Cooke  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump on Wednesday scored an initial victory in his latest move to clamp down on immigration when a judge in Washington declined to block a new rule that bars almost all asylum applications at the U S  Mexican border  The rule requires all asylum seekers arriving at the southern border to first pursue safe haven in a third country through which they traveled on their way to the United States  The decision allows the rule to stand for now   But the Trump appointed judge  Timothy Kelly of U S  District Court for the District of Columbia  will still preside over the underlying legal challenge that could strike the law down   More immediately  the rule also faces a second court challenge in the Northern District of California  where the judge in that case  Jon Tigar  was appointed by former President Barack Obama  A hearing was held on Wednesday and a written ruling could be issued at any time  Tigar could issue an order to block the new asylum rule  possibly in the form of a preliminary injunction  which carries more weight than a restraining order   Even so  the Trump administration was quick to celebrate the win in the Washington court  saying it would discourage abuse of the asylum process   The rule properly encourages migrants to seek asylum in other countries they have traveled through before reaching the United States and makes those who fail to do so ineligible for asylum  thereby foreclosing opportunistic claims by those who want to exploit our asylum system   White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement  The administration has sought to curtail the increasing numbers of mostly Central American migrants arriving at the U S   Mexico border after fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  It has characterized the vast majority of their asylum claims as bogus  After the administration announced the rule last week  the American Civil Liberties Union and pro immigrant groups sued  claiming it violates U S  law that welcomes those who come to the United States while fleeing persecution at home  Opponents of the rule contend the United States cannot force migrants to first apply for asylum in another country  such as Mexico or Guatemala  unless Washington first has a  safe third country  agreement with that government  Both Mexico and Guatemala have resisted Trump administration efforts to reach such a deal  The judge s decision in the D C  court to allow the rule to go forward was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Capital Area Immigrants  Rights Coalition  which said it was disappointed by the ruling but would keep fighting   We had hoped to obtain immediate relief from the potentially drastic consequences of this rule  which we firmly believe violates U S  law and the Constitution   Mitchell Reich  one of the attorneys representing the coalition  said in a statement  In California  Tigar said he was struck by the dangers faced by people passing through Mexico  which was significant because the Trump administration argued that the country was a safe haven   The administrative record about the dangers faced by persons transiting through Mexico and the inadequacy of the asylum system there     is stunning   Tigar said from bench  The administration has issued a rapid fire series of anti immigration edicts recently  The issue is shaping up to be a focus of the 2020 presidential campaign  Voters rewarded Trump for his anti immigrant rhetoric in the 2016 election campaign  sending him to the White House after he promised to build a wall on the U S  Mexico border and called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States   Last week  the administration issued another rule to expedite deportations for immigrants who have crossed illegally within the last two years and are caught anywhere in the United States  The rule eliminated a level of judicial review and expanded a program typically applied only along the southern border with Mexico

176313,397829,SO,Trump must face marketing scam lawsuit  escapes racketeering claims  NY judge,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal judge on Wednesday said U S  President Donald Trump and his adult children must face part of a lawsuit alleging they used their family name to promote sham marketing opportunities  but dismissed racketeering claims at the center of the case 
U S  District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said the plaintiffs  including investors in a Trump endorsed business called American Communications Network  could pursue state law based claims of fraud  false advertising and unfair competition 
But the judge dismissed claims under the federal racketeering law known as RICO because of a lack of evidence that the Trumps  alleged misconduct was the proximate cause of  or directly related to  the investors  alleged losses 
She said the losses could have simply reflected  the inherent challenges of multi level marketing   including the ability to sell products and recruit new marketers or a lack of customer demand 
ACN charged  499 for a chance to sell videophones and other goods 
The plaintiffs claimed that the Trumps received millions of dollars of secret payments from 2005 to 2015 to endorse ACN and conned them into thinking Donald Trump thought their investments would pay off  when the real goal was to enrich themselves 
Other defendants included Trump s adult children Donald Jr   Eric and Ivanka  and an affiliate of the Trump Organization 
 We are delighted by the court s decision   Joanna Hendon  a lawyer for the Trumps  said in an interview   The RICO claims were baseless and should never have been brought  and we look forward to dispensing with the rest of the case  
Roberta Kaplan  a lawyer for the plaintiffs  said in an email she looked forward to continuing the case  to obtain justice for the plaintiffs  and thousands of other working Americans just like them  who each lost hundreds or thousands of dollars as a result of the defendants  fraudulent scheme  
In seeking a dismissal  the Trumps called the lawsuit politically motivated  with funding from a nonprofit linked to progressive causes  and said Donald Trump s statements about ACN were merely opinion or could not be relied on by the investors 
Hendon said in a July 19 letter that the Trump family expects to ask Schofield to move the plaintiffs  claims into arbitration  even if the lawsuit were not dismissed 
Kaplan accused the Trumps in a response later that day of pursuing a strategy of  heads they win  tails they seek arbitration

176330,397846,SO,Epstein s accusers urge U S  judge to keep him jailed until sex trafficking trial,news,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK  Reuters    Two women who say they are victims of sexual misconduct by American financier Jeffrey Epstein on Monday urged a U S  judge to keep him in jail while he awaits trial on charges of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls 
 He s a scary person   one of the women  Courtney Wild  told U S  District Judge Richard Berman in federal court in Manhattan 
Wild and another accuser  Annie Farmer  spoke at the end of a hearing in which prosecutors argued that Epstein  66  posed an  extraordinary risk of flight  and danger to the community and must remain in jail 
Epstein  who has pleaded not guilty  has asked to be allowed to live under house arrest with armed guard at his expense in his mansion on Manhattan s Upper East Side  which is valued at  77 million 
The hedge fund manager had a social circle that over the years has included Donald Trump before he became U S  president  former President Bill Clinton and Britain s Prince Andrew 
Berman said he would probably announce his bail decision on Thursday at 9 30 a m  EDT  1330 GMT   saying he needed more time to absorb the case 
Lawyers for Epstein said their client  who wore dark blue jail scrubs in court  has had an unblemished record since he pleaded guilty more than a decade ago to a state prostitution charge in Florida and agreed to register as a sex offender 
Critics have called that plea deal  which let Epstein avoid federal prosecution  too lenient 
Epstein is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center  a fortress like jail that has been criticized by inmates and lawyers for harsh conditions 
He pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges on July 8  two days after his arrest at New Jersey s Teterboro Airport  where he had flown back on his private plane from Paris  Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted 
Epstein is accused of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude  massages  and other sex acts  and of paying some girls to recruit others  from at least 2002 to 2005 
A prosecutor  Assistant U S  Attorney Alex Rossmiller  on Monday told the judge that a search of Epstein s home uncovered nude images of underage girls  including at least one who claimed to be among the financier s victims 
The prosecutor also said one item seized was a passport that appeared to have been issued by a foreign country in the 1980s that containing Epstein s photo  but someone else s name 
Last week  prosecutors said in a court filing that Epstein made payments to potential witnesses last year in an apparent effort to influence them 
One of his lawyers  Martin Weinberg  told Berman on Monday that Epstein needed to be out of jail so he and his lawyers could prepare their defense 
In 2016  Berman rejected a similar bail proposal from Turkish Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab to let him live in an apartment under the watch of privately funded guards  saying wealthy defendants should not be allowed to  buy their way out of prison by constructing their own private jail  
The judge expressed similar skepticism on Monday  noting that all defendants have the same right to prepare their defense as Epstein 
 If that s the standard  then what are we going to tell all those people who can t make the  500 or  1 000 bail   he said 
Under the Florida agreement  Epstein served 13 months in a county jail  but was allowed to go to his office during the day 
A federal judge ruled in February that the agreement violated a federal law on crime victims  rights

176333,397849,SO,Jeffrey Epstein s treatment is  worse  because of his wealth  his lawyers say,news,"By Dan Whitcomb
 Reuters    Prosecutors have singled out Jeffrey Epstein for harsher treatment than other defendants because he is rich  lawyers for the American financier claimed on Tuesday in arguing that Epstein should be freed while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges 
Federal prosecutors say Epstein  66  should be denied bail because there are no conditions under which a man with his money and international connections could be prevented from fleeing the country if he was released 
 To be sure  wealthy defendants do not deserve preferential treatment  But they certainly shouldn t be singled out for worse treatment   in effect  categorically disqualified from bail     on the basis of their net worth   Epstein s attorneys wrote in papers filed in federal court in New York on Tuesday 
Both prosecutors and defense lawyers filed additional documents on Tuesday as U S  District Judge Richard Berman weighs whether Epstein should be granted bail  and if so  under what conditions  Berman said he would issue his ruling on Thursday 
Epstein was indicted in federal court in New York earlier this month on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex in at least two states  He was arrested on July 6 at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey  where he had returned from Paris on his private plane 
Epstein  who is a registered as a sex offender under a 2008 plea agreement in Florida that has been sharply criticized for its leniency  has pleaded not guilty to the indictment 
Alexander Acosta  who handled the 2008 case as U S  attorney for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Florida  resigned as secretary of labor under President Donald Trump amid fresh outrage over that plea deal 
HOUSE ARREST
The defense team has asked that Epstein be allowed to surrender his passport and live under house arrest at his  77 million mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan  guarded by private security at his own expense 
A document filed by his lawyers and made public this week lists his total assets at  559 120 954  including four homes and two private islands 
Prosecutors say that they found more than  70 000 in cash in a safe at Epstein s multi story Manhattan mansion  along with jewelry  loose diamonds and a passport that was apparently issued by a foreign country containing Epstein s photo but someone else s name 
Defense attorneys said in the court filing that their client  who is Jewish  acquired the passport in the 1980s for  personal protection  while traveling in the Middle East and that it had expired 32 years ago 
Epstein was known for socializing with politicians and royalty  with friends who have included Trump  former President Bill Clinton and according to court papers  Britain s Prince Andrew  None of those people were mentioned in the indictment

176337,397853,SO,Protesters take to streets to declare new Ethiopian region,news,"By Kumerra Gemechu
HAWASSA  Ethiopia  Reuters    Protesters in the Ethiopian city of Hawassa blocked roads and burned tires on Thursday after security forces thwarted a meeting of activists to declare a new region for their Sidama ethnic group  witnesses said 
The declaration would be a test of whether Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed s federal government can stick to its commitment to peaceful political reforms amid increasing demands from competing ethno nationalist groups 
Hawassa is the capital of the multi ethnic Southern  NYSE SO  Nations region but some Sidama   who make up the largest group there   want it as the capital of their own new entity 
Almost all shops were closed and few cars were on the streets in Hawassa on Thursday as protesters wearing traditional red  white and yellow striped Sidama scarves and hats marched to the venue of a planned meeting of Sidama elders and youth 
But activists told Reuters that security forces prevented them from accessing the meeting venue  and that mobile data had been blocked in an apparent move to impair their means of communication 
There were no immediate reports of violence  Ethiopian authorities had no immediate comment on the situation in Hawassa  275 km  170 miles  from the national capital Addis Ababa 
On Tuesday  the National Election Board tried to defuse the situation at the last minute by promising the Sidama they could hold a referendum on having their own region within five months 
But some activists said they had already requested a referendum a year ago with no response  The constitution guarantees the right to a referendum within a year  but does not say what should happen if it is not held 
The federal system in Africa s second most populous country is designed to allow larger ethnic groups a degree of autonomy 
But smaller communities like the Sidama  who comprise about 5  of Ethiopia s 105 million people  say they have been sidelined  In addition to the Sidama  at least eight more ethnic groups are campaigning for their own regions

176340,397856,SO,Big donor Steyer s presidential run could deny millions to other Democratic races,news,"By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO  Calif   Reuters    Billionaire Tom Steyer  a longtime friend and key donor to liberal candidates and causes  says he decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination next year because no other candidate was offering a  mandate for change  
But by deciding to fund his long shot bid with  100 million of his own money  some Democratic activists believe all he will end up doing is denying his money to grassroots organizations and candidates in Senate and House races that Democrats are desperate to win 
Steyer s political bona fides and passion are not in question  He has worked for years on issues of climate change and voter engagement and donated about  170 million since 2015 to his independent political action committees  Need to Impeach and NextGen America 
During the 2017 2018 election cycle  he was the second largest donor to Democratic and liberal candidates and causes  according to the Center for Responsive Politics 
The 62 year old former hedge fund manager from San Francisco is not well known beyond political circles  however  and most self funded candidacies fail  He also joins a field that numbers more than 20 candidates  currently led by former Vice President Joe Biden and U S  Senators Bernie Sanders  Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren 
 Every dollar he spends on himself is a dollar that s not going into something that can make a difference   said California Democratic campaign consultant Steven Maviglio  who worked with Steyer in 2010 to defeat a ballot measure aimed at weakening the state s greenhouse gas emissions law 
Democrats face high stakes in November 2020 to defeat Republican President Donald Trump  hold on to their new majority in the U S  House of Representatives and pick up seats in the Senate 
The money Steyer plans to spend on his own campaign could fund five Senate elections  which the Center for Responsive Politics says cost  19 4 million apiece to win in 2016 
 The influence he is going to have on the campaign is probably to rob candidates farther down the ballot of the ability to raise the kind of money they need   said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe  a retired University of Southern  NYSE SO  California public policy professor 
 WE RE IN A CRISIS 
Steyer s efforts are credited with helping Democrats make inroads in swing states and conservative areas  and his involvement helped propel Andrew Gillum s insurgent albeit unsuccessful campaign for Florida s governorship last year 
He has been a vocal supporter of efforts to impeach Trump 
He told Reuters he decided to announce his bid on July 9 because he was frustrated with the Democratic candidates when so much was at stake 
 I was watching this campaign and I was thinking  we re in a crisis and it s not being addressed   Steyer said in a phone interview   I couldn t sleep because I thought there was something desperately wrong affecting every American  
The leaders in the field are Washington insiders too beholden to the system to effect change in the areas he believes are crucial  such as campaign finance reform  congressional term limits and regulations to fight climate change  Steyer said 
 In order for this to be a successful election we don t need to just beat Donald Trump   we need a broad mandate for change   he said 
Instead  the candidates were getting bogged down arguing about the details of their policy proposals 
 The question is not who has the best healthcare plan   he said   The question is whether any of it is going to happen  
Steyer has promised to contribute  50 million to Need to Impeach and NextGen America even as he funds his own campaign 
But many activists may still be frustrated by his decision to spend so much on himself  said Raphael Sonenshein  director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University  Los Angeles 
 What s going to stand out for Democrats is his promise to spend tens of millions of dollars on his own presidential campaign  That s not going to be very popular   Sonenshein said ",2019-07-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/big-donor-steyers-presidential-run-could-deny-millions-to-other-democratic-races-1928506,1928506

176344,397860,SO,Southern National Bancorp  SONA  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Southern  NYSE SO  National Bancorp  SONA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for Sonabank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 4  
Revenues are expected to be  24 30 million  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern National Bancorp 
For Southern National Bancorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern National Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern National Bancorp would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of  12 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

When looking at the last two reports  this power company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 11 24   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Southern Co  Was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share  but it reported  1 14 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 54   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 69 per share  while it actually produced  0 80 per share  a surprise of 15 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Southern Co  Lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Southern Co  Currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 77   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 20  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

176365,397881,SO,U S  financier Epstein expected to be charged in sex trafficking case  source,news,"By Brendan Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    American financier Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of sex trafficking as prosecutors accused him of luring dozens of girls as young as 14 to his luxury homes in New York and Florida and paying them for sex acts  An indictment unsealed in federal court in Manhattan accused Epstein  66  of arranging for girls to perform nude  massages  and other sex acts  and paying some girls to recruit others  from at least 2002 to 2005   The alleged behavior shocks the conscience  and while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago  it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims  now young women   U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a press conference   They deserve their day in court   Epstein was known for socializing with politicians and royalty  with friends who have included U S  President Donald Trump  former President Bill Clinton and according to court papers  Britain s Prince Andrew  None of those people was mentioned in the indictment  Wearing dark blue jail scrubs  Epstein entered his plea before U S  Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman to one count of sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking conspiracy  Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted  According to the indictment  the former hedge fund manager  intentionally sought out minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18  including because  in some instances  minor victims expressly told him their age   Epstein  who registered as a sex offender under a 2008 plea deal in Florida  has said in earlier court filings that his encounters with alleged victims were consensual and that he believed they were 18 when they occurred  Epstein will remain in jail until at least July 15  when a judge has scheduled a bail hearing  Prosecutors have said Epstein should be denied bail

prosecutors said  Three unnamed employees  one in Manhattan and two in Florida  aided Epstein by arranging some of his sexual encounters  the indictment said  At a second court hearing on Monday  U S

character actor on the screen and stage but sometimes caused him trouble on the set and in private life  died on Tuesday at the age of 88  media reports said  Torn  whose late career resurgence included a key role on U S  television s  The Larry Sanders Show  and in the movies  Men in Black  and  Dodgeball   died peacefully at his home  his family told the Hollywood Reporter and other media  The cause was not disclosed  but he was surrounded by his wife  actress Amy Wright  known for  Stardust Memories  and  The Accidental Tourist   and his daughters  media reports said  Neither his family nor agent were immediately available for comment late Tuesday  Torn showed great range in his career but with a crooked grin  gruff voice and devilish glint in his eyes  he was especially well suited to playing bad boys and unpredictable characters  He often made headlines because of his volatility  He blamed his dismissal from a production of  Macbeth  on  friends  of the administration of President Richard Nixon  who Torn would later portray in the television mini series  Blind Ambition   Later in life came alcohol related incidents  including an arrest in 2010 for breaking into a closed bank that he had mistaken for his home in Salisbury  Connecticut   I have certain flaws in my makeup  Something called rise ability   Torn told writer Studs Terkel for  Working   a 1974 book about people and their jobs   I get angry easily  I get saddened by things easily   Torn said he went into acting as a way to use those emotions to his benefit   Rip has an unabashed masculine drive  You can t act that   playwright Horton Foote  who cast Torn in his play  The Young Man From Atlanta  and also worked frequently with Torn s second wife  Geraldine Page  told the New York Times  FARM DREAMS Torn was born in Temple  Texas  on Feb  6  1931  and grew up with aspirations of being a farmer before discovering drama at the University of Texas  After graduating  he and first wife Ann Wedgeworth moved to New York in the late 1950s  Torn  who studied at Lee Strasberg s legendary Actors Studio  found steady stage and television work  His early movies included  King of Kings   1961    The Cincinnati Kid   1965  and the war films  Pork Chop Hill   1959  and  Beach Red   1967   Torn was a good fit for Tennessee Williams  plays  such as portraying the menacing Tom Jr  in  Sweet Bird of Youth   which earned him a Tony nomination  He reprised the role in a movie in 1962 and also played Big Daddy in a 1984 TV production of Williams   Cat on a Hot Tin Roof   Much of Torn s work in the 1970s and  80s consisted of one off TV roles and a few little seen experimental films  Among the exceptions were  Cross Creek   a 1984 film that earned him an Academy Award nomination  and 1972 s  Payday  in which he starred as a hard drinking  womanizing country singer  Torn blamed the career slowdown partly on his political views  including criticism of the Vietnam War  but he came out of it in the  90s  boosted by his part in Albert Brooks  much praised life after death comedy  Defending Your Life   From 1992 through 1998 he had the scene stealing role of Artie  the all knowing producer on  The Larry Sanders Show   Garry Shandling s satiric take on late night television  Torn won an Emmy in 1996 and was nominated five other times for the role  Torn also played Zed  the alien busting boss in two  Men in Black  movies  and was Patches O Houlihan  the snarling wheelchair bound burn out case whose idea of training his charges in the 2004 comedy  Dodgeball  was to throw tools at them   If you can dodge a wrench  you can dodge a ball     A run on the NBC sitcom  30 Rock  brought Torn another Emmy nomination in 2008  UNEASY MEETING Torn gained notoriety for a role he did not get in the classic hippie era movie  Easy Rider   Novelist screenwriter Terry Southern  NYSE SO  wanted Torn to play a disenchanted lawyer in the film  the part eventually went to Jack Nicholson   But when they had dinner with stars Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda to discuss it in 1967  an altercation broke out  Hopper would say Torn threatened him with a knife but Torn contended it was Hopper who pulled the knife and that he had taken it away from Hopper and turned it on him  Torn said Hopper s account made him look unstable and hurt his career  When Hopper repeated the story on the  Tonight  show in 1994  Torn sued and won  475 000 in damages  Torn was a co star in one of the most remarkable scenes in movie history   a real fight with friend Norman Mailer in  Maidstone   a 1970 experimental film the writer was directing and starring in  Mailer played a presidential candidate who feared assassination and Torn his half brother in the highly improvised film  which was to conclude with the killing of the candidate  For the final scene  Torn went up to Mailer unannounced and struck him on the head with a hammer  drawing blood  In the ensuing grappling  Mailer bit Torn s ear and Torn ended up on top of him  choking the writer until two men and Mailer s wife  who was screaming and slapping Torn  separated them   all while the cameras rolled  Torn  who would end up in a hospital after his bitten ear became infected  insisted Mailer knew what was coming and that he had used the hammer s handle to hit him  Torn went into entertainment with a name that many assumed was a corny  ill conceived stage name  For a while he carried his passport with him to show skeptics that his name really was Elmore Rual Torn Jr  and told them that Rip was a long standing nickname for the men in his family   If anything  my name has made me work harder   he told the New York Times   Some people just seem to take instant umbrage at it

176370,397886,SO,Societe Generale sued for  792 million by heirs of Cuban bank seized by Castro,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    The family of the former owners of a Cuban bank seized by Fidel Castro s government nearly six decades ago sued  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  for approximately  792 million  saying the French bank owes damages for circumventing U S  sanctions against Cuba 
In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the U S  District Court in Miami  14 grandchildren of Carlos and Pura Nu ez  who once owned Banco Nu ez  want to hold Societe Generale liable under U S  law for doing business with Cuba s central bank  which nationalized Banco Nu ez and other lenders in 1960 
A lawyer for the plaintiffs said he believed the case was the first against a bank that allegedly  trafficked  in property expropriated by the Castro regime  since the Trump administration said in April it would begin letting U S  nationals sue companies for such conduct 
 Victims of the Cuban regime who had their property confiscated now have a vehicle to get justice   Javier Lopez  the lawyer  said in an interview   We have multiple financial institutions that we re looking to target  
Societe Generale did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours 
The lawsuit was filed eight months after Societe Generale agreed to pay  1 34 billion and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to settle U S  and New York regulatory charges that it handled billions of dollars of transactions related to Cuba and other countries under U S  sanctions 
According to the plaintiffs  Societe Generale generated hundreds of millions of dollars of fees by lending money to and processing transactions for Banco Nacional de Cuba from 2000 to 2010 
The plaintiffs said they own a claim to 10 5  of the equity in Banco Nacional de Cuba  roughly the percentage that Banco Nu ez represented when it was seized 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs at Kozyak Tropin   Throckmorton based the  792 million damages estimate on Banco Nu ez s  7 8 million worth at the time  plus 6  annual interest and triple damages under the Helms Burton Act  a 1996 federal law 
The right to sue under that law had been suspended for 23 years because of opposition from the international community and concern that U S  courts could be overrun by lawsuits 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the lifting of that suspension in April  to boost pressure on Havana to end Cuban support for Venezuela s socialist president  Nicolas Maduro

176373,397889,SO,Jailed financier Epstein seeks to be released under house arrest,news,"By Brendan Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    American financier Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday asked a federal judge to let him out of jail and allow him to remain under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion while he awaits trial on charges of sex trafficking underage girls  In a filing in federal court in Manhattan  Epstein s lawyers argued that home confinement  along with electronic monitoring  surveillance and a bond secured by a mortgage on the Upper East Side home which they valued at  77 million  would ensure that he does not flee the country  A spokesman for New York based federal prosecutors declined to comment  On Monday  prosecutors said at a court hearing that they will oppose Epstein s release on bail under any conditions   U S  District Judge Richard Berman  who is overseeing the case  previously rejected a similar request by Turkish Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab  finding it was unfair to allow wealthy defendants to  buy their way out of prison by constructing their own private jail   Epstein s lawyers said their client had a  spotless 14 year record of walking the straight and narrow  since 2005 and had shown  perfect compliance with onerous sex offender registration requirements   They said Epstein would nevertheless agree to be fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet  surrender his passport and de register his private jet as conditions of his house arrest  Epstein  66  was arrested on Saturday evening at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey  where he had returned on his private plane from Paris  He pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy  The well connected money manager was known for socializing with politicians and royalty  with friends including Republican U S  President Donald Trump  former Democratic President Bill Clinton and  according to court papers  Britain s Prince Andrew  None of those people was mentioned in the indictment laying out the charges against Epstein  According to the indictment  Epstein arranged for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude  massages  and other sex acts  and paid some girls to recruit others  from at least 2002 to 2005  Prosecutors said that a search of Epstein s house on Saturday uncovered nude images of underage girls  Epstein had faced similar charges from federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007  but reached a deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty to a Florida state prostitution charge and registering as a sex offender  He served 13 months in a county jail  but was allowed to leave during the day to go to his office  Epstein s lawyers have said that the previous agreement makes him immune to the new charges  which cover the same period  The New York prosecutors have said they are not bound by the agreement  Alex Acosta  then the U S  Attorney for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of Florida  oversaw the Florida plea deal   
Acosta  who is now Trump s secretary of labor  defended the deal in public statements on Wednesday  saying it had ensured Epstein  whom he called a sexual predator  would serve jail time ",2019-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/jailed-financier-epstein-seeks-to-be-released-under-house-arrest-1921255,1921255

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

For Great Southern Bancorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Great Southern Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Huaneng Power and Southern Co  are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   1  Strong Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
HNP currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 81  while SO has a forward P E of 15 55  We also note that HNP has a PEG ratio of 0 98  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  SO currently has a PEG ratio of 3 46 
Another notable valuation metric for HNP is its P B ratio of 0 68  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SO has a P B of 1 72 
Based on these metrics and many more  HNP holds a Value grade of A  while SO has a Value grade of C

176430,397946,SO,Harris challenges Biden in breakout U S  debate performance,news,"By James Oliphant and Ginger Gibson MIAMI  Reuters    Presidential candidate Kamala Harris dominated her Democratic rivals in a debate on Thursday  confronting front runner Joe Biden on race and calling his remarks about working with segregationist senators  hurtful   In a breakout performance  the daughter of a black father from Jamaica and an Indian mother was at the center of several heated exchanges during the second night of debates among Democrats vying for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election  Harris said the issue of race was deeply personal for her  She noted she was bused to school as part of integration efforts in California  and she questioned Biden s 1970s opposition to school busing  The former prosecutor looked straight at Biden and demanded that he explain himself   I do not believe you are a racist  And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground   said Harris  54  a U S  senator from California who has ranked fourth or fifth in most national polls among Democrats    But I also believe   and it s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country    Biden  who was on the defensive throughout the night  has faced heavy criticism for his recent comments that he worked decades ago with two Southern  NYSE SO  segregationist senators as a way to get things done in the U S  Senate  He appeared shaken by the attack  but defended his record on civil rights and said his remarks had been mischaracterized as praise for racists   If we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not  I m happy to do that   he said  noting he had only opposed busing for school integration ordered by the federal government  not by local governments   Everything I have done in my career  I ran because of civil rights and continue to think we have to make fundamental changes   he said  He added a dig at Harris  noting he had been a public defender and  didn t become a prosecutor   One of the lesser known candidates  U S  Representative Eric Swalwell  38  also took a swing at Biden  sharply reminding voters of Biden s age  urging the 76 year old to pass the torch to younger candidates   I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic convention and said it s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans   Swalwell said   That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden    He was right when he said that 32 years ago  He is still right today   Swalwell said  Biden responded   I m still holding onto that torch  I want to make it clear   In a Democratic contest where racial issues have figured prominently  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend  Indiana  also faced pointed questions about accusations of racism inside his city s predominantly white police force after a fatal police shooting of a black man  GOING AFTER TRUMP During the debate  the contenders frequently attacked Trump and sharply disagreed over the best way to boost access to healthcare insurance coverage  Biden and the candidate running second in polls among Democrats  Bernie Sanders  turned their fire on Trump repeatedly   The American people understand that Trump is a phony  that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the American people during his campaign   said Sanders  Biden  the former vice president making his third run for the White House  said Trump s tax cuts for the wealthy and other economic policies were increasing economic inequality in the United States   Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation  We do have enormous income inequality   Biden said   The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the  1 6 trillion in tax loopholes out there  and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump s tax cuts for the wealthy   The debate also included U S  Senators Michael Bennet and Kirsten Gillibrand  former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper  self help guru Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang  All six are polling nationally around 1  or less   Like the Democrats who debated on Wednesday  the contenders disagreed on the best way to expand healthcare coverage  Asked who would back a plan that eliminated private insurance  only Sanders and Harris raised their hands  When asked if their administrations would support covering healthcare for immigrants in the United States illegally  all 10 candidates on the stage raised their hands in the affirmative  Trump  who has made cracking down on illegal immigration a signature policy of his presidency  pounced via Twitter even though he is in Japan for the G20 summit   All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare  How about taking care of American Citizens first   That s the end of that race   the Republican tweeted  The Democrats frequently talked over one another  shouting to get their points across as some of the lesser known contenders tried to get noticed  At one point during the healthcare debate  Harris stepped in   Americans don t want to witness a food fight  They want to know how we re going to put food on their table   Harris said  drawing applause from Biden  Sanders  who was relegated to the sidelines for much of the night  defended his big spending plans for a Medicare for All healthcare plan  saying it would reduce premiums for many but that some in the middle class might pay more in taxes   People who have health care under Medicare for all will have no premiums  no deductibles  no copayments  no out of pocket expenses  Yes  they will pay more in taxes  but less in healthcare for what they get   Sanders said  Buttigieg faced his own questions about the turmoil in his hometown of South Bend after the police shooting in South Bend earlier this month  acknowledged that his police force lacked diversity because he  couldn t get it done   Buttigieg said the situation around the shooting was a  mess  because the officer did not have his body camera on   If the camera wasn t on and that was the policy  you should fire the chief   Swalwell said  Hickenlooper challenged Buttigieg about why the department had been so slow to make changes   I think that the question they re asking in South Bend and I think across the country is why has it taken so long   he asked  
Buttigieg said there had been many steps taken to increase accountability by police  but  we re obviously not there yet  and I accept responsibility for that because I m in charge  ",2019-06-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/second-democratic-debate-could-come-down-to-biden-vs-sanders-1909136,1909136

176435,397951,SO,Former USC gynecologist pleads not guilty to sexual assault,news,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A former University of Southern  NYSE SO  California gynecologist accused by hundreds of patients of molestation and other misconduct over the past three decades pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of sexually assaulting 16 students who were under his care 
George Tyndall  72  was also ordered to remain in custody in lieu of nearly  2 1 million bond  but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Theresa Sullivan said she would review a defense request to slash his bail at another hearing set for Wednesday 
Defense lawyer Andrew Flier  citing his client s age and  serious health concerns   including diabetes and a heart condition  denied in court that Tyndall was a flight risk or threat to the public  His medical license has been suspended 
Tyndall was charged last week with 29 felony counts of sexual penetration and sexual battery by fraud in a scandal that has already resulted in a  215 million civil settlement in federal court 
The 16 patients he is criminally charged with assaulting were students who ranged in age from 17 to 29 and were allegedly violated by Tyndall at the downtown Los Angeles university s campus health center between 2009 and 2016 
Flier entered a not guilty plea on Tyndall s behalf during a 20 minute court hearing  If convicted on all charges  Tyndall faces a prison term of up to 53 years 
Allegations against Tyndall and USC s handling of the matter   he was not reported to the state medical board for eight months   generated a furor on campus that led the university s then president  C L  Max Nikias  to resign last year 
 NOT SUICIDAL 
The gray haired doctor entered the courtroom with his hands shackled to his waist and stood silently behind a glass partition during the proceedings  wearing a padded blue garment commonly called a  suicide suit  
Flier told reporters afterward that his client was  not suicidal whatsoever  but was required by jail officials to wear the outfit  for his own protection  
Upon his arrest last Wednesday  Tyndall complained of chest pains and was briefly hospitalized  police said  Flier said his client was returned to custody on Friday after examinations and a battery of tests medically cleared him 
The  38 caliber handgun Tyndall was carrying when arrested was meant for self defense  his attorney said  adding that Tyndall  has had a lot of threats  
Authorities say more than 350 women reported being subjected to molestation  lewd comments and other sexually inappropriate behavior by Tyndall during medical exams by him at USC  long one of America s most prestigious private universities 
Many accusers said they recalled sensing something unprofessional or  creepy  about Tyndall at the time  only to fully comprehend in retrospect   after reading media accounts of other complaints   that they had been victimized 
Tyndall insists he is innocent and that he conducted his exams  by the book   always with a  chaperone  in the room and always wearing gloves  Flier told reporters 
 As soon as someone makes an inappropriate comment  that does not connote  criminal behavior  the attorney said   The character assassination is overwhelming in this case  
Flier said he was seeking to lower Tyndall s bail to  500 000  a bond sum he said the doctor could afford 
A federal court earlier this month granted preliminary approval to a  215 million settlement in a class action civil suit filed on behalf of Tyndall s former patients  Tyndall s lawyers said he agreed to the settlement to avoid further litigation costs 
The USC case follows a similar scandal that roiled USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University  Larry Nassar  a former USA Gymnastics team doctor who also was on that university s staff  was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison in two trials last year after more than 350 women testified about abuse at his hands

176443,397959,SO,Kansas City Southern Is Our Favorite Railroad Stock Now,opinion,"Railroads are often a good barometer for the health of the economy  When the economy is performing well  demand for goods usually increases which in turn leads to higher shipment of products  Demand usually deceases when the economy slows  With gross domestic product expected to be between 2  to 3  over the next few years  railroads are likely to see growth in car loads and revenue  Among our favorite railroad stocks  Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  is our top choice 
Company Background
Founded in the late 1880s  Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  initially connected Kansas City  MO and Port Arthur  TX  This north south running railroad ranges from the Midwest and southern United States to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico  covering nearly 6 700 miles of track  Kansas City Southern had  2 6 billion in sales last year  Sales were split almost evenly between the U S  and Mexico  The railroad has a current market cap of  9 8 billion 
Recent Financial Results
Kansas City Southern reported financial results for the third quarter on October 19th 

Source  Kansas City Southern s Third Quarter Presentation  slide 5 
 Kansas City Southern had adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 57  This was in line with analysts were looking for and a 16 3  increase from last year  Revenue improved 6 5  to almost  700 million  This total missed the market s expectations by  9 2 million  Carloads increased 4  year over year  The company s operation ratio improved 1   Net fuel prices were up 17   but were offset by a lower employee head count 
Shipments for Kansas City Southern were strong in some areas and mixed in others 

Source  Kansas City Southern s Third Quarter Presentation  slide 10 
Chemicals   Petroleum products saw the highest revenue growth  an increase of 17  from the previous year  Much of this growth was driven by a 15  increase in the number of carloads  Petroleum sales were higher by 36   Refined product shipments to Mexico were also higher during the quarter  Revenues for Automotive shipments were up 8   growth that was split evenly between an increased number of carloads as well as higher revenue per unit  Demand for autos and trucks were strong  a positive to benefit to many of the railroad companies  Intermodal volumes increased 7   leading to 8  revenue growth  Kansas City Southern saw a high level of truck to rail conversion in the third quarter 
Slightly offsetting these gains for Kansas City Southern was a 2  decline in energy revenues  caused primarily by an 8  decrease in energy carloads  The main culprit for this decline was a 25  drop in utility coal  Frac sand shipments were down 35   Revenue per unit  on the other hand  improved 7  as crude oil sales spiked more than 220  
With nearly half of revenues coming from the Mexico side of the border  a trade war between the country and the U S  could have negatively impacted Kansas City Southern s business  Fortunately  it appears that the two countries have come to a trade agreement  While some of the details still have to be settled  we feel that this issue has been addressed 
Kansas City Southern expects to earn  6 15 per share in 2018  If achieved  this would represent a nearly 19  increase from last year 
Dividend History and Valuation
Among the dividend paying railroads  Kansas City Southern has one of the shorter dividend growth streaks  The company has increased its dividend for the past six years  The company has increased its dividend 
By an average of 8 6  per year over the past three years 
By an average of 18 2  per year over the past five years 
While the company has shown solid growth over the short and medium term  Kansas City Southern hasn t increased its dividend since the October 2017 payment  Investors should be aware that the railroad doesn t always follow a predicable dividend growth schedule 
Kansas City Southern will pay out  1 44 in dividends per share in 2018  Using expected EPS for the year  this would equate to a payout ratio of 23 4   According to Value Line  the average dividend payout ratio for the last decade is 25 9  over the life of the company s dividend  This is one of the lowest payout ratios of all of the railroads  This should leave plenty of room for Kansas City Southern to continue paying a dividend  even if earnings were to suffer a decline  Shares of the company currently yield 1 5   below the 2 0  yield of the S P 500 
Based off of Friday s closing price of  96 67 and expected EPS of  6 15  shares of Kansas City Southern have a price to earnings ratio  or P E  of 15 7  The railroad s average P E ratio from 2008 through 2017 was 22 7  This decade long average valuation is one of the highest among all stocks in the railroad sector  Shares of Kansas City Southern may not return this this average P E  but there would still be significant multiple expansion if the stock were to be valued at 18x or 19x earnings  For comparison  the P E ratio for the S P 500 is 19 9 
Conclusion
Though missing on revenue estimates  Kansas City Southern had a fairly strong third quarter  Chemicals   Petroleum  Automotive and Intermodal shipments all saw an increase in carloads and revenues  Volumes were especially strong for Chemicals   Petroleum products  Coal sales declined as demand from utility plants continues to shrink  Even though coal had a negative impact on Energy carloads  revenue per unit was higher thanks to a sizeable improvement in crude oil demand  A cooling in trade tensions between the U S  and Mexico are also very beneficial to Kansas City Southern s business 
While Kansas City Southern has a relatively short dividend growth streak  the company has shown solid growth rates over the past three and five year periods  In addition  the company has a very low payout ratio  one that would allow the company to continue to making payments to shareholders even if earnings were to drop  Kansas City Southern also has a current valuation that is below both its own historical average and that of the market index  The combination of all of these factors make Kansas City Southern our favorite pick in the railroad sector

176445,397961,SO,Hipster Staple Quinoa May Get Pricier as Peru Eyes China Market,news," Bloomberg     Hipsters beware  Quinoa prices are set to rise as Peru  the world s largest producer of the seed  will start exporting the protein rich crop to China 
Officials from both countries signed late last month a customs agreement in Beijing allowing imports of quinoa from Peru for the first time  The accord follows similar agreements for shrimp last year and blueberries in 2016 and comes as the Andean nation rapidly expands shipments of fresh produce while diversifying an export basket dominated by copper and gold 
 It s an immense opportunity   said Alfonso Velasquez  chairman of the Exporters Association known as Adex  which expects prices to rise when shipments start   Increased demand will spur quinoa production and Chinese companies will want to get involved  
Peru bolstered its position as the world s biggest supplier of the seed after a surge in demand in the first half of this decade sent prices soaring and sparked a rush to expand output  As a result  growers from Spain to the U S   who were experimenting with the crop  stepped up production  Export prices then sagged between 2015 and 2016 and have yet to recover  leading Peruvian producers to curb output 
Native to the Andes mountains of South America  the protein rich  gluten free seed has become popular among health conscious consumers worldwide over the last decade  and more recently as a staple in poke restaurants in the U S 
 The Biggest Market 
Farmers began mass producing quinoa on Peru s arid coast for the first time as prices began climbing a decade ago  using pesticides to control mildew and bugs  Some switched to other crops after the U S   the biggest quinoa importer  rejected cargoes because of pesticide residue 
The Andean nation exported  125 million of quinoa last year  of which 36  went to the U S   according to Peru s trade ministry  Five years earlier  sales to the U S  accounted for 55  of the total 
Velasquez  a former minister of production  said demand from Chinese buyers could spur large scale cultivation in highland areas  which are better suited to the crop   If we maintain levels of quality and acceptance of Peru s quinoa  undoubtedly Asia will become the biggest market   he said 
Peru has expanded agricultural output over the last decade after it signed free trade agreements with China  the European Union  Japan and the U S  It s now a key global supplier of crops such as avocados  grapes and blueberries 
Exporters see China as one of the markets with the biggest potential for farm goods  While the Asian giant s demand for copper and other metals makes it Peru s biggest trading partner  its purchases of fresh produce remain comparatively small  The South American country sold  177 million of farm goods to China last year  compared with  1 9 billion shipped to the U S 
Chinese investment in the country has also grown  expanding beyond the mining sector into logistics and energy projects 
Blueberries are a good example of how diplomacy with China is paying off  Peru became the second biggest exporter of blueberries to China in 2017 behind Chile after receiving phytosanitary clearance from customs  China previously imported almost all its blueberries from Peru s southern neighbor 
Peru raked in  554 million from exports of the berry in 2018  up 53  from a year earlier 
 We re the global sensation in blueberries   said Velasquez   Blueberries can be produced all year around  but we re the only country in this part of the Southern  NYSE SO  Hemisphere harvesting in September and October   filling a gap between the U S  and Chilean harvests  he said 
Velasquez said the berry will be the star of Peru s annual Expoalimentaria fair in Lima in September  much like quinoa lured foreign buyers to earlier editions of the trade show 
Expanding large scale farming on Peru s coast is being held back by delays to new irrigation projects and uncertainty about the future of a special labor and tax regime for agribusiness that expires in 2021  he said  A government backed law that seeks to extend the regime for 10 years has been waiting to be put to a vote on the floor of Congress for more than a year ",2019-07-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/hipster-staple-quinoa-may-get-pricier-as-peru-eyes-china-market-1915049,1915049

176491,398007,SO,Trump s Trade War With China Could Squeeze U S  Colleges Next,news," Bloomberg     Kirk Brennan  director of undergraduate admission at the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California  was on a bus in Baotou earlier this month  part of a multi school recruiting trip in Inner Mongolia  when he heard the news  The Chinese Education Ministry had issued a warning to students studying in the U S  to be vigilant about restrictions on academic visas 
It s hard to overstate the importance of international students in general    and Chinese students in particular    to U S  colleges and universities  Second only to New York University in its international student population  USC draws about 12  of its 47 000 students from China  Its 1 000 Chinese undergraduates alone could bring in more than  50 million in annual tuition revenue 
But the increasingly fraught relationship over trade between the U S  and China threatens that pipeline  Orientations for incoming USC first years in Beijing and Shanghai went off without a hitch last week  Brennan said  and as of now  the school has yet to confront  these kinds of road blocks   
Over the last decade  U S  colleges and universities have turned to students from abroad to make up for rising costs and shrinking funding  And no country has been more eager to import American higher education than China  More than 360 000 Chinese students studied at such schools in the 2017 18 school year  making up one third of the overall international student body 
 Every major institution builds international students into their financial model   said Brad Farnsworth  vice president for global engagement at the American Council on Education  a higher education trade group   Universities    and their communities    realize significant economic benefits  
The Trump administration  though  has restricted access to student visas on concern that its biggest rival is exporting what it considers to be a growing threat to the American government  industry and the economy more broadly  spies  The suspicion is feeding a crackdown on students and even cancer and other researchers at leading institutions  which has led to worries that America is descending into a new Cold War like Red Scare 
More than 80  of colleges and universities surveyed by the Institute of International Education said delays and denials have had a negative impact on their ability to enroll international students  Enrollment was flat from the 2016 17 academic year to 2017 18  while the Chinese student population increased 3 6   the smallest gain in a decade 
Schools elsewhere have been eager to absorb the overflow  International student enrollment increased 20  in 2017 in Canada  which has eagerly promoted policies like expedited visa processing  post study work visas and a path to citizenship 
 Politicians and university leaders alike have seized on the opportunity to brand the country as a proudly multicultural  welcoming destination   according to a May report by the NAFSA  Association of International Educators  In 2018  Australia  which has similar post study visa rules  saw international enrollment rise 15  
Potential Losses
 If we re left flat footed  we may not be able to regain those losses   said Rachel Banks  the group s director of public policy 
Even with the political tensions and visa troubles  Chinese student enrollment won t drop to zero overnight  But the stakes vary by school 
NYU  USC  Northeastern and Columbia universities enroll the most international students among private schools  Arizona State  the University of Illinois  UCLA and Purdue lead among public schools  according to the IIE 
 A good practice generally is to have a diverse source of students from many different countries    Farnsworth said   The reality is the global market doesn t work that way  The most who have the financial means and motivation are coming from just a handful of countries   
Illinois  in particular  is already under pressure from several economic trends  State funding has dropped  The state s high school age population is shrinking  reducing the pool of undergraduates 
More than a decade ago  the school began actively recruiting students from abroad  said Kevin Pitts  vice provost for undergraduate education at the flagship campus in Urbana Champaign  Chinese students are the biggest cohort  making up almost 12  of the school s 49 000 students and concentrated in business and engineering degrees 
The University of Illinois  international students overall generated about  475 million in economic impact and supported more than 7 300 jobs  according to data from NAFSA  Tuition paid by them also helps fund need based and merit aid for in state students 
 It s absolutely true that the revenue helps us    Pitts said in an interview   It s helping us be better servants of the students in the state   
If the number of undergraduates from China is curtailed  the school would turn its attention to potential out of state students  who also pay higher tuition than state residents  Prices are locked in for its current crop of students  so any tuition increase would take effect for those entering in 2020  Pitts said 
Insurance Policy
This isn t the first time Illinois has considered its reliance on Chinese students  The colleges of engineering and business purchased an insurance policy to cover losses if international enrollment dropped precipitously  Chinese students comprise about 20  of graduate students at those schools 
If an unforeseen international event  including a trade war  causes an 18 5  decline in enrollment or greater  the insurance kicks in to cover the lost revenue  With graduate tuition at about  40 000 a year  a 20  drop in masters students would portend a  4 million shortfall  said Jeffrey Brown  dean of the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois 
 Recent events have made it clear why we were going down this path to begin with    said Brown ",2019-06-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trumps-trade-war-with-china-could-squeeze-us-colleges-next-1901262,1901262

176495,398011,SO,Controversies test appeal of Democrats Biden  Buttigieg to black voters,news,"By James Oliphant WASHINGTON  Reuters    At various stages of their presidential campaigns  Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg have each faced a central question  Can a Democratic Party that increasingly prizes diversity and progressivism support a moderate white man as the nominee  Both candidates revived that debate this week  when they ran up against the issue of race  spotlighting their relationship with the African American community  a vital Democratic constituency   For Biden  it was his boast of working with avowed segregationists in the Senate in the name of civility and getting things done  For Buttigieg  it was dealing with the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of a black man in South Bend  Indiana  where he serves as mayor   The controversies again raised questions about whether either is the best choice to galvanize black voters as the Democratic nominee against Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 presidential election  Democrats have emphasized the importance of African American voters for next year s election after black turnout dipped in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee   There is a huge elephant in the room this cycle   which is race   said Quentin James  executive director of The Collective PAC  which is working to ensure a black candidate is on the Democratic ticket   At a fundraiser earlier this week  Biden  76  talked of working as a young senator with Southern  NYSE SO  Democrats Herman Talmadge and James Eastland  While discussing Eastland  a senator from Mississippi who described black people as inferior and fought against efforts to desegregate the South  Biden said   He never called me boy  he always called me son   He was swiftly criticized by several other presidential candidates  including U S  Senators Cory Booker  Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren  When Booker  an African American who is almost 30 years younger than Biden  called on him to apologize  Biden responded by defending his civil rights record and saying Booker should apologize to him   There s not a racist bone in my body   he said   Booker was visibly upset in an interview with CNN afterward  saying Biden  who served two terms as vice president to Barack Obama   America s first black president   had missed the point about the harm his words caused    What matters to me is that a guy running to be head of our party  which is a significantly diverse and wondrous party  doesn t understand or can t even acknowledge that he made a mistake   Booker said   He knows better   The front runner for the Democratic nomination  Biden has long championed civil rights and was honored earlier this year by Al Sharpton s National Action Network  At a fundraiser on Wednesday  he cited civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr  as an inspiration for entering public service and spoke of fighting segregation alongside the late Senator Edward Kennedy  But James argued the base of the Democratic Party had shifted beneath Biden s feet  Since his campaign began  Biden has strived to persuade progressive elements of the party that he is in step with them on issues such as abortion and climate change  This week s flap  continues a narrative for Biden that he is not in line with the future of the party   James said  Nancy Pelosi  who as speaker of the House of Representatives is the top elected U S  Democrat  defended Biden on Thursday  calling him  authentic    Joe Biden seems to have tremendous support in the African American community  But it s for them to decide  it s not for me to make a judgment as to how they re going to react to him   she said  RAW RELATIONS Buttigieg has spent the week dealing with a crisis in South Bend  after a white police officer shot a black man early on Sunday who he said had flashed a knife  The officer s body camera had been switched off  Buttigieg canceled campaign events and returned home  He has had at times a rocky relationship with the city s black residents  stemming from his decision to fire the African American police chief early in his mayoral tenure and criticism that poorer neighborhoods have not benefited from his efforts to revitalize the local economy  Openly gay  Buttigieg  37  has been an effective fundraiser in part because of backing from the LGBTQ community  But he has acknowledged he has largely failed to win over black voters in critical early voting states such as South Carolina    We know it s going to take extra work because I m not from a community of color and also was not a famous person when this process began   Buttigieg said last week in Charleston  South Carolina   We re working very energetically  very actively  in order to invite more people and specifically black voters into this campaign   Bolstered by his partnership with Obama  Biden has long enjoyed strong support from black voters in South Carolina and elsewhere   Antjuan Seawright  a Democratic strategist in Columbia  South Carolina  said that while that was unlikely to change  Booker and Harris  another African American candidate  could now siphon off some of that support   He said Biden erred in attacking Booker  who trails him significantly in opinion polls   You don t punch down   he said

176501,398017,SO,Oxford Industries  OXM  Reports Next Week  What You Should Expect,opinion,"The market expects Oxford Industries  OXM  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 4  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the Tommy Bahama  Lilly Pulitzer and Southern  NYSE SO  Tide clothing lines is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  243 27 million  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 7  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oxford Industries 
For Oxford Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oxford Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oxford Industries would post earnings of  1 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 83  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oxford Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oxford-industries-oxm-reports-next-week-what-you-should-expect-200362771,200362771

176505,398021,SO,SO Vs  BKH  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Utility   Electric Power sector have probably already heard of Southern Co   SO  and Black Hills  BKH   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  both Southern Co  and Black Hills are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
SO currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 20  while BKH has a forward P E of 19 14  We also note that SO has a PEG ratio of 3 38  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BKH currently has a PEG ratio of 4 27 
Another notable valuation metric for SO is its P B ratio of 1 69  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BKH has a P B of 1 82 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SO s Value grade of B and BKH s Value grade of C 
Both SO and BKH are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that SO is the superior value option right now ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/so-vs-bkh-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200363099,200363099

176526,398042,SO,China  Hong Kong homebuyers play cross border musical chairs in Bay Area,news,By Clare Jim and Joy Leung HONG KONG  Reuters    An ambitious plan to transform the industrial towns of China s Pearl River Delta into a modern economic zone powered by new technology ventures has triggered a rush of cross border property investments between Hong Kong and the mainland  The promise of reduced investment barriers in the region known as the Greater Bay Area  GBA  has driven greater partnerships between Hong Kong and mainland property firms  who are looking to capitalize on a two way rush for homes  In one direction  cashed up investors from Southern  NYSE SO  China s factory belt are moving into Hong Kong s luxury apartment sector  where prices can be more than 100 times those on the mainland  In the other direction  Hong Kong residents are scrambling for bargains in mainland cities like Zhuhai and Zhongshan   some for quick profit  others a sea change   Hong Kong s housing environment is very cramped  while the mainland provides good space for retirement   said H C  Lee  a 47 year old Hong Kong resident who recently made a HK 4 million   510 000  profit on the sale of her Hong Kong apartment in the New Territories  She used half that money to buy two apartments  one in Guangzhou and another in the third tier city of Huizhou  Her investment was also driven in part by expectations the commute between Hong Kong and Huizhou  currently about four hours  will be halved when a new rail connection opens in five years  Faster transport links to the mainland that opened last year  including the world s longest sea crossing bridge and a high speed rail  are boosting the area s appeal as an alternative destination for Hong Kong property buyers  The plan to develop the area   which has a population of 68 million and a  1 5 trillion gross domestic product   will lead to an increase in such investments  say analysts and real estate agents  The scheme is part of Beijing s plan to increase social mobility between Hong Kong and its hinterland and bring the restive former British colony deeper into its China s political and economic fold  It includes major initiatives at the national  provincial and local levels  Some districts in Zhuhai and the third tier city of Zhongshan recently relaxed home purchase rules to allow Hong Kong and Macau residents to buy new units  Previously  they could only buy second hand apartments or commercial properties  More incentives  such as tax subsidies and healthcare and education benefits  are also being introduced by policymakers to lure Hong Kong people to work and live in the GBA  One Hong Kong investor  surnamed Lam  bought a 1 2 million yuan flat in Zhuhai in mid May  her first in China  She hopes to use it

similar sized unit in Hong Kong  Promotional calls from developers Agile Group and Kaisa Group were also received by Reuters   In recent weeks  Logan Property and Times China separately set up

176527,398043,SO,In VW Chattanooga vote  UAW seeks elusive U S  southern toehold,news,"By Nick Carey CHATTANOOGA  Tenn   Reuters    For the second time in five years  workers at Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG s Chattanooga  Tennessee  assembly plant have been voting this week on whether to unionize  potentially handing the United Auto Workers its first toehold in the U S  South  The vote by 1 700 workers at VW s Chattanooga plant  which makes the Passat sedan and the Atlas SUV  comes at a pivotal time for the UAW  Its membership fell 8  last year and the union faces contentious contract talks this summer with Detroit automakers General Motors Co  NYSE GM   Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  The result in Tennessee could mark a small but significant step toward the UAW s cherished goal of unionizing foreign automakers  In 2014  VW s Chattanooga workers voted against unionization by a small margin  extending the UAW s decades long losing streak in the South  The latest organizing vote has been opposed by prominent Republican elected officials in Tennessee and is expected to be close  Voting began on Wednesday and polls close late Friday  Pro union VW workers complain of lax health and safety procedures  of quality of life issues such as constant last minute changes in scheduling  insufficient vacation time and small bonuses    This is not about a pay raise   said Steven Fugat  26   I just want some stability  I want to know when I have to work and when I get to be with my family or helping out at my church    Fugat makes  20 an hour hanging tires  installing consoles  seats and rearview mirrors on Atlas and Passat vehicles near the end of the assembly line   I want respect for my time and we are ready for a change for the good   he said   UAW faces membership challenge   Detroit automakers pay more for unionized workers   Pro union workers allege VW has argued against unionization in daily meetings  but a company spokeswoman said it respected  the right of our employees to decide    In January  the German automaker said it would invest  800 million to build a new electric vehicle in Chattanooga starting in 2022  creating 1 000 new jobs  When asked if a vote for unionization could affect that plan VW s spokeswoman said the automaker s commitment  is unchanged   VW also has workers on the factory floor who oppose the UAW  Keri Menendez  44  said her problem was not with organized labor but with the UAW  which has struggled with a wide ranging federal corruption probe  So far seven people linked to the union and Fiat Chrysler have been sentenced in the investigation into illegal payouts to UAW officials  The UAW and the automaker insist only a few individuals were involved   Corruption has been a problem for the UAW   said Menendez  a team leader on the line making  23 50 an hour   They re more interested in their own business than caring for people    Republican U S  Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said in a statement it was  deeply concerning that an organization with such a troubled past could soon force their grip onto workers in Chattanooga   FALLING MEMBERSHIP At its peak in 1979  the UAW represented 1 5 million workers  Last year  after nine years of gains  membership dropped again to below 400 000  The union s gains in recent years had come mostly from unionizing casino workers  graduate students and nurses instead of automotive workers  Brandi Ginger  43  who works in quality control at the VW plant  dislikes that history of decline   How can an organization that has fallen that far ever be considered successful   she asked   Maury Nicely  a Chattanooga attorney who oversees Southern  NYSE SO  Momentum  an anti UAW group  said the union would scare away other potential investors and  render us less competitive    A victory in Chattanooga would give the UAW a psychological boost  but the major manufacturing operations of Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd lie further south in states like Alabama and Mississippi that lack Tennessee s history of partial unionization   GM  for instance  has a plant in Spring Hill  Tennessee   A win at VW would give the UAW bragging rights   said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs   But a win in the Deep South is not in the cards    Unionizing those major operations could strengthen the UAW s hand with the Detroit automakers  which want to narrow the gap between what they pay U S  hourly workers and their foreign counterparts  For instance  VW notes that in 2018 the average assembly worker at Chattanooga earned nearly  55 000 last year and skilled workers made more than  78 000  above the Chattanooga area s average annual wage of almost  46 000  But that is well shy of the  95 000 and  123 000 the average U S  based GM assembly worker and skilled work made respectively  including overtime and profit sharing bonuses  Steven Bernstein  a Tampa based labor attorney at Fisher Phillips LLP  said that if the UAW wins in Chattanooga  it must prove its worth to win elsewhere   The UAW would have to deliver meaningful  tangible benefits to VW workers  otherwise why vote for them   Bernstein said  But first  the UAW must win  Shannon Fossett  a team leader at the Chattanooga plant  campaigned for unionization in 2014 and said he believed the UAW could win  but was nervous about how close the vote could be

176571,398087,SO,This Copper Miner Is Highly Leveraged To The Price Of Copper,opinion,"Economic geologist Nigel Maund discusses a copper miner and explorer that he sees as a  longer term  investment play with substantial upside growth potential  
Copper Mountain Mining Corp   TO CMMCAX C6C  is listed on three exchanges  although the highest daily share turnover  by a factor of 5 to 10x ASX turnover  is on the Toronto TSX  The company is a medium rank copper producer  with byproduct gold and silver  with its mines located in two of the lowest sovereign risk countries in the world  Canada and Australia  The company has a total of 203 1 million fully diluted shares in issue  which includes 187 9 fully paid up ordinary shares and 10 million options and 5 1 million warrants  Management and insiders own a total of 8  and institutions are holding 45  of the stock  At today s TSX share price of C 1 03  the current market capitalization is C 194 million or US 148 4 million  The Enterprise Value is C 453 9 million  including C 248 million in long term debt with total liabilities at C 392 million and a debt to assets ratio of 41 23  
The current P E ratio stands at 5 and the Bloomberg  BEst  P E ratio stands at 10 88  EPS stands at C 0 22  Price to Book Ratio stands at 0 84 and Price to Sales Ratio stands at 0 49 
Q2 2018 s last financial results show that the Copper Mountain Mine produced 20 million pounds of copper  6 500 ounces of gold and 68 400 ounces of silver  giving a revenue of C 84 2 million  Cash flow from mining operations was C 40 1 million producing an EBITDA of C 22 6 million  Q3 s financial results will be out by the end of the first week of November 
CMMC s core asset is its 75   Mitsubishi 25   owned Copper Mountain alkalic porphyry copper mine located in southern British Columbia  shown on Figure 1 below  However  CMMC has further emergent copper gold producers  such as the 75  owned Ingerbelle deposit  located 1 kilometer NW of the current open pit mining operations  as well as the 100  owned Eva copper project  Figure 2  located in the Mount Isa Inlier of Central North West Queensland  Australia  Hence  the upside potential is considerable 

  Plate 1  Summary location map of the Copper Mountain   Ingerbelle porphyry copper    gold  Mine in Southern  NYSE SO  British Columbia  some 300 km east of Vancouver 
As shown on the detailed Table 1 below  the latest CMMC Ore Resource update  with overall resources having increased by 36   as of 1st October 2018  The table illustrates clearly that the Copper Mountain project is a modest sized low grade open pit porphyry copper    gold  deposit  with a low to moderate stripping ratio of 2 88 1  whose overall profitability is very sensitive and leveraged to the C  copper price and  to a much lesser degree  the gold price  Annual production is around 80 million pounds of copper in concentrates  with modest gold and silver credits of around 25 000 ounces of gold and 270 000 ounces of silver  Given the low grade of the deposit  the stripping ratio becomes more significant as a cost component  To further highlight this copper price sensitivity  during the last financial year overall profitability was reduced by 30 63  due to lower average copper prices 

  Plate 2  A view across the Copper Mountain Open Pit Complex  Pits 1 through 3 being merged into a Super Pit  

  Plate 3  A monochrome aerial photograph of the Copper Mountain Mining Operations showing basic mine infrastructure and the location of the new Ingerbelle porphyry copper    gold  deposit less than 1 km WNW from the main open pit 
Cash operating costs currently amount to U 2 10 to 2 20 for years 1 to 3  i e   2018 to 2020  Thereafter  these cash operating costs increase to U 2 25 to 2 45 in Years 4 to 10 and then fall to U 1 75 to 1 85 at the base of the open pit where the stripping ratio is substantially reduced  Total material mined and removed over the life of the mine has been estimated at 572 million tonnes  with total ore mined amounting to 148 million tonnes and total waste rock of 424 million tonnes 
The overall metallurgical recovery of copper  79    gold  68   and silver  71   all err on the low side  which with the low mined grades  further add to the price sensitivity and reduced profitability of the project and its strong leverage to the copper price  Clearly  given these figures  any significant lift in copper and precious metal prices will significantly alter the overall profitability of the project and stock price of CMMC  The mine operates a 40 000 tonnes per day  tpd  conventional crushing  grinding and sulphide flotation plant 

   Table 1  1st October 2018 updated ore resources for the Copper Mountain Mine  The table shows the impact on resources at different cut off copper grades at different resource categories applicable under Aus IMM JORC 2012 and Canadian NI 43 101 systems 
Given the updated ore resources  shown in Table 1 above  and the anticipated production rate  CMMC have projected a 14 year life of mine at current production rates without factoring in the increased resources provided by the Ingerbelle deposit detailed below  The June 2018 production schedule for the Copper Mountain Mine is presented below 

  Table 2  this summarizes the Production Plan for the Copper Mountain Mine projected over the Life of Mine  LOM  split into tranches reflecting changes in production as mining progresses to depth within the open pit  Note the progressive and significant decrease in the volume of ore mined and the fall of in grade and metal production  although cash operating costs decline due to less waste rock mining at the pit base 
From Table 2 above  it is apparent that CMMC will be looking to develop the open pit mine at Ingerbelle to replace the falling copper and precious metal production from the Copper Mountain open pit from Year 3 onward 
CMMC released an Ore Resource Estimate for Ingerbelle on 21st September 2018  In summary  this comprises a  Measured and Indicated   M I  resource of 151 million tonnes at a grade of 0 29  copper and 0 18 g t gold  0 41  copper equivalent  at a 0 16  copper cut off grade  This resource contains more than one billion pounds of copper and one million ounces of gold at a 0 12  copper cut off grade  A further  Inferred  category resource of 69 million tonnes at a grade of 0 27  copper and 0 16 g t gold  0 38  copper equivalent  containing 405 million pounds of copper and 360 000 ounces of gold at a 0 16  copper cut off grade has been defined 
It is noteworthy that the gold content of Ingerbelle is between 200  to 300  more than that of the Copper Mountain Resource with a comparable copper grade  Hence  Ingerbelle is strongly leveraged to both the gold and copper price  A Preliminary Economic Assessment  PEA  of the Ingerbelle Project has been undertaken and its key findings are summarized in Table 3 below 

  Table 3  Highlights of the PEA for the Ingerbelle Mining Project focusing on the first 5 years of production for a LOM of 12 years  Assumptions made are listed below the Table 
CMMC s other major copper project  Eva  is located in Central NW Queensland  Australia  within the Proterozoic age  1 600 to 1 500 Ga   Mount Isa Inlier  MII   with its location shown on Figure 3 below  The MII has been one of the world s greatest metallotects  hosting world class copper  gold  copper lead zinc silver and Iron Oxide Copper Gold  IOCG  mines such as Mount Isa  Cu  Zn  Pb  Ag   Hilton  Zn  Pb and Ag   Dugald River  Zn  with lesser Pb and Ag  and Ernest Henry  IOCG   Cu  Au  Fe   Co    plus numerous medium rank and smaller deposits  mostly of copper  molybdenum and gold 
The Eva Copper Project is 100  owned by CMMC  The project was acquired during early 2018 following a merger between CMMC and Australia s Altona Mining Limited  ASX   where CMMC acquired all Altona s stock for a premium of 40  above market  Infrastructure in proximity to the project is excellent and access easy 

  Plate 4  A summary map showing the location of the Cloncurry Copper Project  amidst the major infrastructure in the State  which includes the Eva copper deposits amongst a cluster of other neighboring smaller deposits  The project area is served by a major rail connection between Mount Isa and the Port of Townsville  a National Asphalted Highway  Power Generation  Mt Isa  and asphalted airport with direct jet flights to Brisbane  Capital of the State of Queensland 

  Plate 5  a photo showing the location of the Little Eva Mine and Plant 
Among Altona s mineral assets  besides the Cloncurry Copper Project  the company had built up an outstanding land position comprising a total area of 3 970 sq  km in the highly prospective MII as shown on Plate 6 below 

  Plate 6  A summary map showing CMMC s extensive land position in the highly prospective Mount Isa Inlier  also showing the location of the Little Eva copper project and local infrastructure 
This gives CMMC a very strong platform from which to build its overall copper and gold resource inventory over the coming years and to sustain the project s LOM through definition of further near mine resources  Initial advanced exploration targets were generated by Altona prior to the merger  at the Brolga and Reaper prospects  where deep Induced Polarisation  IP  chargeability anomalies lie directly beneath major regional copper in soil geochemical anomaly 
Prior to acquisition  Altona completed a Definitive Feasibility Study  DFS  on the Cloncurry Copper Project  which comprises four deposits  as follows  Little Eva  Lady Clayre  Ivy Anne and Bedford  Little Eva is the largest single copper project of this group and is regarded as a close geologic analogue of the Ernest Henry  GLENCORE  IOCG deposit  Mineralization at the Little Eva deposit comprises structurally controlled veins  veinlets and breccia bodies  hosted with an envelope of strong hydrothermal alteration comprising  sodium and potassium feldspars  hematite and magnetite  developed within subvolcanic porphyritic and amygdaloidal intermediate rocks  All the other deposits are substantially smaller  shear zone  faulted and vein hosted deposits developed within metasedimentary and igneous rocks 
A DFS was prepared under Aus IMM JORC 2012 Ore Resource Code  in mid 2017 by Altona for the Eva Copper Project  Following the merger  CMMC completed an NI 43 101 Project Feasibility Study in October 2018  Key findings of this study are presented below  based solely on the sulphide resources 

  Table 4  key findings of NI 43 101 Project Feasibility Study in October 2018 
Conclusions and Recommendations
CMMC is now a fully fledged experienced operator of bulk tonnage low grade copper  with minor gold and silver credits  mines having cut its teeth on the Copper Mountain deposits  The Copper Mountain Mine has substantial operating upside from the development of the open pit Ingerbelle deposit that has very similar geology and metallurgy  The combined Copper Mountain and Ingerbelle deposits  plus the brownfield s exploration potential around both deposits and along the CM copper trend  in ground that CMMC holds  should sustain reserves well into the future  The merger with Altona Mining Ltd  ASX  was well timed  in market terms  with Altona having substantially augmented CMMC s overall resource base and lifted overall ore resource mine grades  The same exploration scope to substantially add to its copper and gold resource base exists at the Eva Project in Australia  given the superb ground holding CMMC holds around the projected copper operations near Cloncurry  The mining projects are moderately robust at today s relatively weak copper prices  Given the decline in overall global copper resources and the reduction in average mined grades together with the projected substantial increase in demand for copper metal from  especially  electric vehicles  EVs  and grid supporting storage batteries  the upside potential for CMMC could hardly look better  All CMMC s copper projects are highly leveraged to the price of copper  Therefore  given the foregoing metal demand projections the stock is viewed as a strong  longer term  investment play with substantial upside growth potential and scope for potentially significant dividends and or organic growth as earnings improve

176590,398106,SO,Mexico  U S  officials meet in high stakes tariff talks at White House,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Mexican officials met with their U S  counterparts for talks in Washington on Wednesday aimed at reaching a deal to stave off the imposition of U S  tariffs on Mexican goods next week  even as their government prepared to retaliate if duties go ahead  Frustrated by the lack of progress on a signature issue from his 2016 election campaign  U S  President Donald Trump unexpectedly told Mexico last week to take a harder line on curbing illegal immigration or face 5  tariffs on all its exports to the United States starting on Monday  rising to as much as 25  later in the year  If the tariffs go ahead  the United States would be in a serious dispute with two of its three top trading partners  U S  relations with China have worsened in the past month as Washington and Beijing have imposed additional tariffs on each others  imports   Mexico wants to stop a trade war that analysts believe might tip its economy into a recession and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he is optimistic that the talks in Washington could lead to an agreement   But his administration is preparing for a no deal outcome  too   Lopez Obrador has an official list of U S  products that could be subject to retaliatory tariffs if the duties take effect  officials said in Mexico City   The list is principally tailored toward products from agricultural and industrial states regarded as Trump s electoral base  according to one of the sources  U S  Vice President Mike Pence was chairing the meeting on Wednesday afternoon with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard to try to broker an agreement   We have a crisis on our Southern  NYSE SO  Border  POTUS has made clear that Mexico must do more   Pence tweeted before the meeting  U S  border officers apprehended more than 132 000 people crossing from Mexico in May  the Trump administration said on Wednesday  the highest monthly total in more than a decade and reaching what officials said were  crisis  levels  Many are Central American families seeking asylum  It was unclear what Mexico would offer to solve the dispute  An industry source who has met with the Mexican delegation said that ideas being floated include more border controls and joint security exercises on Mexico s southern border with Guatemala  which Central American migrants pass through on their way to the United States   The leftist administration of Lopez Obrador will make demands of its own  Mexican government sources said  It wants more economic aid and development for Central America to attack the root of migration  the sources said  With the clock ticking toward U S  elections in 2020  Trump is facing resistance within his own Republican Party over the threatened tariffs  Many lawmakers are concerned about the potential impact on cross border trade and on U S  businesses and consumers  John Thune of South Dakota  the No  2 Senate Republican  told reporters   We have conveyed our concerns to the administration  There are a good number of Republican senators who have expressed both publicly and privately to the White House their concerns about this    White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNN the tariffs might not be needed because the threat alone was enough to  have the Mexicans  attention   During a visit to Ireland  Trump said Mexico could still stop the tariffs being imposed   Mexico can stop it  They have to stop it  otherwise we just won t be able to do business   he said   I think they want to make a deal  and they sent their top people to try and do it    DEAL TALK Mexican officials will offer a  long list of things  in Wednesday s talks to avoid the duties  said Chuck Grassley  Republican chairman of the U S  Senate Finance Committee  Grassley said a deal could be announced on Thursday night   Grassley represents the farming state of Iowa  which exports pork and other agriculture products to Mexico and might be hit by Mexican retaliation in a prolonged trade dispute  The proposed tariffs have also been criticized by the U S  Chamber of Commerce and industry groups due to concerns about increased costs for U S  businesses and consumers of imported Mexican goods from cars and auto parts to beer and fruit  Migration at the southern border is still lower than at other peak periods since the 1970s  U S  authorities have said they are overwhelmed not so much by the number of migrants but by a shift in the type of person turning up at the border  Increasing numbers of Central American families and unaccompanied minors seeking asylum after fleeing criminal violence in their home countries have been turning themselves in to U S  border agents  who have long been geared up to catch mainly single  adult Mexicans trying to cross clandestinely

176602,398118,SO,2  Fire Sale  Dividends Up To 10  To Buy Now  With Upside ,opinion,"One of the most reliable income producing sectors has been hit hard over the past year  handing you a terrific shot at outsized dividend yields running all the way up to 10  
In a moment  I ll show you two funds that let you grab these huge income streams at a big discount and one that looks like a strong buy but is way overpriced and headed for a fall  You ll want to keep that one as far away from your portfolio as possible 
The sector all three of these picks come from is utilities one of only two sectors of the S P 500 that s down over the past year  the other being consumer staples   with a 2 6  overall decline 
The fact that utilities and consumer staples are down tells us one thing  the market has a bigger appetite for riskier stocks on confidence that the economy is expanding  with GDP growth slated to reach 3  by the end of 2018 
But that confidence has resulted in some folks shifting cash away from so called  boring  utilities in effect throwing out the baby with the bathwater  as the old saying goes 
And for dividend investors like us  that adds up to a nice buying opportunity 
Because as you can see in the chart below  all four of America s biggest utilities are having no trouble making their dividend payouts  the exception  Southern Company  NYSE SO   saw its payout ratio spike as it paid for an acquisition  but that s quickly returning to normal  
Stable Dividends  Check  
And if you want more proof that these dividends are ironclad  take a look at the history 
Dividend Growth Is in Their DNA 
That s why utility stocks are often called  orphan and widow  stocks  they re reliable payers you can buy  forget about and enjoy your dividend checks 
How to Grab Up to 10  Cash Payouts From Utilities Now
Unfortunately  this is where most people get hung up  Because despite their stable cash flows and rising dividends  utility stocks are far from easy to pick  They re largely regional and  as a result  are exposed to demographic flows and local economic developments that are tough to track 
That s why the benchmark ETF  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU   is so popular 
With a 3 4  dividend yield  XLU s payouts are nearly double those of the S P 500  But the great news is that we can do even better  doubling XLU s payouts again by digging into a high yield corner of the market few people even know exists  closed end funds  CEFs  
Right now  there are 9 utility focused CEFs with dividends ranging from 6 4  to 10   making them all intriguing options  But there are 2 in particular that should be high on your list 
Utility CEF Pick No  1  This 8 6  Markdown Won t Last Long
The first CEF is the Reaves Utility IF  NYSE UTG   which is trading at an 8 6  discount to NAV after trading at a premium price for most of 2017  UTG gives investors a generous 7 3  income stream  or more than twice the payout of XLU 
That s not the only thing UTG has going for it  This fund has crushed the benchmark ETF over the last decade  nearly doubling its total return while also giving investors a much higher payout  Bigger returns and a bigger income stream aren t easy to find but UTG offers investors both 
An Index Crusher 
CEFs with this kind of outperformance are usually priced at a premium to NAV  and given that this one was priced at a premium itself just a few months ago  the time to make a move is now  before its current markdown bleeds away 
CEF Pick No  2  More Risk  More Reward
In addition to UTG  there s another utility CEF that is worth considering although I ll tell you upfront that there is more risk involved 
I m talking about the Duff and Phelps Global Utility Income Closed Fund  NYSE DPG   which is trading at a 10 6  discount to NAV 
I m going to be honest  DPG doesn t have a great history  It s underperformed the index since its IPO in 2011  although a lot of that underperformance has shown up since 2014 
This Chart Is Ready to Flip 
Why the poorer performance 
Well  remember back in 2014  when oil prices crashed  This was great for American utilities  which are net consumers of energy  But DPG is a global utility fund  and a lot of energy providers outside of America are also energy producers  so they re much more sensitive to oil prices than their US cousins 
But oil is soaring in 2018  We ve already seen West Texas Intermediate  WTI  prices jump 12 8  this year  and the strong economy probably means prices will go even higher  That could be a boon for DPG  as it benefits from higher consumption and higher oil prices 
Plus  DPG s luxurious 10  income stream is nearly triple that of the index fund  so you ll be well compensated by that hefty dividend while you wait for the fund s discount to close and its NAV to rise 
Now we have to talk about another utility fund that has outperformed the market but isn t the screaming buy it appears to be  Far from it 
An Overpriced Utility CEF to Avoid
The DNP Select Income Closed Fund  NYSE DNP  is another utility CEF that has beaten XLU over the long term  as you can see here 
Another Outperformer 
While DNP s outperformance deserves to be rewarded  the market is going way too far  currently rewarding it with a 20  premium to NAV  Meanwhile  UTG the first utility fund I told you about trades at an 8 6  discount  Not only that  but UTG has beaten DNP for a long time  indicating that it is the superior fund 
The bottom line  DNP s huge premium and the downside it implies alone make this CEF a fund to avoid right now 
Why Wall Street Ignores CEFs
At this point you may be wondering why you ve never the media  and likely your own financial advisor  talk about the big yields and deep discounts in the CEF space  like the two I ve showed you today 
The answer  They d rather just talk about what s popular big cap stocks or overbought ETFs  It saves them a lot of research  and they get paid the same amount anyway 
That s too bad  because the totally inefficient CEF market is serving up some incredible deals on funds paying huge dividends right now  such as  
My No  1 CEF Buy Now  810  Gains and 8 4  Dividends in 1 Click 
My favorite CEF to buy right now has crushed the market since inception  with a monstrous 810  return 
1 Chart That Demolishes Conventional  Wisdom  
This is incredible the kind of gain you might expect from  say  a small cap tech stock  not a conservative fund like this one 
To give you a little more context  my No  1 pick is a pharma fund run by some of the smartest minds in the business researchers and doctors with  boots on the ground  experience zeroing in on the next billion dollar plus blockbuster drug 
That alone is reason enough to put this one on your short list 
There s more  though  Because this dynamic fund also throws off an incredible 8 4  dividend  too 
You d think a gain and a payout like that would at least get a few folks in the mainstream media talking 
No way  Not yet  anyway 
Why  For one  this low key CEF is tiny  with just a  391 million market cap  so it gets even less attention than your typical CEF does 
Yet as I write  this fund trades at a 4  discount to NAV  That may not sound like much  but it s traded at fat premiums MANY times in the past 5 years 
When it does so again  we ll be locked in for fast 20   upside from here  on top of that massive dividend 
That s our cue to buy and I ll give you full details on this fund  I m talking name  ticker symbol  buy under price and more   plus the whole story on my 4 other top CEF picks when you CLICK HERE now 
By the way  I ve hand picked these 5 CEFs to flourish as interest rates rise  AND your average yield  8 1  on all 5 funds  will soar as their dividend payouts skyrocket  too  Don t miss this incredible income  and growth  opportunity  CLICK HERE for full details on these 5 rock solid cash machines now

176603,398119,SO,Southern Co   SO  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Southern Co   SO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 5  
Revenues are expected to be  6 01 billion  down 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 9  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co 
For Southern Co The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Southern Co  Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Southern Co  Would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  15 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Southern Co  Appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/southern-co-so-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200352404,200352404

176615,398131,SO,U S  judge rejects Trump administration move to start wall construction,news,"By Tom Hals  Reuters    A federal judge rejected on Thursday an effort by the Trump administration to begin construction on a wall on the border with Mexico while it appeals a ruling that found funding for the wall was likely not authorized by Congress  U S  District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam in Oakland  California said in a written order the government was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its appeal  and therefore failed to justify a stay of a preliminary injunction issued last Friday  A spokesman for the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Gilliam s order  The government said in a court filing it needed a stay of Friday s injunction to begin wall construction in Arizona and Texas and stem the flow of illegal drugs  The Trump Administration has said it plans to redirect  6 7 billion from the Departments of Defense and Treasury toward wall construction  after failing to convince Congress to provide the money   Last Friday  Gilliam blocked the administration s initial transfer of  1 billion  finding that redirecting the funds from other programs likely violated the separation of powers principles  The government has appealed  and can still ask the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Gilliam s injunction during the appeals process  On Wednesday  civil rights groups and 20 states began round two of what is likely to be a prolonged battle over wall funding  The groups and states asked Gilliam to prevent the Trump Administration from redirecting an additional  1 5 billion that Congress had approved for the military  according to a court filing   A spokesman for the Department of Justice declined to comment  As more transfers are made  the plaintiffs are expected to respond by seeking further injunctions  The latest request seeks to block the use of  1 5 billion that was transferred by the Department of Defense in early May  The injunctions were requested by the Sierra Club and the Southern  NYSE SO  Border Communities Coalition  which are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union  as well as 20 states led by California and New Mexico

176619,398135,SO,Qualcomm has strong argument to win reversal of U S  antitrust ruling  legal experts,news,"By Jan Wolfe  Reuters    A rare public call by a U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  official for one of the agency s courtroom victories to be reversed  in a case of anticompetitive business practices by chipmaker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  charts a strong course for a judge s ruling to be overturned on appeal  some legal experts said  FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson  an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump  wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the May 22 ruling against Qualcomm  radically expanded a company s legal obligation to help its competitors  and was based on a strained interpretation of a 1985 decision by the U S  Supreme Court  U S  District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose  California said that Qualcomm s licensing practices had strangled competition in parts of the computer chip market  harming rivals  smartphone makers  and consumers  She ordered the San Diego based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices  without threatening to cut off supplies  and ordered that it be monitored for seven years to ensure its compliance  The Qualcomm case has been controversial since it began in the final days of Democratic President Barack Obama s administration  with the lone Republican FTC commissioner at the time saying it should not be brought  The op ed by Wilson  one of five FTC commissioners  will not have any legal weight as Qualcomm appeals Koh s decision but foreshadows strong arguments the company has to win on appeal  Geoffrey Manne  director of the International Center for Law and Economics  and several other antitrust lawyers said   Other experts  however  said the decision was well reasoned and relied on detailed factual findings and determinations of witness credibility that appeals courts would be reluctant to second guess   FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan said the agency declined to comment  The judge has not yet ruled on Qualcomm s request to put her decision on hold as it plans an appeal  The ruling sent Qualcomm shares tumbling and shaved  10 billion off the company s value  Under U S  antitrust law  companies generally can decide who they want to do business with  Even monopolists do not have a so called  duty to deal  with competitors   ASPEN SKIING  U S  SUPREME COURT CASE      But the Supreme Court created an exception to this rule in the 1985 case  known as  Aspen Skiing   holding that exiting a profitable  time tested business arrangement could be an violation of competition law       As Koh s ruling points out  Qualcomm once licensed its patents on industry standard technology to rival chip makers  though the ruling does not make clear how extensive the practice was  Qualcomm abandoned the practice entirely in the early 2000s and began only licensing those patents to companies that make consumer devices such as smartphones  which contain chips      Koh said Qualcomm s about face was  motivated by anticompetitive malice  and was the sort of conduct prohibited by Aspen Skiing   In Aspen Skiing  a ski resort operator backed out of a profitable  long standing agreement with a rival to jointly sell a combination lift ticket package   The Supreme Court said the company appeared to be sacrificing immediate profits in hopes of stomping out a competitor in the long run   Qualcomm argued at trial that it never granted so called  exhaustive  full licenses to other chip suppliers  Requiring it to grant them now  as Koh has ordered  would force it into a new business arrangement  rather than require a return to a previous one  the company argued   The FTC s Wilson wrote that Koh had misapplied the Supreme Court case  Under the judge s logic   Aspen Skiing now means that if a company ever sells any product to any competitor  it then could have a perpetual antitrust obligation to sell every product to every competitor   Wilson said  Jonathan Barnett  a law professor at the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California  agreed that Koh s decision was in danger of being overturned by an appeals court      The exception created by Aspen Skiing was supposed to be  very narrow   Barnett said  In a 2004 case involving  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   the high court cast doubt on Aspen Skiing  saying it was  at or near the outer boundary  of antitrust liability   Manne said Koh erred in comparing Qualcomm s change in licensing practices to the conduct in Aspen Skiing       The shift to device level licensing  hardly originated with Qualcomm  and made a great deal of business sense because it was much more lucrative  Manne said   But some legal experts said that Koh s heavy reliance on factual determinations  particularly findings that Qualcomm executives lacked credibility on the witness stand  made her ruling harder to challenge   Appeals courts will not set aside a trial judge s factual findings unless there is  clear error    a high standard that is difficult to meet  Koh  for example  said in her decision that  many Qualcomm executives  trial testimony was contradicted by these witnesses  own contemporaneous emails  handwritten notes  and recorded statements to the Internal Revenue Service   One Qualcomm in house lawyer  pretended not to recall  details of a 2012 meeting until the FTC s lawyers played a recording from it  Koh said  And Qualcomm executives often responded with  fast and practiced narratives  when questioned by their own lawyers  Koh said   It was embarrassing and probably really damaging on appeal that Koh carefully documented the Qualcomm executives pretty clear lies in testimony   said Christopher Sagers  a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University  Qualcomm said in a statement that it believes  a thorough examination of the evidence and the proper interpretation of the law will result in a reversal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals   Manne said that even under the deferential approach taken by appeals courts  Koh s decision was on thin ice  
 I definitely think she is incorrect on the law with respect to the duty to deal and Aspen Skiing  and she s vulnerable to reversal on appeal   Manne said ",2019-05-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/qualcomm-has-strong-argument-to-win-reversal-of-us-antitrust-ruling-legal-experts-1884139,1884139

Reuters   Similarly  London based private equity firm THCP  which manages more than 1 billion euros of assets  is finalising plans to open a base in the city after the summer  to be led by partner Michele Prencipe  the sources said  Alternative asset manager Hayfin Capital Management has also agreed to lease an office from June in the Brera district  boosting its European network which already includes London  Frankfurt and Paris among others  another source said  EQT declined to comment while spokesmen at THCP and Hayfin confirmed the plans  Milan started to emerge as a destination of choice for major private equity firms in the late Nineties  but after the boom years of 2005 2007 local teams were dramatically downsized  under pressure to cut costs during the financial crisis and with scarce opportunities for multi billion euro deals    Italy is one of our leading markets thanks to its large number of family owned companies   said Astorg partner Lorenzo Zamboni who launched the fund s Italian office in September  Paris based Astorg   which focuses on mid market investments and manages more than 8 billion euros of assets   clinched its first Italian deal in 2014 when it bought power transmission belts manufacturer Megadyne  THCP   another mid market investment firm which provides growth capital in exchange for minority stakes   has so far invested about 300 million euros in Italy and wants to use its Milan base to deploy more capital in the country   Founder and managing partner Mauro Moretti pointed to the large number of Italian companies which generate the bulk of their revenues abroad as a sweetspot for international investors   Their export driven strategy is a unique and attractive feature   he said  SILICON VALLEY OF BAD LOANS Despite being active in Italy since 2015 when it announced plans to buy medical device firm Lima  EQT has so far managed its investments in the country from its Zurich and Munich offices   Now the Swedish firm  which is backed by the Wallenberg family via Investor AB  is looking to move three of its dealmakers to Milan this year  including managing director Federico Quitadamo who will oversee the Italian rollout  the sources said  Credit focused investors are also circling the Italian market  where local banks hold about 189 billion euros of soured loans   There is growing appetite for distressed deals in the country and no wonder investors are flocking to Milan   said a banker based in the city   Italy is the Silicon Valley of bad loans   Founded in 2009  Hayfin is one of Europe s leading alternative asset managers  investing in anything from non performing loans and structured credit to real estate debt  It is actively growing its presence in Italy  eyeing a wide range of deals   We see attractive investment opportunities in both primary and secondary transactions and a growing role for private credit investors with patient and flexible capital   said managing director Stefano Questa   Our focus on Italy is not driven by near term considerations  but instead is part of Hayfin s approach of building a sustainable  long term presence in the major European markets   Italian banks have accelerated the sale of bad loans in the past two years  offloading debt with a gross value of 140 billion euros since 2017  Their focus is now shifting to  unlikely to pay loans   which had a gross value of 83 billion euros in December  Most credit investors in Italy tend to partner or take control of local debt servicing firms  U S  hedge fund Elliott  for example  relies on its majority owned Italian bank Credito Fondiario to manage the recovery of the non performing loans it has bought  But competition is fierce and investors want to stay close to local clients to prevail in auctions  TAX PERKS Generous tax incentives are also encouraging Italian investors to return to their homeland   An annual flat tax of 100 000 euros on all income from foreign investments  known as the non domiciled tax regime  appeals to general partners of private equity and hedge funds whose compensation includes so called carried interest  carry   which is a share of the funds  profits  Algebris Chief Executive Davide Serra  who founded the London based hedge fund in 2006  is among those who took advantage of the flat tax rate and moved back to Milan  a source familiar with the matter said  Serra did not respond to requests for comment  An existing 50  tax break for Italian workers returning from abroad has been hiked to 70  as part of the government s Growth Bill or Decreto Crescita  The bill  which Parliament needs to approve by June 29  grants a more generous 90  tax break for five years to those moving to some Southern  NYSE SO  regions  All incentives will be extended for a total of 10 years to those who buy properties in Italy or have children   If it goes through  this will be Europe s most attractive tax bill for country nationals living abroad   said Marco Cerrato  a partner at law firm Maisto e Associati which specialises in tax law from offices in Milan and London    Most people relocating from cities like London are highly skilled professionals who tend to bring business to Italy  open offices and recruit locally

176656,398172,SO,Should Value Investors Consider Southern Company  SO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Southern Company   NYSE SO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Southern Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Southern Company s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 16 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Southern Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Southern Company s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Southern Company has a P S ratio of about 2 1  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Southern Company currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SO a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 1  which is marginally better than the industry average of 8 6  Clearly  SO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Southern Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives SO a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The full year 2017 has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year 2018 estimate has seen one upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year 2017 consensus estimate has inched up 0 3  in the past two months  while the full year 2018 estimate has dipped 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Southern Company  The  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSouthern Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 27  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment Ideas While

176693,398209,SO,Southern Company s Kemper Project Delayed  Rates Unchanged,opinion,Electric utility firm The Southern Company s   NYSE SO   much delayed clean coal power plant project Kemper in Mississippi has suffered yet another setback  The project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution  cost overruns and multiple delays Recent Updates Mississippi Power  a subsidiary of Southern Company  recently announced a delay in the projected in service date of its Kemper County plant until the end of June  The extension of the schedule  will add  22 million to the overall cost of the plant  The company also revealed that it needed to redesign and replace a key component in its plant   syngas cooler super heater system   in order to establish long term sustained operations   Sustained operations will also require relocation of ash loading process together and other minor improvements  This will add another  164 million to the operating costs of the project  Therefore  the latest glitch would hike the overall cost of the plant by  186 million  While the company expects the facility to become functional by the end of June  the redesigning of the syngas cooler super heater would need another 18 to 24 months of construction time  Further  the company also intends to undertake additional improvement projects over the next few years to fix leaks and other issues relating to the plant s performance  safety and operations The Kemper ProjectKemper project had been central to ex President Obama s Climate Plan as it is based on clean coal  Notably  the project also received the support of President Trump The 582 megawatt electric power plant is designed to pipe synthetic gas through a chemical plant to remove carbon dioxide and other chemicals  and then burn the gas in turbines to generate electricity  It is designed to capture up to 65  of carbon dioxide emissions from the plant Challenges GaloreThe project found it difficult to get its two gasifiers to operate consistently  The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over  4 billion beyond the stipulated budget  The overall cost of the plant was estimated to total to around  3 billion in 2010  However  with several delays adding to the project s cost  the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over  7 3 billion  In the past 18 months  the company announced 10 delays owing to project management problems Further  the additional improvement projects will add to costs and negatively impact certain economic aspects of the Kemper The economics of the Kemper project is a major cause of concern for the company as the plant is not competitive at the current natural gas prices   According to the viability analysis undertaken by the Southern Company  the project will be economical with natural gas prices at  5 per million British Thermal units  This seems quite unlikely for many years according to Energy information Administration forecast Rate plan UpdatesIn 2015 Public Service Commission allowed the company a 15  rate hike for the plant s incremental costs to be passed on to ratepayers  Though the company was again to file rate plans for the project in early June  it recently announced that there would be no rate increase  The company has planned to keep the current customer rate in place for at least 11 months and has not filed a full rate review on recovery of the project s costs  According to the spokesperson of the company   Its plan to avoid further raising customer rates is likely to reduce whiplash to customers when rates rise later to pay for Kemper  would pay off accumulated costs more quickly and would help the company wean itself off financial support from Southern Co  while maintaining credit ratings  Mississippi Power is considering to develop a traditional rate case and a rate mitigation plan to address these costs  however  the timing of that filing is uncertain Zacks rank   Key PicksSouthern Company is one of the

176716,398232,SO,Utility Industry Stock Outlook   Oct 2016,opinion,"Demand for utility services like electricity  gas and water varies marginally with the swings of the economy  This is because the fortunes of these companies do not fluctuate extensively over the economic cycle  After all  these companies that provide basic services can never go out of business    this is their most basic fundamental strength  Their ability to boost shareholders  value through consistent dividends and share buybacks makes them all the more attractive

The Environmental Challenge
Historically  Electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  Curbing pollution is now an ongoing process and regulators have fixed standards of emission that need to be achieved within a stipulated timeframe  Utilities are installing smart meters  attaching scrubbers to lower emissions and launching energy efficiency programs to reduce customers  energy consumption 
Governments across the world are enforcing even stricter rules and mandates to bring down the industry s carbon footprint  In Aug 2015  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency released the final version of the Clean Power Plan  The plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from the 2005 levels 
There was however strong opposition to the enforcement of this Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on other industries like coal apart from utilities  The Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants 
Some of the utilities had on their own taken steps to curb emission levels  by shutting down old coal based power plants  investing in emission control methods  and adding natural gas and alternate energy sources for electricity generation  As a result of these initiatives  per a U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report  the coal share of total electricity generation should fall from 33  in 2015 to 26  in 2040

176722,398238,SO,Country House wins Kentucky Derby after favorite DQ d,news," Reuters    Country House was declared the winner of the 145th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday when Maximum Security became the first horse in the history of the race to be disqualified after crossing the line first 
Country House s team raised an objection to Maximum Security s win  saying the 9 2 favorite s wide turn heading into the stretch impeded other horses on the sloppy track in rainy Louisville 
After a review  officials found Maximum Security was guilty of a contact foul and awarded the win to the William Mott trained Country House 
Code of Honor was bumped up to second and Tacitus third 
 No words can describe this  It s amazing   Country House jockey Favien Prat said after learning he had won his first Kentucky Derby 
 I really lost my momentum around the turn   he said of Maximum Security s foul  which came when the colt veered from the rail just as several horses were gaining ground on the leader

176748,398264,SO,Is Southern Company s Dividend Still Safe ,opinion,"This week  I will be taking a look at the dividend safety of Southern Company  NYSE SO  
My full thesis on Southern can be seen   but I will be focusing on the company s Dividend Safety Score in this article 
Before analyzing Southern s dividend  let s review how the company makes money  After all  the most effective investors understand that one of the best pieces of investing advice is to only invest in simple  easy to understand businesses 
Southern Company has been in business for more than a century and is a major producer of electricity in the United States 
The company s four regulated utilities service roughly 4 5 million customers residing in Georgia  Alabama  Florida  and Mississippi 
In addition to its regulated utility operations  which generate approximately 90  of earnings  the company also has a small wholesale energy company 
By power source  coal generated 33  of Southern Company s total megawatt hours in 2015  gas accounted for 47   nuclear was 16   and hydro power was 3  
Investors should note that Southern Company s business mix materially changed in July 2016 as a result of  
AGL Resources is a natural gas utility  As a result of the merger  Southern is now the second largest utility company in the U S  in terms of customer base 
The combined company has 11 regulated electric and natural gas distribution companies providing service to 9 million customers 
Its energy mix has shifted from 100  electric to a 50 50 mix of electric and natural gas Southern Company s Dividend SafetyI created a Dividend Safety Score metric to help conservative investors find the safest sources of dividend income for their portfolios 
Dividend Safety Scores analyze a company s  and answer the question   Is the current dividend payment safe  
Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100  A score of 50 is average  75 or higher is excellent  and 25 or lower is weak 
Dividend Safety Scores have flagged a number of major companies as high risk stocks before they cut their dividends 
Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   BHP Billiton  LON BLT   Potash  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are some of the companies that scored in the bottom 10 20  for Dividend Safety before announcing their dividend cuts 
Since we started tracking dividend cut announcements for all companies  businesses that cut their dividends by at least 50  has an average Dividend Safety Score of 6 
The utility sector is one of the safest areas for dividend income  However  that doesn t mean all utilities are solid income plays 
Fortunately  Southern pays one of the most reliable dividends in the market as indicated by its Dividend Safety Score of 89 
Southern Company has paid uninterrupted dividends every quarter since 1948 and increased its dividend by 2 9  per year over the last 20 calendar years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Investors have enjoyed higher dividends from Southern for 15 consecutive years  and it wouldn t surprise me if the company ultimately joined the dividend aristocrats list in 2026 
Simply put  Southern Company has been one of the most predictable and dependable dividend stocks in the market for more than six decades 
Some investors are surprised by the company s dividend reliability when they see its relatively high payout ratio  which sits above 80  
The payout ratio measures how much of a company s earnings are paid out as a dividend  High payout ratios can be riskier because there is less wiggle room to continue paying dividends if earnings unexpectedly decline 
Southern s elevated payout ratio doesn t concern me because it generates extremely steady earnings  Many utility companies can maintain relatively high payout ratios compared to most businesses because their financial results are so stable 
While two of the company s major capital projects have experienced delays and cost overruns  read my thesis for more information   I do not believe they impair Southern s long term earnings power 
As seen below  the company has recorded stable profits for more than a decade  Earnings fell by less than 10  during the financial crisis as well because people continued to need electricity to power their homes Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Earnings stability has resulted in a consistent payout ratio  The following chart shows that Southern s payout ratio has generally remained between 70  and 80  for the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking ahead  the company s projected payout ratio based on analysts  earnings estimates and SO s current dividend per share is 79   75   and 72  in 2016  2017  and 2018  respectively 
In other words  more of the same is expected from the company over the next few years  Since the business is recession resistant  income investors don t need to worry much about Southern s elevated payout ratio 
Return on invested capital  ROIC  is another important metric to analyze when it comes to evaluating dividend safety  ROIC measures how efficiently a company utilizes its assets 
Companies with higher returns can compound their earnings faster and often have competitive advantages  I like to invest in businesses with high and steady returns 
Regulated utilities act like monopolies in their service areas  but their rates are regulated  capping profitability 
As seen below  Southern generates a moderate but predictable mid single digit return on invested capital  The dip in fiscal year 2013  FY13  was due to write offs on its capital projects  but the favorable regulatory environment in its key states has helped it earn somewhat higher returns than many other utility companies 
As Southern s large projects go live over the next five years  ROIC should edge higher and cash flow generation will improve Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Beyond payout ratios  business stability  and asset efficiency  a company s balance sheet makes a major impact on dividend safety 
Utilities are capital intensive businesses and require a lot of debt to build and maintain their costly infrastructure 
Companies will always make their debt and interest payments before declaring dividends 
Businesses with high debt levels can be at greater risk of cutting their dividend if they unexpectedly fall on hard times  During such periods  earnings can be significantly reduced and existing cash must be preserved 
Southern s balance sheet took on an additional  8 billion in debt to finance the company s acquisition of AGL Resources 
Once the company reports results next quarter  its cash balance will fall by around  8 billion  leaving the business with under  2 billion in its bank account compared to roughly  38 billion in total debt 
Several credit agencies downgraded Southern s debt ratings and outlook because of the company s higher financial leverage resulting from its acquisition of AGL 
Moody s slightly downgraded the company s credit rating to Baa2  which indicates  average creditworthiness relative to other domestic issuers   S P also lowered its outlook on the company but continues to assign it an investment grade rating 
While Southern will need to improve its leverage ratios over the coming years  it s important to recognize the benefits AGL Resources brings 
Gas distribution is a fairly low risk business  and AGL operates in environments mostly characterized by supportive regulations  Southern s increased scale and revenue diversity also lower risk 
I expect Southern s debt ratios to improve over the next few years as management integrates AGL and works on completing several major construction projects 
Until then  the company s consistent earnings should more than support its ongoing cash needs Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  it s always worth reviewing a company s recent sales and earnings trends to make sure no surprises are brewing 
Southern Company reported earnings on July 27  Sales grew 2 7  compared to the prior year quarter  and adjusted earnings per share increased by roughly 4  
The company s acquisition of AGL Resources closed on July 1  so all attention will turn to integrating the business and positioning it for growth 
All things considered  Southern s dividend payment is very secure  The company s scale  recession resistant services  favorable regulatory environments  improved diversification  AGL acquisition   and proven commitment to continue paying and growing its dividend more than offset any worries about its elevated payout ratio and balance sheet Closing Thoughts on Southern s DividendSouthern Company is one of the most reliable dividend paying stocks in the market  The company s acquisition of AGL Resources stretches the balance sheet but provides healthy diversification by customer type  geography  and regulatory body 
As long as the company s major capital projects don t experience any more negative developments and merger integration work remains on track  Southern should continue to provide stability for years to come  With a healthy dividend yield of 4 3  and the potential for 3 5  annual dividend growth going forward  Southern Company is a favorite investment for retired income investors 
The stock doesn t look particularly cheap with a forward P E ratio of 18 0  but the dividend should remain solid ",2016-09-08,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-southern-company's-dividend-still-safe-200152550,200152550

176758,398274,SO,Special Report  China s vast fleet is tipping the balance in the Pacific,news,By David Lague and Benjamin Kang Lim TAIPEI  Reuters    A generation ago  from mid 1995 into early 1996

central to President Xi Jinping s bold bid to make China the preeminent military power in the region  In raw numbers  the PLA navy now has the world s biggest fleet  It is also growing faster than any other major navy   We thought China would be a great pushover for way too long  and so we let them start the naval arms race while we dawdled   said James Holmes  a professor at the U S  Naval War College and a former U S  Navy surface warfare officer  China s Ministry of National Defense  the U S  Indo Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters  For the United States  the stakes are now much higher in any operation to support its regional allies  including Japan and Taiwan  America now faces daunting obstacles to any efforts to reinforce heavily outgunned Taiwan in a crisis  Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is currently building an amphibious force that could give it the capacity to launch an invasion of the island  Senior Asian defense and security officials say the PLA s naval advances have introduced a new uncertainty in such scenarios  If Beijing can sow serious doubt about whether Washington will intervene against China  it would undermine the value of U S  security guarantees in Asia  In November  a bipartisan commission set up by Congress to review the Trump administration s national defense strategy reported that in a war with China over Taiwan   Americans could face a decisive military defeat   RAPID EXPANSION As China gains confidence that it can dominate its near seas  it intends to challenge the dominance of the U S  Navy in distant waters  too  in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean  according to U S and Chinese military officials  Satellite imagery of Chinese dockyards  reports in China s state controlled media and assessments of U S  and other foreign naval experts show the PLA navy is expanding as fast as shipyards can weld hulls together  This emerging blue water fleet was just a dream for the early commanders of the communist navy born in 1949  during the closing stages of the nation s civil war  Then  the People s Liberation Army assembled a motley collection of conscripted fishing boats and vessels defecting from the Nationalists  Since 2014  China has launched more warships  submarines  support ships and major amphibious vessels than the entire number of ships now serving in the United Kingdom s fleet  according to an analysis from the London based International Institute for Strategic Studies published in May last year  Between 2015 and 2017  China launched almost 400 000 tonnes of naval vessels  about twice the output of U S  shipyards in that period  the IISS said  The PLA navy now has about 400 warships and submarines  according to U S  and other Western naval analysts  By 2030  the Chinese navy could have more than 530 warships and submarines  according to a projection in a 2016 U S  Naval War College study  A shrunken and overworked U S  Navy  which has ruled the oceans virtually unchallenged since the end of the Cold War  had 288 warships and submarines at the end of March  according to the Pentagon  Globally  the U S  Navy remains the dominant maritime force  the power that keeps the peace and maintains freedom of navigation on the high seas  Chinese military and political figures say that while their nation s fleet has more ships  America has more powerful ones  and overall supremacy at sea   The Chinese navy is at least three decades behind the United States   a retired Chinese naval officer told Reuters  requesting anonymity   It is too early for the United States to fret   China  however  has established dominance in the waters closest to its coast  ENDING CHINA S HUMILIATION The regular  highly publicized launch of new warships is a powerful political weapon for Xi Jinping  For a domestic audience  modern aircraft carriers  destroyers and submarines are hard evidence that what Xi describes as the  Chinese dream   his vision of a strong  rejuvenated nation  is becoming reality  Almost immediately after taking power in late 2012  Xi began a series of high profile visits to naval bases and voyages at sea on sleek  new warships  In documentary footage and news reports  he is piped aboard to the salutes of immaculately turned out officers and crew  Underway  he peers into the distance from the bridge through bulky naval binoculars  climbs ladders between decks and shares meals with sailors  Last spring  he watched a giant exercise in the South China Sea  where a flotilla of 48 warships assembled in formation  Half of these vessels had been commissioned since Xi took power  state controlled media reported  The highlight was the launch of jet fighters from China s first aircraft carrier  the 60 000 tonne Liaoning  a refurbished Soviet era flat top that has served as a test bed for carrier operations  The Chinese navy has launched a second carrier as well  which is now in sea trials and expected to join the fleet this year  according to U S  officials  A key message in the official coverage of Xi s voyages  A vigilant navy under his command will guard against a repeat of the century of humiliation that began with the First Opium War in 1839  and during which European colonial powers and Japanese invaders took cruel advantage of a vulnerable China  Every Chinese school child learns that China s suffering arose partly because of the lack of a modern navy  Infamously  in the final years of the Qing Dynasty  the Empress Dowager diverted funds earmarked for naval modernization to building a new Summer Palace  This contributed to China s heavy defeat in the 1894 95 war with Japan  in which a rising Japanese navy smashed the Chinese fleet  While Beijing s repeated references to these past humiliations have propaganda value  invasion is now regarded as a highly unlikely threat  according to military strategy documents published by the Chinese government  Instead  China needs to prepare for high intensity conflict in its near seas  these documents say  It is not spelled out exactly how these conflicts would arise  But officers from the U S  and other foreign militaries say they have no doubt Beijing is referring to clashes over Taiwan or disputed territories in China s near seas  This strategy is driving a shift away from Beijing s traditional emphasis on land forces  It marks a historic transformation for an ancient continental power that for millenia feared armies encroaching overland from the north and west  Xi has elevated the status of the navy within what is the world s biggest military  In an unprecedented move for what has been an army dominated force  a senior naval officer  Vice Admiral Yuan Yubai  was appointed in 2017 to head China s Southern  NYSE SO  Theater Command  one of the country s five regional commands  Under Xi  the Communist Party has also opened the funding tap  Between 2015 and 2021  total military outlays are projected to jump 55 percent from  167 9 billion to  260 8 billion  according to a report last year that the U S  China Economic and Security Review Commission ordered from Jane s By IHS Markit  a defense information company  Over the same period  the navy s share of this budget is expected to increase 82 percent  from  31 4 billion to  57 1 billion  the report said  The Chinese leader has set a clear direction for the navy to become a truly global force that would protect the country s vast seaborne trade and expanding international interests  In its 2015 White Paper on defense  China said its navy would gradually shift its focus from defending its offshore waters to operations in the open seas  For now  many of China s warships are smaller vessels  including a big fleet of fast missile attack craft  But Chinese shipyards are launching surface warships that are closing the gap in size  quality  and capability with the best of their foreign counterparts  according to interviews with veterans of the U S   Taiwanese and Australian navies  China s big fleet of conventional and nuclear submarines is also improving rapidly  they say  By 2020  the PLA navy will boast more big surface warships and submarines than the Russian navy  the former head of the U S  Pacific Command  Admiral Harry Harris  told a congressional committee last year  Some American naval experts believe China could achieve rough parity with the U S  Navy in numbers and quality of major surface warships by 2030  Crucially  the Chinese navy already has an edge in hitting power  according to senior officers from the U S  and other regional navies  The best Chinese destroyers  frigates  fast attack craft and submarines are armed with anti ship missiles that in most cases far outrange and outperform those on U S  warships  these officers say  A DIFFERENT WAR This firepower explains why Washington keeps its carriers at a distance  The last U S  carrier to pass through the Taiwan Strait was the now decommissioned USS Kitty Hawk  which made a transit with its battle group in late 2007 after being denied a port visit to Hong Kong  The U S  Navy and other foreign navies still sail near the Chinese mainland  But they avoid overt shows of force that would increase the risk of clashes with modern Chinese warships and submarines  Retired U S  Navy carrier fleet officers say that in recent years the Pentagon has also avoided sending carriers to the Yellow Sea between the Korean Peninsula and the Chinese mainland  amid repeated Chinese warnings  An example of China s determination to control its near waters came this month  when a French warship passed through the Taiwan Strait  After the April 6 transit of the frigate Vendemiaire  China informed Paris that France was no longer welcome to attend celebrations last week to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese communist navy  U S  officials told Reuters  Veteran U S  Navy officers predict any serious conflict with China off its coast would be bloody  The United States and its allies would risk heavy losses and possible defeat  they say  This type of conflict would be vastly different from the wars the United States has been fighting in the Middle East and Afghanistan  There  America enjoyed unchallenged air and sea superiority and unimpeded logistics  said Gary Roughead  co chairman of a 2018 review of the Trump administration s defense strategy  Today  heavy damage to or losses of American warships or major bases is a real but underappreciated possibility for the United States in a conflict with China  said Roughead  the former Chief of Naval Operations  the top job in the U S  Navy   We have not thought about the significant capital losses that will occur   and the American people not being prepared for that   he said in an interview with Reuters   Those are significant factors in the win loss equation   Chinese military veterans and people with ties to the ruling Communist Party leadership say China s new naval muscle is defensive in nature  It is essential  they say  to counter a hostile United States that sees China as an enemy   Without air and sea domination  Chinese naval vessels will just be targets in the event of conflict   said a retired PLA officer   For Southeast Asian neighbors  China s navy may be intimidating  but its prowess is limited to waters near the country s shores and too early to be a force to be reckoned with in the open sea   The PLA navy is growing and improving  and in sheer numbers of vessels  exceeds its American rival  But China still falls well short of overall U S  naval power  With 11 aircraft carriers  88 powerful surface warships and 69 nuclear powered submarines  America deploys the mightiest fleet and is likely to maintain a technological edge for some time  according to U S  and Chinese military officials  In response to the challenge from China and a resurgent Russian navy  the Pentagon is rebuilding its fleet and accelerating development of new weapons  including the urgent introduction of longer range missiles  The United States aims to deploy a 355 strong fleet by 2034  according to the Trump administration s 2020 budget proposal documents  And key U S  allies Japan  South Korea and Australia are upgrading their navies with new  advanced warships and submarines  China also faces challenges in its drive to become a global naval power  Chinese and foreign naval experts warn that Beijing faces a colossal funding burden as it adds multiple warships to its fleet  Typically  navies wind up paying the initial price of building a warship three times over its service life  if maintenance and refitting costs are included  according to shipbuilders  In some vital naval technologies  China is struggling to catch up  Chinese shipyards still rely on foreign suppliers for some engines  weapons and sensors  according to global arms trade registers  High profile arrests of suspected Chinese spies accused of stealing military secrets in the United States suggest China s navy has shortcomings in radars  underwater sensors and other electronic technologies  The PLA navy is well behind the U S  and other navies in anti submarine warfare  a serious deficiency  according to Chinese and Western military experts  Most Western military analysts also believe the Chinese navy lacks the amphibious capability to invade Taiwan   the vessels and skills to reach the island by sea and then put boots on the ground  A VAST UNSINKABLE CARRIER However  when it comes to dominating its near seas  China doesn t need to match the U S  ship for ship  The U S  Navy is a globe spanning force with offshore bases and multiple missions  including supporting Middle East operations  bolstering European allies  countering Russia s naval revival and safeguarding global shipping routes  To do this job  the U S  Navy has to dominate virtually all the world s oceans  In contrast  the entire Chinese fleet is based on the mainland coast  This means it has the advantage of being the home team  Without major global military responsibilities  the PLA navy can concentrate virtually all its forces in its coastal waters  flooding the zone inside what Beijing refers to as  the first island chain   the arc that runs through the nearby major islands of the Japanese archipelago  Taiwan  the Philippines and Borneo  In a conflict in these near seas  the Chinese mainland would function as a vast  unsinkable aircraft carrier  China s warships would be close to logistical support and the firepower of land based missiles and strike aircraft  These forces would seek to overwhelm enemy warships with volleys of missiles and torpedoes from multiple directions  U S  and Chinese military analysts say  Most of this firepower was unavailable to Beijing when President Bill Clinton deployed the two carrier battle groups off Taiwan in early 1996  China s obsolete navy  geared for coastal defense  was powerless to respond  and Beijing could only watch helplessly as the Taiwanese vote went ahead  This humiliation was a turning point  Chinese and Western navy officers say  Stung  China ordered from Russia two powerful destroyers armed with supersonic anti ship missiles that could take out American carriers and other warships  Two more arrived later from a subsequent order  Then China s naval shipyards started cranking  Satellite imagery of the key yards at Shanghai  Dalian  Guangzhou and Wuhan show them almost continuously crowded with warships and submarines at different stages of construction  Since June 2017  Chinese shipyards have launched four heavily armed Type 055 cruisers  which U S  and Chinese military officials say are a match for any modern warship  Multiple warships can be seen under construction in one section of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai in April 2018  including Type 055 cruisers and Type 052D destroyers  advanced surface warships armed with long range missiles for attacking naval and airborne targets  The first Type 055 cruiser  the 10 000 tonne Nanchang  has completed most of its sea trials and will soon join the fleet  the Chinese military said on April 25  It will deliver a major boost to China s naval firepower when fully operational  And the PLA is building a force of modern  amphibious heavy lift vessels that in time could allow Beijing to mount a landing on Taiwan or disputed territories such as the Japanese controlled Senkaku Islands  known as the Diaoyu Islands in China  The PLA is also training an expanded force of marines for amphibious landings  China s marines are expected to be a 30 000 strong force by 2020  according to the Pentagon s annual report on Chinese military power released in August  On February 27  China s second aircraft carrier put to sea from Dalian for its fifth round of sea trials  according to reports in the official media  With the still unnamed carrier now close to joining the fleet  the PLA navy celebrated its anniversary on April 23 with a multinational naval display off the North Sea Fleet headquarters at Qingdao  Xi Jinping was on hand as the Nanchang made its first public appearance with the fleet ,2019-04-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/special-report-chinas-vast-fleet-is-tipping-the-balance-in-the-pacific-1850520,1850520

176777,398293,SO,4 Things To Watch When Kinder Morgan Reports On Wednesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Energy infrastructure giant Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI  reports on Wednesday  July 20  after the close 


1  Revenue and Earnings forecast
Kinder Morgan s forecast for Q2 2016 is  0 15 EPS on  3 51B expected  Meeting analyst expectations would mean Kinder Morgan has managed to regain the sort of EPS numbers it reported during Q2 last year  after its disappointing marginal results at the end of 2015  when the company reported EPS of  0 08 and   0 33 for Q3 and Q4  respectively 

2  Crushing Debt
The biggest threat Kinder Morgan currently faces is  without doubt  the massive amount of debt is has taken on  While debt isn t usually a major issue when it contributes to growth  it becomes more difficult to deal with when corporate strategy doesn t go according to plan  For energy companies  the plunge in oil and gas prices to historically low levels was surely not what anyone expected 
According to its Q1 release  Kinder Morgan had over  43B of outstanding debt  down just 3  from Q1 2015  when its liability was  45B  Kinder Morgan s EBITDA of  4 5B TTM means that the company is highly leveraged  Its Debt to EBIDTA ratio of 9 5 is a huge red flag  In comparison  one of Kinder s main competitors  Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD   which is 25  larger than KMI based on market cap  has approximately half the debt  and a Debt to EBIDTA ratio of 6 4  That s still high  but EPD s numbers underscore just how perilous the financial situation is for KMI 

3  Positive Steps To Reduce Its Debt
Fortunately  it appears that Kinder Morgan is finally keen on solving its debt problem  and has taken several positive steps over the past quarter  Less than two weeks ago  on July 10  the company  a  4 15B deal with Southern Company  NYSE SO   regarding Kinder s Southern Natural Gas pipeline  a 7 600 system which connects 4 supply basins in the US south with markets in Louisiana  Alabama  Florida  Georgia  South Carolina and Tenessee 
According to the terms of the deal  Southern will pay  1 47B in cash and assume  2 68B in debt for a 50  stake in the pipeline  In addition  Southern will participate in 50  of future capital expenditure costs 
On top of this deal  Kinder sold a 50  stake in its Ohio based Utopia pipeline to the Riverstone Investment Group for a 50  reimbursement of previous capex costs as well as half of the pipeline s funding costs going forward  The total project cost is estimated to be  500M  Additionally  50  of yet another pipeline  Parkway  has been sold to refining company Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   for an undisclosed sum of cash 
These three deals  as well as the fact that KMI canceled the planned construction of several other pipelines  prove that the company is appropriately focusing on its massive debt load  and actively trying to unload it from its balance sheet  That s always a good sign from an investor perspective  signaling that the company is making moves to secure its future 

4  Whither KMI s dividend 
Kinder Morgan was once an attractive dividend payer  When oil prices plummeted  Kinder s shares fell in conjunction  raising its dividend yield to a rich 7 8  
Unfortunately  the plunge also hurt KMI s profitability  and Kinder could no longer pay as big a dividend  On October 21  2015  the company began scaling back promises for 2016 dividends  eventually slashing the payout by 75  this past December 
The uncertainty surrounding its dividend  and the eventual cut  caused the stock to fall by 50  from  31 in October to  15 on December 8th  the day the cut was announced  The company is still trying to recover 
Nevertheless  to its credit  KMI has continued to pay some dividend  currently  0 125 quarterly  It s a smart gesture aimed at current and future investors  showing that Kinder Morgan is still committed to shareholders  And this quarter is especially important because of Kinder s payout ratio 
Because the company hands out a quarterly dividend  it must make a higher EPS number to show that the dividend is sustainable  Last quarter s EPS was  0 12  pushing the payout ratio above 100   While a quarter or two above 100  isn t always catastrophic  for a highly leveraged company that has already hurt shareholder confidence with a dividend cut  it is critical to be able to report an EPS numbers above the dividend threshold 
 Conclusion
We believe investors should take a wait and see approach  Kinder Morgan management is taking favorable steps to try and secure the future of the company  but they did surprise shareholders with the harshness of the dividend cut in December 
Like the entire energy sector overall  Kinder Morgan s situation is also dependent on the price of oil price  which for now has stabilized around  45  The company is headed in the right direction  but these are early stages  The risk reward proposition for Kinder Morgan will be more positive once the company re establishes EPS growth ",2016-07-20,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-things-to-watch-when-kinder-morgan-reports-on-wednesday-200142900,200142900
176778,398294,SO,3 ETFs In Focus As Kinder Morgan s Top Line Fails To Impress,opinion,"Shares of Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI    a leading energy transportation and storage company  declined 2 04  to  21 64 in after hours trading following a decline in the company s second quarter revenues  which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company maintain its dividend and reported in line earnings per share for the quarter 
Q2 Earnings in Detail

176803,398319,SO, Don t shoot yourself in the foot   Inside Mexico s campaign to save NAFTA,news,"By Dave Graham MEXICO CITY  Reuters    In April 2017  a group of Mexican executives filed into the Texas governor s mansion in Austin for a meeting they hoped would help save a trillion dollar trade deal  They had a simple pitch for their audience   Republican Governor Greg Abbott  a handful of business leaders and some party donors  it would be in Texas  best interest to preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Abbott was just one of the prominent names on a list of dozens of American politicians and business executives that Mexico would carefully compile to help save NAFTA from the relentless attacks of U S  President Donald Trump  Supplying them with up to date information on trade and investment flows  the Mexicans believed the Americans could persuade policymakers that scrapping NAFTA would hurt U S  workers and companies   Graphic    Rather than  be good to Mexico   said Juan Gallardo  a prominent Mexican businessman who helped craft the strategy  the message was  don t shoot yourself in the foot   The inside story of Mexico s efforts to stop Trump from killing NAFTA   and to preserve its essence in a reworked accord   comes from interviews with more than 20 Mexican and U S  officials  lawmakers and executives involved in the process  After 18 months of talks and concessions by both sides  a deal was struck  Canada later signed on in what became known as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA   which awaits ratification by lawmakers in the three countries  But final approval has become more uncertain since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives from Republicans  a potential setback to Mexico s best laid plans  GIVING GROUND Mexican business and political leaders  including the heads of the foreign and economy ministries  started scrambling to save the 25 year old trade deal right after Trump s election in November 2016  Early on  they decided to avoid public confrontation with Trump  who had made blaming NAFTA for job losses  particularly in manufacturing  a centerpiece of his campaign   Tit for tat wasn t going to work   said Moises Kalach  head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico s CCE business lobby   We agreed not to even get into the ring   Trump showed no sign of backing off after taking office in January 2017  telling aides he wanted to withdraw simultaneously from NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP   according to three Mexican business and government leaders  When Trump pulled out of TPP that month  Mexican officials feared NAFTA would be next  In Mexico City  then foreign minister Luis Videgaray and his counterpart in the economy ministry  Ildefonso Guajardo  flew to Washington to sketch out possible concessions for an overhauled trade pact   Meeting with Trump s economic advisors and his son in law Jared Kushner  they floated stricter content rules for auto manufacturing  tougher Mexican labor laws and changes to dispute resolution mechanisms  Mexican participants said  Those early concessions would eventually evolve into new rules set out in the USMCA deal   I m absolutely convinced that if that didn t happen     NAFTA would have died in January 2017   Videgaray told Reuters shortly before leaving office  While Videgaray dangled concessions  Mexico s private sector rolled out a lobbying operation underpinned by reams of data supplied by IQOM  a Mexican trade consultancy  Headquartered in an old stone townhouse in Mexico City  IQOM collected data and intelligence to pinpoint U S  businesses with the most to lose from a NAFTA repeal  Two top Mexican negotiators of the original NAFTA  Herminio Blanco and Jaime Zabludovsky  spearheaded the effort  It was  a permanent  online  computer based information gathering drive   said IQOM partner Zabludovsky   And a lot of data crunching   Meanwhile  the CCE hired Washington lobbying firm Akin Gump in the summer of 2017 to help identify about 250 potential U S  allies  Gallardo said  Akin Gump and the CCE communicated daily and met regularly  The idea was to  engage with USMCA stakeholders on both sides of the aisle and in the Trump administration   an Akin Gump spokesperson said  and build  CCE s brand and reputation as a trusted partner   Throughout the process  Mexican negotiators were in close contact with their Canadian counterparts   even as Mexico also left the door open to a bilateral deal with the United States  EYE OPENER During negotiations  Mexico s private sector had some 200 representatives in Washington updating its negotiators on how best to pitch the case to U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  according to sources involved in the process  Each member of Mexico s team also had politicians or executives to target  Kalach of the CCE said he spoke to 36 U S  state governors about the value of cross border trade  Mexican participants often expressed surprise about how little U S  politicians knew about the extent of bilateral economic ties  Even in Texas  the state doing the most trade with Mexico  some officials appeared not to have grasped fully what a NAFTA termination could cost  Gallardo said  At the April 2017 meeting in the governor s mansion  the Mexican delegation gave a detailed breakdown of trade between Mexico and Texas to Abbott and the others  who included Gerardo Schwebel  executive vice president of the International Bank of Commerce  and oil tycoon Paul Foster  sources said  Economic ties were explained  by players  by amounts   Gallardo said   That was an eye opener    no one had ever put that together into one paper   Abbott eventually sent a letter to Lighthizer defending NAFTA   emphasizing that Texas exported more than  90 billion of goods to Mexico annually and that nearly a million jobs depended on free trade with the NAFTA partners  In a second letter to Lighthizer  Abbott asked the Trump administration to  reconsider  its demand for a sunset clause that could have killed the new agreement in five years  a major Mexican concern  In the end  the clause was left out  John Wittman  a spokesman for Abbott  confirmed the Austin meeting  adding that the governor had been engaged with various stakeholders and White House officials throughout NAFTA talks  Lighthizer s office did not respond to a request for comment  HELP FROM WALL STREET High among the list of prospective allies drawn up by Mexico were several top Wall Street executives  including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Blackstone s Stephen Schwarzman and KKR s Henry Kravis  Dimon chairs the Business Roundtable  which  with the U S  Chamber of Commerce  was viewed by the Mexicans as a powerful voice in support of NAFTA  The banking executive proved particularly effective  Mexican and U S  sources said  Among others  a source familiar with the situation said  Dimon met with Kushner  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn  Trump s chief economic adviser until April 2018  Calling Mexico a peaceful neighbor  Dimon publicly argued a trade agreement would help  ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti American leaders   Mnuchin held multiple meetings with counterparts  and offered his input to Lighthizer as he negotiated USMCA  a U S  Treasury official said  Mnuchin sees Canada and Mexico as important trading partners  and believes free and fair trade with them benefits the United States  the official added  The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the meetings  Representatives for Cohn  Schwarzman and Kravis declined to comment or did not reply to requests for one  Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  Chief Executive Officer Pat Ottensmeyer  whose company runs trains through Mexico  was a staunch advocate for NAFTA in the United States  and also consulted with top level Mexican officials  Between Trump s inauguration and the end of 2018  Kansas City Southern  NYSE SO  said it had organized or participated in 65 meetings with lawmakers or regulators  as well as 76 speeches or conferences in defense of NAFTA  Ottensmeyer recalled speaking to several cabinet members  including Lighthizer and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  when he was still head of the CIA  The approach was to  literally talk to anybody and everybody who we thought was willing to listen and could be influential in the process   Ottensmeyer told Reuters  A representative for Pompeo declined to comment  Within months  Mexico s lobbying efforts began paying dividends  American politicians and business executives were making a case for NAFTA directly to the White House  pushing back on Trump s ongoing threats to rip up NAFTA

176805,398321,SO,Match fixing not doping poses greatest risk to sport,news,"By Steve Keating TORONTO  Reuters    Two of the men that put the doping crisis in the global spotlight say the integrity of sport now faces a greater threat from match fixing than drug cheats  Richard McLaren  who authored a 2016 report into state sponsored Russian doping and David Howman  a former director general of the World Anti Doping Agency  WADA   painted an alarming picture about match fixing at the Symposium on Match Manipulation and Gambling in Sport in Toronto on Wednesday and Thursday   McLaren  a Canadian law professor and CEO of McLaren Global Sport Solutions  told Reuters that doping and match fixing combined were the two biggest issues affecting the integrity of sport   Yet manipulating outcomes was a bigger problem  he said    What makes sport different than entertainment is unpredictability  Fixing results removes the greatest and most important characteristic  that unpredictability   he added    If it loses unpredictability because of fixed results the passion for sport is diminished and that is a much bigger issue   Match fixing has become increasingly pervasive in recent years across a number of sports   More tennis players  for example  were disciplined for violations of anti corruption rules in 2018 than in any other year in the last 10   nL8N1Z958H  A number of cases in other sports have also brought renewed attention to the issue   Recent punishments include the banning of a soccer referee for life in February for accepting bribes to manipulate matches  nL5N20L7AM  and the suspension of two snooker players for fixing the outcome of matches or failing to report a corrupt approach   nL5N2017A3   CRIME SYNDICATES  Organized crime has been the driving force behind sports corruption  according to Howman  and the globalization of sports betting has allowed crime syndicates extend their reach and match manipulation expertise   I have done a lot of work in the general sport integrity area and I can quote you what I am told by people who work in that more general business  including enforcement agents  and they all say the biggest threat to sport integrity is organized crime   Howman  a New Zealand based barrister who was director general at WADA from 2003 to 2016 and now serves as the chair of the Athletics Integrity Unit  told Reuters    We saw it coming at WADA and I raised it during my term there as a significant issue that needed to be countered by world sport  because the bad guys involved in pushing dope and steroids are the same bad guys involved in match manipulation   Andy Cunningham  director of integrity services for Sportradar  a company that monitors betting patterns and offers intelligence to over 100 sports governing bodies  said exact figures for how much is bet on sport are at best a  guesstimate    Interpol  however  set the figure at  500 billion a year  Operating in every corner of the globe  match fixers work to manipulate the outcome of everything from World Cup matches to the lower rungs of the International Tennis Federation s  ITF  Futures tournaments  Sportradar reported in 2015 it had identified as many as 60 fixed matches in the Canadian Soccer League  CSL   a small league operating mostly in Southern  NYSE SO  Ontario with few supporters that was for years the target of Asian match fixers   In the most recent Sportradar report  Cunningham said the CSL had largely cleaned up its act and Asian bookmakers had lost interest  Yet the CSL is an example of just how far the tentacles of gambling syndicates reach  Whether it is an under 16 soccer international or a lower level tennis match  the targets for match fixers are often amateurs or the less well paid in professional sport  NO GLOBAL AGENCY  McLaren pointed to an ITF commissioned report that found only 600 of the nearly 14 000 players competing in ITF competitions made enough money to cover their costs  providing an impoverished pool of athletes for fixers to target  There is no global agency in place to fight corruption in sport in the way WADA was set up to combat doping and nor  according to Howman  is there ever likely to be such an organization  Instead the fight is being left to often ill equipped individual sporting bodies  governments and law enforcement agencies   Everyone is resisting another WADA   said Howman   They don t want to have an independent body taking control over their fiefdoms and they don t want to see another fall like a Russian fall and that would be likely if you had a world anti corruption unit or whatever you wanted to call it   What I think will occur is step by step  Tennis is confronting it now  cricket has confronted it  There are sports where there is already entrenched match fixing

176806,398322,SO,Bolsonaro s sons bash vice president  widening rifts in Brazil government,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    A barrage of criticism this week from the sons of Brazil s right wing President Jair Bolsonaro aimed at the vice president has laid bare stark divisions in his cabinet  raising serious concerns from senior members of his four month old government  People close to the president say the retired military officers who make up a third of Bolsonaro s 21 member cabinet fear the attacks on Vice President Hamilton Mourao  a former general  are threatening to derail an uphill effort to pass the president s economic reform agenda   We are wasting time  The economy is at a standstill  unemployment is increasing and people are discussing such nonsense   a senior official in the government told Reuters  requesting he not be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  Bolsonaro s sons Carlos and Eduardo  among the president s four sons and a daughter from three marriages  have accused Mourao of disloyalty and criticized him on social media and in the press   Mourao is the most outspoken of the former generals in Brazil s government  His more pragmatic approach on foreign affairs and hot button cultural issues has drawn the ire of the president s hardline conservative advisers   including his sons  Even for a country with a long history of political dynasties  the unprecedented influence of the president s family and open sparring with a formal adviser have stymied observers   Political clans have held sway in Brazilian state politics  but we have never seen a family dominate the federal government this way before  or attack the vice president like this   said Carlos Couto  a politics professor at think tank FGV  Carlos dos Santos Cruz  a former general in a cabinet level position overseeing communications and congressional relations  downplayed the divisions in the government and chalked the clamor up to a new media environment   The internet is an open channel  It s different from when you had traditional media and the campaign ended   he said   Now the campaign continues  Everyone keeps debating  fighting  criticizing  Those that helped in the campaign think they can keep giving their opinion in the government   SON CARLOS IS RIO COUNCILMAN Carlos Bolsonaro  a Rio de Janeiro city councilman behind the social media campaign that helped to elect his father  unloaded on Mourao via Twitter this week  questioning his loyalty and conservatism in nearly a dozen posts   Mourao the traitor   was the title of one video he retweeted  Another post criticized Mourao for saying that the Venezuelan opposition should not be armed because a civil war there would be  horrible for the Southern  NYSE SO  Hemisphere   Carlos Bolsonaro did not respond to questions from Reuters and shrugged off concerns in a Wednesday comment on Twitter   I m not attacking anyone  they are just things that happened that I would like to keep sharing with friends    Mourao and his allies have pushed back against sharp policy shifts proposed by Eduardo Bolsonaro  a lawmaker advising his father on foreign affairs  and Foreign Minister Ernesto de Araujo  who have pushed for Brazilian diplomacy to hew closer to the U S  line on Venezuela  Israel and China  Mourao dismissed the idea of a military intervention in Venezuela s political crisis  floated by U S  President Donald Trump  after a White House news conference where Bolsonaro did not rule out the possibility  He also urged Bolsonaro not to move Brazil s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem  as the United States did  because it would threaten Arab markets for billions of dollars of halal meat exports  Business leaders praised Mourao for working to strengthen ties with China after Bolsonaro railed on the campaign trail against Chinese investors  That moderating influence and centrist appeal have enraged presidential advisers who see Mourao undercutting Bolsonaro s conservative turn in favor of his own presidential ambitions  Asked if the social media attacks on the vice president were a distraction  Eduardo Bolsonaro flipped the question   What s causing a lot of noise are the successive declarations by the vice president in contradiction of the president of the republic   he told newspaper O Estado de S Paulo   If he is a soldier for the president  then things will fall into place   Mourao kept silent this week  preferring not to add fuel to the fire  But in February he told Reuters that the president had to rein in his sons after Carlos Bolsonaro called one minister a liar  sparking a crisis that led to the first exit from the cabinet  With the government struggling to build a congressional coalition to approve a landmark social security reform  allies warn the president needs to put an end to the friendly fire  The vice president and his allies in the government fear that the president s silence means his sons and fellow hardliners may be gaining the upper hand  according to sources   The military in the government are unhappy  because they are seeing mistakes made and they are not being listened to

176835,398351,SO,Income Yielding Equity Sector Valuations Near Historical Highs,opinion,"Towards the end of 2015 and far ahead of the Brexit induced market downturn  investors began to seek the apparent safety of income yielding equities  The initial motivation for this seems to have been investors seeking yield outside of fixed income where yield seems hard to find in this low interest rate environment  The consequence of this pursuit of yield is the valuation of some of the defensive  income yielding sectors has been pushed to extremes  This move towards higher valuations has been exacerbated by the Brexit outcome  One example of this is the utility sector 
The below chart displays the performance of the S P 500 Index sectors for the year to date period through June 27  2016  Three of the top performing sectors are viewed as defensive ones and tend to be comprised of companies that pay and grow their dividends  i e   utilities  telecom and consumer staples sectors  The top performing sector is utilities garnering a return of 19 8  so far this year  
Of importance  investors should keep in mind the utility sector is trading at a near record valuation based on the sector s forward price to earnings ratio of 17 8 times  blue line   
Other sectors such as consumer staples and energy also trade at higher valuations or P E multiples as well  Yardeni Research updates sector valuations on a periodic basis and their most recent report can be   Sectors  and for that matter specific stocks  can remain elevated from a valuation perspective for an extended period of time  However  when rates rise and or a more risk on equity environment returns  these defensive sectors are likely to underperform 
S P Dow Jones Indices and Factset recently highlighted the continued growth in cash balances for S P 500 companies  A part of this cash growth has gone towards dividend payments and stock buybacks as I noted in a post yesterday  Stock Buybacks Up Double Digits In First Quarter  In  released today  they acknowledge the growth in cash levels  however  they also note the Cash to Debt Ratio for S P 500 companies  ex financials  has fallen to its lowest level since the second quarter of 2009  And back to utilities  six of the top ten companies with the lowest cash to debt ratios are utilities as can be seen in the below table  
There is more to valuation than simply looking at cash debt ratios  and utility rates are regulated and maybe more sustainable from that point of view  but higher demands on cash due to debt payments can become an issue for utility companies  Just last month Moody s downgraded the long term senior unsecured rating of The Southern Company  NYSE SO  to Baa2 from Baa1 due to increased debt levels and lower cash flow coverage resulting from an acquisition 
For investors pursuing investments in higher dividend yielding equity sectors  paying attention to valuations and coverage ratios is important  Additionally  not if  but when a risk on equity environment returns  these defensive  income yielding stocks could come under pressure ",2016-06-28,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/income-yielding-equity-sector-valuations-near-historical-highs-200138560,200138560

176842,398358,SO,Special Report  How China is replacing America as Asia s military titan,news,By David Lague and Benjamin Kang Lim HONG KONG  Reuters    In 1938  in the midst of a long campaign to bring China under Communist Party rule  revolutionary leader Mao Zedong wrote   Whoever has an army has power   Xi Jinping  Mao s latest successor  has taken that dictum to heart  He has donned camouflage fatigues  installed himself as commander in chief and taken control of the two million strong Chinese military  the People s Liberation Army  It is the biggest overhaul of the PLA since Mao led it to victory in the nation s civil war and founded the People s Republic in 1949  Xi has accelerated the PLA s shift to naval power from a traditionally land based force  He has broken up its vast  Maoist era military bureaucracy  A new chain of command leads directly to Xi as chairman of the Central Military Commission  China s top military decision making body  Operational leadership of naval  missile  air  ground and cyber forces has been separated from administration and training   a structure that Chinese and Western defense analysts say borrows from U S  military organization   See the interactive version    The Chinese leader isn t just revolutionizing the PLA  Xi is making a series of moves that are transforming both China and the global order  He has abandoned reform architect Deng Xiaoping s injunction that China should hide its strength and bide its time  The waiting game is over  Xi s speeches are peppered with references to his  Chinese dream   where an ancient nation recovers from the humiliation of foreign invasion and retakes its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia  The effort includes signature shows of soft power  Xi s multibillion dollar  Belt and Road  program to build a global trade and infrastructure network with China at its center  and his  Made in China 2025  plan to turn the country into a high tech manufacturing giant  But the boldest stroke is his expansion of China s hard power  through his remaking of the PLA  the world s largest fighting force  At the core of this vision of national renewal is a loyal  corruption free military that Xi demands must be prepared to fight and win  His push to project power abroad was accompanied by a power play at home  Xi has purged more than 100 generals accused of corruption or disloyalty  according to the official state controlled media  A raw demonstration of his authority came when state television broadcast a laudatory documentary series about the PLA   Strong Military   In one scene in the 2017 series  an elderly man sits in a military court at a desk marked  defendant   looking frail in a navy blue civilian jacket  It is Guo Boxiong  a former general and the most senior officer convicted in Xi s purge  He reads his confession to charges of bribery from a sheaf of papers gripped in both hands   The Central Military Commission dealt with my case completely correctly   says Guo  who had once served as vice chairman of the body   I must confess my guilt and take responsibility for it   Guo was sentenced to life in prison  In a series of stories  Reuters is exploring how the rapid and disruptive advance of Chinese hard power on Xi Jinping s watch has ended the era of unquestioned U S  supremacy in Asia  In just over two decades  China has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the U S  armory  China s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy  which now rules the waves in East Asia  Beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines  giving it a powerful second strike capability  And the PLA is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the South China Sea  while stepping up preparations to recover Taiwan  by force if necessary   THE U S  COULD LOSE  For the first time since Portuguese traders reached the Chinese coast five centuries ago  China has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast  Conflict between China and the United States in these waters would be destructive and bloody  particularly a clash over Taiwan  according to serving and retired senior American officers  And despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the Cold War  there would be no guarantee America would prevail   The U S  could lose   said Gary Roughead  co chair of a bipartisan review of the Trump administration s defense strategy published in November   We really are at a significant inflection point in history   Roughead is no armchair theorist  A retired admiral  as former Chief of Naval Operations he held the top job in the U S  Navy until 2011  His alarm reflects a growing view across the American defense establishment  In their report  he and his colleagues issued a dire warning  The United States faces a  national security crisis   principally arising from growing Chinese and Russian military power   U S  military superiority is no longer assured and the implications for American interests and American security are severe   the panel concluded  It is clear that Xi wants to bring the era of U S  dominance in Asia to an end   In the final analysis  it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia  solve the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia   he said in a 2014 speech to foreign leaders on regional security  China s Ministry of National Defense  the U S  Indo Pacific Command and the Pentagon did not respond to questions for this article or detailed summaries of its findings  This account of Xi and the PLA   which despite the  army  in its name comprises all military branches   is based on interviews with 17 current and former military officers from China  the United States  Taiwan and Australia  Many would only speak on condition of anonymity  It draws on the accounts of Chinese officials and people with ties to the senior leadership in Beijing who have known Xi Jinping and his family for decades and are familiar with his career as he rose through the party and government bureaucracy  It also relies on Chinese government publications describing Xi s political thinking  his speeches and official documentaries showcasing his leadership of the military  In Washington  the world s pre eminent military power is mobilizing to respond  After decades of seeking engagement in the expectation that Beijing would become a cooperative partner in world affairs  the United States is treating China as a strategic competitor bent on displacing it as Asia s dominant force  Largely in reaction to this challenge  Washington is boosting defense spending  rebuilding its navy and urgently developing new weapons  particularly longer range conventional missiles  It is expanding military ties with other regional powers  including Japan  South Korea  Taiwan  Australia  Singapore and India  And it s conducting an international diplomatic and intelligence campaign to counter China s cyber attacks  traditional espionage and intellectual property theft  This campaign includes efforts to contain the global reach of Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp  HK 0763   The confrontation comes as the administration of President Donald Trump is waging a tariff war aimed at reducing China s massive trade surplus with the United States  However the trade conflict is resolved  a graver risk is the possibility that the deeper tensions could boil over into an armed clash between Beijing and Washington and its allies in the hotly contested maritime zones off the Chinese coast  UNEXPECTED RISE The rise of the PLA is not all Xi s doing  Long before he took power  the military had been transformed from the massive but rudimentary land force that swept Mao and his comrades  including Xi s father  to victory over the Nationalists in 1949  Decades of steep increases in defense spending paid for an arsenal of high technology weapons  millions of soldiers were demobilized  But corruption became endemic  Xi s two predecessors  Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao  were civilians who took office without a network of support among PLA brass  They fostered loyalty through patronage  pay rises and budget increases  according to Chinese and Taiwanese analysts and retired officers  Under the weak leadership of Hu in particular  they say  senior officers exploited their positions to siphon off money  particularly from the logistic and equipment budgets  Rank buying became rampant  The military hierarchy Xi inherited had become a law unto itself under Hu  according to Li Nan  a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore   It was out of control  in a sense   said Li   Now the power is centralized in the hands of Xi Jinping   Xi  a so called princeling  grew up as a member of China s Communist Party aristocracy  even though his family suffered separation and persecution in Mao s chaotic Cultural Revolution  His late father  Xi Zhongxun  was a revolutionary military leader who became a top government official in the early years of Communist rule  He was later purged in Mao s upheavals  before emerging a key leader of China s market reforms in the 1980s  Xi s dramatic accumulation of power was unexpected  He took a low profile as he slowly worked his way up the Communist Party and state bureaucracy  according to multiple Chinese familiar with his early career  His first job out of university in 1979 was serving in a junior post as a uniformed aide to General Geng Biao  then minister of defense  Xi s official biography records this three year posting as  active duty   In this role  he had access to classified military documents  including files on the 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam  according to sources with ties to the leadership  He had to memorize hundreds of telephone numbers and was not allowed to rely on a telephone book  in case it was lost or stolen  they said  He then began a series of provincial government and party postings  In these roles  his performance was relatively unremarkable  As governor of the southeastern Province of Fujian  for instance  he was obsessed with the bureaucratic routine of political study sessions where officials review Communist Party documents and speeches of senior leaders  according to people who knew him at the time  And he was far from universally popular  He finished last in elections for alternate members of the party s 200 strong Central Committee during the 15th Communist Party Congress in 1997  This nondescript record appears to have worked in his favor  During his period as China s paramount leader  President Jiang Zemin handpicked Xi for senior office because the younger man was perceived to lack ambition  according to sources with close ties to the Chinese leadership  Xi was also thought to be a pliable candidate because he lacked a power base  one source said  speaking on condition of anonymity  But as China s top leader  he has shown a willingness to impose radical change at the top of the party  government and military   When I talk to my mainland friends  they all say he is a risk taker   said Andrew Yang Nien Dzu  former defense minister of Taiwan   You never know what his next move will be   XI THE SOLDIER From the beginning  Xi s corruption purge and promotion of loyal officers made it clear he had big plans for the PLA  Then  in mid 2015  he cut 300 000 mostly non combat and administrative personnel before launching a sweeping overhaul of the military structure  He broke up the four sprawling  Maoist era  general departments  of the PLA that had become powerful  highly autonomous and deeply corrupt  said Li from the National University of Singapore  Xi replaced them with 15 new agencies that report directly to the Central Military Commission he chairs  He also scrapped the seven geographically based military regions and replaced them with five joint service theater commands  These new regional commands  comparable to those that govern the U S  armed forces  are responsible for military operations and have a strong focus on combining air  land  naval and other capabilities of the Chinese armed forces to suit modern warfare  Xi also promoted favored commanders  many of them officers he knew in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces  where he served the bulk of his early career as an official  according to Chinese and Western observers of the PLA  Others hail from his home province of Shaanxi or are fellow princelings  At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017  Xi further tightened his grip over the top military leadership  paring the Central Military Commission from 11 members to seven and stacking it with loyalists  Xi knew most of them from Shaanxi and Fujian  As he burnishes his military credentials  Xi draws on his early service in uniform  In speeches to military audiences  he describes himself as a soldier turned official  according to reports in the state controlled media  In distinctive PLA camouflage fatigues  cap and combat boots  he has overseen some of the biggest military parades since the 1949 Communist victory  In the most recent of these displays  Xi has taken the salute from the troops without sharing the podium with the usual line up of fellow party leaders and elders  In a massive naval exercise in April last year  Xi boarded the guided missile destroyer Changsha to review the Chinese fleet of 48 warships in the South China Sea  State run television showed the navy commander  Vice Admiral Shen Jinlong  and navy political commissar  Vice Admiral Qin Shengxiang  standing to attention as they reported to Xi and saluted  Xi then gave the order for the exercise to proceed  Both navy chiefs are Xi prot g s  Shen has been rapidly promoted under Xi  leapfrogging other  more senior officers  according to Chinese and Western analysts  Qin had worked closely with the Chinese leader in a top post in the Central Military Commission before his promotion in 2017 to his navy role  China s official military media reported  Xi was also in fatigues again in July 2017 at a massive military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA at the Zhurihe training ground in Inner Mongolia  He took the salute from the parade commander  General Han Weiguo  an officer who served in Fujian while Xi was a party and government official in the province  Han has enjoyed a meteoric rise under Xi  being promoted to command China s ground forces shortly after this parade   Xi Jinping is obsessed with military parades   said Willy Lam Wo lap  a veteran observer of personnel movements in China s military and political elites and a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong   He loves these demonstrations of raw power   As part of Xi s martial image building  the party s propaganda machine portrays him as the leader responsible for a decisive pivot in China s recovery from foreign conquest and colonial domination that began with the First Opium War in the mid 19th Century  In the opening scenes of the  Strong Military  documentary  Xi is shown boarding the guided missile destroyer Haikou at Shekou port on December 8  2012  and sailing into the South China Sea for the first time since becoming party and military chief that year  As Xi looks to the horizon through binoculars  the narrator says   As the warship pierces the waves  Xi Jinping peers toward a vision obscured in the mist of history when  170 years ago  Western powers came from the sea to open the door to China  beginning a bitter nightmare for ancient China   The nightmare ends  according to the documentary  with the Communist victory under Mao and the periods of growing economic and military power under former leaders Deng  Jiang and Hu  With Xi in charge  the series shows  a heavily armed China is poised to recover its former glory  PRESSURE ON TAIWAN Propaganda aside  Xi is proving far more assertive than his most recent predecessors in employing China s new military power  In 2013  China began dredging and island building in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea  an area in which Beijing has competing territorial claims with the Philippines  Malaysia  Taiwan  Vietnam and Brunei  Xi personally directed these moves  according to a July 2017 commentary in Study Times  the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party s Central Party School   It is the equivalent of building a Great Wall at sea   the commentary said  Extensive fortification of these outposts  including missile batteries  means that China has virtually annexed a vast swathe of this ocean  Ahead of his May 30 appointment to head the U S  Indo Pacific Command  Admiral Philip Davidson told a Congressional committee that China was now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios  short of war   Xi is also stepping up military pressure on Taiwan  Japan and India  Alongside a massive arsenal of missiles capable of striking Taiwan  Chinese naval and air forces conduct increasingly complex exercises that regularly encircle the self governing island  These exercises are designed to intimidate Taiwan and wear down its forces which must respond to these drills  according to some Taiwanese defense analysts   They are obviously applying a lot of coercive power over Taiwan   said Yang  the former Taiwan defense minister  Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is determined to bring it under mainland control  In response to questions from Reuters  Taiwan s Defense Ministry said it would continue to maintain surveillance and deploy aircraft and warships to  ensure the safety of our nation s air and sea territory   Chinese naval and air forces are also increasing the tempo of deployments  exercises and patrols through the Japanese island chain  Japan s annual military White Paper last year said China s  unilateral escalation  of activities around Japan was arousing strong security concerns  Japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times in the past year against Chinese aircraft  the government reported this month  up almost 30 percent from the year before   China has expanded and intensified military activities not only in the East China Sea  but also in the Pacific Ocean and the seas around Japan   the Japanese Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters   These activities appear aimed at improving operational capability and bolstering China s presence   Despite these assertive moves  there are still questions from inside the PLA about the capacity of Chinese forces to compete with the United States and other advanced military powers  In numerous published commentaries  Chinese officers and strategists point to the PLA s lack of experience in conflict  technological shortcomings and failure to introduce effective command and control  Xi s power grab and bold agenda also carry great risk for him personally  the party and China  There has been widespread speculation in China that the corruption crackdown in the military and a parallel purge of party and government officials is at least in part Xi s response to a vicious  behind the scenes power struggle  Rare evidence of this surfaced at a key gathering of top officials  On the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress in October 2017  Liu Shiyu  then China s chief stock market regulator  accused a group of senior officials deposed in the purge of plotting a coup  including the disgraced former military chief Guo Boxiong  Earlier  the official military newspaper hinted at similar accusations  without citing evidence  Guo  who was imprisoned on corruption charges  could not be reached for comment  The Chinese government has not commented further on this allegation  In bringing down so many powerful military and party leaders and their factions  Xi has made many dangerous enemies  say people with ties to the leadership  And steep increases in military spending will become more difficult to sustain if the growth of the debt burdened Chinese economy continues to slow  Still  Xi shows no sign of toning down his drive to galvanize the Chinese military  On October 25  he toured the Southern  NYSE SO  Theater Command in the city of Guangzhou  the headquarters responsible for the contested South China Sea  State television showed Xi in fatigues and combat boots  striding through the command post with senior brass  Xi  state media reported  told officers to concentrate on  preparing for war and combat

176853,398369,SO,I Own Southern Company and AGL Resources   Now What Do I Do ,opinion,"Introduction
Utility stocks are generally low growth high yield investments  As I will soon illustrate  both Southern Company  NYSE SO  and AGL Resources Inc  NYSE GAS  neatly fall into that category  These low growth and above  average dividend yield characteristics have led me to only invest in utility stocks when two important conditions are met 
First and foremost  when considering utility stocks I am even more of a stickler for fair valuation  My logic is simple  since long term historic and future prospects for growth are low  I consider it imperative to only invest when utility stocks can be bought at fair value or below  There is typically not enough growth available to produce an attractive enough total return if you overpay even slightly  With most utilities  the dividends are consistent  but also grow at low rates in conjunction with the utility s earnings growth 
Second  I like to utilize utility stocks when current and dependable income is my primary investment objective  Although many utility stocks can be classified as dividend growth stocks  I tend to like them more for current income than total return  However  when purchased at or below sound valuation  investments in utility stocks can produce acceptable levels of long term total return 
On the other hand  when investing at sound valuations  utility stocks do tend to produce significantly more cumulative dividend income than the average company  As the following two announcements and reports indicate  Southern Company will become the second largest utility company in the U S  by customer base after buying AGL Resources  Importantly  Southern Company s management expects the transaction to accelerate earnings growth in the first full year from its traditional 2  to 3  rate to a higher but still moderate 4  to 5  earnings growth rate 

 Southern Co  to buy AGL Resources in  12B deal Aug 24 2015  07 49 ET   By    SA News Editor


Southern Company  NYSE    AGL Resources  NYSE   for  66 share in cash  a 38  premium over Friday s closing price  in a deal with an enterprise value of   12B including debt 


SO says the deal will create the second largest utility company in the U S  by customer base  with 11 regulated electric and natural gas distribution companies providing service to  9M customers with a projected regulated rate base of   50B 


SO expects the deal to increase EPS in the first full year after the close and drive long term EPS growth to 4  5  



Market Pulse
Southern Co  agrees to buy AGL Resources in  12 billion deal Published  Aug 24  2015 7 41 a m  ET By Ciara Linnane CORPORATE NEWS EDITOR Shares of AGL Resources Inc  GAS   28 52  surged almost 9  in premarket trade Monday  after Southern Co  SO   3 14  said it has agreed to buy AGL in a deal with an enterprise value of about  12 billion  Southern Co  said it expects the deal to boost earnings per share in the first full year after the close  and to drive long term EPS growth to 4  to 5   AGL will become a wholly owned unit of Southern Co   creating the second biggest utility in the U S  by customer base  AGL shareholders will receive  66 in cash for each share  a premium of 36 3  over the volume weighted average stock price over the last 20 trading days through Aug  21  We believe the addition of AGL Resources to our business will better position Southern Company to play offense in supporting America s energy future through additional natural gas infrastructure   Chief Executive Thomas Fanning said in a statement  The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016  Southern Co  shares were up slightly in premarket trade  but are down 6 7  in the year so far  while the S P 500 has lost 4 3   

Here  to a report on Reuters that outlines the deal  The Southern Company Purchase of AGL Resources by the Numbers
As a shareholder of both Southern Company and AGL Resources I immediately wanted to know what I might expect from this transaction  In other words  does the deal make economic sense and will it benefit shareholders over the long run 
Therefore  I looked at the deal through the lens of the  analyzer software tool and the FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers  in order to evaluate the value to me as a Southern Company and AGL Resources shareholder 
From The Perspective of an AGL Shareholder
I was quite content with my position in AGL Resources as I considered the company fairly valued with a blended P E ratio of 14 3 and I appreciated the 4 3  dividend yield  Additionally  since my cost basis was approximately 39  I was enjoying a reasonable level of capital appreciation coupled with its current above average yield that had been growing at about 2   to 3  per annum  The following earnings and price correlated graph illustrates my contentment  
Of course the approximate 30  premium over fair value significantly improves the total return I will receive when the transaction is complete  Therefore  from the perspective of an AGL Resources  shareholder  I am quite pleased with the windfall  The following forecasting calculator on the day of the announcement and based on AGL Resources  expected midterm future earnings growth illustrates the premium that Southern Company is paying  
This is what the same graph looks like as of 8 24 2015  which shows the premium price that Southern Company is paying for AGL Resources  This would indicate that technically speaking AGL Resources has become overvalued as a result of the premium paid by Southern Company  
On the other hand  when looked at from the perspective of expected future cash flows  the premium price that Southern Company is allegedly paying does not look so enticing  Cash flows are expected to increase significantly this fiscal year  Therefore  on the basis of price to cash flow  the apparent premium that Southern Company is paying based on earnings  looks like a bargain based on cash flows  

When reviewing the cash flow per quarter growth  cflq  that AGL Resources has generated thus far in fiscal 2015  those fiscal year 2015 cash flow projections appear to be on track  So now I am partially conflicted  I like the premium market valuation  but I m not so sure that I m truly receiving a premium price for my AGL shares based on potential cash flow growth  I have circled the last three quarters of cash flow highlighting the cash flow growth over the last three quarters 
 
Furthermore  when I evaluate AGL s historical annual dividends paid per share  dvpps  coverage based on cash flows per share  cflps  I am confident that my dividend was secure  Of course  I am even more confident considering the recent quarterly cash flow growth presented above  
Furthermore  upon reviewing other valuation ratios  it appears that Southern Company instituted the transaction when AGL s price to sales  ps  was at reasonable levels  However  the premium price they had to pay is common when a company is purchased outright  
Additionally  AGL s price to book value  pb  at the time the transaction was initiated was within historical norms as well  the red line   
The bottom line is that as an AGL shareholder I have mixed views about the transaction  I like the premium market valuation  but I was also content to continue holding my AGL shares for the high yield they were providing  
From The Perspective of a Southern Company Shareholder
The following long term earnings and price correlated graph on Southern Company supports my contentment as a shareholder  Although my cost basis in Southern Company was approximately at the same level that the company was trading at prior to the announcement  I was quite happy with my 4 7  dividend yield and believed that the company was fairly valued  Consequently  I was committed to continuing to own this high quality utility company for many years to come  Moreover  even the approximate 5  price drop as a result of the transaction did not concern me very much because I felt the dividend was secure  above average  and had the potential for a modest amount of future growth  However  I was now faced with the issue of whether my Southern Company investment would continue to make sense after they purchased AGL 
 
At this point  I decided that I would give credit to management s assertion that the transaction would in fact accelerate Southern Company s future earnings  and therefore  along with it   future dividend growth  Therefore  I reviewed the Forecasting Calculator based on consensus estimates from S P Capital IQ prior to the AGL transaction  Here I discovered that consensus expected Southern Company s earnings to grow at a very modest rate of 2 7   Based on those consensus estimates and assuming that Southern Company would trade at a reasonable P E ratio of 15 out to fiscal year end 2018  I came up with a total annual rate of return expectation of 5 22   Of course  that is nothing to write home about as it only represented capital appreciation of   85  On the other hand  the  7 70 of projected dividend income was very attractive considering today s low level of interest rates  Clearly  this is purely an income play and I had no delusions of anything different 
 
This is what the expected returns look like after Southern Company s price drop as a result of the announcement  The announcement brought Southern Company s stock price into better alignment with fair value  

For additional insight  I felt the forecasts prior to the transaction announcement were reasonably reliable considering the historical record of analysts forecasting Southern Company s earnings  As the following analyst scorecard indicates  when making 1 year forward and 2 year forward estimates since calendar year 2000  the record of analysts following Southern Company has been consistently accurate at over 93   
Then I ran a similar calculation using the custom Forecasting Calculator based on management s expectation of earnings growth accelerating to between 4  and 5  as a result of the transaction  I split the difference and ran a calculation based on Southern Company s 5  drop in price and a forecast 4 5  growth rate  Based on those calculations I was pleased that my Southern Company investment offered the potential for significantly more capital appreciation of approximately  11 11 versus the   85 based on growth prior to the transaction  However  I was even more pleased to discover that my dividend income of  13 19 would be close to double what I expected prior to the transaction  Note  all these calculations are made and based on purchasing one share of the stock  The bottom line is that I have concluded that my Southern Company investment holds the potential to be much more attractive after the AGL transaction than it was prior to it 

As a bonus  I have prepared a free  MisterValuation which provides a more in depth and detailed look at Southern Company and AGL Resources  transaction  
Summary and Conclusions
From the perspective of a Southern Company shareholder based solely on the numbers  I am enthusiastic and pleased with the AGL transaction  From the perspective of an AGL shareholder  I am disappointed that I will lose the company as a separate holding  but pleased that I will still benefit from its potential as a Southern Company shareholder  Of course  the premium over current market price is also a plus  However  I am now also faced with the challenge of what I will do with the proceeds received from the AGL shares  At this point  I am not yet certain whether I would reinvest the proceeds into Southern Company  or look for another opportunity  However  I have time to assess the situation

176854,398370,SO,Southern Company  Invest While The Yield Is Still High ,opinion,"Introduction
In consideration of today s low interest rate environment  fixed income securities offer little in the way of return  Moreover  the safety characteristics normally associated with fixed income are also potentially upside down  Since early 1982  the interest rates available with fixed income have been in a continuous freefall  This has presented both good and bad news for the conservative investor desirous of a high and safe income stream on their portfolios 
The good news is that bond prices move inversely with interest rates  Therefore  when interest rates drop  as they have done since 1982  the prices of previously issued bonds will rise  Therefore  fixed income investments  primarily bonds  have provided the opportunity for high yield and either capital appreciation or at least stable prices  This falling interest rate trend has gone on for more than three decades  and as a result  fixed income returns have been abnormally strong and even high 
However  the first part of the bad news is that fixed income investors need to understand that previously issued bonds will move to a premium valuation as rates are dropping  but will eventually move back to par when they mature  Consequently  the only way to lock in capital appreciation in addition to your interest income would be to sell your bonds before they mature  Otherwise  temporary capital gains created by falling rates will inevitably dissipate to breakeven levels  As a result  investors that hold bonds to maturity will in effect suffer losses of purchasing power due to inflationary forces 
On the other hand  the additional bad news is that falling interest rates result in the inability to reinvest in newly issued fixed income instruments at rates that are attractive  But the worst bad news is that those investors purchasing fixed income at today s extremely low rates are exposing their capital investments to potential losses in a rising interest rate environment 
Investors need to understand that bond prices fluctuate just as stock prices fluctuate  If future interest rates move higher  and if that were to happen quickly  originally issued bond prices could drop just as much as stock prices did during the Great Recession  Bonds are considered safe because they mature at par  however  bonds are also liquid  Therefore  bond prices can  and do  fluctuate between their issue date and maturity 
Fairly Valued Utility Stocks for Income and Safety
Consequently  and as the result of the fixed income dynamic discussed above  I have been  temporarily at least  eschewing fixed income  In other words  I have been recently looking for viable alternative income producing opportunities  Importantly  I am just not focused on finding higher income streams  I m also concerned about finding income producing alternatives with reasonable safety characteristics  I believe that carefully selected utility stocks can fit the bill  as long as they are purchased at sound or attractive valuations 
Stocks and bonds are different investment types and therefore possess different investment merits and characteristics  In other words  I believe it would be a stretch to state that utility stocks are perfect fixed income alternatives  On the other hand  utility stocks  when purchased at sound valuation  do possess and or share characteristics with bonds that are similar enough to consider them a reasonable alternative 
When interest rates are at normal levels  bonds pay higher interest income than most blue chip dividend paying stocks provide in dividend yield  Furthermore  since bonds provide an implicit guarantee of returning principle at maturity  they also provide a level of safety not normally associated with stocks  However  it is also true that all dividend paying common stocks are not the same 
Utility stocks are generally regulated monopolies  and as such  have a history of producing reliable and consistent earnings growth and above average levels of dividend income  Nevertheless  even though the earnings growth on utility stocks is generally consistent and reliable  earnings and dividends generally do not grow very fast  Regulation provides consistency and a level of reliability  but at the expense of higher or above average growth potential 
Southern Company  N SO  High Yield Sound Valuation
Southern Company  SO  is a blue chip utility stock that is considered one of the strongest among its peers  The two primary reasons supporting this view are the relatively friendly regulatory environment they operate in  and the better than average economic fundamentals associated with its region  Headquartered in Atlanta  Southern Company dominates the power business serving both regulated and competitive markets across the southeastern region 
For example  Zacks considers Southern Company one of the largest and best managed electric utility holding companies in the United States  Operating in one of the fastest growing and strongest regions of the country  Southern Company is a holding company for four regulated Southern electric utilities that serve about 4 4 million customers  Those utilities are Georgia Power  Alabama power  Gulf Power  and Mississippi power 
Additionally  Zacks estimates that Southern Company s impending acquisition of AGL Resources  N GAS  could double its customer base and generate more revenues  However  this additional growth potential is slightly mitigated by what many consider the high valuation  approximately  28 billion  they paid for AGL  The following earnings and price correlated graph on AGL  GAS  illustrates the premium valuation that Southern Company is paying 

On the other hand  when looked at from the perspective of the 3 to 5 year trend line growth estimates for AGL Resources  the valuation that Southern Company might be paying appears more reasonable  These long term growth estimates may in fact be reasonable  and more importantly  could provide a meaningful benefit to Southern Company  Considering that Southern Company currently generates approximately 40  of its power from coal fired plants  the AGL acquisition could provide a breath of fresh air  pun intended  
According to MorningStar   If the AGL deal closes  Southern will operate 7 gas LDCs  including a core Georgia business and a large LDC in Illinois  while gaining stakes in two midstream gas projects with upside to more   MorningStar also believes that   Southern Company operates in the business friendly Southeast  where its relatively low power prices and sterling reputation help to foster a constructive and stable regulatory atmosphere  
The following Short business description courtesy of S P Capital IQ provides further insight into Southern Company and its businesses 
 The Southern Company  together with its subsidiaries  operates as a public electric utility company  It is involved in the generation  transmission  and distribution of electricity through coal  nuclear  oil and gas  and hydro resources in the states of Alabama  Georgia  Florida  and Mississippi 
The company also constructs  acquires  owns  and manages generation assets  including renewable energy projects  As of December 31  2014  it operated 33 hydroelectric generating stations  33 fossil fuel generating stations  3 nuclear generating stations  13 combined cycle cogeneration stations  9 solar facilities  1 biomass facility  and 1 landfill gas facility 
The company also provides digital wireless communications services with various communication options  including push to talk  cellular service  text messaging  wireless Internet access  and wireless data  and wholesale fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast  The Southern Company was founded in 1945 and is headquartered in Atlanta  Georgia  
The biggest negative I see with Southern Company relates to issues within their nuclear power businesses  Cost overruns on their Georgia Power nuclear projects  principally Vogtle  do raise some concerns  However  I think those concerns are exaggerated given the diversity of Southern Company s diverse electric generating businesses 
Investing In Utility Stocks at Sound Valuation Is Critical
When investing in low growth companies like utility stocks  getting valuation right is even more critical  Just as it is with all companies  utility stocks can become overvalued from time to time  However  since utility stocks do not grow very fast  overpaying for future earnings can dramatically destroy the dividend income advantage that utility stocks typically offer  Paying too much for a low growth enterprise can easily result in long term capital losses and future earnings will generally not be large enough to bail you out  You can test this statement by utilizing the following live earnings and price correlated Southern Company graph 
Bonus  Live Fully Functioning Historical F A S T  Graphs on Southern Company
In order to assist the reader in understanding Southern Company s current valuation and historical operating achievements  I offer the following live fully functioning historical F A S T  Graphs  on the company 
Furthermore  to get maximum benefit from this exercise  I offer the following tips on how to utilize and navigate the live graph  At the top of the graph there are orange rectangles representing different historical time frames  For example  you can click on the orange rectangle 10Y and the graph will automatically draw a 10 calendar year graph  Therefore  you can quickly move from one time frame to the next and evaluate changes in earnings growth rates and historical normal P E ratio valuations over each respective time frame  There is also a scrollbar at the bottom of the graph that allows you to focus on any historical time frame of your choosing 
At the bottom of the graph there is a long orange rectangle that allows you to take the graph apart or rebuild it by simply clicking on any of the words  For example  if you click on the word  Price   monthly closing stock prices will be taken off of the graph and you can replace them by simply clicking on the word  Price  again  You can do this with all of the items located in the orange rectangle 
But most importantly as it relates to the thesis of this article  valuation   the graph also has a built in performance calculation feature  Simply point and click your mouse on any price point on the graph  the black line  until a red dot appears  Then simply move your mouse to any other price point on the graph and click it and a pop up will appear with the calculation of the performance over the time frame you chose  To erase the calculation  simply point and click on your second red dot and you will be ready to perform another calculation  Note  all these calculations are based on purchasing and holding one share of the company s stock 
I suggest that the reader utilizes this calculation function feature in order to evaluate the effects that valuation has on long term performance  You can measure periods of time from high valuation to low valuation  when price is above the orange valuation reference line   from low valuation  when price is below the orange valuation reference line  to high valuation  etc  As you perform these calculations  notice the effect that various levels of valuation have on long term performance over time  I hope you have fun performing these various calculation exercises  and I hope they reveal and solidify the important effect that valuation has on long term returns when investing in utility stocks 
 
Southern Company s Income Advantage
The following detailed performance report on Southern Company since 1996 illustrates the significant income advantage it has provided shareholders compared to an equal investment in the S P 500  Total cumulative dividend income from Southern Company would have been almost twice as high as the index would have provided 
However  due to the low earnings growth rate that Southern Company  and utility stocks in general  has generated  higher yield came at the expense of capital appreciation  Nevertheless  in contrast to long term bonds held to maturity  Southern Company did produce some capital appreciation in addition to its high dividend income generation 

Reinvesting Dividends in High Yield Southern Company Levels the Playing Field
The above historical performance report on Southern Company validates the income advantage that a blue chip utility stock investment can provide  However  for those investors focused more on total return  a low growth high yield utility stock like Southern Company can level the total return playing field   if you reinvest your dividends 
As the following performance report on Southern Company with dividends reinvested each quarter illustrates  the high income advantage remains  On the other hand  the capital appreciation  total return  advantage that the index held without reinvesting dividends disappears  With dividends reinvested  the total return on Southern Company and the S P 500 end up in a virtual dead heat  I believe this validates the power and protection that high quality high yield dividend paying stocks offer 
This is especially true when a low growth high yielding utility stock like Southern Company is originally invested in when valuation is sound  On that note  I would like to add that both Southern Company and the S P 500 were soundly valued at the beginning of 1996  Therefore  the return comparisons over this timeframe are apples to apples from a valuation perspective  Additionally  the virtual tie in total return between Southern Company and the S P 500 happened even though Southern Company only grew earnings at 2 5  while the S P 500 grew earnings at 6 1  over the same time period 

Additional supporting fundamental metrics on Southern Company
Returns on invested capital  roiq  is an important consideration when evaluating utility stocks  After hitting a low point in the last fiscal quarter of 2014  Southern Company has been steadily improving each quarter in 2015  I consider this a comforting accomplishment 

In concert with an improving return on invested capital  Southern Company s bottom line has also been steadily improving throughout 2015  Southern Company s net profit margin per quarter  npmq  in 2015 has increased from 7 04  to 17 6  in their most recent quarter ending in September 2015 

Southern Company s revenues for quarter  revq  have also been improving throughout 2015  Importantly  revenues had recovered to 20 year highs in 2014  and 2015 is on track to be even higher 

But perhaps most importantly  since I m attracted to Southern Company for its dividend yield  cash flow per quarter  cflq  strongly support dividends for quarter  dvq   Southern Company is a Dividend Challenger on fellow Seeking Alpha author David Fish s CCC lists that has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years  Moreover  southern company has paid a dividend every quarter since 1948 

Summary and Conclusions
I consider Southern Company a strong and healthy utility stock that can currently be purchased at a sound and attractive valuation  At current levels  its dividend yield is approaching 5   and I believe this represents an opportunity for investors in need of current income  Consequently  I would recommend purchasing Southern Company as long as its yield remains above the 4 5  level or better 
In today s low interest rate environment  a current yield above 4  with the potential for modest capital appreciation to fight inflation looks attractive  Southern Company  like most utilities  is not offered as a high total return opportunity  Instead  I suggest that is most suitable for those investors  including retired investors  that are looking for high current income and reasonable safety

176860,398376,SO,SO  A Safe High Yield Dividend Stock,opinion,"Yield starved investors should familiarize themselves with Southern Company  NYSE SO   a highly dependable business that has paid dividends every quarter for more than 65 consecutive years 
With a high yield of 4 4   low stock price volatility  and a track record for outperforming the S P 500 Index over the last 30 years  Southern Company is the type of business that we like to review for our Conservative Retirees and Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolios Business OverviewThe Southern Company is a major producer of electricity in the U S  that has been in business for more than 100 years  The holding company s four retail regulated utilities serve approximately 4 5 million customers across Georgia  Alabama  Florida  and Mississippi  Approximately 90  of Southern Company s earnings are from regulated subsidiaries  and the company also has a small wholesale energy company 
Industrial customers account for 28  of the company s sales  followed by commercial  27    residential  27    and other retail and wholesale  17   
By power source  coal generated 33  of Southern Company s total megawatt hours in 2015  gas accounted for 47   nuclear was 16   and hydro power was 3  
The company s mix of business and geographies will significantly change in the second half of 2016 when it closes its acquisition of natural gas utility AGL Resources  NYSE GAS   Southern Company s customer count will double to roughly 9 million  and its energy mix will shift from 100  electric to a 50 50 mix of electric and gas Business AnalysisUtility companies spend billions of dollars to build power plants and transmission lines and must comply with strict regulatory and environmental standards  As capital intensive regulated entities  utility companies typically have a monopoly in the geographies they operate in 
As a result  the government controls the rates that utilities can charge to ensure they are fair to customers while still allowing the utility company to earn a reasonable return on their investments to continue providing quality service 
Each state s regulatory body is different from the next  and some regions have been better to utilities than others  The Southeast region has been friendly to businesses  and Southern Company operates in four of the top eight most constructive state regulatory environments in the U S  according to RRA 
Source  Southern Company Investor Presentation
Southern also maintains strong relationships with regulators in part due to its reputation and the reasonable rates it currently charges  which are below the national average and perceived as being more customer friendly 
The South region is also one of the fastest growing in the country  which makes Southern Company a relatively more attractive utility than many others 
While regulation protects Southern Company s monopoly business and helps it generate consistent earnings  it also makes growth more difficult  The company s earnings have grown by about 3  per year historically  but its planned merger with AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  is expected to boost earnings growth to a 4 5  annual clip 
In late 2015  Southern Company announced plans to acquire AGL Resources for approximately  8 billion  AGL is the largest U S  gas only local distribution company  serving about 4 5 million customers in seven states and generating approximately 70  of its earnings from regulated operations 
The combined company will now serve roughly 9 million customers and diversify Southern Company s revenue mix from being 100  electric to a 50 50 mix of electric and gas customers  The deal also somewhat reduces the impact from the company s large construction projects that have been delayed and provides a new array of growth projects to invest in  Furthermore  we like that AGL will provide some regulatory diversification for Southern Company by expanding its reach into several new states 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that Southern Company is the only electric utility in the country that is committed to a portfolio of nuclear  coal gasification  natural gas  solar  wind  and biomass  The company has committed  20 billion to developing a portfolio of low  and zero carbon emission generating resources  including investments in natural gas  solar  wind  and integrated gasification combined cycle technology 
As seen below  the company s mix of resources is expected to become more diversified over the next five years  reducing its dependency on coal  A diverse generation fleet reduces the company s risk of being overly dependent on any one source of energy 
Source  Southern Company Investor PresentationSouthern Company s Key RisksUtility companies generally have lower business risk than many other types of businesses  Their biggest risks are usually regulatory in nature   customer rates are decided at the state level and materially impact the return a utility company gets on its major capital expenditures 
In Southern Company s case  its main states in the Southeast have historically had generally favorable regulatory rulings  The acquisition of AGL Resources will also diversify the company s regulatory risk 
EPA regulations are another challenge  There is increased scrutiny around coal and nuclear power  which could result in higher spending to remain compliant with safety and emissions standards  If Southern Company cannot pass these costs through to customers  shareholders would take the hit 
Project execution is another big risk facing the company  Southern Company has taken on several major capital projects in recent years  The company is building a coal fired power plant in Kemper County  Mississippi  and two nuclear plants at Plant Vogtle in Georgia 
The coal gasification project in Mississippi was originally expected to cost  5 billion and go into service in 2014  but it has been delayed by two years and experienced over  1 billion in additional costs  While the Kemper County facility is finally nearing completion  it s uncertain how the project will be paid for 
A  from May 22  2015  cited that Southern informed state regulators that it might need to raise electricity rates by as much as 41  a month for households to pay for the project  The company was ultimately bailed out by  in August 2015  although the increase was temporary and  
Southern Company is only about 26  finished with construction of its nuclear plants in Georgia  This project has seen its costs escalate from an estimated  14 1 billion in 2009 to over  20 billion today  Southern s share of the project s cost is less than  10 billion   It has also been delayed by more than three years 
While the cost overruns and delays on these massive projects are certainly a black eye for the company and do not help its regulatory relationships in the effected states  we do not believe they impair Southern s long term earnings power  However  there is risk that these projects receive unfavorable rate treatment with regulators 
Finally  Southern Company s acquisition of AGL Resources creates some risk  This was a large deal that comes at a time when the management team is already facing challenges with the company s large capital projects  AGL gets Southern into a new business  gas utility  and brings exposure to new states that have different regulatory bodies Dividend Analysis  Southern CompanyWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Southern Company s dividend payment appears very safe with a Dividend Safety Score of 86  If we exclude charges related to increased cost estimates for the company s large construction projects  Southern s earnings payout ratio in 2015 was 75   While we prefer to see a lower payout ratio for most businesses  we can see that Southern Company s payout ratio has remained between 70  and 80  for most of the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Utility companies can also maintain relatively high payout ratios compared to most businesses because their financial results are so stable  Customers still need to use a certain amount of electricity and gas regardless of economic conditions  making utilities one of the best stock sectors for dividend income 
As seen below  Southern Company s sales only fell by 8  in fiscal year 2009  and its stock was flat in 2008  outperforming the S P 500 by 37   Utility companies are generally great investments to own during economic downturns Source  Simply Safe Dividends
We can also see that Southern Company s reported earnings have remained remarkably stable over the last decade  The dip in recent years was caused by constructed related charges  Otherwise  the steady earnings results look almost like interest payments coming in from a bond  Southern s earnings growth isn t exciting  but it s dependable Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As a regulated utility company  Southern generates a moderate but predictable mid single digit return on invested capital  The slight dip was due to write offs on its capital projects  but the favorable regulatory environment in its key states has helped it earn somewhat higher returns than many other utility companies  We expect the company s returns to improve as its large projects finally come on line Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Utility companies maintain a lot of debt to maintain their capital intensive businesses  Southern Company most recently reported  1 4 billion in cash compared to  27 4 billion in debt on its balance sheet  While this would be a concern for most companies  the stability of Southern s earnings and strength of its moat alleviate much of this risk 
The company also has over  4 billion available in its credit facility and maintains investment grade credit ratings with the major agencies Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite the challenges Southern Company is facing with its major construction projects  the safety of its dividend still looks great  The company maintains a reasonable payout ratio for a utility company  earnings are predictable each year  and its key operating states have provided a historically favorable regulatory environment Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
The dependability of utility companies  dividends comes at the price of growth  Southern Company s dividend has grown at a 3 9  annualized rate over the past decade  and the business has a very low Dividend Growth Score of 9  The company most recently increased its dividend by about 2  in April 2015  marking its 14th consecutive raise Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While Southern Company is 11 years away from joining the dividend aristocrats list  we believe it has a good chance of getting there  The company s dividend growth rate could even increase in coming years  Management believes the AGL Resources merger could increase Southern s long term earnings per share growth from 3  to 4 5   which would allow for slightly greater dividend raises ValuationSO s stock trades at 17 4x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 4 36   which is below its five year average dividend yield of 4 46  
If the AGL merger increases the company s long term earnings growth rate to 4 5  as management expects  the stock appears to offer total return potential of 8 9  per year 
We think the stock looks to be about fairly valued today  and it s worth noting how the predictability of Southern s business has resulted in very low stock price volatility  The chart below shows the volatility of each of the 20 utilities in the Philadelphia Electric Utility Index  UTY   Southern Company had the lowest level of volatility through the five year period ending on 12 31 2014 
Source  Southern Company Annual ReportConclusionSouthern Company is a blue chip dividend stock in the utilities sector  The last few years have been disappointing due to delays and cost overruns with some of the company s major construction projects  but the long term outlook appears to be intact 
Southern Company s stock appears to be reasonably priced and offers a dependable income stream for those living off dividends in retirement  It s hard not to like a business as sturdy and reliable as this one ",2016-03-12,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/so:-a-safe-high-yield-dividend-stock-200121315,200121315

176878,398394,SO,CBI Gives Investors False Hope,opinion,"Stocks rallied during  s testimony on February 24  Yet two of the three major indices gave up some of their gains the next day 

Chicago Bridge   Iron Company NV  NYSE CBI   kept on trucking  though  The stock jumped 14 2  after it beat analysts  estimates for Q4 earnings 

Wednesday s move helped push the stock into positive territory year to date after hitting its 52 week low in January 

If you re worried you missed out  don t be  As you ll see  the optimism is totally misplaced 

Let s take a look at what investors perceive  versus the real hindrances that CBI faces 

Examining Q4 and FY 2014 Results

Investors see the surface numbers of Q4 2014  along with the full year 2014 results  and they re hoping the stock goes higher 

For the three months ended December 31  2014  the company reported a total revenue of  3 37 billion   a 12 3  increase over the same quarter in 2013 

However  the higher revenue didn t trickle down to the bottom line  CBI reported an adjusted net income of  161 3 million  a 22 8  decline against in Q4 2013 results 

And while the company s earnings per share  EPS  of  1 47 beat analysts  expectations of  1 43  the company still saw an EPS decline of 23  against the same quarter a year ago  due primarily to falling oil prices  

Looking to the company s full year results 

Chicago Bridge   Iron reported a 16 9  increase in total revenue to  12 9 billion 

Adjusted net income for 2014 was  568 6 million  or  5 21 per diluted share  That represents a 7 8  increase over the previous year s total of  527 4 million  or  4 91 per diluted share 

This may sound like music to shareholders  ears  but here s something to think about  CBI shares have woefully underperformed the broader market indices  declining more than 42 3  in the past year   This includes Wednesday s price spike  

Avoid CBI Like the Plague

If you re still on the fence  consider these two roadblocks that are keeping CBI behind the curve  proving why I m so bearish on the stock 

Challenge No  1  Troubled Nuclear Power Plant  CBI faces serious headwinds caused by continued construction delays on a troubled nuclear power plant for Southern Company  NYSE SO  near Waynesboro  Georgia 

You see  the Plant Vogtle reactor sites 3 and 4 were originally expected to begin commercial operations in 2016 and 2017  respectively 

But pending lawsuits over delays  as well as cost increases between the principals  could delay commercial operations to Q2 2020 

Adding more pressure  DBKGn  Comments  target   blank  rel  nofollow  it could take another 18 months to resolve the dispute between both parties  And with each month  CBI is shelling out another  40 million 

Challenge No  2  Declining U S  Oil Rig Count  A more pressing concern for CBI is the declining U S  oil rig count  which fell by another 37 units last week  This marks the lowest number of rigs in production since July 2011 

With capex budgets being slashed almost to the bone with no end in sight  CBI will experience a serious decline in its cash flow 

And with an anemic quick ratio of 0 43  the company demonstrates weak liquidity to meet short term needs 

For now  CBI shares are a bridge too far  and investors should stay clear ",2015-03-02,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbi-gives-investors-false-hope-243466,243466
176879,398395,SO,Don t Overweight The Utilities Sector,opinion,"We ve all heard Benjamin Franklin s quip that nothing in the world is certain but death and taxes 

However  for a number of years now  income investors have relied upon a third certainty  utilities  Indeed  many portfolios were buoyed by the steady  above average dividend payments offered by  

Unfortunately  the run up in the market  combined with the perpetual search for yield  has elevated the prices of utilities stocks to the point that they provide a mediocre yield and a substantial chance of capital loss 

Thus  while a few investible companies remain  investors should tread carefully in this once sought after income haven 

Bull Market Pressures

In total  these forces have pushed the premium above the net asset value at which utilities stocks trade  This has been particularly true during the current bull market  in which utilities have been seen as safe havens for dividend seekers   even though the dividend yields available have steadily decreased and the price risks have risen 

You can see the effect of the current bull market by looking at PEPCO Holdings Inc  NYSE POM   the electric utility for the Washington  D C  area  In mid 2009  it was trading at  14  and its stock price was less than net asset value  Its dividend yield  based on a  0 27 quarterly dividend  was 7 7   At that level  it represented a safe  attractive investment for income investors 

Today  POM pays the same  0 27 quarterly dividend  but its stock price has almost doubled to  27  At that level  it yields a bare 4  and is trading at 60  above net asset value  What s more  its trailing four quarters earnings were just  0 96  so the dividend is uncovered  and the stock is trading at a trailing P E ratio of 29x 

And while there appears to be little chance of a significant dividend increase in the near future  there s a substantial chance that the stock will soon trade closer to its net asset value of about  17 per share  That s not an attractive investment 

Of course  there are a couple of companies that appear to offer better value than the norm  Southern Company  NYSE SO   an electric utility headquartered in Atlanta and operating in several southern states  yields 4 6  at its current price  It s trading at more than twice book value  which is negative  though its quarterly dividend of  0 525 per share is fully covered by earnings with a 5  margin based on the trailing four quarters 

Furthermore  Southern is expected to increase earnings significantly by next year  bringing its forward P E down to 15x  Finally  unlike Pepco  which has struggled to maintain its dividend in the last six years  Southern has increased dividends by a total of 20   beating inflation and giving shareholders a yield that should increase gently  rather than remain flat  at best  

Another above average investment is Calgary based TransAlta Corporation  NYSE TAC   TAC is a non regulated electricity generation and energy marketing company in Canada  the United States  and Australia that generates power from hydro  wind  natural gas  and coal 

With fewer regulations and a broader field of operation  TAC offers a 6 3  dividend yield while its shares are trading at just 35  above book value  Its past earnings don t quite cover its  0 58 annual dividend  which  being paid in Canadian dollars  fluctuates in U S  dollar terms  Therefore  it s a riskier investment than Southern   but its higher yield  broader geographical spread  and lower premium to book value offset the risk to some extent 

Bottom line  Utilities companies are expensive right now  and should probably be underweighted in your portfolio  For income investors  though  a few reasonably attractive opportunities remain 

Good investing ",2015-03-12,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/don’t-overweight-the-utilities-sector-244835,244835

176892,398408,SO,Former South Carolina Senator Ernest  Fritz  Hollings dies at 97,news,By Will Dunham WASHINGTON  Reuters    Ernest  Fritz  Hollings  a sharp tongued moderate Democrat with a booming voice and deep Southern  NYSE SO  drawl who advocated fiscal discipline in Washington during 38 years representing South Carolina in the U S  Senate  died on Saturday at age 97   Andy Brack  who served as spokesman for Hollings during his Senate career  said he died early Saturday of natural causes at his home on the Isle of Palms  Hollings was elected as South Carolina s governor at age 36  serving from 1959 to 1963  and then represented the state in the Senate from 1966 to 2005  retiring at age 83  He unsuccessfully ran for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination  For all his accomplishments in office  the World War Two combat veteran may be best known for his folksy language and acerbic remarks  as well as for serving 36 years as his state s  junior senator  behind Strom Thurmond  the longest serving senator in history who retired at age 100  Hollings was a leading deficit hawk and also fought international free trade pacts that he believed threatened American jobs  He was passionate about alleviating hunger in America and was one of the authors of a nutrition program that provided food vouchers for the poor  With government deficits mounting in the 1980s  Hollings advocated a budget freeze and was one of the main sponsors of a 1985 law requiring spending cuts to lower the federal deficit  When a bipartisan 1997 budget agreement was reached to balance the federal budget  Hollings pointed to the government s lingering debt and vowed to jump off the U S  Capitol s towering dome if the Treasury Department ever reported a real surplus  Hollings consistently won elections as a moderate Democrat even as his state became ever more Republican   With his passing  South Carolina has lost one of her greatest champions and most effective political leaders   Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement on Saturday  A tall  white haired man with a booming voice and a deep Palmetto State drawl that sometimes left colleagues not exactly sure of what he had just uttered  Hollings was sometimes better known for what he said than what he did  He once called a colleague  already in his mid 60s   son   labeled a Republican campaign rival a  goddamn skunk  and  despite his strong pro Israel stance  once likened Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to Bull Connor  the notorious Alabama sheriff who fought racial integration in the American South  Hollings  a Lutheran  once apologized to fellow Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum  who was Jewish  after calling him the  senator from B nai B rith    the Jewish service organization   during a Senate debate on prayer in public schools   YOU CAN T SHUT THEM UP  Even in his farewell speech from the Senate  Hollings managed to lament the demise of the Senate drunk  saying lawmakers were all too busy nowadays  He also commented in his own unique way about the role of women in the Senate  When he arrived in the Senate  he said   We had one woman  Margaret Chase Smith  She was outstanding but she was outstandingly quiet  Now we ve got 15 or 17   and you can t shut them up   Even presidents were not spared his barbs  Amid the scandal over fellow Democrat Bill Clinton s sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky  Hollings said   Clinton s as popular as AIDS in South Carolina   He called Republican George W  Bush a  weak president   observing dismissively   He s a nice fellow  You can t find a better fraternity brother   Hollings won the loyalty of South Carolina black voters for his role in quietly and peacefully integrating South Carolina schools when he served as governor at a time when some other Southern governors stirred up racial strife  He fought to save American manufacturing jobs and was especially alarmed at the loss of textile jobs in his state  When Hollings announced his decision to retire  Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said the Senate was  losing one of its giants  and labeled Hollings  a powerful and unerring voice for fiscal sanity  a strong economy and civil rights   Graham  who replaced Thurmond in the Senate  said of Hollings in 2003   He s one of the most direct and straightforward people I ve met in political life   But Hollings departed the Senate with contempt for the political atmosphere in the capital  saying   I am frustrated with Washington  It has gotten totally partisan  We are not serious about anything except the next election   Born on Jan  1  1922  in the gracious coastal city of Charleston  South Carolina  Hollings attended the Citadel  the famed military school  and served as a decorated Army officer in World War Two  He then earned a law degree at the University of South Carolina and started his political career by winning election to the state legislature

176895,398411,SO,Midwest floods hammer U S  ethanol industry  push some gasoline prices toward five year high,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK  Reuters    The March floods that punished the U S  Midwest have roiled the ethanol industry  hammering prices and trapping barrels in the country s interior while the U S  coasts suffer from shortages of the biofuel  The historic March floods have dealt a series of blows to large swaths of an ethanol industry that was already struggling with high inventories and sluggish domestic demand growth  And the ethanol shortages are one factor pushing gasoline prices in Los Angeles and Southern  NYSE SO  California to the highest in the nation and they could top  4 a gallon for the first time since 2014  according to tracking firm GasBuddy  Benchmark price for ethanol used in most supply contracts initially jumped on news of the floods but has been hobbled by rising waters around the Chicago hub that have halted barges and sales  That stands in contrast to prices on the coasts  which rose dramatically   drawing in heavy imports from Brazil  the main U S  ethanol competitor   The floods inflicted billions of dollars in damage to crops and homes in the U S  Midwest  and knocked out roughly 13 percent of ethanol capacity   U S  ethanol is made from corn and required by the government to be blended into the nation s fuel supply to reduce emissions   While some ethanol plants were flooded  the primary effect of the rising waters was to shut rail lines that serve as the main arteries for corn and ethanol deliveries   Ethanol prices on the coasts spiked due to shortages  but Midwest producers have been unable to take advantage because of washed out rail lines  market sources told Reuters    Unfortunately for anyone who was impacted by logistics issues it was a double whammy  You couldn t capture the rally   said one trader   At Chicago s Argo terminal  the nation s main ethanol pricing hub  the cash price for ethanol fell for an eighth straight session last week to  1 29 a gallon  the longest downward skid since April of last year  according to Oil Price Information Service  which does daily assessments   Initially  fears of widespread plant outages boosted that benchmark  but plants proved more resilient than expected  continuing to produce despite logistical challenges   U S  ethanol inventories were at 24 million barrels for the week ended March 29  just off a record hit a week earlier  according to U S  Energy Information Administration data   Chicago s price acts as the benchmark for millions of barrels bought and sold via longer term supply contracts each day  While that price faltered  ethanol prices at the coast have surged  helping plants owned by Pacific Ethanol Inc and White Energy in California and Texas to take advantage of higher prices   Ethanol delivered into Los Angeles typically trades at 20 cents a gallon higher than Chicago  but that premium rose to as high as 50 cents a gallon  traders said  The price in New York Harbor was at roughly double normal levels  traders said  The tight ethanol supplies  along with refinery outages  boosted retail gasoline prices and led to some gas station shutdowns in the West as blenders there lacked the ethanol needed to blend with gasoline to make fuel that meets government regulations   Gas prices in Arizona averaged  2 88 per gallon on Sunday  17 percent higher than last month  according to the American Automobile Association  Prices were even steeper in California at  3 78 a gallon  well above the national average of  2 74 a gallon   Ultimately  Los Angeles could get close to seeing that average at  4 a gallon   Patrick DeHaan  head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy  said  adding that much of that increase will come because of refinery outages in the state   At least one county in California has already surpassed  4 a gallon  The highest recorded average price for the state was  4 67 a gallon  in October 2012  according to AAA   
The high coastal prices attracted barrels from the biggest U S  competitor  Brazil  Overall ethanol imports to the United States totaled 558 279 barrels in March  the most seasonally since 2013  according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data  Most of the imports during the month came from Brazil  according to the tracking data ",2019-04-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/midwest-floods-hammer-us-ethanol-industry-push-some-gasoline-prices-toward-fiveyear-high-1829672,1829672
176896,398412,SO,Whatever it takes  Part 2   Five questions for the ECB,news,"By Dhara Ranasinghe  Ritvik Carvalho and Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON  Reuters    Just a month after the European Central Bank halted plans to normalize policy and delayed a rate increase into 2020  further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors is putting the central bank back in the spotlight  No policy changes are expected at Wednesday s ECB meeting  especially since some board members are traveling to Washington for the International Monetary Fund s spring meetings  But talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks  global recession fears and a sense of alarm that pushed 10 year German bond yields below zero percent for the first time since 2016 suggest the ECB news conference may prove lively  We look at five key questions on the radar for markets  1  How close is the ECB to action to offset the impact of negative interest rates on banks  A debate on whether to  tier  the negative interest rates that banks pay on the idle cash they park at the ECB is now underway  judging by recent ECB comments and the minutes from the March meeting    It s not an obvious next step  but one that the ECB will have to face at some point   said James Rossiter  senior global strategist at TD Securities   We don t expect anything official in the ECB s statement  but it will be difficult for  ECB chief Mario  Draghi to avoid questions on this   Dutch central bank Governor Klaas Knot has said he would need to see clear evidence that negative rates were hurting lending to the real economy  ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said last week that while the bank is studying ways to cut its charge on banks  deposits  euro zone lenders should look closer to home for the causes of their meager profits  The debate is important because if the ECB introduces tiered rates  that might suggest it is preparing to keep interest rates low  below zero percent  for longer than anticipated  No surprise then  that money markets have scaled back expectations of a rate rise and even started to factor in the risk of a rate cut this year    Graphic  When will the ECB raise interest rates      2  What about TLTRO III  can we expect more details  In March  the ECB offered some details of what TLTRO III will look like  the loans will have a two year maturity and be offered on a quarterly basis from September until March 2021  The ECB s March meeting minutes showed the bank is still ironing out details  Key questions for investors now are what interest the banks will have to pay on the loans and where the funds can be deployed   Barclays   LON BARC  analysts  for example  expect banks will be given an incentive to take up the loans through better borrowing rates than the main refinancing operations  MRO   which provide the bulk of liquidity to the euro zone banking system   Euro zone bank stocks and government bonds are sensitive to any TLTRO news  Yields on short dated Southern  NYSE SO  European bonds have dropped  suggesting investors expect Italian banks in particular to take up the loans    Graphic  Euro zone bank stocks cheer signs of multi year loans     3  Does the ECB see any green shoots for the economy  The ECB is not expected to change its assessment that risks to the economy are tilted to the downside but officials are worried about the downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts   Unexpectedly weak manufacturing activity data from Germany rattled markets last month  and a brief inversion of the U S  bond yield curve fueled concerns about global recession risks  Germany s leading economic institutes last week slashed their 2019 forecast for growth in Europe s biggest economy and warned growth might be even lower if there is a no deal Brexit  Not all the data have been bad  and economists point out a pick up in data from China    the world s number two economy    and signs of strength from the euro zone services sector   Graphic  Euro zone economic data     4  How concerned is the ECB that ultra loose policy has failed to lift inflation expectations  Even after last month s unexpectedly dovish tone from the central bank  inflation and inflation expectations remain low  Draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation  only for the data to disappoint him and force the ECB to ask for even more time to lift prices  A closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices slowed to 1 0 percent in March  its weakest reading since April 2018  Economists note the timing of Easter distorts the inflation numbers and that the April data should prove more encouraging   It might not feel or look like it  but inflation has been delayed rather than derailed   said Jefferies senior European economist Marchel Alexandrovich  The ECB will be hoping that s the case  especially since inflation expectations have tumbled  A key market gauge of long term inflation expectations tracked by the ECB is near its lowest level since 2016  It is down 20 basis points this year    more than it fell the whole of 2018    Graphic  Below target inflation      5  Is the ECB ready for a no deal Brexit  Draghi told European Union leaders recently that the ECB  the Bank of England and the European Commission have made all the necessary preparations for a no deal Brexit  according to a recent report  But Draghi and other officials have also stressed that markets are not fully pricing in the risk of Britain s exit from the EU without a deal    a warning the ECB chief may repeat this week   A no deal Brexit might also affect market liquidity  the EU commissioner in charge of financial services said last week   Any clarity on Brexit is likely to be met with relief by investors and boost sentiment  The ECB is no doubt paying close attention  For an interactive version of the below chart  click here

176897,398413,SO,Let The Clean Coal Battle Begin,opinion,"I recently wrote about the possibility of a resurgence of coal stocks spurred by new policy backed by the Republican controlled Congress next term 
I reminded readers that coal never really went away  It was   and still is   the most significant single source of power generation in the world 
It just has a bad reputation  Of all the fossil fuels  coal is considered the dirtiest as it emits the most carbon dioxide   almost twice as much as natural gas  depending on the type of coal burned 
To counteract this  the Republicans have resorted to drastic measures 
The Dirty Truth
Carbon emissions are the root cause of the climate change argument  And the type of coal burned makes a difference in terms of emission 
For instance  in China  the coal contains more moisture and burns less efficiently  creating even more carbon emissions 

The science behind the damage is irrefutable  But it has not prevented proponents of the coal industry from moving forward with solutions that keep coal in the energy game 
These solutions fall under the category of  clean coal  
Airing Out the Filthy Laundry
Now  by promoting clean coal  Republicans are really just playing the part of environmentalists 
There s no such thing as  clean  coal  I would liken it to  light  cigarettes   it sounds less harmful  but it s still toxic 
What clean coal really means is hiding coal emissions by capturing them and using them or storing them  The reasoning is quite simple  If you can prevent carbon dioxide emissions from getting into the atmosphere  as it does currently  then emissions are therefore reduced 
But the logic doesn t hold water  None of the methods actually reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produced  They just redistribute it using different methods 
There are several methods by which carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced or captured  The most popular of which is carbon sequestration  That is  carbon dioxide is captured and pumped underground  as far as two miles  with the intention that it will never resurface 
The second method is using filtration systems that will clean the emissions before they get into the atmosphere  The by product of which is again sequestered  A third method is to gasify the carbon and reuse it as fuel 
This last method is where the opportunity may lay 
Making Not So Dirty Money
Southern Company  SO  is building a plant in Mississippi to capture carbon emissions and convert them into gas that can be sold on the market  Southern also plans to sell the technology to the Chinese  who have an abundance of coal but lack gas 
The plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 2013 at a cost of  2 2 billion  The estimate now is completion in 2016 at a cost of more than  6 billion  That s not exactly as planned  and the shareholders will ultimately bear the brunt of the cost overruns 
There s also a new type of coal plant  in Saskatchewan  Canada  that just opened for business  This plant  referred to as the Boundary Dam Project  will capture and sell over 90  of the carbon emissions it produces 
Coal may never be clean  but it certainly could get much more profitable than anyone ever imagined  Stay tuned for more 
And  the chase  continues

176913,398429,SO,The Best Utility Stocks To Own Right Now,opinion,After all of the gyrations of the market in 2011  it turns out that utilities were the best performing sector of the S P 500 last year  posting 15  returns  So far this year  however  utilities have missed out on the broad market rally  These stocks are down roughly 2   while the S P has risen 11   But investors shouldn t forget about these dependable income stocks  In fact  I ve found some utilities that yield as high as 6   which is nothing to sneeze at  Consider the fact that stocks in the S P 500 currently yield an average of less than 2   while 10 year Treasuries yield slightly above 2  The reason utilities are off to a slow start is the unusually mild winter  which caused U S  households to use 9  less electricity than the previous year  Lower sales squeezed utility profit margins  But the longer term outlook of the utility sector is good  Energy demand is expected to rise  which will likely push utility stocks up  As a result  analysts expect utility sector earnings to rise an average of 4  to 6  a year  with similar growth in dividend payments    And right now  investors can take advantage of this situation by purchasing utility stocks at discount prices while locking in exceptionally high yields and watch their dividends grow    With this in mind  I went looking for utility stocks with strong cash flow  capacity upgrades and expansion plans in place  and generous yields  Here are three I find especially attractive     1  Pepco Holdings  NYSE  POM  Yield  6  Pepco Holdings Inc  is one of the largest energy utilities in the Mid Atlantic region  serving about 2 million customers in Delaware  the District of Columbia  Maryland and New Jersey  Pepco supplies electricity  natural gas and energy management services to its customers    Despite lower energy demand  Pepco was able to deliver 2  earnings growth in 2011 to  283 million  compared with  277 million in 2010  This growth was primarily the result of rate increases  higher margins on electricity sales and reduced interest expense    Pepco also invested  900 million in infrastructure upgrades and plans to invest about  5 6 billion during the next five years in energy distribution and transmission systems improvements    The company has filed for rate increase approvals in three states  If approved  Pepco s annual earnings should see a 10  boost  These rate increases are expected to go into effect in mid 2012    Pepco pays a  1 08 annual dividend and yields just under 6   Cash flow provides three fold coverage of the dividend  In the past five years  dividend growth has been just 1   but analysts say future earnings gains  projected at 4  5  a year  can support rising dividends   2  PP L Corp   NYSE  PPL  Yield  5  PP L controls 19 000 megawatts of power generating capacity and delivers electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers in the United States and the United Kingdom    The company has aggressive plans to improve capacity generation  Last year  it acquired two Kentucky utilities and bought a Pennsylvania power plant just last month   In 2011  the company registered a strong performance by its U K  subsidiary and was benefited by a favorable Supreme Court ruling that allowed PP L to be refunded the rent money it used to pay the state of Montana for its hydroelectric operations in the Missouri River  These two events alone resulted in nearly 60  earnings growth compared with the year before  bringing in a total of  1 5 billion  and a 25  growth in earnings per share  EPS  to  2 70  Consensus analyst estimates predict 5  earnings growth   in each of the next five years     PP L s dividend payout is less than one third of cash flow  and the company recently hiked the dividend 3  to a  1 44 annual rate  This was the eighth dividend increase in nine years  PP L shares yield roughly 5  based on the new dividend rate   3  The Southern Co   NYSE  SO  Yield  4  Southern Co  owns more than 42 000 megawatts of power generating capacity and is the largest generator of electricity in the Southeastern United States  The company provides electricity to 4 4 million retail customers in Alabama  Florida  Georgia  Mississippi and the Carolinas    Southern has a more diverse revenue stream than most utilities  it also owns wholesale power marketing  along with fiber optics and wireless communications businesses    Southern s earnings rose 12  to  2 2 billion in 2011 from  1 97 billion in 2010  while earnings improved 8  to  2 57 per share in the same period  Earnings were higher because of a utility rate increase in Georgia and the signing of new long term contracts that increased margins on natural gas sales     The Southeast markets Southern serves are growing faster than other regions of the country  The company also benefits from automakers such as Kia and Mercedes Benz  which are building new manufacturing plants in the region    In the next three years  Southern plans to invest  14 billion in transmission systems and expansion of power generating capacity  Management targets 5  to 7  earnings growth in each of the next five years  Analysts say the company can easily deliver 6  annual earnings gains     Southern delivers much faster dividend growth than most utilities  Dividends have grown more than 40  in 10 years  The last dividend hike was a 4  increase last April to a  1 89 annual rate  with another increase likely to take place this year  Payout is modest at less than 30  of cash flow  which leaves plenty of cushion for more dividend growth    Risks to consider  Pepco may not be granted its request to hike rates this year  In addition  the company is raising funds through an equity offering that is dilutive to shareholders  Southern plans to build nuclear plants in Georgia  but is encountering roadblocks from environmental groups that want to block its construction    Though the three utilities I mentioned here are great investments  my top pick overall is Southern Co  because it offers the best prospects for high dividend growth  Southern is also more diversified  has a foothold in faster growing Southeastern markets and a stellar dividend record  Pepco and PP L are good picks for investors who want safety  high income and improving growthby Lisa

176914,398430,SO,5 Safe Stocks To Own Before The Next Market Crash,opinion,There s a tried and true maxim on Wall Street  Stocks fall a lot faster than they rise  There are myriad examples  and the sharp plunge of 1987 is just one  The economy was growing at a nice clip  corporate profits were on the rise  and investors were pouring into the market  And then   Black Friday  came on October 19  1987  pushing the S P 500 down more than 20  in a single day  The fact that stocks had risen 250  in the previous five years led to a great deal of complacency  as few potential land mines stood on the horizon    Looking back  we still don t even know what caused the crash  Some think it was due to computer driven trading programs that fed off each other in a cycle of negativity  or that maybe underlying derivatives had lost enough value to cause a cascading effect of unwinding contracts  Others simply suggest that the market was due for a breather and a mild sell off turned into a panic driven rush for the exits as they day wore on    We ll never know  Fast forward to 2012  and the skies are again seemingly clear  In fact  we ve just emerged from a risky phase for the global economy  and the economic backdrop holds few land mines in the near term  But still waters run deep  and you have to always think about the risks of a seemingly benign market mood  So it s simply prudent to make sure that  at this phase in the market cycle  your portfolio also contains a handful of deeply defensive stocks that will more likely hold their own if the major indices slump badly    Here are five stocks that have  bomb shelter  like qualities    1       Abbott Labs  NYSE  ABT   While many health care related companies tend to focus on one core strengths such as insurance  hospital ownership  niche drug development or specialized medical devices  Abbott plays the field by selling hundreds of products to a range of customers  This will never be a fast grower  Then again  sales have never fallen in any of the past 20 years  The current  40 billion revenue base benefits from a huge degree of recurring revenue and  thanks to modest annual price increases  management is always able to maintain 20  to 25  EBITDA margins regardless of any cost pressures the company may face  2  Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE  ADM  The agricultural titan has its share of challenges  Profit margins can fluctuate as input prices and end market prices gyrate back and forth  But because ADM controls so much of the agro industrial complex  it is better insulated from the booms and busts that would rock its smaller rivals in the farm belt  The timing for this stock is good  Analysts think margin trends will soon swing back in ADM s favor  which is why they think earnings per share  EPS  will rise from around  2 50 in fiscal  June  2012 to around  3 in fiscal 2013 and  3 50 in fiscal 2014   3  Verizon  NYSE  VZ  No company has handled the migration from wire line to wireless phones as adroitly as Verizon  Management has been steadily reducing expenses at the legacy wire line business  freeing up resources to further cement its gains in the industry leading wireless business  Even in adverse economic times  consumers would be loathe to cut back on their need to stay connected  Indeed today s smartphones are a lot like an addictive drug  Try going a week without one  The fact that Verizon currently sports a 5  dividend yield means shares have ample downside protection  Any sell off in the stock would simply boost the yield  making it newly attractive to a fresh base of investors  whose buying would presumably push shares back up     4  Loews  NYSE  L  There are plenty of insurance stocks that would represent safety in a plunging market  But Loews is so broadly diversified that it is insulated from the vagaries of any one particular insurance niche  Not only is Loews involved in all kinds of insurance  it also owns a hefty slate of energy assets  such as offshore drilling rigs and natural gas rigs and pipelines  The fact that the stock s current market value of  15 7 billion is actually lower than the book value of  18 8 billion just underscores the relative safety of this stock    5     Southern Co   NYSE  SO  I could mention almost any power utility  but Southern Co  is an exemplary industry play  The company s 4 6  return on assets  ROA  and 12 3  return on equity  ROE  are among the best in the business  The fact that the company s dividend grows about 4  every year would surely be noticed by investors as they made a flight to safety  If you buy shares today  you ll be getting a yield of about 4   but thanks to the power of compounding  you could be scoring double digit annual yields  based on your original cost  if you hold this stock into the next decade   Risks to Consider  These stocks are unlikely to fall nearly as much as the broader market in a major sell off  but would likely take a moderate hit as investors pull funds    Building a portfolio around these kinds of stocks is suitable for the most conservative investors  especially those nearing retirement  For more aggressive investors  you need simply to think about having a degree of exposure to these safer stocks  even as you remain more squarely focused on high beta stocks that are leveraged to a growing economy  by David

176915,398431,SO,Southern Co  A Solid Dividend Choice Worth Waiting For,opinion,Southern Company  SO  is a high quality regulated utility that also participates in competitive markets across the southeastern United States  Since the recession of 2001  Southern Company has generated a consistent record of moderate earnings growth and the company fared better during the great recession than it did during the recession of 2001  Consequently  their dividend was frozen for several years up through calendar year 2000  but has been increasing steadily ever since  Although the company offers an above average current yield  valuation is high relative to historical norms    Dividend Contender   Southern Co    This article looks at Southern Co  a Dividend Contender  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures   In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life      A Dividend Contender is defined as a company that has increased its dividend for a minimum of 10   24 straight years  Southern Co is a Dividend Contender that has raised its dividend every year for 11 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Contenders list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Contender list   With 4 4 million customers and more than 42 000 megawatts of generating capacity  Atlanta based Southern Company  NYSE  SO  is the premier energy company serving the Southeast  A leading U S  producer of electricity  Southern Company owns electric utilities in four states and a growing competitive generation company  as well as fiber optics and wireless communications  Southern Company brands are known for excellent customer service  high reliability and retail electric prices that are below the national average  Southern Company was named the World s Most Admired Electric and Gas Utility by Fortune magazine in 2011  and is consistently listed among the top U S  electric service providers in customer satisfaction by the American Customer Satisfaction Index  Southern Co  A Dividend Contender with 11 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Southern Co s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Southern Co has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 3 6   see purple circle on graph  per annum Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1    The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2    The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Southern CoThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 4 1  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Southern Co would have received an additional  81 899 35 in dividends that increased their total return from 4 1  to 6 9  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Contender it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 10 24  years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as high as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Southern Co is 2 31  which is historically high Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Southern Co represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Contender at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Southern Co has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 21 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Southern Co long term earnings growth at 5 8   Southern Co has medium long term debt at 50  of capital  Southern Co is currently trading at a P E of 17 6  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Southern Co s True Worth valuation would be  52 62 at the end of 2017  which would be a 6 7  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Southern Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Southern Co s expected earnings would be 3 9 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Contenders Southern Co  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on Southern Co Summary   ConclusionsWe believe that Southern Company represents an extremely high quality option for the investors seeking a high level of current income with an opportunity to grow moderately  However  we believe the current valuation is a little extended notwithstanding expectations for future growth of 5  to 6  that exceeds the historical 3   to 4  average  Although Southern Company s current stock price is currently within our corridor of value  the orange lines on the estimated earnings and return calculator   it is at the high end  Therefore  we would be more comfortable in recommending Southern Company if the PE ratio were a couple of points lower  On the other hand  Southern Company is an extremely high quality and stable utility that may be worth waiting for Disclosure   No position at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should

176916,398432,SO,Weighing The Week Ahead  Are Hopes Too High For Jackson Hole ,opinion,After weeks of anticipation  we may get the answer to a key question  Will the Fed launch another round of Quantitative Easing  Since the decision for QE II is linked to Fed Chair Bernanke s 2010 speech to the annual Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole  some expect a similar outcome this time  There is obvious confusion  Stocks rallied as the Fed minutes seemed to show a greater receptiveness for more QE  Stocks sold off when St  Louis Fed President  a non voting member whose hawkish views are well known  said that the minutes were  stale  and that data had improved  Stocks then rallied a bit when Chicago Fed President Evans basically said the opposite  Finally  there was a significant reversal on Friday when WSJ reporter Jon Hilsenrath  from Bernanke to   R  Cal    responding to some questions he had posed by mail  The answers contained nothing new  but market participants seized upon the date of the letter  The idea is that this is the most recent information  Here s more evidence of confusion  dedicated to those who are always opining about the  message of the market   Headline in   Price of gold surges on Fed stimulus hopes  is it headed for  2 000  And   Wall St falls on dimmed Fed stimulus hopes  dataTwo stories    published within minutes of each other  For the flexible pundit  it is easy to derive whatever message you want  Figuring out what the market really expects is a big challenge this week  I ll offer some of my own expectations in the conclusion  but first let us do our regular review of last week s news  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead  There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  With foreign markets setting the tone for US trading on many days  I especially like the comprehensive calendar from Investing com  There is also helpful descriptive and historical information on each item  In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios  This is unlike my other articles where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context  Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market Last Week s Data Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good There was quite a bit of economic data last week  and it had a generally positive tone Rail traffic is modestly higher  via    Taxpayers cashing in on toxic assets  While we are still toting up the net results  some of the bailout decisions have paid off on the specific investments  in addition to the possible benefit for the overall economy  Here is a  by Todd Sullivan  always worth reading  Durable goods set a record high  Some definitely embraced the bright side  Here is Mark Perry s chart  but also see below under  The Bad   Auto sales are solid  In support of the full durable goods metric   the authoritative JD Power survey  suggesting that car sales will reach a 4 1 2 year high  This is clearly helping employment and GDP  so it seems relevant New home sales continue to improve  Here is the  The Bad The was a little negative news Gasoline prices moved higher  up another eight cents  via   and getting into dangerous  choke collar  territory  Individual investors are more bullish in the American Association of Individual Investors Survey  This is a contrarian indicator  of course  suggesting that those in the survey are mistaken  Here is the   Because of the honest depiction of data  you can judge for yourself whether the relationship is strong and enduring Chinese growth is overstated and falling  I have frequently mentioned this concern  There is additional evidence  via   that official data exaggerates the story in China  Meanwhile  the flash PMI from HSBC showed contraction in the headline number and also specific categories  It is important to monitor developments in China  Core durable goods are weak  especially in real terms  Doug Short does a series of adjustments for population  inflation  and non transportation expenditures  His take is much more discouraging than Mark Perry s  above   Steven Hansen   Here is Doug s summary chart  but it is important to  and see the complete series of charts if you want to understand the argument Bearish indicators    both short and long term  from Dr  Ed Yardeni  Here is the chart for his three variable fundamental method  His conclusion is as follows  On balance  I think that stock prices may move sideways between now and the November elections  It s certainly hard to characterize the rally since June 1 as a  Romney Rally  given that the presidential race remains in a dead heat  A few pundits have suggested that it s actually been an  Obama Rally   figuring that the market favors the devil we all know rather than the one we don t  The Ugly The fiscal cliff    as   The nonpartisan Congressional source sees an economic contraction of 0 5  if Congress fails to act on the looming changes to current law  James Hamilton  and it is a good one  He accurately notes that the problem lies with a system of government where we reward pandering to specific interests  Here is his very sensible assessment  Let me begin by making clear my personal position up front  I think America faces a serious long term fiscal challenge  Not one that needs to be addressed in 2013   trying to fix this all at once would be   But I believe that the American political system is badly broken  The voting public expects to get something for nothing  and the two parties compete to promise to give them exactly that  I m persuaded that both tax increases and drastic entitlement reform will eventually be necessary  I would like to see debate and even a consensus reached today on exactly how we plan to implement both measures over time  If only we could see such wisdom  Professor Hamilton suggests that either or both candidates might benefit from demonstrating the ability to compromise  We ll see the first act this week in Tampa  The Silver Bullet I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to   He takes on the latest oddball recession indicator  Trash  Michael McDonough from Bloomberg  with this chart   He had some fun by  talking trash  in the interviews  The chart aligns the two series based upon the most recent and most dramatic decline in 2009  It is pretty rough before that  The eyes can deceive  But   He also has fun by  trashing a garbage indicator  and invoking GIGO  He notes that the data is based upon quarterly results  but McDonough rushed to print and the talk show circuit with only part of a quarter  In fact  the data from last year    not this year    seems to have been distorted by some abnormal results in the first part of the quarter  We will not know the final verdict until the end of the quarter  but that is not the point  This is an error in data analysis and a premature announcement  I wonder if Bloomberg or NPR will follow up  as they should  Why not interview NDD  The Indicator Snapshot It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   Bob and I recently did some videos explaining the recession history  I am working on a post that will show how to use this method  As I have written for many months  there is no imminent recession concern  I showed the significance of this last week by explaining the relationship to the business cycle  The evidence against the ECRI recession forecast continues to mount  It is disappointing that those with the best forecasting records get so much less media attention  The idea that a recession has already started is losing credibility with most observers  I urge readers to check out the list of excellent updates from prior posts  Readers might also want to review my new   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong  The single best resource for the ECRI call and the ongoing debate is Doug Short  This week s article   describes the complete history  the critics  and how it has played out   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we continued as bullish  We have been bullish since June 23rd  with a one week move to neutral a few weeks ago  These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  The ratings are higher  and the confidence is improving   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead This is a big week for economic data  On my A List are the following  Initial claims  Th  which continue to provide the most up to date read on jobs and the economyConsumer confidence  Conference Board   T  Michigan  F  important for employment and spendingBeige Book  W  which normally does not surprise  but will have heightened attention this monthAlso important are these  Housing data includine Case Shiller prices  T  and Pending home sales  W Chicago PMI  F  which is important as a pre weekend clue about the national ISM reportPersonal income and spending  Th   July data  but interesting to confirm retail salesQ2 GDP revisions  Backward looking but still important given the modest growth levels The GOP convention will grab some headlines  It will be interesting  but I do not see an immediate market angle  Most important of all will be the Jackson Hole symposium  with Bernanke s morning speech on Friday and Draghi scheduled on Saturday  Trading Time Frame Our trading positions continued in fully invested mode last week  Felix became more aggressive in a timely fashion  near the start of the summer rally  Since we only require three buyable sectors  the trading accounts look for the  bull market somewhere  even when the overall picture is neutral  As the tape has improved  the ratings from Felix have gotten stronger  Felix does not try to call tops and bottoms  but keeps us on the right side of major moves  We had one  neutral  forecast about a month ago  but things never got weak enough to reduce positions  Investor Time Frame More sources are joining us in warning about chasing yield  Jacqueline Doherty does a great job on this front in the current issue of Barron s   She looks a valuations on a sector by sector basis  noting  nosebleed valuations  for popular companies like Southern Company  SO  and Verizon  VZ   Dividend investing is fine  but you must look past the dividend yield and study the earnings  earnings growth rate  cash flow  balance sheet  and payout ratio   that the volatility indexes seem out of line with reality  He notes the potential for some sophisticated arbitrage opportunities  but these are not available to the average investor  The most important lesson is his warning about buying volatility because you have read about headline risks  How many times must we repeat that the market has already priced what you read in your morning paper  If you have been following our regular advice  you have done the following  Replaced your bond mutual funds with individual bonds Sold some calls against your modest dividend stocks to enhance yield to the 10  range  andAdded some octane with a reasonable input of good stocks There is nothing more satisfying than collecting good returns in a sideways market  If you have not done so  it is certainly not too late  We have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments welcome   Final Thoughts on Jackson Hole Last week I predicted that the Fed will eventually act  but perhaps with something other than another round of QE  Jon Hilsenrath s take plays this down  and he has good connections  Perhaps I am wrong  I remain open to new information  I do not expect anything significant from Jackson Hole  so there is potential for a market disappointment  It would not be the first time that I have disagreed with Felix  and the verdict has been mixed  Here is my rationale  Jackson Hole is typically not the forum for policy announcements  It is an occasion for mixing and exchanging ideas  Most speeches by the Fed Chair are of the cerebral and background variety The 2010 Bernanke speech is a piece of Wall Street truthiness  In fact  there was little immediate market reaction  Stocks were lower a few days later  It was only after a big rally that those seeking a bogus correlation reached back to the  hints  from the Jackson Hole speech  In fact  there was nothing new in these hints  and the official policy did not start until November  When someone is on a mission to prove something  and has a choice of starting dates  it makes it easier to create bogus correlations The jury is still out  There is no reason for Bernanke to tip his hand before getting the employment report for August I have a dozen links  not included  to stories speculating about this and forcefully explaining what the Fed should do  Most of them confuse personal opinion and politics with forecasting  For those seeking investment success  the key question is what the Fed will do  not what you think it should do ,2012-08-27,Jeff

176992,398508,SO,Explainer  Why Trump s legal woes go beyond the Mueller report,news,"By Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON  Reuters    The closure of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election does not mark the end of legal worries for President Donald Trump and people close to him  Other continuing investigations and litigation are focusing on issues including his businesses and financial dealings  personal conduct  charitable foundation and inaugural committee  The special counsel on Friday submitted his confidential report on the investigation to U S  Attorney General William Barr  who must decide on how much of it to make public  On Sunday Barr released a summary of Mueller s findings that said the investigation did not find that President Donald Trump committed a crime but also does not exonerate him  The summary also said Mueller found no evidence that any member of Trump s election campaign conspired with Russia during the election  While Mueller s probe has ended  the other investigations  pursued by prosecutors at the federal and state level  could result in charges beyond those brought by Mueller or civil liability  The U S  Justice Department has a decades old policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges  so such a case against Trump would be unlikely while he is in office even if there were evidence of wrongdoing  Some legal experts have argued the department is wrong and that a president is not immune from prosecution  Either way  Trump potentially could face charges once he is out of office   Here is an explanation of some criminal investigations and civil lawsuits still under way  MUELLER S CRIMINAL CASES Mueller charged 34 individuals and three companies  Several of those cases resulted in guilty pleas and one case went to trial  with former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort convicted in August 2018 of eight criminal counts  including bank fraud and tax fraud  Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted in January of this year and pleaded not guilty  but his trial is still pending  There are other cases involving indicted Russians that have not gone to trial  Other prosecutors within the Justice Department will likely take over criminal cases begun by Mueller  legal experts said  BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL DEALINGS Trump may face significant peril from federal prosecutors in Manhattan  according to legal experts  His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in Feb  27 congressional testimony that the U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York is examining Trump s business practices and financial dealings  Cohen already has implicated Trump in campaign finance law violations to which he pleaded guilty in August 2018 as part of the Southern District investigation  Cohen admitted he violated campaign finance laws by arranging  at Trump s direction   hush money  payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election to porn film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal to prevent damage to Trump s candidacy  Both women said they had sexual relationships with Trump more than a decade ago  He has denied that  Prosecutors said the payments constituted illegal campaign contributions intended to influence the election  Under federal election laws  such donations cannot exceed  2 700 and need to be publicly disclosed  Daniels  whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford  received  130 000  McDougal received  150 000  The New York investigation has involved longtime Trump ally David Pecker  publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper  who admitted to paying McDougal for the rights to her story and then suppressing it to influence the election  an arrangement called  catch and kill    During his Feb  27 congressional hearing  Cohen said he was in  constant contact  with federal prosecutors in Manhattan  and said other crimes and wrongdoing by Trump are being investigated by them  though he did not offer details  Cohen said he could not testify about the nature of his last conversation with Trump in early 2018 because it was under investigation by the federal prosecutors in New York  NEW YORK STATE CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT The Manhattan district attorney s office is exploring criminal charges against Paul Manafort  President Donald Trump s former campaign chairman  over financial crimes related to unpaid state taxes and possibly loans  In cases bought by Mueller  Manafort in 2018 was convicted of tax fraud  bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts in Virginia and pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in Washington  He was sentenced to a combined 7 1 2 years in prison in the two cases  Trump has not ruled out granting Manafort a pardon  The president would not be able to pardon Manafort if he is convicted of charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney because they would not be federal crimes  However  New York has broad double jeopardy protections that usually prevent the state from prosecuting a person for crimes arising from the same criminal conduct the federal government has prosecuted before  SUMMER ZERVOS DEFAMATION LAWSUIT A defamation lawsuit against Trump by Summer Zervos  a former contestant on his reality television show  The Apprentice   continues in New York state court after a judge in 2018 allowed it to proceed  Zervos sued Trump after he called her and other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct liars and retweeted a post labeling her claims a hoax  Trump has agreed to provide written answers to questions from Zervos by Sept  28  according to a court filing  Zervos accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her at a meeting at a hotel in California  More than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics  Marc Kasowitz  a lawyer for Trump  had argued that the lawsuit unconstitutionally impedes the president from performing his duties  An appeals court rejected that argument on March 14 by a 3 2 vote  Kasowitz said he would appeal the decision to the state s highest court  Separately  two lawsuits against Trump brought by porn star Stormy Daniels were dismissed  THE TRUMP FOUNDATION A lawsuit filed by the New York state Attorney General s Office has already led the Donald J  Trump Foundation  which was presented as the charitable arm of Trump s business empire  to agree in December 2018 to dissolve  and the litigation continues   The state is seeking an order banning Trump and his three eldest children from leadership roles in any other New York charity  Trump has said the lawsuit was concocted by  sleazy New York Democrats   The state s Democratic attorney general accused the foundation of being  engaged in a  shocking pattern of illegality  and  functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr  Trump s business and political interests  in violation of federal law  The attorney general s office alleged Trump and his family members used the charity to pay off his legal debts and purchase personal items  The foundation agreed to dissolve and give away all its remaining assets under court supervision   EMOLUMENTS  LAWSUIT Trump is accused in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia of violating anti corruption provisions of the U S  Constitution through his businesses  dealings with foreign governments  The Richmond  Virginia based 4th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on March 19 in the Trump administration s appeal of U S  District Judge Peter Messitte s 2018 rulings allowing the case to proceed  The Constitution s  emoluments clause  bars U S  officials from accepting payments from foreign governments and the governments of U S  states without congressional approval  The lawsuit stated that because Trump did not divest himself of his business empire  spending by foreign governments at the Trump International Hotel in Washington amounts to unconstitutional gifts  or  emoluments   to the president  The three appeals court judges  all appointed by Republican presidents  expressed approval toward Trump s arguments in the case and signaled they might dismiss it  but did not issue a ruling  Some experts have said the case will eventually be heard by the U S  Supreme Court  TRUMP INAUGURAL COMMITTEE Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether the committee that organized Trump s inauguration in January 2017 accepted illegal donations from foreigners  misused funds or brokered special access to the administration for donors  Federal election law prohibits foreigners from donating to U S  political campaigns or inaugural committees  and corruption laws ban donors from making contributions in exchange for political favors  Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in December 2018 that the president was not involved in his inaugural committee  The  107 million raised by the committee  which was chaired by real estate developer and investor Thomas Barrack  was

176995,398511,SO,Cathay Buys Hong Kong Express to Enter Budget Airline Market,news," Bloomberg     Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd  agreed to buy Hong Kong s only budget carrier to enter the no frills market  after more than a decade resisting such a move to focus on premium services 
Cathay will pay HK 2 25 billion   287 million  in cash for Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd   the flag carrier said in a filing Tuesday  The flag carrier will also be issued HK 2 68 billion in promissory loan notes for the transaction 
The deal is expected to be completed by Dec  31  Cathay said  HNA Aviation Group Co  is the seller s guarantor  according to the filing 
The acquisition will give Cathay a crucial piece of business that s missing from its operations and will lift its market share to more than 50 percent in Hong Kong  home to Asia s busiest international airport  It will also provide Cathay with a new revenue source as the region s growing economies allow more people to fly and as Chinese rivals expand with direct flights to Europe and U S   bypassing the need to transit in Hong Kong 
Asia Pacific s burgeoning market will probably see the largest increase in air traffic worldwide  with almost 4 billion passenger journeys expected in the next two decades 
Cathay is more than a decade behind Asian arch rival Singapore Airlines Ltd  in entering the no frills business  and has seen demand for some shorter routes eroded by low cost airlines while Chinese and Middle Eastern carriers chip away at premium and long haul demand 
As airlines from Australia to India acknowledged the travel aspirations of Asia s rising middle class by setting up budget carriers including Jetstar  Peach Aviation and IndiGo  Cathay sat tight on its premium roots  Profits were further eroded as mainland carriers began offering cheaper  direct flights to the U S  from Chinese cities including Shanghai and Guangzhou  reducing the need to fly via Cathay or Hong Kong 
In March 2017  Cathay reported the first annual net loss in eight years and said it was embarking on a three year transformation program to improve its operational efficiency and returns 
In April that year  it named a new chief executive officer  Rupert Hogg  who said a few months later that Cathay  broadly  had no plan to begin a low cost carrier  Less than a year later  Cathay s parent  Swire Pacific Ltd   named Merlin Swire as chairman  marking the return of a Swire family member to lead the conglomerate 
The overhaul amid the management changes appears to be bearing fruit  After cutting at least 600 jobs  adding destinations  and improving services  the carrier ended a two year run of losses and posted its first full year profit in 2018 
Apart from Hong Kong Express  airlines looking to start frills free operations in the city have been met with opposition  In 2015  Hong Kong rejected an application from Jetstar Hong Kong Airways Ltd   saying it didn t comply with legal requirements to operate such a business  Cathay also voiced its objection to the budget airline    a venture of Qantas Airways Ltd  and China Eastern Airlines Corp  that s backed by billionaire Stanley Ho s Shun Tak Holdings Ltd 
Hong Kong s position as an aviation hub has been threatened in recent years as airports in the mainland have been expanding to handle more international passengers  while Chinese carriers are either adding direct routes to the U S  and Europe or teaming up with U S  peers to expand their networks  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   took a minority stake in China Eastern in 2015 and American Airlines Group Inc  announced a similar deal with China Southern  NYSE SO  Airlines Co  in 2017 
For Chinese conglomerate HNA Group  the disposal is part of its efforts to trim one of China s biggest debt piles by selling dozens of assets from hotels to aircraft leasing and inflight catering businesses

177000,398516,SO,U S  judge blocks Medicaid work requirements in Kentucky  Arkansas,news,"By Nate Raymond
 Reuters    A federal judge on Wednesday overturned the Trump administration s approval of plans by Kentucky and Arkansas to impose work requirements on people seeking Medicaid health insurance benefits 
U S  District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed to adequately consider the extent to which the Republican led states  plans would cause significant numbers of people to lose coverage 
The decisions came in separate lawsuits by Kentucky and Arkansas residents enrolled in Medicaid  It marked a setback for efforts by President Donald Trump s administration to scale back the joint federal and state healthcare program 
 The court reaffirmed the rights of financially insecure individuals to access health care   said Sam Brooke  a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Southern  NYSE SO  Poverty Law Center 
But Adam Meier of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services called the ruling  illogical  because it did not take into account whether the state s program was actually helping enrollees 
 Although a setback to our implementation schedule  we believe that we have an excellent record for appeal and are currently considering next steps   Meier said in a statement 
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson  a Republican  said in a separate statement he was disappointed by the ruling  Representatives for HHS did not respond to requests for comment 
Kentucky and Arkansas are among eight states that have received approval by HHS to impose requirements that people seeking coverage under Medicaid engage in work or job training 
HHS approved those projects as part of a push to put a conservative stamp on Medicaid  which expanded in 36 states following the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare 
In Arkansas  case  the state had already implemented its work requirements  causing about 16 000 Arkansans to lose Medicaid coverage after HHS failed to consider whether the state s plan would help its citizens  Boasberg wrote 
His ruling in Kentucky s case marked the second time Boasberg had vacated the approval of an HHS waiver needed by the state to move forward with its work requirements 
In his June 2018 ruling  Boasberg said HHS had failed to grapple with the fact that an estimated 100 000 people would lose Medicaid coverage 
HHS  in reapproving Kentucky s program  sought to address that issue by arguing that figure was dwarfed by the 450 000 who would lose coverage if Kentucky moved forward with repealing its expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare 
But Boasberg said adopting that position would allow the department to justify approving any proposed plan by a state  as long as it is accompanied by a threat that the state will de expand  Medicaid ",2019-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-judge-blocks-medicaid-work-requirements-in-kentucky-arkansas-1820240,1820240

177019,398535,SO,Justice Thomas speaks as U S  top court confronts racial bias in jury selection,news,By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Supreme Court justices appeared poised to side with a black Mississippi death row inmate put on trial six times for a 1996 quadruple murder who accused a prosecutor of repeatedly blocking black potential jurors  though the court s only black member sounded skeptical  Justice Clarence Thomas  who had not posed a question during an oral argument in three years  asked several in the case involving Curtis Flowers  48  who has argued that his constitutional right to a fair trial was violated  Thomas  an idiosyncratic conservative and only the second African American ever appointed to the court  signaled through his questions he might vote against Flowers  who otherwise drew broad support among the other justices  both liberal and conservative  The case is the latest to reach the nine member court over allegations of racial bias against minorities in the American criminal justice system  Some prosecutors  including in Southern  NYSE SO  states like Mississippi  have been accused over the decades of trying to ensure predominately white juries for trials of black defendants to help win convictions  Prosecutors and defense lawyers can dismiss   or  strike    a certain number of prospective jurors during jury selection without giving a reason  In 1986  the Supreme Court ruled that people cannot be excluded from a jury because of their race based on the right to a fair trial under the U S  Constitution s Sixth Amendment and the 14th Amendment promise of equal protection under the law   Thomas focused on whether lawyers for Flowers sought to exclude white people from the jury in the most recent trial  which would indicate that both sides used race as a factor in selecting jurors  First Thomas asked whether the defense struck any jurors  Then he asked   What was the race of the jurors struck there   Sheri Lynn Johnson  Flowers  attorney  said the jurors the defense sought to block were white  but argued that what was relevant in the case was the motives of the prosecutor  not the defense lawyer  The other justices largely sounded supportive of Flowers  claim   We can t take the history out of this case   conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh told the state s lawyer  Jason Davies  Another conservative  Justice Samuel Alito  said  the history of this case prior to this trial is very troubling  and noted that it was  cause for concern and certainly relevant  to how the justices decide the dispute  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan questioned why prosecutors excluded a black potential juror  Carolyn Wright  who had said she supported the death penalty and had an uncle who is a prison security guard   Except for her race  you would think that this is a juror that a prosecutor would love when she walks in the door  Isn t she   Kagan asked  A ruling is due by the end of June  QUESTIONS FROM THOMAS Thomas not had asked a question since a February 2016 gun rights case in which he voiced concern that people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors could permanently lose the right to own a firearm  In another 2016 case  Thomas was the sole dissenter when the court ruled in favor of a black Georgia death row inmate who made a similar jury claim   On race issues  Thomas has been a decisive vote to restrict affirmative action programs designed to help minorities overcome past discrimination  In 2013  he was part of the majority when the court struck down a key section of the Voting Rights Act  passed in 1965 to protect black voters in Southern states from ongoing discrimination  The justices heard Flowers  appeal of his 2010 conviction   in his sixth trial   on charges of murdering four people at the Tardy Furniture store where he previously worked in the small central Mississippi city of Winona  His lawyers accused long serving Montgomery County District Attorney Doug Evans of engaging in a pattern of removing black jurors that indicated an unlawful discriminatory motive  Evans has given non racial reasons for striking jurors  Flowers was found guilty in his first three trials but those convictions were thrown out by Mississippi s top court  Several blacks jurors participated in the fourth and fifth trials  which ended without a verdict because the jury both times failed to produce a unanimous decision  In the sixth trial  there were 11 white jurors and one black juror  The jury in the first trial was all white  One black juror took part in each of the three other trials  Prosecutors said Flowers was upset with the store owner for firing him and withholding his paycheck to cover the cost of batteries he previously had damaged  He was convicted of killing store owner Bertha Tardy  59  bookkeeper Carmen Rigby  45  delivery worker Robert Golden  42  and part time employee Derrick Stewart  16  All except Golden were white

emergency on Thursday as floodwaters that left a swath of destruction across Nebraska and Iowa surged downstream  swamping small towns  roads and farmland in the U S Midwest  Flooding triggered by last week s so called  bomb cyclone  storm has already inflicted damage estimated at nearly  1 5 billion in Nebraska  killed at least four people in Nebraska and Iowa and left a man missing below Nebraska s collapsed Spencer Dam   The rising floodwaters are affecting more Missouri communities and farms  closing more roads and threatening levees  water treatment plants and other critical infrastructure   Governor Mike Parson said in issuing his emergency declaration   We will continue to work closely with our local partners to assess needs and provide resources to help as Missourians continue this flood fight and as we work to assist one another   Parson said   The declaration allows resources and assistance to be provided directly to counties and municipalities that need aid to deal with worsening flood conditions locally  Public safety officials have said continued flooding of the Missouri River in the days ahead is unlikely to reach the widespread  catastrophic scale seen in Nebraska and parts of Iowa   partly because much of the excess flow has dissipated through numerous levee breaches upstream that have left less water in the river s channel  But the extensive flooding seen in Nebraska and Iowa was forecast to continue in the wider region through May and become more dire in coming weeks as water flows downstream  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  officials said on Thursday   This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season  with more than 200 million people at risk   Ed Clark  director of NOAA s National Water Center in Tuscaloosa  Alabama  said on Thursday in the agency s spring outlook  TRUMP APPROVES FEDERAL FUNDING Floodwaters have already swamped a large swath of Missouri  Nebraska and Iowa along North America s longest river  A state of emergency has been declared in all or parts of the three Midwestern farm states  U S  President Donald Trump on Thursday approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska  making federal funding available to affected individuals in nine counties in the state  as well as state  local and Native American tribal governments and some private nonprofit organizations  More rain is in the forecast for the coming days  likely exacerbating the situation    This isn t over   said David Roth  a meteorologist with the National Weather Service s Weather

threatening several Midwestern and Southern  NYSE SO  states  including Arkansas and Louisiana  About 200 people voluntarily evacuated from the small city of Winthrop and Lewis and Clark Village in Buchanan County  Missouri  after an area levee was breached on Thursday  said local emergency management coordinator Bill Brinton    These people may get flooded two or three times over the next month or so   Brinton said   Howard Geib  54  owns a farm near the town of Craig in Holt County  Missouri  which ordered a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday  Geib said a levee near his farm broke over the weekend  and he saw at least 10 levees in the county that have broken   They broke   Geib said on Thursday   There are 600   700   1 000 foot long holes in the levees   The deputy commander of the Army Corps  Omaha District  which encompasses the Missouri River watershed downstream to St  Joseph  said on Wednesday there had been more than 30 breaches across the public levee system in the region   More than 2 400 homes and businesses in Nebraska have been destroyed or damaged  with 200 miles  320 km  of roads unusable and 11 bridges wiped out  according to authorities   The state s governor  Pete Ricketts  thanked Trump for his federal disaster declaration as Nebraskans prepared to recover from what he called  the most widespread natural disaster in our state s history   Ricketts

177022,398538,SO,Explainer  Why Trump s legal woes go beyond the Mueller report,news,"By Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON  Reuters    The closure of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election does not mark the end of legal worries for President Donald Trump and people close to him  Other ongoing investigations and litigation are focusing on issues including his businesses and financial dealings  personal conduct  charitable foundation and inaugural committee  These investigations  pursued by prosecutors at the federal and state level  could result in charges beyond those brought in Mueller s investigation or civil liability  The special counsel on Friday submitted his confidential report on the investigation to U S  Attorney General William Barr  who must decide on how much of it to make public   The U S  Justice Department has a decades old policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges  so such a case against Trump would be unlikely while he is in office even if there were evidence of wrongdoing  Some legal experts have argued the department is wrong and that a president is not immune from prosecution  Either way  Trump potentially could face charges once he is out of office   Here is an explanation of some criminal investigations and civil lawsuits still underway  MUELLER S CRIMINAL CASES Mueller charged 34 individuals and three companies  Several of those cases resulted in guilty pleas and one case went to trial  with former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort convicted in August 2018 of eight criminal counts  including bank fraud and tax fraud  Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted in January of this year and pleaded not guilty  but his trial is still pending  There are other cases involving indicted Russians that have not gone to trial  Other prosecutors within the Justice Department will likely take over criminal cases begun by Mueller  legal experts said  BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL DEALINGS Trump may face significant peril from federal prosecutors in Manhattan  according to legal experts  His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in Feb  27 congressional testimony that the U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York is examining Trump s business practices and financial dealings  Cohen already has implicated Trump in campaign finance law violations to which he pleaded guilty in August 2018 as part of the Southern District investigation  Cohen admitted he violated campaign finance laws by arranging  at Trump s direction   hush money  payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election to porn film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal to prevent damage to Trump s candidacy  Both women said they had sexual relationships with Trump more than a decade ago  He has denied that  Prosecutors said the payments constituted illegal campaign contributions intended to influence the election  Under federal election laws  such donations cannot exceed  2 700 and need to be publicly disclosed  Daniels  whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford  received  130 000  McDougal received  150 000  The New York investigation has involved longtime Trump ally David Pecker  publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper  who admitted to paying McDougal for the rights to her story and then suppressing it to influence the election  an arrangement called  catch and kill    During his Feb  27 congressional hearing  Cohen said he was in  constant contact  with federal prosecutors in Manhattan  and said other crimes and wrongdoing by Trump are being investigated by them  though he did not offer details  Cohen said he could not testify about the nature of his last conversation with Trump in early 2018 because it was under investigation by the federal prosecutors in New York  NEW YORK STATE CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT The Manhattan district attorney s office is exploring criminal charges against Paul Manafort  President Donald Trump s former campaign chairman  over financial crimes related to unpaid state taxes and possibly loans  In cases bought by Mueller  Manafort in 2018 was convicted of tax fraud  bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts in Virginia and pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in Washington  He was sentenced to a combined 7 1 2 years in prison in the two cases  Trump has not ruled out granting Manafort a pardon  The president would not be able to pardon Manafort if he is convicted of charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney because they would not be federal crimes  However  New York has broad double jeopardy protections that usually prevent the state from prosecuting a person for crimes arising from the same criminal conduct the federal government has prosecuted before  SUMMER ZERVOS DEFAMATION LAWSUIT A defamation lawsuit against Trump by Summer Zervos  a former contestant on his reality television show  The Apprentice   continues in New York state court after a judge in 2018 allowed it to proceed  Zervos sued Trump after he called her and other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct liars and retweeted a post labeling her claims a hoax  Trump has agreed to provide written answers to questions from Zervos by Sept  28  according to a court filing  Zervos accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her at a meeting at a hotel in California  More than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics  Marc Kasowitz  a lawyer for Trump  had argued that the lawsuit unconstitutionally impedes the president from performing his duties  An appeals court rejected that argument on March 14 by a 3 2 vote  Kasowitz said he would appeal the decision to the state s highest court  Separately  two lawsuits against Trump brought by porn star Stormy Daniels were dismissed  THE TRUMP FOUNDATION A lawsuit filed by the New York state Attorney General s Office has already led the Donald J  Trump Foundation  which was presented as the charitable arm of Trump s business empire  to agree in December 2018 to dissolve  and the litigation continues   The state is seeking an order banning Trump and his three eldest children from leadership roles in any other New York charity  Trump has said the lawsuit was concocted by  sleazy New York Democrats   The state s Democratic attorney general accused the foundation of being  engaged in a  shocking pattern of illegality  and  functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr  Trump s business and political interests  in violation of federal law  The attorney general s office alleged Trump and his family members used the charity to pay off his legal debts and purchase personal items  The foundation agreed to dissolve and give away all its remaining assets under court supervision   EMOLUMENTS  LAWSUIT Trump is accused in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia of violating anti corruption provisions of the U S  Constitution through his businesses  dealings with foreign governments  The Richmond  Virginia based 4th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on March 19 in the Trump administration s appeal of U S  District Judge Peter Messitte s 2018 rulings allowing the case to proceed  The Constitution s  emoluments clause  bars U S  officials from accepting payments from foreign governments and the governments of U S  states without congressional approval  The lawsuit stated that because Trump did not divest himself of his business empire  spending by foreign governments at the Trump International Hotel in Washington amounts to unconstitutional gifts  or  emoluments   to the president  The three appeals court judges  all appointed by Republican presidents  expressed approval toward Trump s arguments in the case and signaled they might dismiss it  but did not issue a ruling  Some experts have said the case will eventually be heard by the U S  Supreme Court  TRUMP INAUGURAL COMMITTEE Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether the committee that organized Trump s inauguration in January 2017 accepted illegal donations from foreigners  misused funds or brokered special access to the administration for donors  Federal election law prohibits foreigners from donating to U S  political campaigns or inaugural committees  and corruption laws ban donors from making contributions in exchange for political favors  Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in December 2018 that the president was not involved in his inaugural committee  The  107 million raised by the committee  which was chaired by real estate developer and investor Thomas Barrack  was the largest in history  according to Federal Election Commission filings  IMPEACHMENT 
Under the Constitution  the president  vice president and  all civil officers of the United States  can be removed from office by Congress through the impeachment process for  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors   The House of Representatives acts as the accuser   voting on whether to bring specific charges such as obstruction of justice   and the Senate then conducts a trial with House members acting as prosecutors and the individual senators serving as jurors  A simple majority vote is needed in the House to impeach  A two thirds majority is required in the Senate to convict and remove ",2019-03-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/explainer-why-trumps-legal-woes-go-beyond-the-mueller-report-1815910,1815910
177023,398539,SO,Attorney general pores over Russia report  details may come Sunday,news,"By Andy Sullivan and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON WEST PALM BEACH  Fla   Reuters    U S  Attorney General William Barr pored over a special counsel report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow  and was due to release key findings perhaps as early as Sunday  Barr  the top U S  law enforcement official  aimed to transmit to Congress and the public a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report by the end of the weekend   He will not deliver the summary on Saturday  a Justice Department official said  leaving it likely that he will do so on Sunday   There appeared to be initial good news for President Donald Trump and his inner circle  as Mueller did not bring any new indictments when handing over his report to Barr on Friday after a probe of almost two years  That signals there might be no more criminal charges against Trump associates on the issue of whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to help ensure the Republican businessman s surprise election win against Democrat Hillary Clinton   Once we get the principal conclusions of the report  it s entirely possible that that ll be a good day for the president and his core supporters   Democratic Senator Chris Coon told reporters on a conference call  It was not immediately known what Mueller s report says about another strand of inquiry  whether Trump committed obstruction of justice to hinder the Russia investigation by acts such as firing then FBI Director James Comey in 2017   Mueller had earlier brought charges against 34 people and three companies  with prison sentences for some of Trump s ex aides such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen   None of those charges  however  directly related to the question of collusion between the campaign and Moscow  Trump and his core team still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes  and congressional Democrats on Saturday vowed to keep looking into his activities   Trump s business  his charity and presidential transition operation remain under investigation  said Coons  a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee   Other prosecutors have picked up strands of the Mueller probe  most notably the U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York which is looking into Trump s business practices and financial dealings   KEY FINDINGS On Saturday  Barr and his deputy were working closely with principal advisers to determine what to include in a letter to Congress to present the key findings of Mueller s report   Under Department of Justice regulations  Barr is empowered to decide how much to disclose publicly  A Trump appointee  Barr told lawmakers on Friday that he is  committed to as much transparency as possible    The attorney general spent nine hours at the Justice Department on Saturday before leaving at around 7 p m   2300 GMT   CNN said  Trump  at his Mar a Lago  Florida  resort for the weekend  remained uncharacteristically silent about the completion of the investigation that has cast a shadow over his two years in the White House   He has frequently derided the Russia investigation as a  witch hunt   He denies collaborating with Moscow  Russia says it did not interfere in the election  Spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters that the White House still has not received or been briefed on Mueller s report   The president had no public events scheduled on Saturday and played golf with musician Kid Rock   He s fine   Gidley said when asked by reporters how Trump was feeling   He s good  he s good   Gidley declined to say whether Trump had talked about the Mueller report while golfing  A large pro Trump float behind a flatbed truck pulled up to the golf course about an hour after he arrived  adorned with American flags and  Trump 2020  signs  Political analysts expect the Mueller report to have a significant impact on the 2020 presidential campaign   how Democrats might be able to use it stop Trump being reelected and how Trump could use it if he is effectively cleared of wrongdoing  The big question is whether the report contains allegations against Trump or exonerates him  Even if Mueller has outlined serious wrongdoing by Trump  the Justice Department has a policy that sitting presidents cannot face criminal charges  U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord in the United States  hurting Clinton and helping Trump   U S  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  said Barr s offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report s conclusions is insufficient and that  Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents

Venezuela s border  U S  Admiral Craig Faller  the head of the U S  military s Southern  NYSE SO  Command that oversees U S  forces in Latin America  told Reuters the United States had sharpened its

remove Maduro from office   U S  officials have uniformly emphasized diplomatic and economic tools to accelerate Maduro s departure  like sanctions  but Faller acknowledged the U S  military stood ready to provide options if needed  At the same time  he noted that no U S  allies in the region were seeking a military solution to the crisis in Venezuela    My job is to be ready  be on the balls of my feet  at all times  But we ve been talking to our partners and no one  no one  thinks that a military option is a good idea   Faller said  Opposition leader Juan Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term was a sham and he invoked a constitutional provision on Jan  23 to assume the interim presidency  Most Western nations including the United States have backed Guaido as head of state  Maduro  a socialist who has denounced Guaido as a U S  puppet seeking to foment a coup  retains the support of the armed forces and control of state functions  Jeremy McDermott  a Colombia based expert on the insurgencies and co founder of the Insight Crime think tank  said he believed the Colombian insurgents were operating in Venezuela with at least the blessing of Maduro  The rebels  aim is to exploit Venezuela s lawlessness for safe haven and for economic gain  he said  But he noted there could be an added benefit for Maduro    If the Americans invade  or if Colombia promotes a military intervention  then they  Maduro s supporters  would be able to call upon an insurgent force with more than 50 years of combat experience   McDermott said  Asked whether the United States had any evidence of communications between Maduro and the guerrilla groups  Faller said   I d rather not discuss the details of the exact connections but we re watching it very closely    Venezuela s Information Ministry and ELN contacts did not immediately respond to requests for comment   Colombia s ambassador to Washington  former Vice President Francisco Santos  said ELN and FARC factions had long been present in Venezuela but had grown stronger and more integrated into the country as a result of Venezuela s crisis   They have become the paramilitary groups of the Maduro administration   Santos told Reuters  ELN EXPANSION A Cuba inspired Marxist insurgency formed in 1964  the ELN claimed responsibility for a January car bomb attack against a police academy in Bogota that killed 22 cadets  It was an escalation by insurgents who have kidnapped Colombian security forces  attacked police stations and bombed oil pipelines   U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  say the ELN is increasingly using Venezuelan territory to carry out narco trafficking and illegal mining of minerals like gold and coltan   The Venezuelan security forces were believed to be getting kickbacks from the guerrillas  they said   One U S  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the U S  collection of intelligence on the guerrilla groups had increased in recent weeks  including looking at the militants  activities on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia  Several U S  officials said they believed senior leaders of both the ELN and the so called FARC dissidents who do not adhere to the peace agreement were now located inside of Venezuela   Their leadership is there   a second U S  official said  who also declined to be named  without providing evidence  An International Crisis Group report cited estimates that the ELN had been active in a minimum of 13 of Venezuela s 24 states   absorbing new recruits and shifting from a guerrilla force that embraced armed resistance against Colombia s ruling elites to one with many core operations in Venezuela   Opposition lawmakers in Venezuela also regularly denounce growing ELN activities in Venezuela  but Reuters has been unable to independently verify the extent of its presence or its operations   Faller declined to discuss any specifics about the collection of U S  intelligence or identify which insurgent leaders were in Venezuela   But he acknowledged the trend and added that the flow of illegal narcotics  from Colombia into Venezuela  and then from Venezuela out in the region  has risen as the misery of the Venezuelan people has risen    It s essentially a lawless region now inside Venezuela along the border and the FARC dissidents and the ELN have taken advantage of that   Faller said  adding   They operate with impunity inside Venezuela   Santos said the big concern for Colombia was that the strengthening rebel forces would upend efforts to crack down on narcotics trafficking   
 That s a big worry because in this situation of chaos  obviously they are going to grow  They are growing   he said ",2019-03-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-as-venezuela-crisis-deepens-us-sharpens-focus-on-colombia-rebel-threat-1810944,1810944
177047,398563,SO,Ex U S  Attorney Bharara to Trump  don t mess with Manhattan probes,news,"By Nathan Layne
 Reuters    Preet Bharara  the ex U S  Attorney in Manhattan  has a piece of unsolicited advice for President Donald Trump  don t meddle with investigations being pursued by his former office  especially one involving the Trump business or a family member 
Any such attempt  Bharara predicted  would likely prompt Democrats in Congress to start the impeachment process 
Bharara  who was fired as head of the office soon after Trump became president  wrote a book   Doing Justice  A Prosecutor s Thoughts on Crime  Punishment and the Rule of Law   that goes on sale Tuesday 
A recurring theme in the book is the reputation of the Manhattan U S  Attorney s office   formally known as the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York   for political neutrality and independence 
The office s willingness to pursue high profile cases was confirmed with its prosecution of Michael Cohen  Trump s former lawyer  who pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance crimes which prosecutors say he carried out at the direction of Trump 
The office s work is considered by many legal experts to be a bigger threat to Trump than Special Counsel Robert Mueller s probe of Russia s interference in the 2016 election  which is believed to be nearing its conclusion 
Reuters asked Bharara what would happen if Trump ordered the Southern District to halt a probe  a prospect that may not be far fetched given that Trump last year asked then acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker if Geoffrey Berman  Bharara s Trump appointed successor  could be tapped to oversee the Cohen investigation  according to the New York Times 
Berman is recused from the matter for undisclosed reasons 
Bharara said if he were still U S  attorney and received such an order he would resign and buy  a one way ticket for the shuttle to D C   to testify before a congressional committee 
 And then  I think you set the timer on impeachment   he said   So I don t think it would be a wise thing to do  
Trump has repeatedly criticized Mueller s probe as a  witch hunt  pushed by Democrats who want to impeach him  He has called Cohen a  rat   accusing him of lying to prosecutors to try and reduce his sentence of three years in prison due to start in May
Rudy Giuliani  a lawyer for Trump  did not respond to requests for comment 
Unlike the special counsel  the Southern District has wide latitude to pursue cases with some connection to New York  In addition to Cohen  it is looking at Trump s inaugural committee and the business practices at Trump s real estate firm 
Bharara s book is not about Trump but he acknowledges the president  infuses the book like he infuses everyone s life at the moment  even if he is not cited frequently by name 
The book instead centers on a variety of both high profile and lesser known cases to illustrate his views on how the justice system should work and when it falls short 
He addressed a frequent criticism of his tenure   that his and other agencies failed to prosecute bankers for the financial crisis  He wrote that holding people accountable was difficult because  much of what happened in 2008 was not the product of a few people with clear  provable intent  
He pushed back at the notion that politics  bias or other considerations blunted his response to the crisis  noting that the Southern District prosecuted hedge fund executives and New York politicians from both major parties during his time there 

 I m more than willing to accept credible criticism on behalf of the law enforcement community  but the idea that self interest or politics or fear was a factor is a silly criticism  at least at SDNY   he wrote ",2019-03-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/exus-attorney-bharara-to-trump-dont-mess-with-manhattan-probes-1811417,1811417

Southern  NYSE SO  California  USC   according to court documents  Loughlin and her husband were taken into federal custody and later released on separate  1 million bonds on Wednesday  DENIED A FAIR SHOT Lawsuits began emerging on Wednesday  a day after federal prosecutors said a California company made about  25 million from parents seeking spots for their children in top schools  including Georgetown University  Stanford University and Yale University  Fifty people  including 33 parents and athletics coaches  have been criminally charged in the nation s largest known college admissions scandal  The accused mastermind  William Singer  pleaded guilty to racketeering charges  In one civil lawsuit  Stanford students Erica Olsen and Kalea Woods said they were denied a fair opportunity to win admission to Yale and USC because of alleged racketeering  and said their degrees from Stanford will be devalued  Singer and eight colleges were named as defendants in the lawsuit  which seeks unspecified damages including refunds of application fees paid to the schools over seven years by unsuccessful applicants  Another lawsuit filed by Joshua Toy and his mother said he was denied college admission despite a 4 2 grade point average  and seeks  500 billion of damages from 45 defendants for defrauding and inflicting emotional distress on everyone whose  rights to a fair chance  to enter college was stolen  The defendants in that case include Singer and accused parents  including  Desperate Housewives  actor Felicity Huffman  Loughlin and Giannulli  and TPG Capital private equity partner William McGlashan Jr   who was fired by the firm on Thursday   These class action cases are opportunistic creatures of lawyers trying to obtain a windfall   Donald Heller  a lawyer for Singer  said in a phone interview  Lawyers for the other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Both lawsuits were filed in California  More lawsuits are likely   Prosecutors said Singer used his Edge College   Career Network and an affiliated nonprofit to help prospective students cheat on college admission tests and bribe coaches to inflate or create athletic credentials  The Stanford case is notable because it is among the country s most prestigious and selective universities  admitting just 4 3 percent of its applicants last year  But Olsen and Woods said their degrees are  now not worth as much  because prospective employers might question whether they were admitted on merit or through bribes by parents  A Stanford spokesman said the university is reviewing the lawsuit  TIP THAT LED TO FRAUD DISCOVERY The original tip that led to uncovering the college scandal stemmed from an unrelated securities fraud probe into Morrie Tobin  a Los Angeles resident who prosecutors said engaged in  pump and dump  stock market schemes  a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday  Tobin  who pleaded guilty on Feb  27 to conspiracy and securities fraud charges  told authorities a Yale University women s soccer coach had sought a bribe in exchange for helping his daughter get into the Ivy League school  the person said  That now former coach was Rudy Meredith  who agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud charges  The FBI after receiving the tip secretly recorded a meeting between Meredith and Tobin in which he sought  450 000 in exchange for recruiting her for a spot on the soccer team  according the person and related court records  At the meeting  Meredith accepted  2 000 cash as a partial payment  according to charging documents

177105,398621,SO,Bribing your way to college  Check your math  it may not pay,news,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    Experts agree that college pays off  But at any price   More than two dozen wealthy families charged with allegedly cheating or bribing their kids  way into elite schools are learning the hard way that crime doesn t pay  even when higher education is the prize  Potential criminal punishments aside  the scheme raises the question  was the premium parents paid worth the anticipated long term economic gain for their children   Take Bruce Isackson  president of a Woodside  California  real estate firm  and his wife Davina  who in July 2015 turned over 2 150 shares worth  251 000 of  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  stock to help get their daughter into UCLA as a fake soccer recruit  according to a federal criminal complaint  If they had just held on to those shares  they would have been worth around  373 000 today  They later allegedly spent another  350 000 to get their younger daughter into the University of Southern  NYSE SO  California as a bogus rowing recruit  Manuel Henriquez  a resident of Atherton  California  who until Tuesday was chairman of Silicon Valley finance company Hercules Capital Inc  and his wife Elizabeth were arrested in New York after allegedly shelling out more than  500 000 to cheat on entrance exams and fake their daughter s tennis expertise to get her into Georgetown University  Just imagine the calculus of the unnamed relatives of a teenaged girl who authorities said paid  1 2 million to get her into Yale University as a soccer recruit  though she did not play competitively   And then there are the parents accused by prosecutors of paying  15 000 apiece to cheat on standardized tests to make their kids  applications look better   All of these were upfront costs incurred even before the first checks for tuition  room and board and other fees were written  In each case  would the crime have even paid off  GRAPHIC   The college gamble   DOING THE MATH Five years ago  San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly   then associate director of the bank s research department   asserted in a paper that college costs more often than not are worth the expense over the long term  A student in 2014 paying  21 200 a year for a four year degree  she found  would break even with someone with only a high school diploma by the age of 38 and would have made a cumulative  831 000 more than that individual by retirement  But what about the Yale student and her family  who paid  1 2 million up front and then presumably were on the hook for full tuition and room and board adding up to more than  70 000 a year  That s an all in tab for that degree of  1 48 million  Using Daly s approach as a guide and inputting updated government data on median incomes for individuals with and without college degrees  a Reuters analysis found a college grad whose  70 000 annual tuition was paid upfront would outearn a high school grad by  1 3 million over a lifetime of work  assuming each earned the median national wage for their demographic inflated over time   But the unidentified student s family paid more than five times the Yale sticker price after the bribe  a cost that would not be fully recovered until the child reaches age 64  assuming 3 percent annual wage growth and a one time  10 percent increase at age 34 to reflect higher earnings of older adults  In many cases involving wealthy parents  future earnings may be less of a draw than the prestige of saying your offspring were at Yale or Stanford  or the lure of potential connections with influential elite school graduates  But had some of these parents not been caught  the payoff alone might have been worth it   In the case of a less expensive school like UCLA  the  391 000 cost to the Isacksons   the  251 000 bribe plus  140 000 for four years of tuition and fees   would still leave a lifetime earnings surplus for their daughter of a bit over  1 2 million  Meanwhile  for those parents like  Desperate Housewives  actress Felicity Huffman  whose total outlay in the fraudulent enterprise was just  15 000 to improve their childrens  entrance exam scores by cheating  the payoff would have been handsome  Assuming the student graduates  the  22 000 gap in median annual pay between high school and college graduates would easily offset the extra investment  Lawyers representing the Henriquez couple and Bruce Isackson did not respond to a request for comment  Davina Isackson could not be reached  GRAPHIC   College pays off  even if you pay your own way   INTANGIBLES There are benefits to a degree from a top college beyond excess earnings over time  Unemployment is lower among college grads and job satisfaction is higher   Philip Oreopoulos  an economics professor at the University of Toronto  has even quantified non work related benefits of a college education  including lower divorce rates  better health  and more happiness overall  even after accounting for pay differences    It goes way beyond financial gain   he says  adding that he in no way endorses parental cheating  which he called  grossly unfair    The still unfolding scandal highlights economic inequalities exacerbated by college admissions programs that in some cases legally give preference to children of wealthy parents  even as U S  students are saddled with a collective  1 56 trillion in loans  Federal Reserve data shows   The financial analysis suggests that  in terms of money alone  at least some of the bribes and cheating would have led to a net gain   unless you consider how the money might otherwise have been invested   The return on the median fraudulent payment of  250 000  invested at the standard 6 percent yearly return used by many long term financial planners  after high school and through age 65 would have been  3 9 million  Reuters calculated   And for  1 2 million   the maximum shelled out   18 6 million

NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  authorities on Friday announced criminal charges against the alleged leaders of an multibillion dollar pyramid scheme involving the sale of a fraudulent cryptocurrency  OneCoin 
Konstantin Ignatov  who runs OneCoin Ltd  and his older sister Ruja Ignatova  who co founded OneCoin and is known as  Cryptoqueen   were accused of swindling investors coveting big returns and low risk  in a scheme conceived as a fraud 
Prosecutors said OneCoin  which still operates  claimed to have more than 3 million members  who would receive commissions for recruiting new members to buy cryptocurrency packages 
Much of the  1 2 billion of investor money located so far was laundered through at least 21 countries  prosecutors said 
OneCoin records  meanwhile  show profit of 2 23 billion euros  US 2 51 billion  on sales of 3 35 billion euros  US 3 77 billion  in the two years ended Sept  2016  they added 
The defendants  created a multibillion dollar cryptocurrency company based completely on lies and deceit   U S  Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement   Investors were victimized while the defendants got rich  
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance added   These defendants executed an old school pyramid scheme on a new school platform  
Ignatov  33  of Sofia  Bulgaria  was charged with wire fraud conspiracy  and detained after being arrested on Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport 
Ignatova  38  also of Sofia  was charged with wire fraud  securities fraud and conspiracy  She has been at large since disappearing in Oct  2017 
Lawyers for the siblings could not immediately be located 
According to court papers  the defendants misled investors into believing OneCoin s value was determined by supply and demand  when it was actually determined internally  and that OneCoins were  mined  using company servers 
The papers also include quotations suggesting the defendants knew OneCoin was a fraud 
Ignatova was quoted as telling a co founder that  I cheat currently on coins   and that one possible  exit strategy  was to  take the money and run and blame someone else  
Ignatov  meanwhile  allegedly told a OneCoin member recently in Las Vegas   If you are here to cash out leave this room now because you don t understand what this project is about  
Another defendant  Mark Scott  50  of Coral Gables  Florida  pleaded not guilty last September to conspiring to launder more than  400 million for OneCoin 
Scott is a former partner at the law firm Locke Lord 
 Unequivocally  Mr  Scott maintains his complete and utter innocence   his lawyer David Garvin said on Friday   His conduct is consistent with the normal  proper duties of a lawyer

drama  Beverly Hills 90210  and then aged into a fatherly role on comic based  Riverdale   died on Monday at the age of 52 after suffering a  massive  stroke last week  his publicist said  Publicist Arnold Robinson said Perry died in a Los Angeles area hospital surrounded by his family and close friends  including his former wife Minnie Sharp  his two children  and his fiance Wendy Madison Bauer   The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world  and respectfully request privacy in this time of great mourning  No further details will be released at this time   Robinson said in a statement  Perry was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital on Wednesday after suffering the stroke at his home  celebrity website TMZ com reported last week  TMZ said on Monday that Perry never recovered consciousness  Perry was taken ill the same day that Fox television announced it was reviving the  Beverly Hills 90210  series with many of the original cast  including Jason Priestley  Jennie Garth and Tori Spelling  Perry was not among those announced as returning for the limited run of six new episodes this summer  Since 2016  Perry had played Fred Andrews  father of Archie Andrews  in the television series  Riverdale   a dark twist on the Archie comic books  but more than 20 years earlier the actor had been a heartthrob who adorned the cover of scores of magazines aimed at adolescent girls  thanks to  Beverly Hills 90210   Perry s death prompted an outpouring of grief   Riverdale  producers in a statement called Perry an  incredibly caring  consummate professional   Molly Ringwald  one of his co stars on the show  said on Twitter   My heart is broken    Beverly Hills  90210   which aired on the Fox network  was about a group of attractive high school students living the sweet life amid Southern  NYSE SO  California affluence while dealing with teen angst  as well as a raft of more serious issues such as date rape  AIDS and teen pregnancy  Perry was in his mid 20s when he started playing high schooler Dylan McKay  a brooding loner on a motorcycle with prominent sideburns and bad boy tendencies  An avalanche of comparisons to the late James Dean soon followed   Beverly Hills 90210  got off to a slow start in the ratings in 1990 but built a cult following that grew to become a cultural phenomenon with its target demographic  One of the key plot lines was Perry s character developing a romance with Brenda  a wholesome Midwestern transplant to Beverly Hills  played by Shannen Doherty  before moving on to her best friend  Kelly  played by Garth  Along the way Perry  Doherty  Garth and co stars Priestley  Spelling and Ian Ziering became stars  MOB SCENES Perry s fame was such that he was getting 4 000 fan letters a week and drawing crowds of thousands of teenage girls to his personal appearances  Once Perry had to be smuggled out of a Seattle mall hiding in a laundry hamper because of overzealous fans and at another appearance  some 20 people were injured rushing a stage  He eventually gave up the personal appearances for security concerns and did not like being considered a  teen idol    My problem with that is it s inaccurate for two reasons   he said at a news conference in 1992   One  I m not a teenager  Two  I don t think anyone idolizes anybody    Perry left  90210  after its sixth season but returned two years later as the show finished its 10 year run  By the time it was over  Perry s Dylan had endured a drinking problem  cocaine and heroin abuse  financial hardship  a near fatal car crash  his father s faked death  various romances and a marriage that ended when his wife was mistakenly killed by a hitman hired by her mobster father  Perry also was in the 1992 movie  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  that preceded the TV series of that name and during his  90210  run portrayed real life rodeo star Lane Frost in  8 Seconds   He learned to ride bulls and did many of his own stunts in the film  Perry s other TV credits included  Windfall   a 2006 series about a group of friends who win a big lottery jackpot  two seasons of  Jeremiah   a post apocalyptic drama  and a season on  Oz   a prison drama on which he played a preacher convicted of embezzlement  His stage work included starring in London stage adaptation of  When Harry Met Sally  in 2004 and playing Brad in  The Rocky Horror Show  on Broadway in 2001  Perry grew up in Fredericktown  Ohio  population 2 300  and after graduating from high school headed to Los Angeles to pursue acting while working construction jobs and in a doorknob factory  In the late 1980s  he took on soap opera roles and television commercials in New York before landing the  Beverly Hills 90210  part

177218,398734,SO,North Carolina judge rules voter ID  tax cap amendments unconstitutional,news,"By Brendan O Brien
 Reuters    A North Carolina judge on Friday ruled that two amendments  one requiring identification to vote and another capping the state income tax  were unconstitutional because racial gerrymandering meant that the state s legislature was  illegally constituted  
Wake County Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins found the makeup of the Republican led North Carolina General Assembly was based on unconstitutional racial gerrymandering when it sent the ballot questions to the voters for their approval in November  the ruling showed 
 An illegally constituted General Assembly does not represent the people of North Carolina and is therefore not empowered to pass legislation that would amend the state s constitution   he wrote 
He voided both amendments in his ruling 
 We re thrilled the court has made clear that our state s core foundational document can only be amended when all people of North Carolina are properly represented   said Kym Hunter  an attorney at the Southern  NYSE SO  Environmental Law Center that represented the North Carolina NAACP and Clean Air Carolina 
Republican State Senate leader Phil Berger said his party is duty bound to appeal the decision 
 The prospect of invalidating 18 months of laws is the definition of chaos and confusion   Berger said in a statement  calling the decision  absurd  
GERRYMANDERING CASE
A federal court ruled in August that North Carolina Republicans illegally drew up U S  congressional districts in the state to benefit their party 
The constitutional amendment that would require voters to show a valid piece of identification passed in the state House of Representatives with just two votes more than the required three fifths margin  Voters approved the amendment with 55 percent of the vote 
The House approved decreasing the state income tax cap from 10 percent to 7 percent with just one vote more than the required three fifth majority before voters approved the measure with 57 percent of the vote 
 One man with a political axe to grind invalidated millions of votes and potentially dozens of laws  including the state budget   said Republican Senator Ralph Hise  who chairs the Senate Redistricting and Elections Committee in a statement ",2019-02-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/north-carolina-judge-rules-voter-id-tax-cap-amendments-unconstitutional-1788354,1788354

177260,398776,SO,Trump  adult children urge dismissal of marketing scam lawsuit,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump and his adult children on Thursday urged a federal judge to dismiss a racketeering lawsuit accusing them of using the family name to promote sham marketing opportunities to vulnerable  financially struggling investors  Calling the lawsuit  implausible   the Trump family said in a filing in federal court in Manhattan that the four plaintiffs failed to prove there was fraud or intent to cause harm  or that any statements by Donald Trump caused losses  A spokeswoman for the plaintiffs  who went by pseudonyms  had no immediate comment  They accused the Trump family of having received millions of dollars of secret payments from 2005 to 2015 to endorse American Communications Network  which charged  499 for a chance to sell videophones and other goods  and two other businesses  The lawsuit said the Trumps deliberately conned victims into believing Donald Trump stood behind the investments and thought they would pay off  when the real goal was to enrich themselves  They said this violated a federal anti racketeering law known as RICO  Other defendants included an affiliate of the Trump Organization and Trump s adult children Donald Jr   Eric and Ivanka  In Thursday s filing  the defendants suggested that the case was politically motivated  having been filed against the Republican president one week before November s congressional elections and funded by a nonprofit whose president backs progressive causes  They also said Trump s promotional statements about ACN were merely opinion  or were  puffery  that reasonable investors could not rely on  and that none of the other defendants said anything the investors might have heard  The plaintiffs originally sued on Oct  29  2018  and amended their complaint on Jan  31  But according to the defendants  the new complaint  cures none of the original defects  and in fact only highlights the implausibility  of a lawsuit that seeks to convert a celebrity endorsement by Mr  Trump and the licensing business of the Trump family  in toto  into a RICO violation by which Plaintiffs who paid no money to any Trump business  ever lost  499 each   The plaintiffs have until March 7 to respond

177291,398807,SO,First stop for migrant kids  For profit detention center,news,By Yeganeh Torbati and Kristina Cooke HOMESTEAD  Fla   SAN FRANCISCO  Calif   Reuters    For a growing number of migrant children  this is their first home in America  a sprawling campus dotted with beige buildings  massive white tents and metal trailers  next door to a U S  Air Force base  The federal government is holding nearly 1 600 migrant children here  at what it calls a  temporary influx  shelter  It has added 250 beds in the last two months and could soon house 2 350 children who crossed the nation s southern border on their own  It is the country s only such temporary quarters for migrant children  after the closure last month of a similar facility in south Texas  and the only shelter for migrant youths that is run by a for profit company  The site is a topic of heated debate  as immigration advocates and Democratic legislators complain many traumatized children who fled violence and poverty in their home countries are held in an institutionalized setting for too long before being released to sponsoring families who can better care for them   Government officials say they are trying to safely release children to family members as fast as they can  and that the facility provides the first experience of stability that the children have had after long and often perilous journeys northward  Their arduous journeys are not necessarily over  Some of the children will gain asylum  which can take years  others will be deported  As the government seeks to rapidly expand the site s capacity  it has waived a federal requirement at Homestead meant to ensure children receive sufficient health care  The U S  Department of Health and Human Services  which cares for the children  previously required Homestead to maintain a clinician to child ratio of 1 to 12 to provide mental health services  according to a November 2018 report  But that requirement has been relaxed to 1 to 20  a Homestead program director said on Wednesday  The facility sits on federal property  and unlike established children s shelters  such as smaller group or foster homes that hold migrant children across the country  is not governed by state child welfare regulations designed to protect youngsters from harm  ART  PARCHEESI AND INSPIRATIONAL SLOGANS On this day  as a steady rain poured down  children wearing clear plastic ponchos walked in single file lines around the grounds  attended by shelter staff  Some waved and yelled greetings in English and Spanish to visiting reporters   The Trump administration opened the Homestead site s doors to media on condition that reporters not interact with children or photograph or record them inside  which they said was to protect children s privacy  For these youths  aged 13 17  school is held in large white tents divided into small classrooms  Their instructors are not required to be certified teachers but must have a bachelor s degree and speak English and Spanish  The younger children sleep in rooms with six sets of bunk beds each  Seventeen year olds  who are housed separately  sleep in large  long  bays  with 144 beds each  The older children use toilet stalls in an attached tent  In recreation areas near the beds were games of dominoes  Jenga  and Parcheesi  Outside  kids can play soccer  volleyball and basketball on the palm dotted campus  Inspirational slogans and other art work by the children decorate building walls  including a drawing of Martin Luther King  Jr  with the words  I have a dream  written in Spanish  Another sign atop a doorway says   Through These Doors Walk the Greatest People in the World   in English  The facility was first opened during the Obama administration  but immigration rights advocates say the Trump administration has stranded children there for longer periods by making it more difficult for them to be released to sponsors  usually parents or close relatives  They say youngsters have been there for months  one of them for more than eight   Officials say the children spend an average of 67 days at Homestead before they are released   750 A DAY About 35 miles south of Miami  the facility is run by Comprehensive Health Services  Inc   a private  for profit company with a growing line of business in housing immigrant children  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year  the firm s parent company  Caliburn International Corp   noted President Donald Trump s immigration policies were driving  significant growth   It costs approximately  250 per day to house a migrant child at a standard  permanent shelter  said Mark Weber  an HHS spokesman  But at an influx facility like Homestead  the cost is triple that   around  750 per day  It is covered by American taxpayers  Democrats in Congress introduced a bill in December that would ban the use of unlicensed temporary emergency shelters for unaccompanied minors  arguing that stays at the shelters can re traumatize children  In 2014  record numbers of children crossed the border and were held at Border Patrol stations in the southwest for days longer than the 72 hours allowed by law  he said   That limit applies to how long children can be kept in Border Patrol custody   not HHS custody  as at Homestead   A lawsuit filed in January on behalf of migrant children by immigrant rights groups accuses HHS  Office of Refugee Resettlement of instituting  opaque and arbitrary  bureaucratic hurdles as it processes the release of the children  One Guatemalan boy  identified only as E A R R   entered the United States in July 2018 and was held at Homestead for five months  according to the suit  His father applied to be his sponsor in July  and fulfilled myriad requirements set by caseworkers  such as giving the boy a separate room and even moving at one caseworker s request  the suit alleges  His son was released shortly after the lawsuit was filed   At one point  E A R R  suffered from a headache so severe that he broke out in screams  and was taken to a hospital   the suit said   He has become anxious and depressed and has begun mental health treatment and medication   While some of the children detained in federal facilities over the past year were separated from their parents at the U S  Mexico border as part of the Trump administration s  zero tolerance  policy on illegal immigration  most crossed alone  often planning to reunite with a parent or close relative  The number of unaccompanied children crossing the border is not out of line with previous years  but children are spending far longer in federal custody  government data show  The average length of stay for migrant children in HHS custody for the first four months fiscal 2019 was 89 days  compared to 60 days in fiscal 2018 and 41 days in fiscal 2017  according to HHS data  As of Feb  13  11 500 children were in HHS custody  down from a record of nearly 15 000 in mid December  partly because of a change in fingerprinting policy    but still it was nearly 80 percent higher than a year ago  the data show   We don t think most of these kids need to be detained at all   said Mary Bauer  deputy legal director of the Southern  NYSE SO  Poverty Law Center s Immigrant Justice Project   These are kids who have for the most part loving family members who want them

177372,398888,SO,How Kabila s election strategy unraveled in Congo,news,By Giulia Paravicini  David Lewis and Aaron Ross KINSHASA  Reuters    In Kinshasa s lush Botanical Garden  the scene was set to celebrate the election of the man Joseph Kabila had chosen to replace him as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo   Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary s face beamed from yellow and blue banners  some emblazoned with the words  Shadary President   Soda bottles were piled up in a corner as Kabila s ruling coalition tallied results of that day s election at a nearby hotel  Within hours of polls closing on Dec  30  the planned festivities at the gardens were abruptly called off   As the results poured in from observers and thousands of electronic voting machines  it became clear to Kabila s camp that opposition leader Martin Fayulu had won by a decisive margin  diplomats and Congolese sources with direct knowledge of the events said  Fraught discussions began in Kabila s team over whether to engineer a win for Shadary  a former interior minister  or anoint a different opposition candidate who might be willing to protect the political and financial interests of Kabila and his associates  the sources said  A week later  the electoral commission announced the election had been won by Felix Tshisekedi  Fayulu said he was a victim of fraud and the Catholic Church  which had a 40 000 strong team of election observers  rejected the official result  Aides to Kabila  who succeeded his slain father in 2001  and Tshisekedi denied there was any tampering with the election results  as did the head of the commission charged with overseeing the poll   The results are those we announced   said Corneille Nangaa  president of the National Independent Electoral Commission   The rest is politics and useless speculation   Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi  a Kabila adviser  rejected the allegations of rigging as  pure speculation  and Jean Pierre Kambila  Kabila s deputy chief of staff  denied the president s camp ever considered trying to rig the vote in Shadary s favor    This is pure imagination   he said   These are  accusations from  people who have lost and don t want to accept the reality   But a Congolese source  who was in direct contact with senior government officials and members of the electoral commission as the debate unfolded  told Reuters that Kabila and his advisers realized quickly that the game was up    Shadary s defeat was so blatant that not even the most sophisticated of the rigging was going to turn the results in his favor   he said   This is when Plan B kicks in  Felix President   FEAR OF VIOLENCE  Kabila s aides feared that a Shadary win could provoke a violent backlash from opposition supporters who dominate in Kinshasa  the capital  and in several eastern regions of Congo  source of much of the country s vast mineral wealth  A Tshisekedi win  on the other hand  would be more likely to garner international approval and might help keep the opposition divided  the source said  Accusations of vote rigging are not new to elections in Congo  Foreign powers have overlooked alleged irregularities in the past for the sake of insuring relative stability in a country where two wars in the 1990s and early 2000s sucked in other regional armies  But the scale of the alleged cheating in December s election stoked fears that the long delayed vote  which was meant to lead to Congo s first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence  could degenerate into renewed street fighting or regional conflict  The African Union and Southern  NYSE SO  African Development Community held emergency meetings in the Ethiopian capital  Addis Ababa  on Thursday  to discuss the election  The African Union called for the final results to be postponed  citing  serious doubts  about their credibility  But the Congolese government rejected the call on Friday  The U S  government  which has already sanctioned a number of top Kabila officials  has said it will hold accountable those undermining the democratic process   Fayulu    who was backed by Kabila s two fiercest political rivals  Jean Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi    has called the result a  coup  and filed a challenge at the constitutional court  The court was expected to rule on the case by Saturday  A member of Fayulu s camp shared figures with Reuters that he said were leaked from the electoral commission s server and showed its candidate with 59 4 percent of the vote  compared to just under 19 percent for both Tshisekedi and Shadary  The figures were similar to those contained in a report by the Catholic Church bishops  conference in Congo  seen by Reuters  which was based on results collected by its observers  Neither of the sets of figures is complete  and Reuters could not independently authenticate them    WE CAN ALWAYS CHEAT  In a change from elections in 2006 and 2011  Congolese authorities introduced electronic voting machines for the latest poll   The opposition feared the machines would be used to rig the vote but the government said it was a more efficient way to collect and transmit votes in the country of 80 million people  Voters entered their selections on iPad like devices  which were equipped with sim cards that allowed the final tallies to be transmitted via mobile phone networks to election organizers in Kinshasa as soon as the polls closed   The government ordered internet services cut on the morning of Dec  31  saying this was necessary to preserve public order after  fictitious results  began circulating on social media   But by that time  figures had reached Kinshasa from most of the more than 60 000 polling stations  three Congolese sources and three diplomats briefed by election officials said  Kabila s coalition  the Common Front for Congo  also had observers who recorded results at individual polling stations and sent them via phone  email or text messages for tallying at a Kinshasa hotel   By the early hours of Dec  31  their figures showed Shadary losing heavily to Fayulu    He is beating us everywhere   one coalition official wrote in a message seen by Reuters   We don t organize elections to lose them  We can always cheat   Two diplomatic sources said an election commission official told some foreign envoys in Kinshasa of Fayulu s victory within days of the vote but said it was too dangerous for the body to announce it   Two other diplomats said commission officials made clear to them that Shadary had lost but said they were not informed of the winner   The government did not immediately abandon the Shadary option  However  they understood that it was going to be very difficult to make the population accept a Shadary victory   a Kinshasa based diplomat said    SEMINAL ROLE  FOR KABILA Representatives of Kabila sought a deal with Tshisekedi s team  Kinshasa based diplomats and Congolese sources said  An agreement was reached  they said  under which Tshisekedi would be president  Kabila would be guaranteed protection for himself  his family and assets  and his supporters would retain significant control over parliament and the financial and security apparatus    What is certain is that Kabila will keep a seminal role   a senior Congolese government official said  Tshisekedi and Kabila s camps deny such a deal was reached  But Fayulu supporters question how members of Kabila s coalition won over 70 percent of the votes in provincial and national legislative elections when official results show their candidate  Shadary  won just 24 percent in the presidential vote  Top officials instructed Nangaa  the electoral commission chief  to award the vote to Tshisekedi  two Congolese government officials told Reuters  Denying this  Nangaa told Reuters that no one put pressure on him to change the results   Kabila loyalists  especially in the military  did not trust Tshisekedi and wanted Shadary to be named president  They presented their concerns to Kabila s aides at a meeting on Jan  9  hours before the official results were announced early on Jan  10  said a businessman with access to the presidency and a Western security official in touch with the Congolese military   They said Kabila s aides assured the loyalists they would retain their positions and their interests would be protected    David Lewis reported from Nairobi and Aaron

177373,398889,SO,From Craft Brews to Car Bills  Shutdown Hits American Confidence,news," Bloomberg     Atlanta restaurateur Deborah VanTrece quietly put a notice on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Monday night inviting furloughed federal workers to her Southern  NYSE SO  eatery for a free meal on Martin Luther King Jr  Day  She wasn t prepared for what came next 
 By Tuesday it had exploded   said VanTrece of Twisted Soul Cookhouse and Pours  Some 500 people have called in about it  and she s had to extend the luncheon by two hours to accommodate the demand  So many people have called from all federal agencies  to the point that it s started to scare me about the trickle down effect of the shutdown  
She s not the only one nervous  U S  consumer sentiment tumbled to the lowest level since October 2016 and future expectations dimmed  according to figures released Friday  giving fresh evidence that concerns about the government shutdown are creeping into the American psyche 
Lowest Level
The University of Michigan s preliminary January sentiment index fell to 90 7 from the prior month  missing all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists  according to a report Friday  The measures of current conditions and expectations both declined to the lowest since President Donald Trump s election in 2016 
Richard Curtin  director of the University of Michigan consumer survey  attributed the drop to  a host of issues including the partial government shutdown  the impact of tariffs  instabilities in financial markets  the global slowdown  and the lack of clarity about monetary policies  
For all the hand wringing over furloughed public employees  most economic forecasters still don t expect it to cause too much pain to growth so long as it doesn t drag on for months  For starters  an event affecting about 800 000 workers is a relatively small portion of a U S  labor force totaling 163 million people  And there s a snapback effect  The drag to gross domestic product that the shutdown is causing now will turn into a propellant when the stalemate ends and people get paid again 
According to the median forecast in a Jan  15 17 Bloomberg survey  analysts project the federal government will reopen by mid February  though if the closure lasts through March  the disruption will cause economic growth to dip below 2 percent this quarter  At the same time  just under half say the government impasse increases the probability of a recession this year 
More Dire Predictions
The relatively sanguine assessment is at odds with some more dire recent predictions  including by  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn   The White House itself doubled the estimated negative fallout 
Federal workers deemed non essential are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits but they have to repay the assistance when their checks with back pay eventually arrive  About 15 000 applied for weekly jobless benefits during the first two weeks of the shutdown  according to Labor Department figures released Thursday 
Still  some small businesses with federal contracts or waiting on government actions are sweating the delays  In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta  former schoolteacher Thomas Monti and his business partner are building out a new craft brewery  Schoolhouse Brewing  and waiting on a license from the U S  Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau  It normally takes 45 to 60 days to get such a license   unless the government shuts down  Monti said 
 Being former teachers  we are used to bureaucracy   he said   We are staying optimistic that the shutdown is going to end sooner rather than later  But is it a concern  Yes  we can t open our business without doing this  
For others who are affected  an extended period without income may leave lasting damage to their personal finances as they dip into savings to make ends meet or run up expensive credit card debt 
Brandon Long  33  an investigative specialist at the Department of Justice  was declared an essential employee  meaning he has to report to work even though staff has been furloughed 
Falling Behind
His schedule is erratic  so he can t arrange for another job to help pay the bills  Even if he could  the father of five with a stay at home spouse said the government sets strict rules on doing part time work  Long  who was last paid on Dec  29  is supposed to get another check on Friday Jan  25 
After falling behind on his car payment  car insurance  his student loan and other bills  he launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise  500 for groceries  rent  due in a couple of weeks   baby formula  diapers  wipes  As of Friday afternoon  he d raised  650  They ve nearly depleted their savings 
 Me and my wife sacrificed a lot to get our credit in a good place  and we were hoping to get a house next year   said Long  who s worried the late payments will damage their credit rating 
 You gotta live this squeaky clean lifestyle to get a job in government   he said   You do all this stuff  and now I m getting punished for something I have nothing to do with  ",2019-01-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/from-craft-brews-to-car-bills-shutdown-hits-american-confidence-1751572,1751572

177383,398899,SO,Record Bidding for Southern Europe s Debt Shows Pent Up Demand,news," Bloomberg     Investors are seeking record amounts of bonds from Southern  NYSE SO  Europe  emerging from the sidelines after last year s political turmoil in Italy 
Sovereign bond offerings from Italy  Spain and Portugal this month have all drawn unprecedented bidding for a total of 106 billion euros   120 billion   up 14 percent from a year ago  Asian investors are joining the rush  snapping up more than one billion euros of debt  helping to drive peripheral euro area yields lower in the past two weeks 
The strong demand marks another step in the recovery for a region that saw sentiment weighed down by the risks of a deficit blow out from Italy s populist government  While rating companies downgraded Italy last year  Portugal was raised from junk status and Spain was upgraded  Now the nations are starting to benefit as investors are drawn to their relatively high yields 
 Volatility in Italy left tons of pent up demand   said Jaime Costero  a rates strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in Madrid  There is also greater structural demand as the rating upgrades have drawn  new investors and wider credit lines   he said 
Spain received 46 5 billion euros of orders for a 10 year bond on Tuesday  following successful sales by Italy and Portugal earlier this month  A breakdown of demand for Spain s syndication showed Asian investors at 11 8 percent of the 10 billion euros sold  up from 0 7 percent for a similar offering in January 2018 
Spanish yields have fallen 15 basis points in the past two weeks  while Italian yields are down 11 basis points  Greece could also offer a medium term bond soon  according to Danske Bank A S 
Market sentiment improved after Italy resolved a dispute with the European Union over its 2019 budget deficit  while weaker regional economic data has spurred fears of a slowdown that may lead the European Central Bank to be more cautious about removing stimulus 
 There has been a widespread belief among investors that rates will likely remain low for longer  with central banks likely to be very cautious in pushing rates higher   said Jorge Garayo  a strategist at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA   Low volatility combined with a low level of rates has led investors to overweight periphery  more so with more market friendly political posturing

177462,398978,SO,Trump widens demands in wall standoff  threatens Mexico border closure,news,"By David Morgan and James Oliphant WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the southern U S  border with Mexico unless he gets the money he wants for a wall  raising the stakes in a standoff that will present an immediate test next week for the new U S  Congress  When Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take control of the U S  House of Representatives on Thursday  they plan to quickly approve a spending measure meant to end a partial government shutdown that began on Dec  22  triggered by Trump s demand for  5 billion in funding for his proposed wall  Democrats have made clear that the House measure  which would then have to go to the Republican controlled Senate  will not include  5 billion Trump says is needed for the wall  a central part of his tougher positions on immigration than his predecessors   Democrats are united against the president s immoral  ineffective and expensive wall     that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for   Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement  referring to a Trump 2016 presidential campaign pledge  Trump has previously threatened to close the border to prevent Central American immigrants reaching the United States  Asked about Trump s threat on Friday  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters it was an internal U S  government matter   Lopez Obrador added  however   Of course we will always defend our sovereignty     We will always protect migrants  defend their human rights   Whether Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell  Pelosi and Trump can find a way forward to fully reopen the government will say a lot about the next two years of divided government  A close congressional ally of Trump s on Friday sent a tweet suggesting more partisan confrontation lies ahead   To Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats  No Wall Money  No Deal   Republican Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on Twitter  The dispute over Trump s wall has led to the shutdown of  non essential  operations at numerous agencies because of lack of funding  including the departments of Agriculture  Homeland Security  Interior  Transportation  Commerce and Justice  Trump is demanding that Congress include his  5 billion in legislation that must be passed to restore funding to the agencies that expired at midnight on Dec  21  Firing off angry tweets from the White House early on Friday  the president widened his demands    We will be forced to close the Southern  NYSE SO  Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall   also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with   Trump tweeted   Either we build  finish  the Wall or we close the Border    PROUD  TO SHUT DOWN Earlier this month  Trump said he would be  proud  to shut down the government over border security  But since the shutdown started  he has tried to blame Democrats  In television interviews on Friday  Trump aides said Democrats have refused to negotiate over the matter   We re here  and they know where to find us   White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said in an interview with Fox News Channel   Where is Chuck Schumer  Where is Nancy Pelosi  They re not even talking right now   he said  Schumer is the top Democrat in the Senate  Pelosi s spokesman said the White House has not reached out formally to her since Dec  11  when she and Schumer had a contentious  televised Oval Office meeting with Trump  Pelosi is expected to become speaker of the House on Jan  3 because Democrats won a House majority in November s elections  Since their victory  House Democrats have talked about seeking common ground with Republicans  while also promising numerous investigations of Trump  who has painted himself and Republicans in the Senate into a political corner  Rejecting next week s spending measure from House Democrats would put a Republican stamp on the shutdown  But accepting it would mean backing away from Trump s proposed wall  THREE OPTIONS Pelosi and Schumer have been discussing three options for Democratic legislation  according to a senior Democratic aide   One is a stop gap funding bill that would run through Feb  8  Another is six full 2019 appropriations bills for all but the Department of Homeland Security  which would be funded through a measure known as a continuing resolution maintaining current funding through Sept 30  The third is a continuing resolution for all shuttered agencies that would expire on Sept 30   The aide said the legislation expected for a full House vote on Jan  3 could be a variation on any of the three options  According to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Thursday  47 percent of Americans hold Trump responsible for the shutdown  while 33 percent blame Democrats in Congress   The shutdown affects about 800 000 employees  Most of the federal government  which directly employs almost 4 million people  is unaffected  Even agencies that are affected never totally close  with  essential  workers still on the job  
Trump  who scrapped plans to spend Christmas at his private resort in Florida and stayed in Washington  has now also canceled his New Year s plans  Mulvaney said ",2018-12-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-threatens-to-close-southern-border-if-not-given-wall-funding-1732558,1732558

177495,399011,SO,In presidential election  Congo seeks first democratic transfer of power,news,"By Giulia Paravicini and Aaron Ross KINSHASA  Reuters    In his 74 years  Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel has lived through independence from Belgium  two coups d etat  multiple civil wars and three changes to the country s name   In the coming days  he hopes to witness another milestone  a presidential election meant to lead to Democratic Republic of Congo s first democratic transfer of power  But like many of his compatriots  he s keeping his expectations in check   There is no freedom   said Ndaywel  who has lived in hiding since last year because of his work with a Catholic group that has organized protests against President Joseph Kabila  who is stepping aside after nearly 18 years in power   There isn t much of a chance that these elections will be transparent   Ndaywel told Reuters   In the latest twist to an election that had already been delayed by more than two years  the electoral commission announced on Thursday that the vote planned for Sunday would be postponed by a week because of a shortage of ballot papers   Even so  for many of Congo s 80 million citizens  half of whom are registered to vote  the election offers a chance to draw a line under decades of conflict and economic stagnation  Repeated crises have left the country mired in poverty and 15 million people in need of food assistance despite immense reserves of commodities such as copper and cobalt  which is important to the electric vehicle revolution   That the election will happen at all   even with the latest delay   represents progress of sorts  The vote to replace Kabila  who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001  was first scheduled for November 2016 but has been repeatedly delayed  Kabila s opponents accused the increasingly unpopular president of trying to cling to power  and security forces shot dead dozens of people protesting against him  The violence raised fears of a slide back into the kind of open conflict in which millions were killed around the turn of the century   After refusing to comment publicly on whether he would defy the constitution to seek a third term  Kabila finally announced in August that he would step down and threw his support behind former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary   For some Congolese  most of whom live on less than  2 a day and survive through informal odd jobs  the announcement provided a rare glimmer of hope    I congratulate Mr Kabila on having organized the elections   It s  something serious we did not expect   said Joseph Mukuna  32  a taxi driver in the capital  Kinshasa   We     think there will be big changes in our country    VIOLENCE Ndaywel  however  is wary of false dawns   He recalled how  when he was a student in 1965 at Kinshasa University  a young army general named Joseph Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup to the delight of much of the country  then known as the Republic of Congo   Certain students knew something was going to happen and they stayed up all night listening to the radio   Ndaywel said   People were happy to have an energetic president at last    But Mobutu  who later renamed the country Zaire and himself as Mobutu Sese Seko  did not organize open elections for the next 32 years   The current election  in which Shadary s main rivals are two opposition candidates  Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu  has been marred by technical problems organizing the vote and violence on the campaign trail   Security forces have cracked down since last week on Tshisekedi and Fayulu s supporters  killing at least seven people and causing parallels to be drawn with the violence plagued 2006 and 2011 elections  And a fire  which authorities blamed on unidentified criminals  destroyed about 8 000 of 10 000 voting machines earmarked for Kinshasa  leaving election officials trying to recall machines from Congo s vast forested interior  On Wednesday  Kinshasa s governor ordered campaigning in the city halted for security reasons  The electoral commission then announced on Thursday that the vote would be delayed until Dec  30  a move that appeared certain to spark fresh protests  VOTING MACHINES Kabila s opponents accuse authorities of conspiring to rig the election with untested electronic voting machines  and have urged their supporters to be vigilant    After you have voted     stay in front of the polling place until our observers have obtained the vote tally sheet to prevent any cheating   Tshisekedi  the president of Congo s largest opposition party  told supporters at a rally   The government says the vote will proceed smoothly although its spokesman  Lambert Mende  accused opposition factions last week of  a radical desire to sabotage the electoral process    The government refused to accept election observers from the European Union and the U S  based Carter Center  which said Kabila s re election in 2011 was marred by widespread fraud  Observers from the African Union and Southern  NYSE SO  African Development Community  SADC  will be present  Their criticisms tend to be more muted   A poll in October by a research group at New York University showed Tshisekedi leading the race with 36 percent support  Shadary and Fayulu trailed with 16 and 8 percent  respectively   But Shadary  who is under EU sanctions over crackdowns on protests while he was interior minister  is expected to benefit from the ruling coalition s grip on state institutions  including state media   Victory for Shadary could help Kabila maintain influence behind the scenes  Opposition candidates say they will make a clean break with the Kabila era but have offered few specific policy proposals and many Congolese are not convinced they can bring about real change   Our politicians are incapable of telling the truth   said Christian Boka  a 24 year old student who was selling power to recharge mobile phones in Kinshasa

177505,399021,SO,Japan to resume commercial whaling after pulling out of IWC,news,"By Linda Sieg and Kiyoshi Takenaka TOKYO  Reuters    Japan will resume commercial whaling from July in its waters and exclusive economic zone while ending its controversial hunts in the Antarctic  it said on Wednesday  as it announced its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission  IWC   Australia and New Zealand welcomed the decision to abandon the Antarctic whale hunt  but expressed disappointment that Japan would engage in any killing of the ocean mammals  The decision  some experts said  allows Japan to save the money it spends to support Antarctic whaling while taking a tough pro whaling stance   a matter of national pride for some conservatives   But doubts exist about whether Japanese commercial whaling can be economically viable  especially as fewer people than ever are eating whale meat  they said   From July 2019  after the withdrawal comes into effect on June 30  Japan will conduct commercial whaling within Japan s territorial sea and its exclusive economic zone  and will cease the take of whales in the Antarctic Ocean the Southern  NYSE SO  Hemisphere   Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a statement announcing the decision   The whaling will be conducted in accordance with international law and within the catch limits calculated in accordance with the method adopted by the IWC to avoid negative impact on cetacean resources   Suga said  Japan  which says most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its culture  has long campaigned without success for the IWC to allow commercial whaling  Some influential lawmakers  constituencies include whaling communities  and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s election district is home to the whaling port of Shimonoseki  The decision to withdraw from the IWC followed its latest rejection of Japan s bid to resume commercial whaling at a September meeting  which Suga said showed it was impossible to bridge the gap between whaling advocates and anti whaling members  The resumption of commercial whaling is an unusual decision for Japan  which stresses multilateralism in its diplomacy  and it sparked swift criticism from environmental groups and others who believe all whales should be protected  International Whaling Commission    OUT OF STEP   The declaration today is out of step with the international community  let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures   international conservationist group Greenpeace said   The Japanese government needs to recommit to the IWC and prioritize new measures for marine conservation   Yoshie Nakatani  an official at the foreign ministry s fisheries division  said Japan would still attend IWC meetings   It s not like we are turning our back on the IWC and abandoning international cooperation   she said   There is no change to our country s respect for the rule of law and multilateralism   New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters welcomed Japan s decision to halt Antarctic whaling but said he was disappointed with the decision to resume any commercial whaling   Whaling is an outdated and unnecessary practice  We continue to hope Japan eventually reconsiders its position and will cease all whaling in order to advance the protection of the ocean s ecosystems   Peters said in a statement  Australia urged Japan to return to the IWC    Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so called  scientific  whaling   its environment minister  Melissa Price  and foreign minister  Marise Payne  said in a statement   Japan has long defied such protests to conduct what it calls scientific research whaling  having repeatedly said its ultimate goal was to whale commercially again  In 2014  the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan should halt its Antarctic whaling  Japan suspended its hunt for one season to re tool its whaling program with measures such as cutting the number of whales and species targeted  but resumed hunting in the 2015 2016 season  capping its Antarctic catch with a quota of 333 whales annually  Whales hunted   Japan began scientific whaling in 1987  a year after an international whaling moratorium began  Its aged whaling mothership is in need of a costly replacement or refit  Much of the meat ends up in shops  even though most Japanese no longer eat it  Whale consumption accounted for 0 1 percent of all Japanese meat consumption  according to the Asahi newspaper  That works out to 35 grams per person per year  according to a whale meat shop owner Koichi Matsumoto   We ate whale meat in the old days but there are lots of other things to eat now   said a 75 year old woman shopper   But if we don t explain internationally that whales are increasing     people won t understand   she added  The ever dwindling demand means an uncertain outlook for Japan s whaling    It could persist as a small scale activity  There are still whale meat restaurants and I think some people will keep eating a small quantity   said Yoichiro Sato  a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University  
  But  if it s too expensive  people will not eat it  As an industry  its prospect is very grim  ",2018-12-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/japan-to-withdraw-from-international-whaling-commission-1730609,1730609

177531,399047,SO,Trump ex lawyer Cohen given three years in prison as risks rise for Trump,news,"By Brendan Pierson  Nathan Layne and Karen Freifeld NEW YORK  Reuters    President Donald Trump s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday for crimes including orchestrating hush payments to women in violation of campaign laws before the 2016 election  and he promised to keep cooperating with the U S  government against his former boss  The sentence  which capped a stunning about face by a lawyer who once vowed to  take a bullet  for Trump  was handed down by a judge in New York on the same day as news that the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid had struck a deal with prosecutors to avoid charges over its role in one of two hush payments involving Trump  The publisher admitted the payment was aimed at influencing the 2016 election  contradicting Trump s statements  The twin developments highlighted the growing political and legal risks for Trump from a months long investigation into the payments by federal prosecutors  Some legal experts said Trump could be charged after leaving office  Justice Department policy is not to indict a sitting president   These prosecutors have charged or reached agreement with everyone involved in this process save one notable exception   said Jonathan Turley  a law professor at George Washington University   It seems likely that this effort is directed at building a larger case against Donald Trump   Cohen had said in a guilty plea in August that he was directed by Trump to arrange a payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal  and personally pay adult film star Stormy Daniels  Prosecutors in New York confirmed last week in a court filing that they believed the president ordered the payments to protect his campaign  Trump has denied the affairs and argues the payments to the two women were not campaign contributions   If it were  it s only civil  and even if it s only civil  there was no violation based on what we did   Trump said in an interview on Tuesday    From the president s point of view  it was to protect his family   Trump s lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  told Reuters   In the Manhattan courtroom  Cohen told U S  District Judge William Pauley that  blind loyalty  led him to cover up for Trump  Cohen said he was ready to provide  as much information as I truthfully possess  on the president   I am committed to proving my integrity and ensuring that history will not remember me as the villain of his story   Cohen said  choking up at times while giving his statement   I am truly sorry and I promise I will be better   Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years for the payments  and unrelated crimes of tax evasion and misleading banks  He gave Cohen two months for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Russia  The judge said the two terms would run simultaneously and he set March 6 for Cohen s surrender  While the sentence was a modest reduction from the four to five years recommended under federal guidelines  Pauley described Cohen s crimes as a  smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct  marked by deception and  motivated by personal greed   He ordered Cohen to forfeit  500 000 and pay restitution of nearly  1 4 million  Cohen  52  walked into court with his wife  son and daughter amid a crowd of photographers and reporters  His 23 year old daughter  Samantha  and 19 year old son  Jake  both wept silently in the courtroom  the son wiping his eyes with his jacket sleeve  Cohen s father  Maurice  a Holocaust survivor who helped convince his son to cooperate with prosecutors against Trump  showed little emotion during the hearing but later told reporters   My heart is ripped    DIRTY DEEDS  Pauley sentenced Cohen for two cases   one involving the financial crimes prosecuted by attorneys in the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York and the other for lying to Congress brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller  The Special Counsel is investigating Russia s role in the 2016 election and possible coordination between Trump s campaign and Moscow  Russia denies U S  allegations of election interference and Trump denies collusion  Prosecutors have said Cohen  just before the November 2016 election  paid Daniels  130 000 and helped arrange the  150 000 payment to McDougal so the women would keep quiet  Federal law requires that the contribution of  anything of value  to a campaign must be disclosed  and an individual donation cannot exceed  2 700   It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light   Cohen told the judge during the sentencing hearing  referring to Trump   I felt it was my duty to cover up his own dirty deeds   Cohen added  The Mueller investigation represents a threat to Trump s presidency  Mueller  who also is examining whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe  has secured guilty pleas from several former Trump aides including his former campaign chairman and national security adviser  and has indicted several Russia individuals and entities  One of Mueller s prosecutors praised Cohen s cooperation  arguing it should be a mitigating factor in his defense   He has provided valuable information  investigative information  to us   attorney Jeannie Rhee told the judge   MOST POWERFUL PERSON  Cohen s lawyer likened the political storm that engulfed his client to Watergate  the 1970 s scandal in which the testimony of White House counsel John Dean helped bring down the Nixon presidency  as a way of emphasizing the pressures he faced    He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in the country   Guy Petrillo told the court in a bid for leniency  Lanny Davis  a lawyer who is advising Cohen on his media strategy  said his client wanted to testify in front of Congress after Mueller completes his investigation and issues a report  which is expected in the coming months   I look forward to assisting Michael to state publicly all he knows about Mr  Trump   and that includes any appropriate congressional committee interested in the search for truth and the difference between facts and lies   Davis said in a statement  Cohen was part of Trump s inner circle who in the past called himself the president s  fixer   After Cohen pleaded guilty to the Mueller charges on Nov  29  Trump called his former lawyer a liar   a weak person and not a very smart person   Michael Avenatti  Daniels  lawyer  attended the sentencing and told reporters outside the courthouse   Michael Cohen is neither a hero nor a patriot  He lied for months about his conduct      Michael Cohen was sentenced today  President Trump is next

177558,399074,SO,Mudslide risk in Southern California wildfire zones prompts evacuation of thousands,news,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Heavy rains and the threat of mudslides in Southern  NYSE SO  California forced the closure of a key coastal highway near Malibu on Thursday and prompted authorities to order evacuations of almost 3 000 residents from hillside areas scarred by recent wildfires 
The same Pacific storm also brought snow to the region s high country  leading to the temporary closure of a stretch of Interstate 5 called the Grapevine  a major truck route that traverses a mountain pass north of Los Angeles  officials said 
The storm  which led the National Weather Service to issue flash flood warnings for parts of Southern California  heightened concerns about the long term risk of mudslides and debris flows around communities where wildfires have stripped foothills and canyon slopes of vegetation 
Last month  the Woolsey Fire incinerated 1 500 buildings and charred 97 000 acres  39 000 hectares  in the upscale coastal enclave of Malibu and adjacent areas near Los Angeles  leaving large swaths of hilly landscape vulnerable to slides and flooding 
 The fires have generated some risks that we need to be aware of and be cautious of for several years into the future   Cindy Matthews  a senior National Weather Service hydrologist  said 
About 2 700 people were ordered evacuated from Lake Elsinore and surrounding Riverside County communities about 60 miles  100 km  east of Los Angeles  where rains threatened to unleash rivers of mud  boulders and other debris down hillsides  according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  Cal Fire  Captain Fernando Herrera 
Some mud flows occurred on Thursday in the area  burned earlier this year by the Holy fire  but no major property damage was reported  Herrera said 
The threat of mudslides in the Woolsey Fire zone around Malibu was not deemed severe enough to trigger evacuations there  Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Tony Imbrenda said 
However  as a heavy debris flow smothered a nearby section of Pacific Coast Highway  forcing authorities to close that stretch of the scenic highway for a few hours 
In all  the storm dumped more than 3 inches  8 cm  of rain in some parts of Southern California  according to the National Weather Service ",2018-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/mudslide-risk-in-southern-california-wildfire-zones-prompts-evacuation-of-thousands-1714204,1714204

177613,399129,SO,Trump says asylum seekers to wait in Mexico  incoming government denies,news,"MEXICO CITY  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that migrants at the U S  Mexico border would stay in Mexico until their asylum claims were individually approved in U S  courts  but Mexico s incoming government denied they had struck any deal 
Mexico s incoming interior minister said there was  no agreement of any type between the future government of Mexico and the United States  
Olga Sanchez Cordero  also the top domestic policy official for president elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who takes office on Dec  1  told Reuters that the incoming government was in talks with the United States but emphasized that they could not make any agreement since they were not yet in government 
Sanchez ruled out that Mexico would be declared a  safe third country  for asylum claimants  following a Washington Post report of a deal with the Trump administration known as  Remain in Mexico   which quoted her calling it a  short term solution  
The plan  according to the newspaper  foresees migrants staying in Mexico while their asylum claims in the United States are being processed  potentially ending a system Trump decries as  catch and release  that has until now often allowed those seeking refuge to wait on safer U S  soil 
 Migrants at the Southern  NYSE SO  Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court  We only will allow those who come into our Country legally  Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain  No  Releasing  into the U S    Trump said in a tweet late Saturday 
 All will stay in Mexico   Trump added in second tweet  that also threatened to close the U S  southern border if necessary 
Jenna Gilbert  managing attorney for the Los Angeles office of Human Rights First  a legal rights organization  said Trump s plan is  outright illegal  and I m sure the administration will once more see itself in court  
Trump has been seeking to block thousands of Central Americans traveling in caravans from entering the United States  and has ordered that immigrants who enter the country illegally from Mexico are ineligible for asylum 
That order has been temporary suspended by a U S  judge 
Sanchez  who said the situation of migrant caravans was  very delicate   did not explicitly rule out that Mexico could keep caravan migrants on its soil while their U S  asylum claims are processed  But she told Reuters that plans to assume  safe third country  status were  ruled out  
If Mexico were to assume  safe third country  status  asylum seekers would be required to claim refugee status in Mexico rather than the United States 
Migration activists have long argued that Mexico does not have the security conditions to offer safe haven for migrants feeling violence in Central America 
The Washington Post article cited Mexican officials and senior members of Lopez Obrador s transition team and said the deal would break with long standing asylum rules and mount a new obstacle to Central American migrants attempting to seek refuge in the United States from poverty and violence 
Alison Leal Parker  U S  managing director for Human Rights Watch  a New York based rights organization  said the plan was  a pathetic attempt by the United States to shirk responsibility  Central Americans have faced serious harm in Mexico  
The effect  Parker said  would likely  push people fleeing for  their  lives into riskier attempts to find safety  including using criminal human smugglers who will gain power under this new policy  
Mexico s incoming deputy interior minister Zoe Robledo said details of the  Remain in Mexico  scheme were still being worked out 
 What we re aiming for is that people leaving their countries due to security issues or violence can find a place to stay in Mexico if that is their decision   Robledo told Reuters 
Robledo said the incoming government wanted to find jobs for Central American migrants in sectors that are short staffed  such as maquila assembly plants 
Lopez Obrador has vowed to try to eliminate the causes of migration by creating more jobs and improving living conditions in Mexico and Central America 
In exchange  he hopes Trump and the Canadian government will agree to help spur economic development in the region 

Outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto has also sought to stem the flow of migrants north by offering jobs to them  and has received backing from the private sector in his efforts ",2018-11-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/mexico-backs-trumps-plan-to-overhaul-asylum-rules-washington-post-1699149,1699149

177671,399187,SO,California searches for 1 000 missing in its deadliest fire,news,"By Terray Sylvester PARADISE  Calif   Reuters    Forensic recovery teams pressed their search for more victims in the flame ravaged northern California town of Paradise on Friday as authorities sought clues to the fate of about 1 000 people reported missing in the state s deadliest wildfire on record  Remains of at least 71 people have been recovered in and around a Sierra foothills hamlet that was home to nearly 27 000 residents before the town  175 miles  280 km  north of San Francisco  was largely incinerated by the deadly Camp Fire on the night of Nov  8  More than a week later  firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 45 percent of the blaze s perimeter  up from 35 percent a day earlier  even as the burned landscape grew slightly to 142 000 acres  57 000 hectares   Besides the toll on human life  property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history  posing the additional challenge of providing long term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents  With more than 9 800 homes up in smoke  many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and family  while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles  At least 1 100 evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches  schools and community centers around the region  with more than 47 000 people in all remaining under evacuation orders  authorities said   Graphic     Search teams with cadaver dogs  meanwhile  combed through charred  rubble strewn expanses of burned out neighborhoods looking for bodies  On Friday night  Butte County Sheriff Korea Honea said the remains of eight more fire victims were recovered during the day  bringing the death toll to 71  That far surpasses the previous fatality record from a single California wildfire   29 in the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles   RAW DATA  Honea said the total roster of people unaccounted for had swelled to 1 011   up from the 630 names posted Thursday night and well more than triple the number counted as missing on Thursday afternoon   This is a dynamic list   Honea told reporters  saying it was compiled from  raw data  that likely included some duplication of names reported with more than one spelling  Honea said it was too soon to conjecture on the fate of those on the list  noting that as of Friday  329 individuals previously reported missing had turned up alive   I don t think it s appropriate for any of us to sit and speculate about what the future holds    The names were being compiled from information received from a special hotline  along with email reports and a review of emergency 911 calls that came in on the first night of the fire  Honea said   Some listed have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities  either because they lack phone service or were unaware anyone was looking for

177672,399188,SO,Search on for 1 276 now missing after California s deadliest wildfire,news,"By Terray Sylvester and Steve Holland
PARADISE  Calif   Reuters    The number of people missing after California s deadliest and most destructive wildfire jumped on Saturday to 1 276  despite authorities locating hundreds of people who scattered when the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise 
Forensic recovery teams sifting through the charred wreckage recovered the remains of five more victims  bringing the death toll to at least 76  authorities said  Sixty three of them have been tentatively identified  pending DNA confirmation 
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said much of the increase in the number of missing was due to his office s efforts to comb through a backlog of emergency calls that came in during the first hours of the fire on Nov  8 
He said officials were sifting through the list of missing persons for duplications and people who fled  Some 380 people had been located and taken off the list since Friday  he said 
 A lot of progress is being made with regard to that  but this is still raw data   Honea told a news conference 
The sheriff spoke after President Donald Trump visited Paradise  the small community that was home to nearly 27 000 people in the Sierra foothills  175 miles  280 km  north of San Francisco  before being all but consumed by the blaze 
 Nobody could have thought this would ever happen   Trump told reporters amid the charred wreckage of the town s Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park 
 This is very sad to see  As far as the lives are concerned  nobody knows quite yet   Trump said   Right now we want to take care of the people who have been so badly hurt  
Trump was flanked by California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor elect Gavin Newsom  Brown said the federal government was doing what it needed to do  including supporting first responders and helping with clean up and search for victims 
The disaster already ranks among the deadliest U S  wildfires since the turn of the last century  Eighty seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910  Minnesota s Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people 
Trump has blamed the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement  and he said he discussed the issue with Brown and Newsom on the ride into Paradise 
Asked whether the scenes of devastation had changed his view on climate change  Trump said   No  I have a strong opinion  I want great climate and we re going to have that and we re going to have forests that are very safe  
Authorities attribute the high death toll from the blaze   dubbed  Camp Fire    partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little warning  driven by howling winds and fueled by drought desiccated scrub and trees 
More than a week later  firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 55 percent of the blaze s perimeter 
Besides the toll on human life  property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history  posing the additional challenge of providing long term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents 
EVACUEES
With more than 12 700 homes and other structures up in smoke  many refugees have taken up temporary residence with friends and family  while others have pitched tents or were living out of their vehicles 
Hundreds of evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches  schools and community centers around the region  with more than 46 000 people remaining under evacuation orders  authorities said 
Several shelters are full and although authorities say they still have space for everyone  hundreds of people have been camping in tents and cars in the area 
LIST OF THE MISSING
The names were being compiled from information received from a special hotline  along with email reports and a review of emergency 911 calls that came in on the first night of the fire  Honea said 
Some listed have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities  Others may not have been immediately listed because of delays in reporting them 
Honea bristled at a Friday press conference when asked whether many of those listed  more than a week after the disaster  were expected at this point to end up either deceased or declared missing and presumed dead 
     I don t think it s appropriate for any of us to sit and speculate about what the future holds   he said 
The sheriff on Saturday emphasized that authorities were largely relying on the public s cooperation to determine who on the list of missing persons is alive 
 I want to tell people that it s really very important for you to take a look at the list and call us if you re on the list and let us know  
Weather conditions have since turned more in the firefighters  favor  though strong  gusty winds and lower humidity were expected through early Sunday ahead of rain forecast for mid week

177678,399194,SO,Bondholders push back on Mercuria Energy s DIP proposal for Aegean,news,By Aaron Weinman NEW YORK  LPC    Bondholders of Greek fuel services provider Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc are objecting to a US 532m debtor in possession  DIP  loan from Mercuria Energy Group that could give the Swiss commodities trader a controlling stake in the company and push their recoveries into cents on the dollar territory  three sources familiar with the situation said      As part of a court approved restructuring agreement  Mercuria will provide the DIP financing to bankrupt Aegean in exchange for a  stalking horse bid   which allows it to bid first on the distressed company s assets       The move is part of Mercuria s strategy to finance cash strapped firms that are strategically linked to its core businesses of energy and commodities trading      Aegean Marine is a Greek company focusing on petroleum refining and trading and is one of the largest independent fuel suppliers in the world      Although Mercuria s restructuring proposal values Aegean at US 681m  the ad hoc committee of convertible bondholders is opposing the plan as it would cut their recoveries on US 267m of outstanding bonds to 31  of face value  or US 82 7m      Mercuria s DIP financing was approved on November 9  It includes a US 72m delayed draw term loan and also gives Aegean access to a US 160m revolving credit facility  RCF  and a US 300m global RCF  according to court filings      Aegean filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York on November 6  Judge Stuart Bernstein  who is presiding over the bankruptcy case filed in the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  subsequently approved Mercuria s proposed DIP financing and an auction plan for the company s assets  as long as there is an open and transparent bidding process for control of Aegean Marine      The ad hoc bondholder group is working on a competing restructuring plan that would boost their recoveries  two of the sources said      The final DIP hearing will take place on December 5  LIQUIDITY STRAIN    Aegean signed a US 750m three year secured borrowing base loan in December 2017  but lenders were reluctant to allow the company to draw down on the credit facility due to concerns over its inventory levels and accounts receivables      The financing comprised a US 200m A facility and a US 550m letter of credit  guarantee and overdraft B facility  according to LPC data      ABN Amro was the lead bookrunner and mandated lead arranger on the transaction   BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   KBC Bank  Natixis  MUFG  HSH Nordbank  Belfius Bank   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  and Mashreqbank are also lenders      As part of a financial audit overhaul in May 2018  Aegean named three directors   Tyler Baron  Raymond Bartoszek and Donald Moore   to its board of directors in a bid to turn around its liquidity woes and also terminated a consulting agreement with Aegean s founder Dimitris Melissanidis       The new board members started talks with the bank group to allow drawing on the credit facility but pushback from the lenders left illiquid Aegean hamstrung       The company had no additional liquidity to procure supplies and had little fuel to sell to the markets   one of the sources said   CHECKERED HISTORY     The new board members ordered an audit of Aegean s financials dating back to 2010  In November  Aegean confirmed it had written off US 200m in accounts receivable  and a further US 100m may have been fraudulently siphoned away       The audit committee  along with Aegean s board members  believed a contract with Oil Tank Engineering and Consulting  a company incorporated in March 2010 in the Marshall Islands  was signed in 2010 to build an oil terminal in the United Arab Emirate of Fujairah but the contract was used to misappropriate funds through over priced contracts  Aegean said in a press release on November 2   The audit also unveiled payment of oil receivables that were never delivered  Costs to construct the Fujairah oil terminal facility had also increased by more than US 100m to approximately US 222m  according to internal documents obtained by LPC      Aegean said in June it had reported the findings of the audit committee to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice  Several Aegean employees deemed complicit in the fraud had been dismissed        Armed with the audit s preliminary findings  Aegean s new board members approached commodities traders  such as Trafigura and Freepoint  hoping to find a trade financing partner to fund Aegean after commercial banks would not  two of the sources said      Mercuria stepped in and offered Aegean US 30m of incremental liquidity  along with US 250m and US 750m in revolving credit facilities through January 31  2019  Aegean said on August 16      The transaction gave the Swiss commodities trader a 30  stake in Aegean  and effectively set the stage for a takeover       Aegean Marine was founded in Piraeus  Greece in 1995 by Greek businessman Dimitris Melissanidis  The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange

177679,399195,SO,U S  prosecutors investigate Hyundai  Kia vehicle recalls  source,news,"By Hyunjoo Jin and David Shepardson
SEOUL WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  prosecutors are investigating if  Hyundai Motor   KS 005380  and affiliate Kia Motors   KS 000270  vehicle recalls over engine defects were conducted properly  according to a person with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by Reuters 
The South Korean firms  together the world s No 5 automaker  recalled nearly 1 7 million vehicles in 2015 and 2017 in the United States in one of their biggest recalls in the country  citing an engine failure that increases the risk of a crash 
The U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  SDNY   part of the U S  Department of Justice  DoJ   has launched a criminal investigation  the person told Reuters 
It remains to be seen whether the probe will lead to charges  the person added  If criminal charges are filed  it could lead to hefty fines for Hyundai and Kia 
The DoJ is coordinating with the U S  transport regulator  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA   on the investigation  the person said  asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential 
Nicole Navas Oxman  a DoJ spokeswoman  declined to comment 
 The Justice Department generally does not confirm  deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non existence of an investigation   she said in an emailed statement to Reuters 
The United States has previously investigated and imposed strict penalties on other automakers such as Toyota Motor  T 7203  and Volkswagen AG  DE VOWG p  
In 2017  a U S  judge dismissed a criminal charge against Toyota  after it completed three years of monitoring under a  1 2 billion settlement in which it admitted to misleading the public about sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles 
The settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen admitted to diesel emissions fraud and paid  4 3 billion in fines in 2017 
Apart from the SDNY probe  Hyundai and Kia are also the subject of an investigation by NHTSA into whether their recalls covered enough vehicles and were conducted in a timely manner 
NHTSA has  active  investigations into engine issues related to certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles  the regulator told Reuters 
 These investigations are ongoing   no final conclusions have been reached   it added 
Hyundai declined to comment on the SDNY probe 
PROBE TO EXACERBATE WOES
An investigation by U S  prosecutors will add to Hyundai and Kia s woes at a time when they are grappling with sluggish sales in the United States and China 
The pair have already set aside roughly 1 trillion won   885 million  in 2017 and 2018 to cover costs mainly stemming from recalls over engine problems 
In the United States  Hyundai recalled 470 000 Sonata sedans in 2015 due to the failure of  Theta II  engines  In 2017  it expanded its U S  recall to 572 000 Sonata and Santa Fe sport utility vehicles  citing the same engine issue  the NHTSA said 
Kia also recalled 618 160 Optima  Sorento and Sportage vehicles which use the same engine in the United States 
However  Kim Gwang ho  an engineer at Hyundai and a company veteran of 26 years  told NHTSA that the companies should have recalled more vehicles in 2015  citing an internal report ",2018-11-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-prosecutors-probe-hyundai-kia-vehicle-recalls-source-1696254,1696254

177709,399225,SO,At least 56 killed  130 missing in California s deadliest wildfire,news,"By Terray Sylvester PARADISE  Calif   Reuters    National Guard troops joined the grim search on Wednesday for more victims in the ruins of an incinerated northern California town while the death toll climbed to 56 in the most deadly and destructive wildfire in the state s history  The latest fatality count was announced as authorities released a revised list of 130 people reported missing by loved ones after flames largely obliterated the Sierra foothills town of Paradise  about 175 miles  280 km  north of San Francisco  last Thursday  The majority on the list were over the age of 65  Nearly 230 people were initially reported as missing in the killer blaze  dubbed the Camp Fire  Most of those who remain unaccounted for are from Paradise  once home to 27 000 people  More than 8 900 homes and other buildings burned to the ground in and around Paradise  and an estimated 50 000 people remained under evacuation orders in the area   Adding to the misery of some survivors was an outbreak of norovirus  a highly contagious gastrointestinal illness  at a shelter housing about 200 evacuees in the nearby city of Chico  Public health agency spokeswoman Lisa Almaguer said at least 20 people may have caught the virus  The footprint of the six day old fire grew to 135 000 acres  55 000 hectares  as of Wednesday  even as diminished winds and rising humidity helped firefighters shore up containment lines around more than a third of the perimeter  Still  the ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris made a strong impression on Governor Jerry Brown  U S  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other officials who toured the devastation on Wednesday   This is one of the worst disasters I ve seen in my career  hands down   Brock Long  head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  told reporters in Chico   It looks like a war zone  It is a war zone   Brown said  NO FINGER POINTING  After visiting some of California s earlier wildfire zones in August  Zinke blamed  gross mismanagement of forests  because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by  environmental terrorist groups   But pressed by reporters on Wednesday  Zinke demurred   Now is really not the time to point fingers   he said   It is a time for America to stand together    The blaze  fueled by thick  drought desiccated scrub  has capped two back to back catastrophic wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change  Lawyers for some of the victims claimed in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that lax equipment maintenance by an electric utility was the proximate cause of the fire  which officially remains under investigation  The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern  NYSE SO  California  most notably the Woolsey Fire  which has killed at least two people  destroyed more than 500 structures and displaced about 200 000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles  On Wednesday  the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department said the body of a possible third victim was found there in a burned out dwelling  Cal Fire officials said that blaze was 52 percent contained as of Wednesday night  In Butte County  the search for more human remains kicked into high gear as a National Guard contingent of 50 military police officers joined dozens of search and recovery workers and at least 22 cadaver dogs  Sheriff Kory Honea said  The remains of eight more fire victims were found on Wednesday  raising the official number of fatalities to 56   far exceeding the previous record from a single wildfire in California history   29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933  The Camp Fire also stands as one of the deadliest U S  wildfires since the turn of the last century  More than 80 people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August of 1910  TRACKING THE MISSING Butte County Sheriff s spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list of 130 missing would fluctuate from day to day as more names are added and others are removed  either because they turn up safe or end up identified among the dead  Sheriff Honea invited relatives of the missing to provide DNA samples to compare against samples taken from newly recovered remains in hopes of speeding up identification of the dead  But he acknowledged it was possible some of the missing might never be found  Authorities attributed the magnitude of casualties to the staggering speed with which the fire struck Paradise  Wind driven flames roared through town so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives  Some victims were found in or around the burned out wreckage of their vehicles  Anna Dise  a resident of Butte Creek Canyon west of Paradise  told KRCR TV her father  Gordon Dise  66  died when he ran back inside to gather belongings and their house collapsed on him   Dise said she could not flee in her car because the tires had melted  To survive  she hid overnight in a neighbor s pond with her dogs   It was so fast   Dise recounted of the fire   I didn t expect it to move so fast

177772,399288,SO,Democrats pick up U S  governorships but lose Florida  Ohio,news,"By Letitia Stein TALLAHASSEE  Fla   Reuters    Democrats won governorships on Tuesday in several U S  states that supported Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 but lost high profile races in Florida and Ohio  as voters cast ballots in dozens of gubernatorial contests across the country  The hotly contested race in Georgia  where Democrat Stacey Abrams was seeking to become the first black woman to be elected governor of a U S  state  remained too close to call early on Wednesday  In Florida  Democrat Andrew Gillum lost his attempt to become the state s first black governor  suffering a narrow defeat to Republican Ron DeSantis in a racially charged contest that drew national attention   I still plan to be on the front lines alongside every one of you when it comes to standing up and fighting for what we believe in   Gillum  the 39 year old mayor of Tallahassee  told supporters at his election night party  where small groups of people embraced  tears streaming down their faces  Republicans also scored a major victory in Ohio s governor race  where Mike DeWine  the state attorney general  defeated Democrat Richard Cordray  who served as the first director of the U S  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  But in Wisconsin  Democrat Tony Evers pulled off a narrow win in unseating Republican incumbent Scott Walker  according to data provider DDHQ  The two term governor  who also survived a Democratic driven recall election in 2012 after ending collective bargaining for public workers  briefly ran for president in 2016  In addition to Wisconsin  Democrats also won governor races in three other states   Michigan  Pennsylvania and Kansas   that supported Trump in 2016  bolstering the party s hopes of capturing those states in the 2020 presidential election  In Michigan  Democrat Gretchen Whitmer turned back Republican Bill Schuette in the contest to replace Republican Governor Rick Snyder  who could not run again due to term limits  In Kansas  Democrat Laura Kelly defeated Kris Kobach  a staunch Trump ally  where outgoing Republican Governor Sam Brownback suffered from low approval ratings  Democratic candidates also triumphed in Illinois  Maine  New Mexico and Nevada  where Republicans had held the governorships  All told  Democrats had flipped at least seven Republican held governorships without suffering any losses as of early Wednesday morning  While much of focus of the elections on Tuesday was on which party would win control of the U S  Congress  Republicans and Democrats were battling across the country for state level power  which could have a major impact on issues such as congressional redistricting and healthcare   EVERY VOTE COUNTED  In Georgia  Abrams  44  was locked in a tight battle with Republican Brian Kemp  the state s secretary of state  There was a minor party candidate also in the race  and under Georgia law  if no candidate exceeds 50 percent of the vote  the top two finishers advance to a December runoff election  By 2 a m  EST  Kemp held a three point lead  but Abrams told her supporters that she expected a runoff once all votes were counted   I promise you tonight that we are going to make sure every vote is counted   she said   We are still on the verge of history  and the best is yet to come   Another Democrat trying to make history  Ben Jealous  lost his bid to become Maryland s first black governor to incumbent Republican Larry Hogan  The races in Florida and Georgia were seen as a test of whether liberal candidates could prevail in Southern  NYSE SO  states  where centrist Democrats have repeatedly lost  by appealing to a coalition of young and minority voters  Both DeSantis and Kemp had strong support from Trump  who traveled to their states in the closing days of the campaigns to energize Republicans at  Make America Great Again  rallies  Democratic former President Barack Obama swooped in to boost the Democrats  and media star Oprah Winfrey visited Georgia on behalf of Abrams  Accusations of race baiting dogged Kemp  55  and DeSantis  40  who denied the allegations  Neither Georgia nor Florida has elected a Democratic governor in 20 years   We all learned in 2016 not to count on anything  not polls  not election integrity  not the electoral mood   Dawn Hucklebridge  36  a friend of Gillum  said at his election night gathering as it became clear he would likely lose   I m pretty disappointed   REPUBLICAN DOMINANCE Going into Tuesday  Republicans controlled 33 governors  mansions and two thirds of state legislative chambers  The Democratic Party said it flipped at least six state legislative chambers on the strength of local races  Democrats now have complete control of state government in Colorado  New York  Illinois  Maine and New Mexico  Democrats  playing catch up after a net loss of 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats during the eight year Obama administration  fielded their largest slate of legislative candidates in more than three decades   The outcome of elections for state positions could also affect future control of the U S  House of Representatives  Governors and hundreds of legislators elected this year will be in office when congressional districts are redrawn after the 2020 Census  In some states  a governor s power to sign or veto congressional maps could decide the partisan balance  Democrats also kept control of Connecticut  a traditionally Democratic state that Republicans had hoped to pick up  In Colorado  Democrat Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected governor of a U S  state  But Democrat Christine Hallquist lost her bid to become the first openly

177773,399289,SO,Italy s Enria wins race to head ECB banking watchdog,news,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa FRANKFURT  Reuters    Italian Andrea Enria was picked on Wednesday to head the European Central Bank s supervisory arm  overseeing a bloated  21 trillion euro banking sector still troubled by a legacy of bad debt from the euro zone s financial crisis  Defeating Ireland s Sharon Donnery in a hotly contested run off  Enria will now head the Single Supervisory Mechanism  covering the euro zone s 118 top lenders  with many still reeling from the last recession and facing new challenges from hacking to fintech  The ECB s Governing Council selected Enria in a secret ballot  and his appointment must now be approved by the full European Parliament and relevant ministers  Enria  who has chaired the London based European Banking Authority since 2011  has played a major role in shaping the European Union s new financial rulebook in the aftermath of the crisis  A former supervisor at the Bank of Italy and the ECB  he is viewed as politically neutral and ruffled some feathers at home for what was seen as an overly tough stance on unpaid bank loans and credit to small companies   If approved by the Parliament and confirmed by the Council of the European Union  Mr Enria will succeed Dani le Nouy as Chair of the Supervisory Board on 1 January 2019   the ECB said in a statement  Enria declined comment  Heading one of the EU s newest institutions  he will be charged with reforming an industry whose fragmented structure and regulatory framework  low profits and piles of non performing loans have left it struggling to compete globally  Sources told Reuters earlier that Enria s candidacy would be backed by the central banks of Italy and other southern European countries  while northern Europeans were expected to split their vote as both candidates were seen as qualified for the job  Southern  NYSE SO  Europeans were alienated by Donnery s harsh approach as the main architect of the ECB s drive to clean up banks  balance sheets from bad loans  which are mainly concentrated in Cyprus  Greece  Portugal and Italy  The initiative  though still approved  was eventually watered down due to opposition from Italy  Enria  while not enjoying Italian political support  was still seen as the candidate with a more constructive approach to Italian banks  some of the weakest lenders in Europe   Both candidates had been approved by the European Parliament s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs after informal hearings  but the representative of Italy s eurosceptic League party did not back Enria  The choice is also likely to intensify criticism about the selection of women at the ECB  where all but two members of the 25 strong Governing Council are men   It also means that both arms of the bank will be led Italians for the next year  until the term of ECB President Mario Draghi expires next October  Donnery s nomination was complicated by the aspiration of her current boss  Irish central bank chief Philip Lane  to replace Peter Praet as the ECB s chief economist in May  
While Donnery s appointment would not have legally disqualified Lane  having two senior officials from a relatively small country would have been difficult to sell politically as several nations have never held a top ECB job   editing by John Stonestreet  editing by David Stamp ",2018-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-eu-mp-slams-colleagues-for-seeking-to-influence-ecb-appointment-1677954,1677954

177886,399402,SO,Washington tells India Westinghouse could be sold by year end  sources,news,"By Douglas Busvine NEW DELHI  Reuters    The U S  administration has told India that Westinghouse Electric Co will emerge from bankruptcy and be sold by the year end  industry and diplomatic sources have said  raising the prospect of a Washington supported sale or bailout for the nuclear firm  India  like other nuclear nations  has been closely watching the fate of Japanese owned Westinghouse  which filed for Chapter 11 in March after an estimated  13 billion of cost overruns at two U S  projects  casting a shadow over the nuclear industry  There has been debate over potential U S  support for the reactor maker since owner Toshiba  T 6502   the laptop to chips conglomerate  announced the blow out at Westinghouse last year  Some form of U S  backing or involvement  industry experts say  could avoid a Chinese or Russian buyer unpalatable to Washington  which would prefer to keep Westinghouse s advanced nuclear technology out of the hands of its foreign rivals  The White House declined comment   We were told that  by the end of the year  Westinghouse would really rework its situation and really be back in business   India s foreign secretary  Subrahmanyam Jaishankar  told a briefing  referring to an exit from bankruptcy  Civil nuclear cooperation has been a cornerstone of U S  India relations  and the proposed construction of six Westinghouse AP1000 reactors in India s Andhra Pradesh  announced in 2016  crowned more than a decade of diplomatic efforts  The achievement was left in limbo by Westinghouse s troubles   Graphic on nuclear power plants in India    The project  however  found specific mention in the Indian government s joint communique from Prime Minister Narendra Modi s first meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington a week ago  The two leaders  looked forward to conclusion of contractual agreements between Westinghouse Electric Company and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for six nuclear reactors in India and also related project financing   the communique said  Sources familiar with the matter said the statement was backed by U S  guidance that Westinghouse would be sold to a U S  investor after emerging from Chapter 11 proceedings  in turn paving the way to close the reactor deal in 2018  Elaborating  one industry source with direct knowledge of Westinghouse s talks with India said   Both sides are engaged and once Westinghouse comes out of bankruptcy we would look to conclude the contract   The source  who was not authorized to speak to media  requested anonymity  A diplomat involved in preparations for the Modi Trump meeting corroborated this timeline  saying   The bankruptcy is on track and should wrap up by year end    MASSIVELY IMPORTANT  Westinghouse and India s Department of Atomic Energy did not respond to emailed requests for comment  The state owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India could not be reached for comment  Toshiba said it wasn t in a position to predict when Westinghouse would emerge from Chapter 11  Because the bankruptcy court has not yet approved a restructuring plan  no decision has been taken on searching for a buyer  it said  U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry  whom diplomats say plans to lead a business delegation to India in October  last week left the door open to a potential deal   This is a lot bigger issue than just allowing the United States a couple of plants in the southern part of the United States   he told reporters   This is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America s allies   Perry declined to elaborate on potential acquirers  But former Westinghouse executives have told Reuters that they have been approached by private equity funds to help them assess a possible deal to buy the company   Paving the way for a deal  Toshiba has agreed on a liability cap on one of the U S  projects  the unfinished Vogtle power plant in Georgia that is being led by  Southern Co   N SO   If a similar agreement can be reached for the VC Summer plant in South Carolina  which is co owned by  SCANA Corp   N SCG   that would clear the path to an exit from Chapter 11  say people familiar with the matter   The administration is hoping that the reconfigured company will be back in operation later this year   with a U S  buyer   and the deal with India can be closed next year   said Washington based analyst Ashley Tellis  an authority on nuclear policy and former Republican official  Tellis  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  was instrumental in negotiating a civil nuclear accord with India during the George W  Bush administration although  more than a decade on  it has yet to yield actual nuclear deals  Trump s pick for U S  ambassador to India  Kenneth Juster  helped lay the ground for the talks on the civil nuclear accord  He would play a  critical role  in bringing the project to completion  added Tellis  Ahead of Modi s visit  a U S  official had said the United States was  looking forward to U S  built nuclear reactors contributing to India s energy security     We very much support continued negotiations between Westinghouse and its Indian partners  recognizing that deals on this scale can take time   the official said   Westinghouse has said it will concentrate on reactors only   and not construction   meaning it would require partners for its Indian and other projects  In India  its favored partner would be Larsen   Toubro  NS LART   industry sources say
