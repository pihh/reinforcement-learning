115377,336892,MTB,Schwab TD Ameritrade deal shows Trump rule easing boon for financial MA,news,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A possible purchase by brokerage giant  Charles Schwab  Corp   N SCHW  of rival TD Ameritrade  O AMTD  reflects a more relaxed mood under Trump administration regulators  which has helped unleash other big ticket takeovers in the financial sector  analysts said 
CNBC and Fox Business reported on Wednesday that the two brokerages were in talks to ink a merger that Fox said could be valued at  26 billion  The companies did not respond on Thursday to Reuters requests for comment 
Regulatory filings show the U S  Federal Reserve has partial oversight over both firms and may need to approve the deal  depending on how it is structured  The Fed declined to comment 
The regulatory path  however  looks smooth despite potential protests from Democratic lawmakers  who worry that the creation of more financial behemoths increases systemic risks 
 We could see some policymakers question the resulting company s growth in assets under management  but my sense is that overall interest in the deal will be low in Washington   said Isaac Boltansky  director of policy research at Washington based Compass Point Research   Trading 
Just two days ago the Fed approved the  28 billion marriage of BB T Corp  N BBT  and SunTrust  N STI   quickly sealing the biggest bank tie up since the 2007 2009 financial crisis  In March  the Fed approved U S  regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp s  O FITB  purchase of smaller rival MB Financial Inc  for  4 7 billion 
Last December  the Fed quickly approved two of the largest bank mergers of the year  Cadence Bancorp s merger with State Bank Financial Corporation and Synovus Financial Corp s merger with FCB Financial Holdings 
Those deals were made possible by Congress  move last year to ease post crisis financial rules and by the Fed s more relaxed attitude toward tie ups under Trump appointed officials 
Banking deals in particular had languished after the financial crisis as strict capital and liquidity rules were imposed on lenders with more than  50 billion in assets  making it unattractive for mid size firms to acquire more assets  Regulators had also aggressively enforced rules that allow them to bar firms with compliance issues from expanding 
The number of U S  bank deals fell in each of the four years to 2018  dropping 23 percent between 2014 and 2017  according to Reuters  even while overall M A activity was rising each year 
Over the past few years  the Fed has expedited approvals for high profile deals that tend to attract public and industry scrutiny  The approval period fell from an average of 297 days in 2015 to 135 during the first half of 2019  Fed data shows 
The central bank has also taken a more flexible approach on compliance issues  according to Fed officials and lawyers 
In the case of BB T   SunTrust  for example  the Fed approved the deal in just nine months despite discovering some unfair and deceptive practices in SunTrust s business customer division  By contrast  it took M T Bank  N MTB  more than three years to complete its 2015 tie up with Hudson City Bancorp after the Fed found problems with M T s compliance systems 
Securities lawyers said it was also unlikely the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  which oversees brokers and has also been easing rules under Trump officials  would stand in the way of an Schwab TD Ameritrade deal  although it might scrutinize the types of fees and services the new company provides 
 There is always going to be scrutiny  but I think we re going to see folks say   OK  let s do it    said Alois Pirker  director of research for wealth management at Aite Group

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by and welcome to the M T Bank Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  At this time  all participants have been placed in a listen only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation   Operator Instructions  I will now turn the call over to Don MacLeod  Director of Investor Relations to begin Donald J  MacLeod    Administrative Vice President  Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Lori  and good morning  I d like to thank everyone for participating in M T s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call  both by telephone and through the webcast  If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning  you may access access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website   and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link Also before we start  I d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M T Bank Corporation  M T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings including those found on Forms 8 K  10 K and 10 Q for a complete discussion of forward looking statements Now I d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer  Darren King Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Don and good morning everyone  As noted in this morning s release  M T s results for the fourth quarter closed out a year of solid performance  which included 8  growth in earnings per common share  11  growth in non interest revenues with mortgage banking and trust fees leading the improvement  a stable year over year net interest margin  notwithstanding the interest rate volatility we experienced in 2019  a credit environment that remains favorable  which although non accrual loans increased slightly  reflected the sixth consecutive year of credit losses below 20 basis points  And industry leading returns on shareholder capital  with return on equity for the year improved slightly to 12 87   and return on tangible common equity exceeding 19  for the second consecutive year We will review the numbers for the full year in a moment  but first let s turn our attention to the results for the fourth quarter  Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were  3 60 for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with  3 47 per share in the third quarter of  2019 and  3 76 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018  Net income for the quarter was  493 million compared with  480 million in the linked quarter and  546 million in the year ago quarter On a GAAP basis  M T s fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1 6   and an annualized return on average common equity of 12 95   This compares with rates of 1 58  and 12 73  respectively in the previous quarter Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter  were after tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to  3 million or  0 02 per common share  down slightly from  4 million and  0 03 per common share in the prior quarter Consistent with our long term practice  M T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis  from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets  as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions  when they occur M T s net operating income for the fourth quarter  which excludes intangible amortization  was  496 million compared with  484 million in the linked quarter and  550 million in 2018 s fourth quarter  Diluted net operating earnings per common share were  3 62 for the recent quarter compared with  3 50 in 2019 s third quarter and  3 79 in the fourth quarter of 2018 Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders  equity of 1 67  and 19 08  in the recent quarter  The comparable returns were 1 66  and 18 85  in the third quarter of 2019 In accordance with the SEC s guidelines  this morning s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non GAAP results  including tangible assets and equity  Both GAAP and net operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 were impacted by certain noteworthy items  Included in the fourth quarter 2018 results  was a  20 million contribution to the M T Charitable Foundation  that amounted to  15 million after tax effect or  0 11 per common share Also included in 2018 s fourth quarter was a  15 million reduction in M T s provision for income taxes  arising from an IRS approved change in the tax treatment of certain loan fees  which was retroactive to 2017  This also amounted to  0 11 per common share Turning to the balance sheet and income statement  taxable equivalent net interest income was  1 01 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019  down  21 million from  1 04 billion in the linked quarter  The net interest margin declined to 3 64   down 14 basis points from 3 78  in the linked quarter  A higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the Fed had an estimated 4 basis points dilutive effect on margin  The higher cash balances were a result of elevated escrow deposits  seasonally high commercial deposits  and increased trust demand deposits We estimate that the lower short term interest rates on the Fed s July  September and October rate actions  pressured the margin by as much as 10 basis points  The linked quarter 38 basis point decline in one month LIBOR was another factor in the decline Included in that 10 basis point impact of lower rates  was a decline in the overall cost of interest bearing deposits  the cost of which declined by 9 basis points compared with the linked quarter  which provided a benefit to the margin of about 2 basis points Average loans increased  167 million compared with the previous quarter  The ongoing and planned runoff of residential real estate loans  primarily acquired Hudson City mortgage loans  was more than offset by growth in other loan categories  which increased in total by  509 million or seven tenths of 1  from the third quarter Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter  commercial and industrial loans were about 1  higher than in the prior quarter  This included  110 million seasonal increase in loans to vehicle dealers to finance their inventories  combined with an almost equal increase in other C I loans Commercial real estate loans were down less than 1  compared with the third quarter  reflecting payoffs as well as completed construction loans  which did not rollover in the permanent financing  and a lower level of commercial mortgage loans held for sale Residential real estate loans  approximately half of which were acquired in the Hudson City transaction  continued the expected pace of paydowns  and that portfolio declined by about 2  or  342 million Consumer loans were up 3   with growth in recreation finance loans and to a lesser extent  indirect auto loans  outpacing further declines in home equity lines and loans On an end of period basis  loan growth was stronger in the commercial portfolios  with commercial and industrial loans  about 3  higher than at the end of the prior quarter  while commercial real estate loans were up about 2   There were no particular regions or industries that stood out in terms of loan growth during the fourth quarter Average consumer deposits  which exclude deposits received at M T s Cayman Islands office as well as CDs over  250 000  were up about 3  compared with the third quarter  As noted earlier  elevated escrow deposits  seasonally high commercial deposits  and higher levels of trust demand deposits  were the drivers of that increase Turning to non interest income  non interest income totaled  521 million in the fourth quarter  compared with  528 million in the prior quarter  The quarter s results included a  6 million    included  6 million of securities valuation losses on our remaining portfolio of GSE preferred stock  compared with a  4 million gain in the third quarter Mortgage banking revenues were  118 million in the recent quarter compared with  137 million in the linked quarter  Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were  697 million in the quarter  down about 16  compared with the third quarter  Nonetheless  origination revenues improved by  3 million to a total of  26 million  as a result of higher gain on sale margin Residential servicing revenues were a little changed from the previous quarter  Total residential mortgage banking revenues  including both origination and servicing activities were  91 million compared with  88 million in the prior quarter  Commercial mortgage banking revenues were  27 million in the fourth quarter  compared with what was a record  49 million in the linked quarter Trust income was  152 million in the recent quarter  improved from  144 million in the previous quarter and up 12  from  135 million in 2018 s fourth quarter  New business generation continues to be strong  while the strength in equity markets has been a modest tailwind  Service charges on deposit accounts were  111 million  essentially unchanged from the prior quarter Trading and FX gains were  17 million  improved from  16 million in the previous quarter  primarily reflecting customer interest rate swap activity done on behalf of commercial customers  in connection with loan originations during the quarter Turning to expenses  operating expenses for the fourth quarter  which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were  819 million  down from  873 million in the third quarter  Salaries and benefits declined by  8 million to  469 million from the prior quarter  reflecting a lower headcount and seasonally lower benefit costs  Other costs of operation for the recent quarter reflect a  16 million reduction in the valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights  Recall  that there was a  14 million addition to the allowance in the third quarter Excluding the changes in the valuation allowance  other costs of operations declined by  825 million  driven largely by lower professional services expense  The efficiency ratio  which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 53 1  in the recent quarter  improved from 55 9  in the previous quarter Next  let s turn to credit  our credit quality continues to be pretty much in line  with the trends we ve been seeing for quite a while  Annualized net charge off as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019  compared with 16 basis points in the third quarter  The provision for credit losses was  54 million in the recent quarter  exceeding net charge offs by  13 million  The excess provision primarily reflects loan growth  The allowance for credit losses was  1 05 billion at the end of December The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1 16  at the end of 2019  unchanged from the end of the third quarter and up 1 basis point from the end of 2018  Non accrual loans declined by  42 million at December 31st  compared with the prior quarter end  The ratio of non accrual loans to total loans fell 6 basis points to end the quarter at 1 06  Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest  excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were  519 million at the end of the quarter  Of those loans   480 million or 93  are guaranteed by government related entities  We will address CECL in a few moments during the discussion of our outlook for 2020 Turning to capital  M T s common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9 72  at the end of 2019  compared with 9 81  at the end of the third quarter  The decline reflects earnings retention during the quarter  share repurchases  and the impact of loan growth  which in turn led to slightly higher end of period risk weighted assets  M T repurchased 1 7 million shares of its common stock during the past quarter  costing an aggregate  282 million Next  I d like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2019s full year results  GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were  13 75  up 8  from  12 74 in 2018  Net income was  1 93 billion  improved from  1 92 billion in the prior year  These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1 61  and 12 87  respectively Net operating income  which excludes intangible amortization was  1 94 billion  up slightly from the prior year  Net operating income for 2019 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders  equity was 1 69  and 19 08  respectively Average diluted common shares declined by 7   as a result of repurchase activity  while the total payout ratio including common stock dividends was 102   Tangible book value per share grew to  75 44 at the end of 2019  up 9  from the end of 2018 As we reflect on our 2019 performance through the lens of relative performance against our peer group of large regional banks  we are particularly gratified by our growth in earnings per common share  our return on tangible common equity and the absolute level of our net interest margin  which remains at or near the top of the peers Donald J  MacLeod    Administrative Vice President  Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor RelationsCan we just back track a second for a minute  Darren  Going back to the other cost of operations  Darren misspoke and said there was a decline of  825 million  it is  25 million Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Don  Not sure what I was looking at when I read that  but thank you for the clarification  Okay  so let s turn to the outlook  Looking forward into 2020  our outlook is fairly consistent with what we shared on the call last January  as well as with the trends we ve been seeing over the past quarter While GDP growth may slow from the pace seen in 2019  we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen since the last recession ended  Unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers  financial positions are healthy  Consumer confidence remains relatively high  although commercial customers have remained cautious  as ongoing and unpredictable global events  including disagreements over tariffs  have led to sustained levels of uncertainty We were pleased to see progress toward the tailoring of capital and liquidity regulations for regional banks  based on systemic risk to the U S  economy  We are awaiting final approval for the capital regulations  including the stress capital buffer for banks in the Fed s category 4  like M T  It s still unclear whether those rules will be in place for the 2020 CCAR process  However  with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manners you expect  here are a few thoughts for the coming year As we share our outlook on net interest income and the net interest margin  we ll start with the caveat that when unfolds  will likely be impacted by actions taken by the Federal Reserve as to short term interest rates After a year volatility  including three rate cuts over the course of 2019  the markets have calmed somewhat  The markets currently are signaling an additional rate cut in 2020 toward the end of the year  The fourth quarter net interest margin of 3 64  is a good starting point to think about where we re headed for 2020  We expect a lower combination of cash at the Fed and investment securities  as we enter the first quarter  and for that lower level to persist over the course of the year  This reflects the decline in escrow  commercial and trust demand deposits from seasonal highs in the fourth quarter  as well as a further repositioning of our portfolio of liquid assets  as the Fed s tailoring rule for liquidity becomes effective  The result will be a beneficial impact on the reported margin compared with the fourth quarter  which could be as much as 10 basis points Loans outstanding grew 2 4  on a full year average basis in 2019  and were up a similar 2 8  on a year end basis  As has been the case for the past few years  this reflected a 9 1  decline in residential mortgage loans on a full year average basis  offset by 5 4  percent aggregate growth in other loan portfolios  Lending activity in the commercial bank in 2019  both commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate  was characterized by better originations and our reduced level of payoffs and pay downs  than was the case in 2018  We expect those trends to continue in 2020 As has been the case for the past several years  we will continue to allow the residential real estate portfolio to run off  as we reposition the balance sheet to higher returning assets  However  the rate of decline on both a percentage and absolute dollar basis will slow compared to prior years  as the portfolio of loans acquired with Hudson City  becomes a smaller percentage of the total Given these factors  our expectation for 2020 is that average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low single digit pace  in line with or perhaps a little better than what we saw in 2019  Taken in aggregate  our outlook for 2020 reflects a lower level of earning assets  but with a higher proportion of loans than in 2019  which improves our return profile  Combined with some improvement in the margin from what we reported in the fourth quarter and a flat rate scenario  we expect a low single digit decline in net interest income on a year over year basis We enter 2020 with a higher run rate in residential mortgage servicing revenues following the additions to our servicing and sub servicing portfolios in 2019  Thus  year over year growth is sort of baked in  The outlook for residential originations is less clear with long term rates above the low point seen this past summer The commercial mortgage banking business had a record year for both volumes and revenues in 2019  Matching or beating that will be difficult  but that s our goal for 2020  The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2019  with growth in the low single digit range  with the exception of trust revenues  which have been growing at a solid mid single digit pace The fourth quarter s operating expenses  excluding the reduction in the MSR valuation allowance  are a good indication of a starting run rate for modeling 2020  Last year s GAAP results included approximately  100 million of items we do not expect to recur in 2020  The writedown of our investment in the asset manager and the settlement of the ESOP litigation  That implies that total expenses on a GAAP basis should be down year over year The capabilities we added to our IT division over the course of 2019  should enable us to continue to reduce professional services in the coming year as well  Other than normal wage growth  we don t foresee the need to accelerate expenses beyond the current run rate We d remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits costs in the first quarter of 2020 which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation  as well as a handful of other items  Last year  that increase was approximately  60 million  Based on the proceeding  we expect to be able to produce neutral to slightly positive operating leverage for the year Our outlook for credit remains balanced  Just as we completed our sixth consecutive year of net charge off experience below 20 points    excuse me  below 20 basis points  at the risk of sounding like a broken record  I ll caution you again that this trend can t continue and that losses will eventually tick upward There continue to be some modest pressures on non performing and criticized loans  but there are no apparent weaknesses in any particular industries or geographies Our adoption of the new loan loss accounting standard  known as CECL  was effective January 1st  2020  Our expectation based on forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31st  2019  is that the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately  140 million or 13  to our reserves  With total commercial reserves being down slightly  reflecting shorter contractual maturities and residential mortgage and consumer reserves increasing substantially due to their long dated maturities For regulatory capital purposes  we have elected to phase in the CECL transitional amount over a three year period  Therefore  the effect of the adoption on the capital ratios will be recognized in a uniform manner  resulting in a reduction to the CET1 ratio by approximately 3 basis points over each of those three years CECL also impacts the accounting for loans previously acquired at a discount  that are on our balance sheet  Acquired impaired loans will transition from 90 days past due in accruing to their current performance status  whether accrual or non accrual  Approximately  170 million of the acquired impaired loans will transition to non accrual status  The income from these loans will only be recognized on an as cash is received basis consistent with originated non accrual loans  Lastly in the future  our loss provision will reflect expected net charge off activity plus CECL reserves for loan growth by category  plus or minus  changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast We don t see anything meaningful on the horizon that would lead us to believe that the tax rate for 2020 will be significantly different from what it was in 2019 in the area of 25   As to capital  we will continue to execute our 2019 capital plan through the end of this year s second quarter  Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged  with investments in our business at high returns being our first priority  while paying a dividend that s sustainable through economic cycles After that we seek  but don t read for acquisitions that make sense and add value to our shareholders  our customers and our communities  When those aren t forthcoming  we return capital to shareholders  We have little appetite for warehousing capital for an indeterminate timeframe until those opportunities present themselves Of course  as you are aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth  changes in interest rates  political events and other macroeconomic factors  which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future Now  let s open up the call to questions  before which Lori will briefly review the instructions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystHey thanks  Good morning guys  Hey Darren  just on the expense front  I m wondering if you can just clarify a little bit on the point that GAAP expenses  you expect to be down because they had that  100 million  And you mentioned that the core  you don t see it really changing from what the growth rate is  So the core  can you just help us understand without having to accelerate investments  what you see is the core underlying growth rate of expenses that you should expect Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So I guess if you look at the full year expenses on a GAAP basis  you ve got about  100 million of one times in the litigation  the additional litigation reserve  as well as the writedown on the asset manager  And then  when you look at that number  and you look at where we grow from there  it s 1  or less Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  And then  can you talk about the puts and takes just in that 1  or less  So you re making some investments that you ve talked about in the last couple  where are you getting the saves out of and that confidence that you can keep it  1  or less  relative to the growth that we ve seen in the last couple of years  Thanks Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  you know  when we look at the trajectory we ve been on  remember that a big portion of last year s growth in expenses was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we both acquired and took on in the form of sub servicings  We had to add expense to support that revenue  And then  the rest of what was happening was this transition of our IT capabilities from professional services  the salary and benefits  And we started to see those professional services come down in the fourth quarter  which we expected and we expect that trend to continue into 2020 And so as we go forward  the gains in efficiency that we will get or expenses from reducing professional services will offset salaries and benefits  as that cycle continues itself  So we think we re at a point  where we re self funding  and that s why we feel confident that the run rate that we re at now  we can basically run at that  ex normal increases that happened in salaries and benefits  as you go from year to year Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  Thanks Darren OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystGood morning  On that same line of questioning the    so your operating leverage comment that you expect positive operating leverage  that s on a GAAP basis  just to confirm  correct Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat is correct John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOkay  So and then looking at it from what you would just walk through in terms of core  that would imply modest negative on a core basis then Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOn a core basis  that would  Yeah John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOkay  And then  in terms of your ongoing IT and franchise investments  I know you had indicated last quarter that they are largely complete  Is that still how you re viewing it  Is there any change to the ongoing infrastructure investments that you re making Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  we are continuing on the transition that we ve talked about and that really is building up our internal IT capability  And we had the uptick in 2019  they got that process started  but from where we end the year  we are now in a place where we re seeing professional services come down  that offset the salaries and benefits costs that we re adding  as we re making those conversions  And the place that we re at now is  we think that those investments are kind of self funding  and so that with the expense base that we re at now  we can continue that transition without having to have meaningful growth As we get to the other benefit  obviously it s our expectation that we ll continue to use those internal team members to improve the expense run rate into 2021 and 2022  but obviously we ll give you more details on that when we get there  But for the purposes of 2020  we think we re at a place where we can operate basically at the level that we re at now with some modest growth from here John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOkay  got it  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good morning Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Erika Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI wanted to inquire a little bit more about the potential for the margin beyond the first quarter  Heard you loud and clear that balance sheet action is going to be quite accretive in the first quarter  If the curve stays or the current forecast stays static  how should we think about the net interest margin trajectory beyond the first quarter  And also  as we think of earning assets growth  should we expect earning asset growth to be flat relative to the actions that you re taking  or should we expect some balance sheet shrinkage Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So in the first quarter  we expect the net interest margin to increase  at least what the printed margin is  because of the change that you ll see in cash and investment securities and you can kind of see that in the period  And those lower levels  we expect to persist throughout the year  So when you get to the first quarter of margin and assuming as you pointed out  a fairly stable rate environment  we would expect that margin that we end the first quarter with  to be fairly consistent throughout the year  assuming that that forward curve in fact occurs  Maybe plus or minus a couple of basis points along the way  but relatively stable We anticipate that the average earning assets will start the year lower  and then come up as the year goes on  as we see the loan growth that we talked about in the forecast that overall  it s kind of low single digits and along the lines of what we saw in in 2019  as we go through 2020 Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  And my follow up question and I apologize  you re probably going to get a thousand expense questions  but we just want to make sure we re getting it right  So as we think about the run rate for 2020  if we take  100 million out of GAAP  that s  3 368 billion and you re saying growth of 1  or less  that includes any nominal increase in salaries and benefits  So in total core should go up 1  or less from that  3 368 billion base Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s right  Yeah Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystPerfect  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystGood morning Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Peter Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystI was just curious on the capital  you ended the year at 9 72   I m just wondering where you think it s going to end in 2020  And then secondly  how much is left in your stock buyback authorization Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo where we will end 2020 is a little bit tough to predict  just depending on what happens with the tailoring rules and SCB  as we go into CCAR this year  which will have an impact obviously on on where we might bring the capital ratios to  And then the other thing that we re paying attention to  is just the pace of loan growth  and in particular  risk weighted assets  But if you look at where we ve been over the course of the last actually kind of five or six quarters  it has been coming down around 9 to 10 basis points a quarter  and we continue a measured movement down toward the low end of the peer group  And over the course of the last year  I believe we ve gone from being slightly above our peer median in terms of our CET1 ratio  to slightly below the median  and will continue a measured and thoughtful move down toward the range that we ve discussed for some time now  obviously paying attention to what s going on in the macro environment and what s happening with loan growth And if you look at what s left outstanding in the capital plan that we discussed or disclosed in July  it s around  750 million   800 million Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystOkay  And just given    you re doing some of the work on remixing the balance sheet to help the margin  I m just wondering  any updated thoughts on the hedging strategy Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNothing that is different from what we ve talked about in the past  You know  if you look at where we ve been  our notional amount has grown  but what s actually outstanding has been relatively consistent  And in terms of notional dollars  its  14 billion   15 billion of cash flow hedges plus another  4 billion or  5 billion of debt  And what we ve been doing is just extending some of those out into the future years to have that same amount of protection in place for a little bit longer Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystOkay  Thanks Darren OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Piper Sandler Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Frank Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystJust on    to try to ask the capital question another way  just curious    and I know you ve got the CCAR cycle coming up  But given how little impact CECL has to the regulatory capital levels here  just curious  your thoughts on capital return overall for the back half of the year  Is it sort of the expectation or I don t know the wish list that you would continue to return 100  plus capital of earnings Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess we don t peg it as a payout ratio number that we re looking to achieve  but more we re projecting forward what we think our loan growth will be and what our risk weighted asset growth will be  and looking at what capital we think we need to fund or to support that loan growth and making sure that we re running an organization that is very safe and sound  We continue to believe that we can move the current ratio down  and we ll continue to do it at the pace that we ve been on for the last several quarters  being consistent in terms of what that decline is  Any quarter  you might see some difference between what the change is in the ratio  based on primarily asset growth in the quarter  But when you look over the long term  over the last few quarters  we ve been on a pretty steady pace I think one of the things that we re also going to be watching as we go through  the first part at least of 2020 is just how the new CECL methodology impacts earnings on any given quarter  which will be impacted by the mix of loan growth in that quarter  just making sure that we re thoughtful with those capital returns  But as you point out  given where we are  we were pleased that the impact on our capital ratios from CECL was fairly nominal  And so  we can continue on the trajectory that we ve been on Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just sort of a ticky tack question on the provision  given    if the environment  if the credit environment stays as is for 2020 let s hope  given the Day 1 CECL adjustment  Is it    and I know a lot more goes into it than this  but is it sort of fair for just modeling to assume provisioning goes up by sort of that 13  number  all else equal Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess I haven t done that math  The way I tend to think about it is  you ve got charge offs that will happen and then if you look at net growth in loans and look at the new allowance rate and multiply those two  that probably gets you the excess provision  And of course  if you look in any quarter  the mix of loans that drive that shift in portfolio can move that around  But if you look over the course of a full year  we wouldn t anticipate any meaningful mix shift in terms of where the growth is coming from  on a percentage basis  which would give you that allowance percentage as a reasonable starting point  As I said  it could move around a little bit within that quarter  but over the course of the year  I would expect it to be within a few basis points of that number Frank Schiraldi    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  All right  great  Thanks Darren Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure thing OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  Darren  How s everything Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood  how are you  Steven Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystGood  I ll just start  so regarding the anticipated decline in liquidity in 1Q  20  if we look at 1Q  19 quarter over quarter  you re down  1 4 billion  Do you think you re going to have a similar decline in 1Q  20  or is it much larger than that  just given how much more deposit growth you ve had recently Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s probably going to be larger than that  given the trust demand business was probably the primary driver  If you look back in prior years plus a little bit of the commercial  Commercial balances tend to move up in the fourth quarter  and then these companies  as they prepare to make their distributions to their owners  that s why you see them come down in the first quarter and so  that s pretty typical  I think businesses are still having a little bit more of their cash sitting in operating accounts versus in interest bearing  And then the other thing that s happened this year for us  obviously as we ve increased the escrow balances  and there is some seasonality to those So when you put all those factors together  you will probably get a bigger decrease there  and then we ll be looking at the securities portfolio in aggregate  and that will probably come down a little bit too  as we react to the new changes in the LCR Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  Got you  And then on the trust income  which came in much stronger than the original guidance call for  it didn t sound like market appreciation was a big factor  Do you have more color on why that was so strong this year Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo there is a couple of things that happened there  We have within there  a business that is    holds retirement assets  And when you add to    when you add clients to that  they can come in big chunks and we had one big retirement fund that came in during the course of the year  that s kind of hard to predict  and that helped with some of the trust fees as well as in our    what we call our institutional client services business  There seemed to be a little bit more activity in that business as the back half of the year went on  which helped with the trust fees  and obviously when I talked about that retirement business  the assets that came on also grew because of the markets  And so there was some help from the markets to be sure  but the business continues to add team members and add clients and has had a strong year Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Maybe just one final one on expenses  I appreciate the color on the 1  expense growth in 2020  given the reinvest in some of the cost saves  But what is expense growth at M T running at these days  without cost saves  What s the natural organic growth rate of expenses  Thanks Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou know  when I think about our natural organic growth rate and you look at us through time and you hold to the side  some of the things that have happened with various litigation expenses or mortgage servicing rights or the write off that we had  we are kind of a low single digit grower and that s mainly driven by compensation costs year over year  Last year was just kind of outside  because of the mortgage  the growth in the mortgage servicing business and then step one in our transformation for technology  But generally  when you look at how we run the bank  we pay a lot of attention to our growth rates and expenses because we know we re in a tough industry and so we re always looking for ways to manage those and keep them in aggregate  growing at low single digits  and making investments and finding offsets to cover the costs to keep it at that pace  And that philosophy hasn t changed Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  thanks for all the color Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure thing OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGood morning  Darren Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHow are you  Gerard Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGood  Can you give us some color on that residential mortgage portfolio  You indicated it was down  I think the run off that is  down about 9   You expect it to be less this year  It looks like your resi mortgages at the end of the year are just over  16 billion or 18  of total loans  where do you see that eventually bottoming out  When does it run off from the deal that you ve done  and we have a stabilized number from that portfolio Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  It s  it s a good question  Gerard  as we watch the portfolio of residential mortgage loans  when you look underneath there  it s down about half Legacy Hudson City mortgages and half legacy M T  plus new originations  We re allowing that Hudson City portfolio to run down and will continue to  just because of the return profile of the mortgage business  and the rate of growth or the rate of decline in aggregate in the mortgage portfolio is slowing  just because the Hudson City mortgages are becoming a smaller percentage  But we ll continue to run those down  We ll probably    you ll see a little bit more growth in the legacy business  especially some of that come from the servicing business  But you re not going to see it hit a steady state likely in 2020  The only thing that    as we work through the new liquidity rules after the tailoring  that we re contemplating is what role the mortgage portfolio plays in overall funding  since the mortgages are pledgeable with the federal home loan bank for funding on a short term basis So there is a number of considerations that go into where that portfolio ultimately ends  but we probably continue seeing it move down  but in a smaller dollar amount over the course of 2020 Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystVery good  And then I know the rules are not set yet on the SCB  but from what you understand today and assuming they don t vary dramatically from what we all understand  do you expect any kind of meaningful impact  come CCAR  because of    if they incorporate the SCB in CCAR this year Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess if they incorporate it  it would be helpful because the threshold that you have to meet would be lower  and there would be some opportunity there  There has also been talk of not having to pre fund the dividend  and not having an assumption of asset growth under stress  which all of those things are positive  The offset to that is  what our loan growth assumptions look like  and in particular what the mix is in terms of risk weighted assets that will be an offset  But you know it s obviously    remains to be seen how this will be implemented by the Fed  given that there is unlikely to be MPR before  and it will all be handled through the rules and the assumptions that are provided to us Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystHey guys  good morning  I guess we have 10 more minutes  A couple of questions  one just a follow up on CECL  By my calculations  your ACL ratio goes roughly from about 115 to about 130 basis points  As I think about the changes in your mix in the loss content on your net loan growth  because there is obviously a lot going on there with resi coming down  consumer going up  How do I think about the loss content  the lifetime losses on your growth relative to your back book  Is the net growth in loans    those with loss like them  loss of above 130 basis points  I know it doesn t change in any given quarter all that much  but should we think that ACL ratio naturally gravitate upwards over time  as your balance sheet remixes Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess if you re time horizon is 10 years and we don t do anything to change the growth rates of the various portfolio  that s probably true  I think if you look in the short term    short term in this case would be like over the next 12 and 24 months  you probably don t see much change in that  Just because the start point on some of those other portfolios  meaning the the other consumer  is relatively small as a percentage compared to the resi mortgage  the commercial real estate and the C I  And that assumes that  we don t do anything to look at those portfolios and look for alternatives  like you re seeing some of the other organizations  thinking about auto securitizations  for instance  We haven t done a lot of those in a while  I m not suggesting that we are going to do one  But that would have an impact on obviously the portfolio and the allowance in there  because if you did a securitization  that allowance would come off So there are a number of moving factors  but I guess the short answer to your question is  your math is consistent with ours and I think it would take a couple of    at least a couple of years of running at the rate that we re at  with no change to see that number go up Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystOkay  No  that s helpful  All right  let me just change gears a little bit  At a conference in early November  I think it was a BAAB conference  you highlighted some of your key metrics versus their long term averages  and your NIM  I think you were at    substantially higher than what    the premium of your NIM  the delta between your NIM and the peer median was substantially higher today than it has been historically  I think it was like 50 basis points or something like that  and historically it s 20 or something in that neighborhood  It seems that like from your outlook  you think that really elevated delta with your peer group should remain  not too far from where it is today  and I think you were kind of hinting at the conference that maybe that NIM    that excess NIM versus your peers will gravitate down over time  Am I reading that right  I mean  what s changed since November and    other than obviously the rate outlook  But am I reading that right  that you think you will be able to maintain a premium NIM that is historically high Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess I ll break up part of  Phonetic  your statement into two pieces  Do we think we ll be able to maintain a premium NIM  Yes  that s kind of always been the nature of our portfolio  largely because of our funding mix  but also because of the pricing on our loan book  It has been a little higher than what we would normally expect  and especially in this kind of time period  and you can see that the gap between us and the next closest peer in the median has come down a little bit  But really when you look over the last couple of quarters it has been fairly consistent  We would need to see rates come down a little bit further to see that delta compressed  But we expect over time  that we try to run the bank to have slightly lower cost of deposits and a slightly higher yield on our loans and manage our expenses a little bit better and credit  and it s not our objective to be outsized performance in any one of those categories  but a little bit better in each one and over long periods of time  that adds up to consistent returns  which is really what our objective is  And some of them may move a little bit in any one time period  be that a quarter or a year  But over long periods of time  that s kind of how we try to run the bank to achieve the returns that we do So we expect that the margin dependent    obviously given the earlier comments in a stable rate environment  we expect the margin to be relatively stable this year  Given that  we would expect to maintain our premium over the    our GAAP  our positive GAAP compared to the next closest in the median  But any movement down and you probably see a little bit of that on the road  but we don t see ending up back at the median Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystRight  So as long as the rate environment remains stable  that historically high delta is no reason why they shouldn t progress Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  From what we can see  we believe that that will persist Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystOkay  All right  That s really helpful  Thank you Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure Donald J  MacLeod    Administrative Vice President  Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor RelationsWith your comment about 10 minutes  I thought you are going to use all 10 OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe  Bruyette Woods Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGo Bills Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette Woods    AnalystGood morning  Darren and Don  We are set up for a good next year  right Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe sure hope so  We re not planning a parade yet  but we re certainly hopeful Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette Woods    AnalystI mean  hope springs eternal in Buffalo every year  right  So let s hope so  But I think I do have five minutes left in the morning  I think that s what Saul was referring to before we say good afternoon  But just had two really quick follow ups  We have had all kinds of questions today and both of these topics  So just wanted to clarify a little bit on the margin guidance  the 10 basis points  Darren  was that all liquidity driven 10 basis points  or I think you guys    whether it was late December  early January  think you redeemed some debt  So that kind of factored into that sort of 10 basis point NIM improvement into the early part of 2020 Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt is  It s impact is in the grand scheme of things relatively small on the NIM impact  The main drivers are the the cash and securities Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette Woods    AnalystGot it  Got it  Makes sense and then again on expenses  this is a 2021 question  but like you mentioned here  the core expense run rate  call it less than 1  inflation in 2020 on a core basis  It feels like with all of those tech expenses kind of consolidated and coming out like you said in recycling  do you think 2021 is one of those  where expenses are flat or is it just maybe normal M T expense inflation out into 2021 Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell you re    I m just recovering from doing the plan for 2020  let alone 2021  so haven t quite looked that far ahead yet  But I guess I ll remind you of who we are and how we run the bank and that is to be very careful with our expense growth  to make sure that we see a path  if we make those investments to bring it back down or that there s offsetting revenue  like we did with the mortgage business this year The low single digit increase  as I mentioned before  is primarily the result of salary inflation  Who knows where wage inflation ends up through 2020  and if unemployment rate stay this low  who knows where we ll end up  but we continue to believe that in the banking business  efficiency matters and being cost effective matters  So we pay a lot of attention to that  and of course  if we can drive that growth down to something less than 1  or even negative  we will look to do that  But too early for me to make comments really about where that will be in 2021 Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette Woods    AnalystThat s fair  I thought I d ask anyway so  but appreciate your time  Thanks Darren J  King    Executive Vice President and

115442,336957,MTB,Take 5  Battle in Baltimore highlights Week 7,news,"Sunday brings the second matchup in three weeks featuring the league s best scoring offense and best scoring defense  this time when the New Orleans Saints  36 points per game  visit the Baltimore Ravens  12 8 allowed per game   This one should look entirely different than the Jaguars Chiefs clash of Week 5  mostly because the Ravens  defense is built on disguises and blitzes  unlike the straightforward Jacksonville defense  The multiplicity will put a heavy burden on New Orleans up front  1  Saints  protection must be sharp physically and mentally Anchored by tackles Terron Armstead and Ryan Ramczyk  the Saints  line is excellent in protection  Always uber athletic  Armstead has blossomed into a technician and has been nearly flawless on Drew Brees  blind side this year  Baltimore s Terrell Suggs remains a terror despite turning 36 last week  but he won t have it easy Sunday  Ramczyk has continued the steady play he showed as a rookie  and he ll draw a variety of challenges in Baltimore  Solid third year man Matt Judon  speedy pass rush specialist Tim Williams and the 274 pound Za Darius Smith  who plays both inside and outside and has already matched his career high with 5 5 sacks  three last week  New Orleans is stout inside  too  where former tackle Andrus Peat has become a rock at left guard  and center Max Unger   8 million cap hit  and right guard Larry Warford   9 million  are well worth their hefty contracts  That group will be tested mentally this week against an expansive collection of amoeba fronts  The Ravens often bring only four or five rushers  but good luck trying to figure out who s coming  They routinely line up players in both A gaps  on either side of the center   threaten blitz off either edge or employ both tactics at once  Chaos ensues at the snap  as four or five  and sometimes six or seven  men rush  and two or three drop out  Veteran safeties Tony Jefferson and Eric Weddle might rotate 20 yards as one blitzes and the other drops deep  while Suggs  Judon or Smith will buzz under crossers to take away quick throws  The coverage usually settles into a three deep zone featuring matchup principles and two or three underneath defenders  but the Ravens mix in plenty of man coverage as well  That frees up linebackers and safeties to blitz when the running back or tight end to whom they are assigned stays in to block  called a green dog blitz   which led to several of the 11 sacks on Marcus Mariota last week  But Brees is no Mariota  who looked lost trying to decipher the Ravens  coverages and routinely held the ball too long  essentially sacking himself on several plays  Brees  an 18th year veteran  has great protection  but more important  he diagnoses and delivers on time and decisively  often aided by an offense that manufactures short completions  Brees will sniff out some of Baltimore s disguises and make them pay  Saints coach Sean Payton  a master of the screen game  will call several to slow down the rush  But the Ravens will get home some  too  especially with a rowdy home crowd making communication difficult  Brees has historically been a different player outdoors  103 6 QB rating in domes compared to 90 8 outside   and the forecast at M T Bank  NYSE MTB  Stadium calls for some wind  That should make for one of the more intriguing and evenly matched offense defense battles we ll see this year  2  Bears must fix fundamentals  and fast The consensus best defense in football through five weeks collapsed on Sunday against Brock Osweiler  of all people  because its players suddenly forgot how to tackle  The Dolphins quarterback went just 7 of 16 with two interceptions on throws at least 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage  but he finished with 380 yards and three touchdowns because his receivers generated 274     yards after the catch  Miami coach Adam Gase deserves credit for crafty underneath designs  but most of the damage came from missed tackles  Chicago safeties Adrian Amos and Eddie Jackson each whiffed on Albert Wilson s 43 yard touchdown  and then again on his 75 yarder  Linebacker Danny Trevathan could have kept the latter to a 4 yard gain  but he inexplicably let Wilson escape from a trio of Bears before the two safeties missed  Chicago must correct those mistakes immediately  because defending the Patriots  offense is untenable with tackling breakdowns  New England coordinator Josh McDaniels    who hired Gase in Denver    engineers the NFL s shrewdest horizontal passing game  which became all the more lethal with Julian Edelman s return in Week 5  Against zone heavy schemes like Bears coordinator Vic Fangio s  the Patriots attack underneath pockets over and over  putting the burden on linebackers and safeties to close quickly and tackle shifty wide receivers  Though not major pieces of the offense  Josh Gordon and Cordarrelle Patterson are even more dangerous in space than Edelman  and James White is also extremely elusive  Even if Khalil Mack  ankle  is healthy  the Bears  pass rush could have trouble getting home before Tom Brady delivers  If Chicago can t tackle soundly  it ll be an awfully long day on defense  3  Geno Atkins is licking his chops Through six weeks  we ve seen Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes do almost everything  and do it extremely well  But he hasn t yet had to deal with repeated pressure  a credit to both Andy Reid s scheme and a front five that has been excellent in protection  But that line is taking hits  with right guard Laurent Duvernay Tardif  fractured fibula  on injured reserve and center Mitch Morse  concussion  likely to miss at least one game  The timing isn t ideal with Atkins coming to town this week  The Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle has a new contract that pays him more annually than any other non QB over age 30 in NFL history  and Atkins has earned every penny so far  The six time Pro Bowler still has a lethal combination of lateral wiggle and forklift power  already producing six sacks and 12 QB hits  tied for second in NFL   Traditionally a 3 technique tackle  he usually lines up on a guard s outside shoulder  but he also will align directly over the center in some third down packages  a threatening look because centers are rarely isolated against top rushers in protection  Atkins happily beats single blocks  but he also reaches QBs through doubles on occasion and leading tackle end stunts  plowing between the guard and tackle  Jordan Devey moved to center in Morse s absence last week  with Andrew Wylie stepping in at right guard  Even if recently re signed Jeff Allen    released after struggling for two years in Houston    takes over at right guard  expect to see Atkins across from both spots often  Left guard Cameron Erving has had hiccups as well  so Atkins should have plenty of chances to collapse pockets in Mahomes  face  4  Get right game for Jaguars  pass rush Eerily quiet in losses to the Chiefs and Cowboys the past two weeks  the famed  Sacksonville  front four is due for a bounce back performance  As it happens  they face the league s most exploitable offensive line this week  Already thin entering the year  the Houston Texans lost Seantrel Henderson in Week 1  thrusting rookie third rounder Martinas Rankin into the lineup opposite raw 2017 fourth rounder Julien Davenport  Both players have been benched for stretches in favor of Kendall Lamm  a fourth year undrafted free agent  The results have been about what you d expect  25 sacks  one shy of the NFL s highest total  and 65 QB hits allowed  the latter a whopping 18 more than any other team  With his front five whiffing blocks and getting bulled into him with frightening regularity  Deshaun Watson has exacerbated matters by moving preemptively and erratically  But his escapability isn t limiting pressure    it s expanding the burden up front because linemen aren t taught to protect for a moving target  Not only is Watson moving into pressure  but he s holding the ball too long while trying to create  leading to more hits and sacks  Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell  four sacks  seven QB hits  should have a field day  Offensive tackles rarely face edge rushers with his raw power  and Davenport lacks the anchor to handle it  Yannick Ngakoue  four sacks  nine QB hits  also should give Lamm repeated trouble with his blend of burst and bendability  For whatever reason  Texans coach Bill O Brien has dialed back the use of play action in Watson s second season  but that would be a helpful tactic to feature again this week  It won t matter  however  if Houston gets behind early and has to throw  5  Pressure squarely on Titans  linebackers With an offense that possesses little identity and a quarterback who isn t seeing the field clearly  Tennessee needs defense to win right now  and the unit has mostly impressed  One weak spot  however  has been inside linebacker  where first round rookie Rashaan Evans has been pulled in some passing situations in favor of nominal special teamer Daren Bates  The group should be better this week with the return of Wesley Woodyard  shoulder   who pairs with second year man Jayon Brown to form a speedy duo  The two will be stressed often in London against the Los Angeles Chargers  outstanding running back tandem of Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler  who rank eighth and second  respectively  in yards per carry among qualified rushers  The Chargers killed the Browns with the perimeter run game last week  getting the edge on tosses and sweeps while often running the same plays  Gordon s power and ability to set up blocks has been devastating  and the shifty Ekeler continues to leave defenders grasping at air in the open field  They might be even more dangerous as receivers  especially because Philip Rivers has always been excellent at hitting his check down early to maximize yards after catch  Gordon ranks fourth and Ekeler 12th in receiving yards by running backs this season  and Ekeler s 14 8 yard average is tops among backs with more than 10 catches  
Woodyard and Brown will be central to the Titans  hopes of slowing an offense that ranks fifth in scoring  29 2 points per game  and third in yards per play  6 8     David DeChant  Field Level Media",2018-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/take-5-battle-in-baltimore-highlights-week-7-1650817,1650817

115508,337023,MTB,Earnings Preview  M T Bank Corporation  MTB  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when M T Bank Corporation  NYSE MTB  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 52 billion  down 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M T Bank Corporation 
For M T Bank Corporation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that M T Bank Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that M T Bank Corporation would post earnings of  3 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 47  delivering a surprise of  3 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
M T Bank Corporation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-mt-bank-corporation-mtb-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200499366,200499366

115519,337034,MTB,Wilmington Trust indictment linked to crisis may be tainted  filing,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal indictment against Wilmington Trust Corp and four former executives for allegedly hiding soured loans may need to be dismissed if it was obtained through false grand jury testimony  lawyers for the defendants said on Tuesday 
If true  the lawyers  allegations  made in a court filing ahead of a scheduled Oct  10 trial  could undermine the government s first indictment against a recipient of federal bailout money during the 2008 2009 financial crisis 
 The defendants  motion is without merit and the government will be filing a response in due course   David Weiss  the acting U S  attorney in Delaware  said in an email 
M T Bank Corp  N MTB   the Buffalo  New York based bank that bought Wilmington in May 2011  is not accused of wrongdoing 
Prosecutors accused the defendants of having hidden Wilmington s deteriorating finances from October 2009 to November 2010 by underreporting its matured past due loans  through what the government called a  waiver  practice 
The four former executives who are defendants are former president Robert Harra  chief financial officer David Gibson  controller Kevyn Rakowski and chief credit officer William North 
They have called Wilmington s loan reporting transparent  including to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 
According to Tuesday s filing  the government knew it was  based on a newly disclosed report from a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent about an interview with David Fomunyam  a senior Fed banking examiner 
The defendants said the report showed that Fomunyam told the government in 2013  two years before the original indictment  that he had known contemporaneously that Wilmington   never reported their matured loans   putting the lie to the accusation that Wilmington Trust deceived the Federal Reserve  
According to the defendants  the government nonetheless presented grand jury testimony that neither Fomunyam nor a colleague was aware of the loan waivers  and withheld its  highly exculpatory  information for two years 
 It appears that the government ran afoul of a basic prohibition   that the government may not secure an indictment based on the knowing presentation of false testimony to the grand jury   according to the defendants 
They are seeking permission to gather evidence concerning whether prosecutors knowingly presented false grand jury testimony  and a hearing to consider possible dismissals 
A Philly Fed spokeswoman declined to comment  as did an M T spokesman 
Wilmington had received  330 million of bailout money  But mounting construction loan and commercial mortgage losses led to its sale to M T at a 46 percent discount  ending more than a century in business

115602,337117,MTB,Fee Income To Support U S  Bancorp  USB  Q3 Earnings,opinion,U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 16  before the opening bell  The bank s revenues and earnings are likely to display year over year growth Given the rise in digitization  card operations and demand for online services are likely to have increased in the third quarter  Thus  the company s credit and debit card  along with merchant processing revenues  accounting for around 30  of total fee income   are expected to grow Further  improvement in mortgage banking performance and strong equity markets are expected to have offset the slowdown in lending activities  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  5 8 billion indicates a rise of 2 3  from the year ago reported figure Before we look at other factors that might have impacted third quarter earnings  let s take a look at how the company performed in the past quarters Notably  U S  Bancorp boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 1 18   U S  Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   Other Factors At PlaySoft Net Interest Income Growth  A dismal lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate   during the third quarter is expected to have had an adverse impact on net interest income  NII   while decent consumer loan growth might have been an offsetting factor Further  the Fed s accommodative policy stance with decline in interest rates  two rate cuts   in July and September   flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas are likely to have hurt its net interest margin However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  433 1 billion for the third quarter indicates improvement of 4 3  year over year Management expects net interest income to reflect increase in low single digits on a year over year basis The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 31 billion for NII projects 1 8  rise Consumer Revenue Growth  With the improving economy  deposits are likely to have increased  leading to higher revenues from service charge on deposits  Per the consensus estimate  deposit service charges are likely to have been up 18 7  year over year Further  pickup in refinancing activities on the back of lower mortgage rates during the quarter is likely to have offered support  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is  206 billion  up 18 4  Payment Services Revenues to Witness Strong Growth  With the increasing demand for online payment of products and services  fees charged to merchants for the electronic processing of transactions are expected to have flared up  The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects 5 4  improvement in merchant processing services revenues Overall Non Interest Revenues to Rise  Inflows from the investment management business might have been recorded on market gains in the quarter  In addition  trust income is likely to reflect improvement on rebound in equity markets  The consensus estimate for trust and investment management fees indicates a jump of 2 7  Given expectations of rise in most components  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest revenues is pegged at  2 51 billion  up 4 2  In addition  management projects fee revenues to have been up in the mid single digits year over year Expenses Might Trend Higher  While the absence of considerable legal expenses is encouraging  increased investments in technology to improve digital

115603,337118,MTB,4 Major Bank Stocks Poised To Outshine Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,With Q3 earnings season almost here  investors are eagerly waiting for the results of the mega banks  which remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons After decent first half results  major banks  performance is expected to be dismal this time  A dismal lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate   during the third quarter is expected to have had an adverse impact on net interest income  NII   while decent consumer loan growth might have been an offsetting factor Further  the Federal Reserve s accommodative monetary policy stance with decline in interest rates  two rate cuts   in July and September   flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas are likely to have hurt banks  net interest margins  one of the key metrics for gauging banks  profitability  in the to be reported quarter Dismal capital markets performance is also a matter of concern  During the third quarter  several lingering concerns  including uncertainty related to the U S  China trade war and Brexit  and expectations of global economic slowdown persisted  The Fed s accommodative monetary policy stance and many geopolitical matters led to ambiguity too  All these factors weighed on investors  minds  resulting in lower client activity  Thus  overall trading revenues are likely to have been muted in the to be reported quarter Overall  investment banking activities were subdued in the third quarter due to seasonality among others  Moreover  marginal increase in consumer spending and subdued business investments amid trade tensions hit the M A and IPO activities  Thus  growth in advisory fees is projected to have been hampered Despite a decent equity market performance  equity issuance is likely to have been weak  However  lower rates might have aided debt issuances to some extent in the third quarter  Hence  equity underwriting fees and debt origination fees are anticipated to have been adversely impacted In a reversal in trend  mortgage banking business is expected to have provided some support to banks  fee income  While concerns like muted home equity loan growth  heightening competition and fall in home buying appetite continue to hurt mortgage banking fees  lower mortgage rates  which drove the refinancing activities  are expected to have partially offset these woes Expense reduction  which has helped banks remain profitable  is unlikely to have been a big support  as these companies have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses  While the absence of considerable legal expenses over the last few quarters is encouraging  increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings as well as starve off competition from fintech firms might have escalated costs moderately In the S P 500 universe  the Zacks  sector s total earnings  of which major banks account for nearly 45   are projected to increase 1 2  year over year in the quarter to be reported  This comes in lower than 4 3  growth recorded in the last reported quarter  For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others  please read our  article  Selecting the WinnersThis is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist  One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the

115645,337160,MTB,Top Analyst Reports For Verizon  McDonald s   Lockheed Martin ,opinion,"Monday  July 1  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  VZ   McDonald s  MCD  and Lockheed Martin  LMT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have gained  13 3  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  8 7  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that Verizon is well positioned to benefit from the impending 5G boom  driven by healthy traction in the wireless business  
The telecom giant is seeking first mover advantage in the 5G race with the launch of commercial 5G smartphones  in collaboration with Samsung  KS 005930   Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising will likely drive future growth  Furthermore  the company has upped the ante against its rivals by launching 5G Ultra Wideband network in Chicago  Minneapolis  and in select locations of Denver and Providence  
However  it continues to struggle in a competitive U S  wireless market  The company s wireline division is struggling with losses in access lines due to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers  which weighs on its margins 
 You can   
Shares of McDonald s have gained  10 2  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry  which has increased  8 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that its various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comparable sales bode well  
Furthermore  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 15 quarters  The company s increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance  These apart  efforts to drive growth in international markets are encouraging  However  high labor costs and currency headwinds remain concerns  
Additionally  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might reduce capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  McDonald s margins have been under pressure 
 You can   
Lockheed Martin s shares have gained  21 5  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry which has gained  8 4  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that Lockheed Martin  being the largest defense contractor in the world  enjoys strong demand for its high end military equipment in domestic and international markets  
As a result  solid order growth has been a key catalyst for the company  F 35 continues to be a major revenue contributor  Of late  the company is witnessing increased demand for its THAAD missiles from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  
However  the company s higher debt to equity ratio shows that the stock is highly leveraged when compared to its industry  and thus bears higher chance of insolvency  Lockheed Martin also faces intense global competition for its broad portfolio of products and services  Higher cost expenditure related to the F 35 program may also hurt growth trajectory

115655,337170,MTB,6 Major Banks Set To Trump Q2 Earnings Amid Tough Backdrop,opinion,The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keeping a close watch on the performance of major banks After decent first quarter results  major banks  performance is expected to be dismal this time  The primary reason is the disappointing lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and real estate   which persisted during the second quarter  This is expected to have an adverse impact on banks  net interest income Further  the Federal Reserve s accommodative policy stance  flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas will likely hurt net interest margin  one of the key metrics for gauging banks  profitability  in the to be reported quarter Dismal capital markets performance is also a matter of concern  During the second quarter  several concerns  including some lingering from the prior quarters  like uncertainty related to Brexit and U S  China trade war  and expectations of global economic slowdown persisted  The central bank s policy accommodation stance also led to ambiguity  All these factors weighed on investors  mind and resulted in lower volatility  Thus  this will likely lead to decline in trading revenues The above mentioned concerns also led to lower global M A deal value and volume during the second quarter  Thus  growth in advisory fees is projected to be hampered  Nonetheless  underwriting business is anticipated to provide some support driven by rise in equity issuances  while debt issuances remained soft In a reversal in trend  mortgage banking performance is projected to improve on the back of lower mortgage rates  which drove the refinancing activities during the quarter  Seasonality aided mortgage banking revenues too  Additionally  wealth management operation will offer some support  given the decent equity markets performance Credit quality is also likely to remain strong  backed by conservative underwriting standards and improving economy  while delinquency rates related to consumer loans will likely rise Expense reduction  which has had helped banks remain profitable in the past  is unlikely to be a big support this earnings season  Increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings as well as starve off competition from fintech firms  and efforts to expand to new geographical regions are expected to result in a moderate rise in costs  But overall non operating expenses are likely to be manageable In the S P 500 universe  the Zacks  sector s total earnings  of which major banks account for nearly 45   are projected to increase 2 7  year over year in the quarter to be reported  This is in line with the growth recorded in the prior quarter  For

support  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is  198 billion  up 3 7  Payment Services Revenues to Witness Strong Growth  Per the  s data  demand for credit card loans likely

the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest revenues is pegged at  2 44 billion  up 1 1  Further  management expects fee revenues to increase in the low single digits year over year  including the negative impact of the sale of the ATM business Expenses Might Trend Higher  Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonal rise in employee compensation and benefits

115709,337224,MTB,Earnings Season And Paris Blockchain Week Kicks Off,opinion,"As the central banks continue to lead from behind  it seems the number one thing driving the markets at the moment is corporate profits  Welcome to earnings season 
Investors got a good taste on Friday as JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  managed to surpass investor expectations  Today  we continue to watch the financial sector as Citigroup Inc  NYSE C   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   and M T Bank  NYSE MTB  report before the opening bell 
Traditional Markets
At one point Chinese stocks were up by 3  today  but it seems that by now the gains have been almost completely erased 
 
Two reasons have been named for the sharp increase  The first is a delayed reaction to some positive trade balance figures on Friday  As the numbers were published in what is technically the weekend in China  it would make sense for the reaction to come this morning  Also  the numbers were really good 
The final figure was published at 221 billion CNH  as economists were forecasting just 2 billion CNH 

The second reason is    

There doesn t seem to be any immediate reason for the gains to have been erased  
Trump Against the Fed
Over the weekend  the US President continued his attack against the US Federal Reserve with a tweet that was more than slightly shocking   

What s unclear to me  aside from what calculation was used to arrive at these numbers  is what exactly the President hopes to gain from this offensive 
It would seem that he s trying to get the Fed to step on the gas a bit more  but as we discussed in Friday s update  the pedal is already at the floor  Some have suggested that Trump is simply trying to blame the Fed for lackluster economic performance  but if that s the case  this is even more perplexing as the economy has been doing fantastic 
Blockchain in Paris
Price action has been encouraging over the weekend and all of the top cap cryptos are up over the last 24 hours 

One thing we ll be watching closely is Paris Blockchain Week  which has just been kicked off with a bang by Bruno Le Maire  France s minister of economics and finance 
Monsieur Le Maire is tweet storming as I write  this last one looks really encouraging

115711,337226,MTB,M T Bank  MTB  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
M T Bank in Focus
Based in Buffalo  M T Bank  MTB  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 13 67   Currently paying a dividend of  1 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 46   In comparison  the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield is 2 86   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 is up 12 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  M T Bank has increased its dividend 2 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 95   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  M T Bank s current payout ratio is 29   meaning it paid out 29  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  MTB expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  14 61 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 13 61  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MTB is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mt-bank-mtb-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200421650,200421650

115740,337255,MTB,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love M T Bank  MTB ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
M T Bank  MTB  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this bank holding company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for M T Bank is 11   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 13 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for M T Bank is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 18  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for M T Bank have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made M T Bank a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions M T Bank well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-mt-bank-mtb-200401130,200401130

115747,337262,MTB,M T Bank  MTB  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects M T Bank  MTB  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 15  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M T Bank 
For M T Bank  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that M T Bank will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that M T Bank would post earnings of  3 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 79  delivering a surprise of  7 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
M T Bank appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mt-bank-mtb-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200404787,200404787
115748,337263,MTB,This Is Why M T Bank  MTB  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
M T Bank in Focus

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MTB is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-mt-bank-mtb-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200405889,200405889

Factors to Drive Q1 Results
Net Interest Income  NII  Likely to Rise  The quarter witnessed improvement in the lending scenario primarily in commercial and Industrial  and consumer front  Thus  loan growth  combined with support from expanding margins on the back of partial impact of December rate hike  is likely to support M T Bank s NII  However  flattening of yield curve is expected to offset the benefit to some extent 
Muted Fee Income Growth  The company might witness growth in trust revenues on the back of strong equity market in the first quarter  However  given the high interest rate environment  no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment  As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter  mortgage banking revenues are not likely to witness much improvement  Thus  overall slight growth in other income is expected for the to be reported quarter 
Expenses to Trend Higher  Expenses are projected to trend higher in the quarter due to seasonally higher compensation costs and M T Bank s continued investments in several areas  including operational infrastructure and technology

115788,337303,MTB,Mitsubishi Asked By OCC To Improve Money Laundering Controls,opinion,"Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group s   NYSE MUFG   subsidiary MUFG Bank  Ltd   has been ordered to improve anti money laundering controls and other compliance procedures at its U S  based branches by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency   OCC   
Upon conducting an examination  the U S  regulator put forth deficiencies in the Bank Secrecy Act Anti Money Laundering  BSA AML  compliance program of MUFG Bank s U S  branches in New York  Los Angeles and Chicago 
OCC stated that the branches have shortcomings in proper internal controls  suspicious activity monitoring  foreign correspondent due diligence program  trade finance monitoring  independent audit and BSA officer staffing functions 
MUFG Bank is continuing to operate under an OCC consent order  issued in November 2017  which requires it to undertake corrective actions to improve Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC   compliance program 
Further  the bank stated in a press release that it has made several investments in the recent years to strengthen BSA AML compliance programs  In fact  it established a Global Financial Crimes Division in New York to monitor internal controls  OFAC sanctions compliance  and anti corruption compliance across MUFG Bank s worldwide operations 
Also  MUFG Bank promised to remain committed to perform operations with the highest levels of integrity and continue making efforts at strengthening its regulatory compliance 
In early February  MUFG entered into a joint venture with Akamai Technologies   NASDAQ AKAM   to form a new entity   the Global Open Network  Inc    GO NET    The companies plan to offer a new blockchain based payment network through GO NET 
The new payment network is expected to be made available in Japan in the first half of 2020  GO NET will provide an extensive set of services  including support for existing payment processing functions  micropayments  pay per use  and other developing IoT enabled payment transactions

Mitsubishi UFJ s strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake expansion strategies  Also  its intention to enter profitable business operations bode well for the long term  However  net interest income continues to remain under pressure due to unfavorable interest rates

115789,337304,MTB,Citi s Long Term Ratings Upgraded By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Moody s Investors Service  a rating arm of Moody s Corporation   NYSE C    has upgraded the long term ratings of Citigroup   NYSE C   and its subsidiaries  including the principal bank subsidiary  Citigroup  N A   as a result of the review commenced on Nov 29  2018  Further  the rating agency affirmed all short term ratings  Also  the ratings outlook is stable 
Rating for Citigroup s senior debt has been raised to A3 from Baa1  Also  its subsidiary s deposits have been upgraded to Aa3 from A1 and the baseline credit assessment  BCA  of its bank subsidiary to baa1 from baa2 
What Supports the Upgrade 
The ratings agency feels that Citigroup s efforts to simplify its operations and reduce global consumer footprint along with attempts to enhance safety and soundness called for BCA rating upgrade  Moreover  the company s strong economies of scale in global cards and institutional businesses is a key positive  Also  Moody s expects Citigroup to keep generating steady earnings that can be used toward investment in technology 
Moody s finds Citigroup s strategy of targeting affluent and emerging affluent consumers in different countries impressive  Alongside  the firm has refocused credit card lending business to a relatively lower risk appetite compared to the pre crisis period along with adoption of digital platforms to serve customers  which gives it an edge over its peers 
Citigroup is considered a leader in transaction and securities services since its institutional strategy centers deliver services through a vast global network of 98 countries and the world s major trade corridors  Combining these operating services with Citigroup s extensive market making capabilities leads to a robust stream of transaction and related trading revenues from global corporates  as well as a growing stock of core institutional LCR friendly deposits 
Per the ratings agency  Citigroup has significantly improved its risk management capabilities  risk appetite and corporate governance since the financial crisis  Therefore  Moody s finds it less likely that Citigroup will materially increase market  credit or operational risks or deviate from its client driven strategy  This strategy  when combined with capital returns  has the potential to further strengthen returns for the company s shareholders 
What Could Lead to Ratings Change 
BCA rating can be upgraded further if Citigroup is able to deepen relationships with existing retail customers and increase market share  while maintaining current risk level  resulting in a stronger and more diversified consumer banking franchise in the United States 
On the flip side  Citigroup s ratings may be downgraded if it experiences a significant deterioration in its capital or liquidity levels  Also  if a marked increase in its risk appetite  or weakness in operations control is witnessed  the ratings agency might consider this to be a negative factor

3 79 per share in fourth quarter 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 51  Also  the bottom line improved 85 8  year over year The company recorded rise in net interest income with support from margin expansion and loan growth  However  deterioration of credit quality and higher expenses were some negative factors  Also  fall in deposit balances was a headwind Net operating income came in at  550 2 million  up around 68 4  from  326 7 million recorded in year ago quarter On a GAAP basis  M T Bank s fourth quarter earnings per share of  3 76 jumped 87  year over year  Net

interest income increased 9  year over year to  1 07 billion in the quarter  driven by higher net interest margin  partly offset by lower average earning assets  Furthermore  net interest margin expanded 36 basis points  bps  to 3 92  The company s non interest income came in at  481 million compared with  484 million in the year ago quarter  Lower gain on bank investment securities and

certain non operating items  non interest operating expenses came in at  797 million  rising 1   The rise was attributable to higher salaries and employee benefits expenses in the recent quarter  partially offset by lower charitable contributions and FDIC assessments Efficiency ratio came in at 51 7   down from 54 7  in the prior year quarter  Lower ratio indicates rise in profitability Loans

repurchased a total of 3 06 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of  500 million Outlook for 2019Management expects continued runoff of the residential real estate portfolio mostly at low double digits In 2019  average total loans are likely to grow on a full year basis at a low single digit pace  Further  the company expects to exceed this pace if C I portfolio continues to grow like in fourth quarter 2018 and slowdown in paydown continues Management foresees slight benefit to NIM in case Fed doesn t announces further rate hikes  However  better upside is expected if the Fed continues to raise interest rates in 2019 Based on margin assumptions  the company expects year over year growth in net interest income  The higher interest rate environment will likely to challenge residential mortgage banking in 2019  specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations Fee income is expected to grow in low single digit range with the exception of trust revenues  which have been growing in a mid single digit or better pace Low nominal growth in total operating expenses for 2019 is expected  This includes the full year benefit of approximately  40 million from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge Seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in first quarter 2019  which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items  is likely to impact expenses Effective tax rate for 2019 in the range of 25  to 26  is expected

115853,337368,MTB,PNC Financial s  PNC  Q4 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"The PNC Financial Services Group   NYSE PNC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2018 results on Jan 16  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to reflect year over year growth 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income as well as non interest income  partially offset by higher expenses 
Moreover  PNC Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 3  
The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc Price and EPS Surprise    
Now  before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s discuss the factors that are likely to impact PNC Financial s fourth quarter results 
Factors to Impact Q4 Results
Net Interest Income  NII  to Improve  Commercial and Industrial  consumer and commercial real estate lending activities were decent during the fourth quarter  thus a support to PNC Financial s NII is expected  Also  the company s Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  332 3 billion for the to be reported quarter reflects growth of nearly 1  year over year 
Further  net interest margin is likely to benefit from the rising interest rates  while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt  Thus  given the improvement in the loans  earning assets and margins  the company s NII is expected to improve 
Management expects NII to grow in the low single digit  on a sequential basis 
Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII for the fourth quarter is  2 5 billion  which reflects an improvement of 6 3  year over year 
Non Interest Income Might Fall  Performance of the equity markets was not very impressive during the quarter  Thus  the company s asset management revenues are expected to decline 32 8  to  484 million  year over year 
Further  with continued rise in interest rates  a slowdown in refinancing activities and mortgage originations was witnessed during the quarter  Thus  residential mortgage revenues are also expected to remain lower 
Also  decline in global M A deals in the fourth quarter will likely hurt the company s corporate services fees marginally 
Nonetheless  given the continued momentum in customer activity  in terms of using credit and debit cards  PNC Financial s consumer services revenues are likely to improve  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consumer services revenues of  384 million reflects growth of 4 9  year over year 
With fall in almost all components of fee income  total non interest income is expected to reflect a decline  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest income is  1 89 billion  indicating 1 3  fall on a year over year basis 
Moderate Rise in Expenses  The company s continued efforts toward its cost saving program to keep expenses under control might be partially offset by its digital expansion efforts  Notably  management expects non interest expenses to increase in low single digits on a sequential basis 
Now  let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts 
According to our quantitative model  chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better to increase the odds of an earnings beat

Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is  0 20  
Zacks Rank  PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 
Also  activities of the company in the to be reported quarter were not adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  2 77 has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days  Nonetheless  the figure reflects year over year improvement of 21

115854,337369,MTB,Is An Earnings Beat In The Cards For M T Bank  MTB  In Q4 ,opinion,"M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2018 results on Jan 17  before the opening bell  The company s revenues and earnings are expected to improve from the year ago quarter 
M T Bank s third quarter 2018 results displayed top line improvement supported by rising margins  Further  lower provisions for credit losses were reported  The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate backed by these factors  Also  fall in expenses was another positive 
The bank s earnings surprise history seems impressive as it delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 7 1  
M T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Activities of M T Bank during the October December quarter were adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been revised slightly upward over the past seven days  Also  the consensus estimate of  3 51 indicates an increase of 32  in the bank s earnings from the prior year quarter 
Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate projects year over year revenue growth of 3 3  to  1 50 billion for the to be reported quarter 
Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Net Interest Income  NII  Likely to Rise  The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario primarily in commercial and Industrial  and consumer front  Thus  loan growth  combined with support from expanding margins on the back of rising interest rates  are likely to boost M T Bank s NII  However  flattening yield curve is likely to offset the benefit to some extent 
Muted Fee Income Growth  Since performance of the equity markets was not very impressive during the fourth quarter  M T Bank is unlikely to receive much support from related fees  Also  debt origination fees will likely remain low due to rising rates curbing involvement in these activities 
Furthermore  with the rising interest rate environment  no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment  As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter  mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement 
Expenses to Trend Higher  Expenses are projected to trend higher in the quarter due to the company s continued investments in several areas  including operational infrastructure and technology 
Finally  let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts 
According to our quantitative model  chances of M T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat

115856,337371,MTB,Rising Rates To Support People s United  PBCT  Q4 Earnings,opinion,People s United Financial  Inc    NASDAQ PBCT   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 17  Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to reflect year over year improvement Before we discuss the factors that could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter Impacted by elevated expenses and provisions  People s United delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2 9  in third quarter 2018  However  rising rates and higher fee income were tailwinds Notably  People s United delivered positive earnings surprise in one occasion and in line results in two out of the four trailing quarters  the average beat being 2 04   People s United Financial  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Regarding the stock s performance  shares of the company declined 14 4  for the three month period ended Dec 31  2018  Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People s United stock  This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter  Notably  our quantitative model shows that People s United is likely to beat on earnings this season  Here s why The company has the combination of the two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at  1 05   This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company Zacks Rank  The combination of People s United s Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat  Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth  A modest increase in lending   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and consumer   is expected to have led to improvement in net interest income  NII   However  weakness in revolving home equity loans  due to slowdown in originations as well as refinancing activities  will partially offset this Due to heightened competition  driven by bank and non bank lenders  lower demands and above average payoffs  loan growth has remained below expectations  Therefore  given the impact of these headwinds  mainly in the commercial real estate portfolio as well as the industry wide slowdown in the home equity market  management is not quite optimistic of attaining its 2018 loan growth goal of 3 5  Notably  the fourth quarter historically has been the bank s strongest quarter in terms of loan originations  Pipelines at the end of the third quarter were strong and management expects continuation of positive results across the businesses which performed well in 2018  including equipment financing and middle market C I  Therefore  runoff in transactional New York multi family portfolio for the full year is likely to be higher than the upper end of previous expectation of  350  400 million  Deposits are projected to be up 2 4  Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Given the influence of rise in interest rates  People s United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII  Notably  management s projections of 2018 NII s growth in the range of 10 12  is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well  This is based on the expectation of net interest margin  NIM  of 3 05 3 15   on assumption of two 25 basis point rate hikes during 2018  Notably  flattening  and sometimes inversion of the yield curve during the Dec end quarter is expected to have an unfavorable impact on net interest margin Fee Income to Escalate  On strong retail banking  fee income might escalate for the bank  Additionally  the company projects non interest income to be up 3 5  in 2018  the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the Oct Dec period Increase in Expenses  Despite undertaking a number of expense saving initiatives  People s United s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level  Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs  escalating expense levels are likely to curb bottom line expansion Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model  these have the right combination of

Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 9  year over year to  1 07 billion in the quarter  driven by higher net interest margin  partly offset by lower average earning assets  Furthermore  net interest margin expanded 36 basis points  bps  to 3 92  
The company s non interest income came in at  481 million compared with  484 million in the year ago quarter  Lower gain on bank investment securities and mortgage banking revenues were partially offset by higher trust  brokerage services and other income 
Non interest expenses were  802 2 million  up nearly 1  from the prior year quarter  Excluding certain non operating items  non interest operating expenses came in at  797 million  rising 1   The rise was attributable to higher salaries and employee benefits expenses in the recent quarter  partially offset by lower charitable contributions and FDIC assessments 
Efficiency ratio came in at 51 7   down from 54 7  in the prior year quarter  Lower ratio indicates rise in profitability 
Loans and leases  net of unearned discount  rose 1  year over year to  86 5 billion at the end of the reported quarter  However  total deposits declined 2 4  to  90 2 billion 
M T Bank s net operating income highlighted an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder equity of 1 93  and 22 16   respectively  compared with 1 12  and 11 77  recorded in the prior year quarter

Our Viewpoint
M T Bank s results display a decent performance in the quarter  We believe the company  with its sturdy business model and strategic acquisitions  is well poised for growth  Further  easing margin pressure and relaxed regulations will be favorable 
However  despite improving economic conditions  M T Bank s declining deposits balance and lower fee income remain key concerns  Also  rise in expenses came as a headwind

Revenues are expected to be  1 50 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 55  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M T Bank 
For M T Bank  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that M T Bank will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that M T Bank would post earnings of  3 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 56  delivering a surprise of  6 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
M T Bank appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mt-bank-mtb-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200374485,200374485
115883,337398,MTB,Will Comerica  CMA  Keep Earnings Beat Streak Alive In Q4 ,opinion,"Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 16  Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year 
The company s third quarter results reflected rise in revenues  Also  a strong capital position and improvement in credit quality were the other positives  However  fall in deposits and higher expenses were the key headwinds 
Notably  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 7 6  
Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise    
To know whether Comerica will be able to keep its earnings beat streak alive in the to be reported quarter as well  let s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts 
Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients  positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for Comerica is  0 63  
Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 
Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 66 for the quarter s earnings has been revised slightly upward over the past 30 days  Also  it reflects growth of 50  year over year 
Factors to Drive Results
Net Interest Income  NII  to Exhibit Slight Growth  Moderate loan growth during the quarter  particularly in commercial and industrial  and consumer portfolios  will lend some support to Comerica s interest income growth 
Also  NII is likely to improve  supported by expanding net interest margin  However  flattening of yield curve witnessed during the quarter will likely offset the benefit to some extent 
Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets of  66 billion for the fourth quarter indicates slight year over year decline 
Rise in Non Interest Income  Comerica s GEAR Up initiatives are likely to support rise in fee income in the to be reported quarter as well by driving growth in treasury management and card fees  along with fiduciary income 
Also  as customer spending remained decent during the quarter  the company is likely to record higher credit and debit cards fees  However  muted investment banking performance is expected to partially offset the benefits 
Therefore  given expectations of rise in both NII and fee income  total revenues are likely to increase  The consensus estimate for sales for the fourth quarter is  864 3 million  reflecting an improvement of 4 1  year over year 
Controlled Expenses  The company is likely to have been successful in keeping expenses controlled with its GEAR Up initiatives  However  some impact of technological investment and restructuring charges is likely to persist 
Credit Quality to Improve  The quarter witnessed strong credit quality trends backed by an improving economy  Also  the consensus estimate shows nearly 43  decline in non performing assets and loans  on a year over year basis

businesses  An improved economic backdrop will also have led to rise in business spending on development and capital investments Mortgage Banking Likely to be Lackluster  The mortgage business of U S  Bancorp is expected to have witnessed a slowdown in the fourth quarter as well  With interest rates moving higher  refinancing activities and fresh originations have been slowing down  Therefore  no

reported on Jan 16  On the trading front  performance of capital markets might be a matter of concern  Though escalating trade war concerns  Brexit issues  anxiety on rising rates and some other geo political tensions during the quarter created high volatility  seasonality on a sequential basis might be an offsetting factor The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division  of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues  reflects a decline of 16 1  sequentially However  the investment management unit of Goldman is projected to have supported earnings in the quarter to be reported  Prior investments in fixed income  alternatives and low cost index funds may continue to reap benefits to some extent  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this division projects a 12 5  sequential rise Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman s Q4 results Investment Banking Fees to Disappoint  Investment banking is anticipated to display a disappointing performance for the to be reported quarter due to seasonality  as well as a considerable reduction in equity underwriting volumes globally on escalating trade war fears  A fall in equity issuances across the globe might have resulted from reduced IPOs and follow on offerings  Therefore  equity underwriting fees are projected to have declined Moreover  debt origination fees will likely have remained low due to rising rates curbing corporates  involvement in these activities  Furthermore  robust pipeline of M As in the previous quarters lost momentum in the fourth quarter on volatile stock markets and higher borrowing costs  However  advisory revenues are expected to be on upswing on escalated volume of closed deals in the fourth quarter Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investment banking segment is pegged at  2 billion  slightly up sequentially Investing   Lending to Get a Boost  Improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to have driven revenues from this source  In addition to higher interest rates  a decent lending backdrop  particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and consumer will offer support to interest income  while weakness in revolving home equity loans  due to slowdown in originations as well as refinancing activities  will partially offset this  Nonetheless  lower asset values recorded during the quarter might have partially offset this rise  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investing and lending segment is projected at  1 8 billion  down 5 3  sequentially Strong Expense Management  Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities  As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been slashed by the bank  expense reduction will unlikely be a major support  Additionally  there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact

The move is aimed at improving efficiency of the wealth management segment by streamlining operations  Details of the restructuring will likely be disclosed later this week  by Jon Weiss  the lead of wealth and investment management unit  at an internal meeting to be held in town hall 
In its latest quarterly filing  Wells Fargo had mentioned that its investment management segment was still undergoing a review to assess whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations  with respect to rollovers for 401 k  plan participants  certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers  The bank had initiated this review on receiving inquiries from the federal authorities

Wells Fargo recently received the final approval for a settlement of  142 million to compensate the customers harmed by the bank s unauthorized account opening scandal  With this settlement  the bank would finally get a chance to move ahead of its past misconducts 
Wells Fargo s impressive cost control plan for 2018 will help it deal with the pressure on its costs  Also  the bank s efforts to improve image among customers and its improving economic backdrop might support the company s growth in the near term

115914,337429,MTB,Big Banks Clear Dodd Frank Stress Test  5 Top  Winners ,opinion,The Federal Reserve released the first round of its annual stress test results  mandated by the Dodd Frank regulation  The findings showed that the 35 largest U S  banks are well positioned to put more money in dividends  share buybacks and business investments  The banks have sufficient capital balance to withstand severe recession The results have been announced at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with rate hikes  reflecting an economy that is improving by the day  Banking on such positive developments  investing in sound bank stocks that have passed the litmus test will be judicious What Are the Dodd Frank Act Stress Tests The Fed started testing banks in 2009  two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that resulted in a recession  The Fed had to test all U S  bank holding companies with more than  50 billion in assets  per the Dodd Frank law enacted by former president Obama in 2010 But the threshold was raised to  100 billion last month by President Trump  These banks are subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  CCAR  that determines whether they can fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic turmoil    Banks Clear First Round of Fed s Toughest Annual Stress TestsAll 35 banks that underwent the annual Dodd Frank Act Stress Tests showed that they have enough capital buffers to weather an economic meltdown and recessions modelled by the Fed  These banks can withstand a situation where unemployment rate rises to 10   an almost 6  increase from the current level  the stock market tanks by two thirds and home prices plunge by 30  Banks  capital scores remained comfortably above regulatory requirements in the first round of the stress tests  even though they had to bear losses due to higher credit card balances and one time accounting challenges enacted by the recent congressional overhaul Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles added that  despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year s test  the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession  Banks Are Well Poised to Meet Financial ObligationsAll 35 banks stayed above the 4 5  minimum capital ratio in a severely stressed situation  When it comes to assessing the ability of a bank to meets its financial obligations  State Street Corporation s   NYSE STT   5 3  capital ratio turned out to be the lowest  per Fed  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Group AG   NYSE CS   topped the list with 17 6   followed by UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS   and Banco Santander  MC SAN   S A    NYSE SAN   at 16 4  and 15 2   respectively The diagram shows all the 35 banks that have cleared the minimum capital ratio to satisfy the Fed s concern  Fed Rate Hikes Bode Well for BanksWhile the stress test showed that the banks could withstand a downturn  it came at a time when the Fed lifted a key U S  interest rate for the second time this year and signaled a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term  Interest rates rose again as the U S  economy gained strength and inflation crawled higher The Fed  as widely expected  raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage points to a range of 1 75  to 2  this month and predicted two additional rate hikes this year  This will take the count to four increases instead of three as planned earlier Needless to say  higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities 5 Biggest GainersGiven the positive

115921,337436,MTB,Will M T Bank  MTB  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering M T Bank  MTB   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry 
This bank holding company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 03  
For the most recent quarter  M T Bank was expected to post earnings of  3 35 per share  but it reported  3 56 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 27   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 17 per share  while it actually produced  3 29 per share  a surprise of 3 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for M T Bank  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
M T Bank has an Earnings ESP of  1 72  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 17  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-mt-bank-mtb-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200369173,200369173
115954,337469,MTB,Wells Fargo Stock Climbs On Upbeat Expectations For 2018 ,opinion,"Shares of Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   closed 1 7  higher yesterday  reflecting investors  bullish stance on the bank s impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets 
During its Investors  Day presentation held on May 10  Wells Fargo also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term  It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55 80  from 55 75  it had set in 2016 
However  net interest income  which makes up more than 55  of revenues  is expected to be  relatively stable  in 2018  Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates 
Let s discuss the two keys takeaways of the presentation in details below 
Impressive Cost Savings Plan
The Sans Francisco based bank expects to reduce expenses by  2 billion in 2018  followed by another  2 billion in 2019  It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures 
The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of  53 5  54 5 billion for 2018  excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses 
Further  Wells Fargo s chief financial officer  John Shrewsberry said that expenses for 2020 might be between  50 billion and  51 billion along with revenues consistent with 2017  However  he cautioned that it was not a formal projection and that the bank s will remain committed to improving revenues 
Such measures will help the bank combat the persistent legal expenses  Also  this move might enable it to invest in productive areas 
Lesser Impact on Earnings From Asset Cap  Time Period Might Extend
Considering Wells Fargo s involvement in a horde of litigation issues  either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees  the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under  1 95 trillion in February 2018 
At the time  the bank said that it expects the restriction s impact on its net income after tax to be about  400 million  However  at the Investors  Day Wells Fargo s treasurer  Neal Blinde said that slow growth in loans and deposits balance helped in reducing the impact to about  100 million 
Also  after considering the restrictions  the bank was looking forward to continue building its balance sheet after a third party review of its plans  to improve controls and governance  to be held in September 2018 
However  on May 10  the bank said that it expects to continue operating with the cap till the first part of 2019  in order to better enforce the plans to improve operations 
Our Viewpoint
Wells Fargo s CEO  Tim Sloan  has launched a new advertising campaign with an aim to gain back the lost reputation by highlighting steps it has taken to repay customers and change its practices  On the other hand  it continues to settle past misconducts and accept penalties 
It is uncertain when the bank will be able to get past the legal hassles and strict regulatory scrutiny  Further  unstable revenues remain another key concern for Wells Fargo  However  its expense control initiative might allow some room to deal with the negatives 
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 3 1  over the past year  significantly underperforming the  s rally of 18  

Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Estimate of  349 4 million Net interest income  NIM  was up nearly 9 5  year over year to  243 2 million  The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases held for investment  partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense NIM of 4 59  expanded 13 basis points  bps  year over year due to elevated average yields on the variable and adjustable rate loan portfolios on rising rates  partly offset by escalated average rates on increased average balances of certificates of deposit  along with higher

over year to  143 6 million Further  provisions for credit losses were  11 4 million  down 6 8  year over year  primarily due to the auto finance portfolio run off and lower net charge offs in the commercial portfolio  These benefits were partly mitigated by rise in net charge offs in the consumer real estate portfolio However  net charge offs  as a percentage of average loans and leases

116038,337553,MTB,Wells Fargo  WFC  To Combine Corporate And Investment Banks,opinion,"With a view to trim costs and enhance the quality of customer service  Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   is making plans to merge corporate and investment banks  The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal 
Citing people familiar with the matter  the journal reported that the bank s restructuring move is likely to result in job cuts in industry coverage  advising  equity and debt capital along with corporate level relationship managerial positions 
Since news of the fake account scandals broke out  a lot of employees at Wells Fargo have been laid off  In July 2017  the company had removed about 70 senior executives from their posts  Some of the employees had moved to lower level positions while some preferred to shift to a new company 
Furthermore  in its annual filing  Wells Fargo disclosed that it overcharged customers in its investment and fiduciary services business   Also  the company said the review process of the Wealth and Investment Management segment is in  preliminary stages  
Due to the review conducted on the bank s operations and staff level adjustments  some positions of Wells Fargo s senior and junior level employees across credit sales and trading areas are likely to be affected  Per the newspaper  layoffs due to the review are not linked with Wells Fargo s integration plans 
We believe that Wells Fargo s bottom line growth is likely to be affected by legal hassles in the near term  However  the bank s efforts to revamp its financial position along with support from lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives 
Wells Fargo s shares have lost 3 4  over the past six months against the 5 7  growth for the  it belongs to

116039,337554,MTB,Will Wells Fargo  WFC  Q1 Earnings Overcome Legal Issues ,opinion,Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   is scheduled to report first quarter earnings  before the opening bell on Apr 13 This San Francisco based banking giant has been in the news on a regular basis  following the sales scam that surfaced in September 2016  The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank s auto insurance business and online bill pay services Therefore  the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage  and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well To add to the woes  during the first quarter  the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond  1 95 trillion  as of Dec 31  2017   The Fed s action demonstrates poor governance  compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal  as well as mishandling of auto insurance and mortgage fees Notably  the firm is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve  However  the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities Mortgage business  the primary source of revenue for Wells Fargo  is expected to witness a slowdown in the first quarter  With the interest rates moving higher  refinancing activities have been slowing down  Therefore  no major help is expected from this segment  Thus  growth in Wells Fargo s mortgage banking revenues is expected to be low Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo s Q1 results Loan Growth  Per the Fed s latest   loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the to be reported quarter  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial  C I   consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent However  the auto portfolio run off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo  Also  the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls Notably  in first quarter 2018  management expects loan growth to be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances  Additionally  based on the current pricing trends and channel mix in held for sale pipeline  the gain on sale margin is expected to decline Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income Expenses May Trend Higher  Wells Fargo might record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas  including mobile banking technology  digital lending and brokerage offerings  Moreover  high legal costs might be witnessed due to ongoing litigation hassles Non Interest Revenues to Grow Modestly  Outflows from the asset management business will likely be recorded on market declines  However  driven by high volatility  trading activity is expected to improve marginally in the quarter and rise in trust income is anticipated on higher equity markets Why

116040,337555,MTB,Will Citigroup  C  Q1 Earnings Benefit From Trading Rebound ,opinion,Citigroup   NYSE C   is scheduled to report first quarter earnings  before the opening bell on Apr 13 The expected rebound in Citigroup s trading revenues will likely have a positive impact on first quarter 2018 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source  Further  benefits of higher rates  decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments   mainly consumer banking   are anticipated to offset the negatives The quarter witnessed investors  anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation  which pulled the benchmark 10 year Treasury bond yields down  This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September  Moreover  Trump s trade tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter Therefore  after three straight quarters of muted activities  it appears that volatility is back in the markets  with extremity in February and March  This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues Per John Gerspach  chief financial officer  CFO  of Citigroup  rising volatility at the very beginning of 2018 is expected to break the trading revenues  slump  The bank expects first quarter 2018 trading revenues to be up by a  low to mid  single digit on a year over year basis  Additionally  equities business is likely to record revenues of more than  1 billion in Q1  last recorded in 2015  However  management believes investment banking might go down as compared with the prior year quarter Other Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth  In consumer  management expects continued modest year over year revenue growth  and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in 2018  In total  sequential growth in pre tax earnings in Global Consumer banking was recorded over the last three quarters and is anticipated to continue into the first quarter as well Acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues is expected in 2018 on rising card revenues Investment Banking Fees to Decline  The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter  as rising rates will limit corporates  involvement in these activities  As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees  this could impact revenues of Citigroup However  a potential rise in fees from increasing M As will likely help banks to partially offset the lost revenues  Also  strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow on offerings  So  the related fees are projected to increase  Thus  Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter On the institutional side  continued year over year revenue growth in accrual businesses  including TTS  the Private Bank  Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated Lesser scope of cost containment  As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank  expense reduction might not be a major support  Nonetheless  some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup s earnings to an extent Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending   particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  real estate and consumer   might perk up interest income Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively  Cost of credit is likely to rise  quarter on quarter  driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG  offset by lower reserve builds in consumer  Net credit card losses are likely to worsen  Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points  bps  for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term  In retail services  NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term Here is what our quantitative model predicts Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is  0 74   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 60 comes in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62 Zacks Rank  Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 62 reflects a 19 12  rise on a year over year basis

116041,337556,MTB,Why An Earnings Beat Is Likely For M T Bank  MTB  In Q1,opinion,M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 16  before the opening bell  The company s revenues and earnings are expected to improve from the year ago quarter The bank s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues  Also  improvements in the lending scenario and a rise in consumer confidence were some other positives  Further  heightened volatility during the quarter due to U S  China trade war tensions is expected to have boosted the top line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  1 42 billion indicates a 4 5  year over year improvement Before we discuss why an earnings beat might be in store  let s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter M T Bank s fourth quarter 2017 results were supported by higher revenues along with lower provisions for credit losses  The company also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors  However  rise in expenses was a negative The bank delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 4 8  Over the past year  shares of M T Bank have gained 27 3   outperforming 22 1  growth recorded by the  M T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M T Bank s stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise Why a Positive Surprise is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model  chances of M T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for M T Bank is  0 15  Zacks Rank  M T Bank carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise Notably  per the consensus estimate  M T Bank s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 27 4  from the prior year quarter to  2 74 Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income  NII  to Improve  The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent  owing to the tax reform  Thus  loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost M T Bank s NII Relatively Stable Fee Income  The first quarter was exceptionally good for trading activities due to increased volatility  thanks to escalated tariff tensions between the United States and China  rise in prices of necessities and a sharp sell off in the tech sector  Further  rise in advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher M A activities and equity issuances are likely to provide some support its top line However  the debt originations remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to remain muted  Also  with the rising interest rate environment  no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment  As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter  mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement Expenses to Trend Higher  Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology  Also  M T Bank witnessed increase in compensation expenses in the first quarter Activities of M T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been revised nearly 1  upward over the last seven days Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks

116070,337585,MTB,Wells Fargo Plea To Dismiss Unfair Lending Lawsuit Rejected ,opinion,"Per a Reuters article  Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   plea to fully dismiss a lawsuit which accused it of practicing discriminatory mortgage lending practices was dismissed by the U S  District Judge Gary Feinerman 
Background
In December 2014  Illinois  Cook County had filed a lawsuit against the bank alleging it of targeting minority borrowers in the Chicago area and violating the Fair Housing Act  FHA   Wells Fargo was charged of making them borrow loans that were too costly for them  which resulted in higher fees  frequent defaults and foreclosures  Also  the bank was accused of offering bonuses to employees who were successful in giving such loans 
In the lawsuit  the county also alleged Wells Fargo of engaging in the practice of  equity stripping  in order to maximize the income and assets the bank could generate by originating or acquiring high cost and other nonprime mortgage loans 
In July 2017  Wells Fargo had requested the federal court at Chicago to dismiss the lawsuit saying that the county failed to show that the bank had directly caused the harms alleged in the lawsuit 
Judge s Decision
Feinerman allowed the county to pursue federal Fair Housing Act claims against Wells Fargo to the extent the bank s alleged  equity stripping  practices boosted the cost of administering and processing a higher number of foreclosures 
Per the article  Feinerman dismissed claims alleging harm from lost property taxes  the need to combat crime and blight  racial segregation and other factors  calling them  ripples  that  flow far beyond  Wells Fargo s alleged misconduct 
Also  the federal judge stated that the cities are eligible to pursue FHA claims so long as they are successful in establishing a  direct  link between the alleged misconduct and the resulting harm 
Our Take
Legal hassles at Wells Fargo seem unlikely to end soon  Thus  legal costs are likely to hurt its bottom line growth  However  its strong capital position and a much attentive management might keep it from landing into trouble again 
Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 7 4  over the past six months against 3 8  rally for the  it belongs to

116073,337588,MTB,5 Reasons To Make Fifth Third  FITB  Part Of Your Portfolio,opinion,"Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB   is a promising stock now due to its diligent efforts to enhance profitability through Project North Star initiatives  Also  the company s organic and inorganic growth strategies make it well poised for future endeavors  Further  earnings growth prospects and favorable valuation make it an attractive pick 
Moreover  continual rise in interest rates and lower commercial tax rate are likely to further boost profitability of the bank

Acquisition Spree  Given its robust liquidity position  Fifth Third is well positioned to grow on the back of acquisitions  In February 2018  it acquired Coker Capital Advisors  a healthcare advisory company  Further  in February last year  the company acquired R G  McGraw Insurance Agency  which provides property and casualty insurance as well as risk management analysis  Product and balance sheet diversification  stemming from the acquisitions  will likely support the company s top line 
Revenue Growth  Fifth Third s diverse revenue base supports its efforts to make consistent progress toward driving performance  Over the past four years  ended 2017   total revenues recorded a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 5 9  
Its projected revenue growth rate is 6 1  for 2018  compared with the industry average of 4 7

116075,337590,MTB,3 Cheap Selloff Buys Yielding Up To 6 4   Sale Won t Last ,opinion,"It s happening again  blood is in the streets 
And if you remember the timeless advice of Warren Buffett  you know what to do  be greedy 
Because this selloff shouldn t be happening  I ll show you why in just a couple paragraphs  and as a result  there are plenty of extremely undervalued bargains just waiting to be snapped up 
Toward the end of this article  I ll reveal 3 funds chock full of high quality  oversold stocks and yielding up to 6 4   But first  let s look at what s driving this income  and gain  opportunity  It comes down to a glaring  and very temporary  disconnect in the market 
Earnings Soar  Investors Shrug
Less than a month ago  I showed you how the first quarter of 2018 saw an unusual anomaly  a sharp spike in earnings per share  EPS  growth for the first two months unlike anything we d seen before 
Source  FactSet Insight
These gains happened across the market  and no sectors saw significant declines  More recent data confirms that things look great for stocks 
On March 29  just before the market took another turn south  FactSet released a report noting that the median EPS estimate across all S P 500 companies in the first quarter of 2018 rose by 5 4   which is pretty much identical to what we saw through the first two months of Q1 
Source  FactSet Insight
The biggest winners were energy  up 14 6    telecom  up 14 1   and finance  up 11 3    Of course  there s more to the story  Wages are up  inflation is moderate  and consumer sentiment is strong 
So why is the S P 500 doing this 
Stocks and Earnings Part Company
The simple reason is that first level investors are focusing on passing headlines that will be forgotten in a couple weeks  But as we ve seen since the start of the year  all the scary headlines about a potential war with North Korea and tariffs  for example are quickly forgotten  and then stocks swiftly recover 
That s about to happen yet again  and savvy investors should be ready 
The One Sector to Target Now
We re seeing a huge gain in financial stocks  earnings  in no small part due to the Federal Reserve s interest rate hikes in recent years  and its plans to raise rates 3 times  or more  in 2018 
This is good for banks because higher rates mean bigger profits from lending money to Americans  It is also good for banks because the Fed only raises rates when economic growth is strong  And economic growth means declining delinquency rates  bankruptcy rates and  you guessed it  even more profits for banks 
It s already happening 
Businesses Get Healthier  
The total number of bankruptcies is crashing  and we re also seeing default rates for mortgages and consumer credit fall to the floor 
  And so Do Household Bottom Lines
This is all good for banks  but look how the Financial Select Sector SPDR  XLF  just keeps tumbling 
A Silly Selloff
That means it s bargain time for savvy contrarians 
Which brings me to 
Bargain Fund Pick No  1  Top Notch Banks and a 4  Dividend
The only problem with XLF is that it yields a crummy 1 9   We can do better than that 
The John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund  BTO  is chock full of high quality  well managed banks that are most exposed to Americans  improving financial well being 
I m talking names like JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM   PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC  and M T Bank Corp   NYSE MTB   the kind of regional and national banks that are focused on providing Americans with mortgages  credit cards and other loans while also maximizing their own returns to shareholders  Plus  BTO pays a much better  yet still sustainable  4  dividend yield 
Here s the best part  BTO s net asset value  NAV  or the market value of all the fund s portfolio holdings  is up 1   while XLF is down 4 3  
Up in a Tough Market
Being up when the market is down tells me BTO is well managed and is set to soar when investors realize just how oversold financials are 
A  2 Pack  for 6 2   Dividends and Upside
As strong as BTO s prospects look  I would be remiss if I didn t mention two other funds  the Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund  JQC  and the Invesco VK Dynamic Credit Opportunities Fund  VTA  
Both of these are senior loan funds  and the way they work is simple  they leverage their NAV at a fixed rate  then lend that money out in the form of corporate loans with floating rates  This is important because the rate that debtors pay on floating rate loans goes up when interest rates go up 
And we all know what the Fed is planning to do this year  make interest rates go up 
That s why both of these funds are attractive right now  and their 6 4   for VTA  and 6 2   for JQC  yields make them even more enticing 
And take a look at this 
A  Hidden  Discount
In the chart above  you can see that VTA has returned a nice 5 7  on its NAV in the last year  while its market price is up less than half that  just 2 6   Even better  JQC s 2 3  gain is met with a 2 2  price loss  meaning these two funds are sitting at nearly their biggest discounts in a year 
A Flash Sale That s About to End
This makes no sense because  as we all know  the Fed is going to make these portfolios more valuable  Amidst the panic selling  the market is giving us a gift of extremely oversold funds that are worth getting right now  Take advantage of the sale while you can 
4 Red Hot Buys With 7 6   CASH Payouts and BIG Upside
VTA  JQC and BTO are a special type of fund called  or a CEF 
The key thing to know about CEFs is this  many of the 500 or so CEFs out there trade at discounts just as big  or bigger  than the markdowns these 3 funds sport  And those ridiculous discounts fuel their outsized dividends  too 
Let me explain 
Take VTA  whose  0 75 annual dividend  paid monthly  no less  amounts to a 6 4  yield on its  tremendously discounted  market price 
That sounds high maybe even too good to be true  But the number that really counts is the yield on NAV  or the fund s  true  value  And that comes out to 5 7   a figure that s much easier for management to earn 
But millions of investors have totally missed this powerful advantage  casually dismissing CEFs  discounts as unsustainable 
That s our cue to pounce 
These 4 off the radar CEFs invest in real estate  corporate bonds and US and international stocks 
Throw them together in a single portfolio and you get unbeatable diversification which keeps your nest egg safe and an average dividend yield of 7 6   with the highest yielder among them throwing off a fat 8 1  CASH payout 
That s just the start  because all 4 of these unsung cash machines trade at BIG discounts to NAV 
Translation  You re looking at easy 20  upside at least in the next 12 months as those weird discounts revert to normal  That s on top of the 7 6  average yield you re getting  too

manufactured housing  as well as building wire for electrical distribution in commercial and industrial buildings Recent Earnings DataThe company reported Q4  and FY 2017 results on February 20th where they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter  On a year over year basis  earnings grew by  38 2  while revenues rose by  25 9  There were several reasons for the impressive results  an increase in unit volumes  measured in copper pounds contained in wire sold  by  5 8   a  22 8  rise in average selling price per copper pound  and a  30 1  increase in sales prices  Moreover  the company s gross margins improved more than previously expected Management s TakeAccording to Daniel L  Jones  Chairman  President  and CEO   We are pleased to report a great fourth quarter and full year  Our unit sales were up in both copper and aluminum building wire for the year  One of the key metrics to our earnings is the spread between the price of copper wire sold and the cost of raw copper purchased in any given period  The copper wire spread increased 9 9  in 2017 versus 2016  as the average price of copper purchased increased 25 4  in 2017 versus 2016  and the average selling price of wire sold increased 19 8    We are also encouraged by the fact spreads improved during the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the third quarter of 2017    Mr

quarter  We also declared another cash dividend during the quarter  Looking ForwardThe company is expected to see significant tax savings due to the new corporate tax rates  WIRE will see its effective tax rate fall from about 33  to approximately 22    Also  the continued positive housing and permit data shows that the need for electric wiring will remain in place though 2018  Tile Shop

declined by 310 basis points Issues AheadIn December the company stopped its promotional pricing strategy as management believed that it was hurting traffic specifically with professional customers  Going into 2018  management has shifted its focus on product differentiation  and less on promotional pricing   While the shift seems appropriate  there is no true way to gauge the potential success of this move  Adding to the uncertainty surrounding future earnings  management has provided very limited guidance for 2018 with zero EPS  sales or gross margin expectations Management s TakeAccording to Robert Rucker  interim CEO   During the fourth quarter  we focused on improving our product assortment  identifying opportunities to better serve our professional customers  and de emphasizing price promotions  We have acted swiftly and decisively and we are confident in our long term strategy   Company performance in the second half of the year was not reflective of our position within the flooring industry as the preeminent place to romance your home with unique and premium tile   We are committed to providing the best product assortment  best service  and best presentation in the tile industry   We believe we are taking the right steps to deliver better financial results and best position the Company for long term success  Additional content 3 Bank Stocks Not Likely to Lose

have outperformed the  Notably  at the same time  this has made bank stocks a bit expensive  So  should one be betting on the stocks though these are expensive  Well  the answer is a yes Factors to Keep the Momentum AliveFavorable rate hike scenario If the Federal Reserve sticks to its plan of increasing rates three times in 2018  it will further help banks in expanding net interest margin  This

rates So  banks are anticipated to benefit further Lower tax rates All sectors are likely to benefit from the lower tax rates with banks expected to gain the most as they are amongst the highest tax payers in the United States Also  driven by the tax legislation provisions related to repatriation of overseas cash  banks will be in a win win situation  This is because  as overseas cash is brought back  it will likely provide an impetus to M As activities  thereby giving a boost to investment banking  Also  as the act will lower tax rates for wealthy individuals  asset management units of these banks are projected to witness a rise in fund inflow Potential lesser regulation Growing investor optimism related to lesser regulations is likely to boost bank stocks  While no time frame has been outlined for the execution  the announcement of a bipartisan agreement has helped investors regain confidence  This will help banks in reducing regulatory compliance costs and will likely to lead to a

116125,337640,MTB,Why An Earnings Beat Is Unlikely For KeyCorp  KEY  In Q4,opinion,KeyCorp   NYSE KEY   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp  Rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank  Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent  pressure on KeyCorp s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017  Further  the quarter witnessed growth in its consumer loan portfolio as a result of a rise in consumer confidence Moreover  President Trump s success with the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter and is likely to support KeyCorp s fee income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  1 58 billion indicates a 1 9  year over year improvement for the to be reported quarter Last quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Lower credit cost  an increase in fee income  and improving loans and deposits were among the positives  However  higher operating expenses were on the downside Activities of KeyCorp during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  Thus  over the last 30 days  its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s earnings remained stable at 36 cents  Nevertheless  it reflects a year over year improvement of 16 1  Notably  KeyCorp s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17 8  in the past three months  outperforming the 13 8  growth recorded by the  Will the stock s rally continue post fourth quarter earnings release  Let s see how things are shaping up Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model  chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are dim  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better

currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow  In addition to higher interest rates  moderate improvement in lending  mostly on the consumer front  is likely to perk up interest income  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be  966 million  up 1 9  year over year  For 2017  management expects net interest income in the range of  3 8  3 9 billion Modest non interest income growth  KeyCorp s fourth quarter non interest income will benefit from increasing investment banking income  primarily driven by slightly higher debt placement fees  Also  as the equity markets performed fairly well during the quarter  trust and investment services income is expected to witness a rise Nevertheless  due to lower mortgage originations  growth in mortgage banking fees is likely to be rather muted during the quarter  Therefore  non interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement Decline in expenses should support profitability  KeyCorp has been constantly diversifying products  reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable non core businesses  As a result of this  we expect the company s overall non interest expenses  excluding merger related charges  to be manageable  Also  management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally Asset quality to worsen  As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans  a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non performing asset of  570 million and non performing loans of  530

116127,337642,MTB,Why A Q4 Earnings Beat Is Likely For M T Bank  MTB ,opinion,"M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18  before the opening bell  The company s revenues and earnings are expected improve from the year ago quarter 
Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store  let s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter 
M T Bank s third quarter 2017 results were hurt by lower trading and mortgage revenues along with higher expenses  The company also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors  However  a decline in provision for loan losses and strong capital position were the tailwinds 
The bank has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 1 9  
Over the past year  shares of M T Bank have gained 16 9   underperforming 27  growth recorded by the  
M T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M T Bank s stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise 
Why a Positive Surprise Is Likely
According to our quantitative model  chances of M T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for M T Bank is  0 45  
Zacks Rank  M T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3  This  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise 
Notably  per the consensus estimate  M T Bank s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 19 4  from the prior year quarter to  2 40 
Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Net Interest Income  NII  to Improve  The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending   particularly in the consumer front  Thus  loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost the company s NII 
Relatively Stable Fee Income  The investment banking business witnessed improvement in the quarter and trust income is expected to rise  thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth  Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line 
However  the overall volume of M A has remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to decline slightly  Also  with the refinance boom nearing its end  no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment and hence revenues are not expected to witness much improvement 
Expenses to Trend Higher  Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology 
Activities of M T Bank during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last seven days

116170,337685,MTB,The Tax Bill Will Be Good For U S  Equities,opinion,"Do not be short Jingle Bells  In fact  you might even want to consider using the three point harness on the Santa Rally this year because the market reindeer are very fired up  The Tax Bill is completed and will be signed this week  The Government will not shut down because Congress wants to leave the swamp for their winter holiday  There is little news or business to attend to in the last two weeks  so the month s direction has been set barring any new geopolitical news or POTUS tweetstorms  While U S  and global data points continued up and to the right last week  the FOMC got together for one last hike under Chair Yellen s leadership   The equity bulls and volatility sellers thank her also for her leadership   Two other great leaders who left much too early over the weekend were Bob Wilmers of M T Bank  NYSE MTB  and Hunter Harrison of CSX  NASDAQ CSX   These two taught many of us how to better run a Bank and a Railroad  They will both be missed but their knowledge will be carried forward by current and future industry leaders

One last time on how the Tax Bill will be good for U S  Equity prices 
Using a bottom up approach  UBS ests the impacts of major tax provisions  including foreign and sector specific items  They calculate a 21  corporate tax rate would boost S P 500 EPS by 9 1   with foreign   1 7   and sector  specific   0 5   tax provisions having a notable offset  Firms have a strong incentive to buy back stock to offset the 2018 headwinds  Similar to after the 2004 tax holiday  when more than  300bn was brought back  firm expects a surge in buybacks   350bn   1 5   of mkt cap  and M A  and a sizeable pickup in corporate spending and dividends  They believe full expensing of capex would boost FCF by 2  and further support a very positive corporate spending backdrop 
 Briefing 
If you want a good summary of the Tax Bill s finer details for an individual taxpayer  this was a very good summary 
Republican lawmakers released the details of their tax code rewrite on Friday  which reconciles differences between the House and Senate bills 
Several of the most anticipated changes   such as a significant increase in the standard deduction and the curtailing of state and local income tax breaks   made the final cut  Some of the most controversial proposals  like eliminating the medical deduction  were wiped away 
Many of these provisions are temporary  however  and are set to expire after seven years  They all take effect in 2018  unless noted otherwise 
  
While the Fed did raise rates as expected  there was increasing debate about inflation 
The Fed s Charles Evans makes the case that the FOMC should hold back and let the economy run  Neel Kashkari would tell you the same and that hopes that inflation will rise in the future is not a prudent policy 
Real activity in the U S  is on a solid footing  which by itself would support a further adjustment in policy  Inflation  however  is too low and has been so for quite some time  I am concerned that persistent factors are holding down inflation  rather than idiosyncratic transitory ones  Namely  the public s inflation expectations appear to me to have drifted down below the FOMC s 2 percent symmetric inflation target  And I am concerned that too many observers have the impression that our 2 percent objective is a ceiling that we do not wish inflation to breach  as opposed to the symmetric objective that it really is  that is  we would like to see the odds of inflation running modestly below 2 percent equal the odds of it running modestly above over the long run 
I believe that leaving the target range at 1 to 1 1 4 percent at the current time would have better supported a general pickup in inflation expectations and increased the likelihood that inflation will rise to 2 percent along a path that is consistent with a symmetric inflation objective 
  

  
Stan Druckenmiller is also in the  lower inflation for longer  camp 
A great long interview with many great thoughts to chew on from last week 
I THINK THE 2  INFLATION TARGET NEEDS TO GO  IF I WAS RUNNING THE FED  THANK GOD FOR THE   TO THE WORLD   I M NOT RUNNING THE FED IT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE IN MY TOP TEN CRITERIA  THE 2  INFLATION TARGET HAS SORT OF BECOME A RELIGION INITIATED BY THE PROFESSORS  AND IT S THIS TARGET  THERE S AN INTERESTING STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  TODAY HOW AMAZON IS MAKING THE FED S JOB MORE COMPLICATED  THIS BELIEF THAT 2  IS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL SEASONS AND ALL TIMES  TO ME IT S PRETTY ABSURD  YOU TAKE THE LAST GREAT INNOVATION PERIOD WHICH IS THE LATE 1800s  WE HE DEFLATION FOR TEN OR 15 YEARS ACCOMPANIED BY VERY RAPID REAL GROWTH  IN THE  50s  I THINK INFLATION WAS 1   MAYBE A LITTLE LOWER  FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DECADE  FED FUNDS WERE 4   WE HAD RAPID GROWTH  THERE WAS NO CRISIS 
 CNBC 
Online shopping and price comparison is helping to hold back inflation 
Economists attribute feeble inflation across developed economies to several causes  including aging populations  slow productivity growth and globalization  which have reined in the ability of companies to raise prices and wages  With consumer spending accounting for more than two thirds of the U S  economy  the explosion in e commerce has been added to the list 
Stacy Peterson  34 years old  of North Little Rock  Ark  said she started her holiday shopping in October  researching and comparing prices online  On Thanksgiving Day  she sprang for a trampoline she had been eyeing  It was marked down online at Academy Sports   Outdoors to  129 99 from  179 99 
The mother of two plans to check the holiday sales at her local stores  she said  but mostly will look online and buy from  whoever has it cheapest  
In a nod to the growing practice  Ms  Yellen said in September that increased competition created by online retailers  may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise prices in response to rising demand   She said in October that online shopping  could be helping to hold down inflation in a persistent way in many countries   The Bank of Japan in has attributed part of the price declines at supermarkets to online shopping

The GMO quarterly letters hit last week  Always a must read 
As you would expect  Jeremy and Ben are having an issue with market valuations  They still see the best opportunity for equity gains in the Emerging Markets 
There is a final  somewhat speculative piece of comfort I take in our equity portfolios  Significant inflation would certainly come as a nasty shock to equity investors in general  But if there is one group of equities that deals with inflation on a pretty much continuous basis  it is emerging equities  Emerging markets usually have a decently high beta in down markets  But it is not so far fetched to imagine that if the catalyst for the fall were rising inflation  the stock markets where inflation was never absent in the first place might be better able to shrug it off  To be clear  our fondness for emerging equities today is driven overwhelmingly by their cheaper valuations  not a speculative belief in their resilience against an event that has not occurred since emerging became an institutionally buyable asset class  But if worse did come to worst and inflation flared up  owning a good chunk of the only equities that remember what inflation is like seems like a decent idea

Company of the week 
Travelers in Atlanta were in trouble on Sunday  Chick fil A isn t even open on Sunday s but they showed up anyway to give out free food and water to thousands 
And then a large elephant appeared in the room  
In a report last week  the cryptocurrency website Digiconomics said that worldwide bitcoin mining was using more electricity than Serbia  The country  Writing for Grist  Eric Holthaus calculated that by July 2019  the Bitcoin peer to peer network remember BitTorrent  Like that would require more electricity than all of the United States  And by November of 2020  it d use more electricity than the entire world does today 
That s bad  It means Bitcoin emits the equivalent of 17 7 million tons of carbon dioxide every year  a big middle finger to Earth s climate and anyone who enjoys things like coastlines  forests  and not dying of mosquito borne diseases  Refracted through a different metaphor  the Bitcoin P2P network is essentially a distributed superintelligence utterly dedicated to generating bitcoins  so of course it wants to convert all the energy  and therefore matter  in the universe into bitcoin  That is literally its job  And if it has to recruit greedy nerds by paying them phantom value  well  OK 
Even crazier is that the elephant is hungry for coal 
China  which gets about 60 percent of its electricity from coal  is the biggest operator of computer  mines  and probably accounts for about a quarter of all the power used to create cryptocurrencies  according to a study of the industry published in April by Garrick Hileman and Michel Rauchs at Cambridge University 
About 58 percent of the world s large cryptocurrency mining pools were located in China  followed by the U S  at 16 percent  the researchers said  China is the biggest producer and consumer of coal  and server farms in provinces such as Xinjiang  Inner Mongolia and Heilongjian are heavily reliant upon the fuel

116185,337700,MTB,5 Major Bank Stocks Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates In Q3,opinion,"The Q3 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the results of banks that have been in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons While investors  optimism over the Fed s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep raising interest rates should drive bank stocks higher in the upcoming months  Q3 results are not expected to be overwhelming This is because  major banks in the S P 500 index  accounting for nearly 45  of the  s total earnings  are expected to witness 5 1  year over year decline in earnings in the to be reported quarter  This compares with 10  growth recorded in the prior quarter  For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others  please read our  article  
Reduction in equity issuance  feeble equity trading volumes and subdued volumes of M A s are expected to negatively impact fee income growth for banks this time around  However  a persistent rise in debt underwriting  mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates  and stability of fixed income trading flows will likely provide some respite In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending  particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer might energize interest income for banks Credit quality is anticipated to remain strong  backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards  Though a continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom line numbers  banks might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed income trading activities on low volatility during the third quarter On the cost front  while the absence of considerable legal expenses is positive  increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are unlikely to be impressive  there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers  Therefore  this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist  One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive

The company is well poised to grow with the help of its revenue and efficiency enhancing initiatives or GEAR Up initiatives  This is expected help the company achieve annual pre tax income of about  270 million by year end 2018  Further  Comericaseeks to achieve  125 million cost savings target for 2017 
The company has reported increased non interest income over the last two years  supported by cross sell opportunities  including wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services  Further  management expects 4 6  increase in fee income in 2017 through modest growth in treasury management and card fees  and wealth management products 
Also  Comerica s capital strength can be judged from its capital deployment activities  It has a share repurchase plan of up to  605 million for a four quarter period  ending second quarter 2018  in progress  Also  as part of its 2017 capital plan  the company raised its common stock dividend by 15  in July 2017  Further  these activities look sustainable as Comerica s debt equity ratio and dividend payout ratio compare favorably with the broader industry 
However  Comerica s significant exposure to commercial loans  nearly 64  of the total loans  keeps us apprehensive  If the housing sector weakens  it would adversely impact the company s financials

116253,337768,MTB,3 Regional Bank Stocks,opinion,"In a previous post  I wrote about some good bank stocks that you should consider investing in to get exposure to the financial sector of the stock market  Today I want to talk to you more about bank stocks  but this time focus on regional bank stocks 
Why regional bank stocks  Unlike national banks like Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   regional bank stocks can be better investments  There are many reasons for this including 

More targeted to a certain customer
Ability to take part in prosperous regions
Less red tape than a national bank
Potentially better service and happier customers

Of course  some could argue negatives for regional bank stocks based on the same strengths that I listed above  But I feel that the 3 stocks I list below do have an advantage over national banks 
Let s take a look at these 3 stocks and see which one makes sense for your portfolio 
3 Great Regional Bank Stocks
 1  First Hawaiian Inc   NASDAQ FHB 
First Hawaiian Bank is an interesting play  Because of the isolation of the state of Hawaii  First Hawaiian is in a position that controls banking in the state  In fact  they control 37  of deposits in the state 
And with little competition  they can set their own saving and lending rates without much pressure to get into a pricing war with other banks 
In their recent earnings release  First Hawaiian reported earnings per share of  0 41 which met expectations  Revenue hit  180 million  which missed estimates by  2 5 million  However  this was an increase of 8  
As interest rates are expected to continue to rise  I expect revenues to continue to grow  The only downside to this stock is the inability to expand into new markets  again because of the isolation  Even so  I think this stock is a good investment 
 2  M T Bank Corporation  NYSE MTB 
M T first caught my attention when I heard that the company has not lost money in a quarter since 1976  That is impressive even without the housing and stock market collapse in 2008  But when you dig into that a little more  you realize why this stock is so solid 
They make smart decisions  They never got involved in the mortgage back securities that were the downfall of so many other banks  Because of this  M T Bank is a great option for the long term investor 
When they released their latest earnings  earnings per share were  2 35  which beat estimates by  0 07  Revenue hit estimates of  1 4 billion  and this was a 7  increase 
The bank does its business in the northeastern part of the United States  With big cities and booming industry  the future of M T looks solid  Add in the smart decision making by its leaders and its no wonder why this stock is a buy 
 3  First Republic Bank  NYSE FRC 
Of the regional bank stocks listed  First Republic is my favorite  The reason is because of the markets and people it serves 
First Republic primarily does business in New York City  Los Angeles  Boston and Silicon Valley  This means they do a lot of banking with businesses and high net worth clients 
Based on statistics  high net worth people are excellent candidates for loans as they rarely default  Because of this  First Republic can offer extremely attractive interest rates on loans 
In the latest earnings release  First Republic had earnings per share hit  1 06 which missed estimates by  0 03  Revenues were  641 million  another miss by  25 million  However  revenue did increase by 20  
Overall  this bank has a bright future ahead of it based on where it does business and with whom it does business with 
Final Thoughts
Overall these 3 regional bank stocks have a lot going for them  In the coming quarters and years  I see them continuing to perform well and as a result  expect their stock prices to rise 
The only major downside risk is another collapse of the market  But this time it won t be fueled by the banks  As a result  any pull back will be a great opportunity to buy more shares at a hefty discount

116254,337769,MTB,Could Repealing Dodd Frank Make The Derivatives Market Even Bigger  ,opinion,"Last month  three of the most powerful people in the world met in Jackson Hole  Wyoming 
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi   let s call them the Big Three of monetary policy   had a lot to discuss 
One item that almost certainly came up was the possible repeal of Dodd Frank    and its effects on the already huge derivatives market 
Yet the only question many people seem to be asking is  Is this Yellen s last Jackson Hole conference  
Yellen s Last Stand 
You see  Yellen s four year term as Fed chief expires in February  She could be reappointed to a second term  yet it s no secret that she and President Trump have a love hate relationship  There are rumors that Trump s economic advisor   Gary Cohn   will replace her 
But too many people are asking the wrong question  The question should be  What will happen if Dodd Frank is eliminated  
If Cohn does get the job as Fed chair  it may become a whole lot more likely that the Dodd Frank Act will be repealed  That would do away with the contentious regulations imposed on banks 
And it could allow our massively overgrown derivatives market   the subject of this week s chart   to get even bigger 
 True  the Fed can t pass or repeal legislation  but it has a big influence on what Congress does in these matters  and it is the chief banking regulator that implements and enforces regulations  
Pros and Cons of Repealing Dodd Frank
According to Steve McDonald s recent Wealthy Retirement article  the repeal of Dodd Frank could spell opportunity for investors   

M T Bank  NYSE MTB  alone saw its compliance costs increase from  90 million a year in 2010 to  440 million in 2016  
Capital requirements are one of the biggest drags on the performance of big banks  State Street Bank is required to have as much as 40  of its cash in risk free Treasurys or the Federal Reserve  And the more cash it has tied up  the lower its performance  
The expected rollback in regulations would be a big boost for earnings across the board  Analysts are predicting a 30  earnings increase  

That said  eliminating Dodd Frank could have a negative effect on investors who are unprepared    especially if history has anything to say about it 
Back in 2000  President Clinton and Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act  CFMA   a sweeping deregulation of swaps and derivatives  According to some economists  the CFMA made a significant contribution to the 2008 financial crisis 
The law loosened restrictions on the financial sector s use of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps   the two instruments that were central to the collapse of the U S  housing market 
As a result  many think the elimination of Dodd Frank could have a similar effect 
Needless to say  this is something the Club is watching closely 
Until a decision is made concerning the future of Janet Yellen and the Dodd Frank Act  stay the course  Stick to the Club s Pillars of Wealth  and don t get bogged down with the wrong questions ",2017-09-03,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/could-repealing-doddfrank-make-the-derivatives-market-even-bigger-200211179,200211179
116255,337770,MTB,Wells Fargo s Rating Lowered By DBRS On Fake Account Scandal,opinion,"Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   has been rated down to AA  low  from AA by DBRS  a Toronto based credit rating agency  Its involvement in fake account scandal has majorly led to this rating downgrade 
The downward rating reflects Wells Fargo s operational inefficiency and improper management  The rating agency also took into account the bank s falling reputation because of the several legal issues that have come to light of late 
Further  DBRS also considered the amount of expenses the bank has already incurred and would be facing in the near term 
Wells Fargo has already agreed to pay  142 million in settlement of class action suit for opening accounts without its customers  permission  Also  it paid refunds of about  3 7 million to its customers through July 2017 
However  this was not the end for Wells Fargo s troubles  Some more disclosures regarding problems in other consumer related products were made 
The bank had been accused of charging high termination fees and unauthorized credit card fees along with issues in its auto insurance business in August 2017  Later  news of Wells Fargo closing authentic bank accounts without permission was reported  Moreover  as a result of an expanded review  the bank revealed that another 1 4 million fake accounts were created by its employees illegally  It has agreed to pay another  2 8 million as refunds to customers 
The regulators are yet to take actions against the bank  Recently  the Fed Chair Janet Yellen called Wells Fargo s actions  egregious and unacceptable  and disclosed that the Fed is trying to understand the main reasons for these problems 
DBRS  rating still keeps Wells Fargo among the highest rated banks because of its diversified franchise and strong capital position  However  the rating agency disclosed that higher than  expected litigation costs are leading to reduced profits  In fact  any further asset quality deterioration would lead to a negative rating 
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 17 6  over the past year  underperforming the 36 4  rally for the  it belongs to 

Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Some better ranked stocks in the same space are PNC Financial Services Group   NYSE PNC    FB Financial Corporation   NYSE FBK   and M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Trading revenues are anticipated to decrease year over year  mainly due to low volatility in both the bond and equity markets  Last year quarter s trading results were quite unusual across the industry  with Brexit being the main driver at that time Apart from this  global M A activity remained lackluster  Per the Thomson Reuters data  the total deal value of announced M As across the world fell during the quarter  Debt underwriting was soft as well  Also  overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline  with the only saving grace being improvement in equity underwriting While the Fed s recent rate hikes should ease some pressure on net interest margin  lower treasury yields during the quarter are likely to curb margin improvement  On the other hand  per the   loans grew on a sequential basis during the quarter  Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans  C I  are expected to increase  while consumer loans might fall  Therefore  interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally On the cost front  there is less chance of a significant rise in the expenses  At the same time  the expense saving initiatives keep on supporting the bottom line performance  So  overall expenses are expected to remain stable in the quarter Selecting the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive  there are still a few major banks that are expected to reflect resilience  Therefore  this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well poised to beat earnings in their upcoming releases

Decline in Fee Income  Fee income might be affected by dismal global M A activities in the quarter  Further  a higher interest rate environment might have affected its mortgage banking business   
Expenses to Trend Higher  Expenses might trend upward in the upcoming release due to digitization and investments in technology  Further  management expects nominal growth in expenses this year Activities of M T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter increased slightly to  2 28  over the last seven days Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider  as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming reports

116337,337852,MTB,Wells Fargo Sees Municipal Business Ban In New York City,opinion,"Troubles for Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   seem unlikely to end anytime soon  Recently  the bank was banned by The New York City Banking Commission from underwriting new bonds in the U S  municipal bond market and renewing the existing contracts 
The reason behind the unanimous vote for cutting back ties with the bank is the Federal Community Reinvestment Act  CRA  rating of  needs improvement  that was assigned earlier this year due to its discriminating lending practices  Also  its fake accounts scandal triggered the decision 
Moreover  the commission plans to consider whether the bank will be permitted to hold government contracts again if the current rating improves  Also  they will vote to remove Wells Fargo from the role of senior book runner for the city s general obligation bond sales and for the New York City Transitional Finance Authority 
Nevertheless  Well Fargo is allowed to hold funds under existing contracts as it would be troublesome to end all the operations with the bank  Currently  it holds  227 million of collected city taxes and fees along with assets worth  2 6 million of the New York City Retiree Health Benefits Trust 
However  Wells Fargo s ranking among the banks underwriting municipal debts has fallen to seven  which is below its peers   The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   and Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS

116339,337854,MTB,Regional Banks On Verge Of Big Breakdown,opinion,"Last week  we noted that the US utility sector s improving performance suggests that the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise interest rates aggressively over the rest of the year  We said 

if we see a lukewarm NFP report on Friday  it would raise the chances of another  dovish hike   where the FOMC raises interest rates but strives to downplay expectations for future interest rate hikes this year  That scenario could result in continued strength in higher yield utility and REIT stocks  as well as underperformance in regional banks and the US dollar 

As our readers should know by now  Friday s jobs report was indeed tepid  showing that only 138k new jobs were created in May  well below expectations of a 180k gain  Today we look at another intermarket relationship  regional bank stock performance  to see if it confirms the  lower for longer  case for US interest rates 
While most mega banks make the majority of their profits through investment banking and trading activities  regional banks tend to be more straightforward  Their  bread and butter  business is borrowing and lending money  and their profits tend to fluctuate with the  net interest margin  or the difference between short term interest rates used for borrowing money  i e  through savings and checking accounts  and longer term interest rates used for lending money  i e  on business  car and home loans  
The chart below shows the recent performance of regional banking stocks  NYSE KRE  and the 10 year and 2 year yield spread  a proxy for the  net interest margin  

Source  Stockcharts com
As you can see  the 10 year 2 year yield spread  green  has more than reversed all of its gains since the US election  while regional banks have held up better  This divergence is unlikely to hold for long  In our view  either the yield curve will start steepening again  or regional banking stocks will drop sharply to  catch down  with the recent drop in interest rates 
The level to watch on KRE is crystal clear  the 51 00 floor has provided support for regional banks on three separate occasions in the last three months and the rising 200 day moving average comes in almost exactly at that same level  If the 51 00 level gives way  the selling pressure in regional banks is likely to accelerate  with KRE potentially dropping to the mid or lower 40s in a short period of time 
Of course  we re always willing to consider the alternative scenario  even if it is less likely in our view  If the Fed comes off as more hawkish in its meeting in a week s time  the yield curve could steepen once again and KRE could break out above its descending triangle pattern  In that case  the index could recover back to the upper 50s by the end of the summer

ExpensesGoldman s net revenue climbed 27  year over year to  8 0 billion in the quarter under review  However  revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 4 billion Quarterly revenues  as per business segments  are as follows The Institutional Client Services division recorded revenues of  3 4 billion  down 2  year over year  The fall reflected lower net revenues in commissions and fees  along with securities services  which resulted in the decline in Equities revenues  down 6   However  rise in Fixed Income  Currency and Commodities Client Execution revenues  up 1  year over year   driven by higher revenues from interest rate products and mortgage products  was mostly offset by reduced  revenues  in  commodities   and  currencies  and  credit  products The Investment Banking division generated revenues of  1 7 billion  up 16  year over year  Results displayed higher debt and equity underwriting revenues  indicating 37  year over year jump in total underwriting fees  However  lower financial advisory revenues  down 2   were recorded  affected by the decreased number of completed industry wide transactions during the quarter The Investment Management division recorded revenues of  1 5 billion  up 12  year over year  The growth was mainly driven by higher incentive and transaction fees  along with management and other fees The Investing and Lending division s revenues of  1 5 billion in the quarter were significantly higher on a year over year basis  The rise was aided by surge in revenues from investments in equities  as well as higher revenues in debt securities and loans Total operating expenses climbed 15  year over year to  5 5 billion  Expenses rose mainly due to increase in compensation and employee benefits expenses  up 24    Non compensation expenses were also up 5  due to elevated other expenses  resulting from increased provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings Strong Capital PositionGoldman exhibited a robust capital

market session  indicating that investors have been bearish on the results  The price reaction during the full trading session will give a fair idea about the extent of disappointment among investors

quarter  up 5 7  year over year  The increases in net interest income as well as non interest income were the tailwinds  Moreover  revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 29 billion U S  Bancorp s tax equivalent net interest income totaled  3 0 billion in the quarter  up 3 7  from the prior year quarter  The rise was mainly due to loan growth  partially offset by contraction in net interest margin Average earning assets climbed 5 6  year over year  supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities  along with elevated average cash balances  However  net interest margin of 3 03  was down 3 basis points year over year  and primarily reflected net impact of loan mix  reduced yields on new securities  elevated rates paid on deposits and a shift in interest bearing liabilities mix U S  Bancorp s non interest income jumped 8 4  on a year over year basis to  2 3 billion  The upsurge was primarily due to an increase in almost all components of non interest income Provision for credit losses increased 4 5  year over year to  345 million in the reported quarter U S  Bancorp s average total loans increased 4 1  year over year to  273 2 billion  The growth was driven by a rise in commercial loans  total commercial real estate  residential mortgages  total other retail and credit card loans  These increases were partially offset by a drop in covered loans  Excluding covered loans  average total loans rose 4 5  year over year Average total deposits were up 11 0  from the prior year quarter to  328 4 billion  The rise was stemmed by growth in non interest bearing deposits  savings deposits as well as interest bearing deposits Non interest expenses rose 7 1  year over year to  2 9 billion at U S  Bancorp  Elevated compensation  employee benefits  marketing and business development  and other expenses mainly played spoilsports  These were partially offset by lower professional services  along with net occupancy and equipment expenses

earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks  It was at the high end of the company s long term goal of returning 60 80  to its shareholders ConclusionU S  Bancorp posted an encouraging quarter  Along with higher revenues  a solid capital position and increased lending activities were the added advantages  The company follows a conservative growth stratagem and has made small but strategic acquisitions However  weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected the company s asset quality  Additionally  there are concerns related to the impact of legal

Consensus Estimate of  1 28 billion  Moreover  the reported figure was up 8  year over year On a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income of  362 4 million was up 15  year over year  This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin Net interest margin  NIM  was 1 35   up 14 basis points from the prior year quarter  The increase chiefly reflected higher short term interest rates and reduced premium amortization Non interest income rose 6  from the year ago quarter to  930 9 million  Rise in trust  investment and other servicing fees  along with rise in security commissions and trading income  and other operating income were the primary reasons for this increase  These positives were partially offset by reduced foreign exchange

116395,337910,MTB,What Spells Trouble Ahead For U S  Banks     ,opinion,"The market is no longer aggressively speculating the benefits of banks from a rising rate environment  as the Fed rate hike is likely to stay off the table for the remainder of 2016  If concerns over global economic growth and unsatisfactory domestic factors weren t enough  the Brexit storm added to the reasons for the already dovish Federal Reserve staying away from hiking rates any time soon  Quite naturally  it leaves little room for improvement in banks  net interest margins   the difference between deposit rates and lending rates          
This coupled with the other nagging factors   including exposure to the distressed energy sector  collapse of commodity prices  global economic threats and the latest Brexit fallout   will likely keep the prospects of U S  banks gloomy Though oil prices showed recovery in the past quarter  banks will have to set aside money to cover the potential loss from their energy debt until either the energy sector stabilizes or they reduce their energy exposure  And this could keep curbing their earnings Further  the earnings performance of U S  banks was not discouraging in the past few quarters  But this was mainly attributable to the temporary defensive measures that they adopted to tide over the legacy as well as new challenges 
Along with strong growth in loans  banks  proactive actions to move beyond defensive actions like cost containment to offset the pressure on interest income by enhancing alternative revenue sources have supported results for the last few quarters  Yet  these are not enough to encourage investors as evident by the lackluster performance of the bank stocks  This is because  burning issues like cybercrime and unconventional competition have piled up on existing concerns to keep the overall picture dreary 
Though recovering economic conditions and easier lending standards should continue to expedite loan growth  the benefits may not be realized any time soon  Added to these are the inconsistent performance by the key business segments and dismal top line growth  Banks are trying every means to contain costs  either by closing lackluster operations or by laying off personnel  Yet nonstop legal expenses plus higher spending on cyber security  analytics and alternative business opportunities are costing a pretty penny In an earlier piece     we provided arguments in favor of investing in the U S  banks  space  But here we would like to argue the opposite case Dealing with Future Losses Could Prove ToughU S  accounting rules allow banks to record a small part of their derivatives and not show most mortgage linked bonds  So there might be risky assets off their books  As a result  the capital buffers that U S  banks are forced to maintain might not be enough to fight the risks of a default Also  if the energy sector witnesses any further collapse  banks will have to build up more cash reserves to cover their losses from energy loans  This will have a significant impact on their earnings  On the other hand  prohibiting drillers from their loan portfolio could end up doing more damage  as it will reduce the chance of repayment of the money that they have already lent    Non Rate Sensitive Revenues Yet to Be DependableBanks  strategies to focus more on non interest revenue sources for strengthening their top line have not been smooth sailing  Opportunities for generating non interest revenues    from sources like charges on deposits  prepaid cards  new fees and higher minimum balance requirement on deposit accounts    will continue to be curbed by regulatory restrictions While the greater propensity to invest in alternative revenue sources on the back of an improved employment scenario might result in higher non interest revenues  grabbing good opportunities will require a higher overhead 
A Rate Hike in the Long Run Might Not Be a Big Help If the rates rise at all in the long run  banks will benefit only if the increase in long term rates is higher than the short term ones  This is because banks will have to pay less for deposits  typically tied to short term rates  than what they charge for loans  typically tied to long term rates   This opposite case will actually hurt net interest margin Banks will not have to compete for deposits and pay higher rates for some time  as they already have excess deposits that they gathered by capitalizing on the lack of low risk investment opportunities in a low rate environment  However  the excess deposits will dry up after some time  And if short term rates are higher than the long term ones  the interest outflow for maintaining the required deposits will be higher than the inflow of the same from loans On the other hand  credit quality    an important performance indicator for banks    should improve with the interest rate hike  But the prolonged low interest rate environment has forced banks to ease underwriting standards for long  This  in turn  has increased the chance of higher credit costs for quite some time Deteriorating Quality of Earnings Could Be Damaging   Banks have been delivering better than expected earnings for quite some time now  but the surprises have mostly been helped by conservative estimates  Promising low and then impressing the market with an earnings beat is the trend Also  the way of generating earnings seems a stopgap  Measures like forceful cost reduction and lowering provision may not last long as earnings drivers  Further  continued narrowing of the gap between loss provisions and charge offs will not allow banks to support the bottom line by lowering provision Unless the key business segments revitalize and generate revenues that could more than offset the usual growth in costs  bottom line growth will not be consistent Stocks to Dump NowThere are a number of reasons to worry about the industry s performance in the short to medium term  So it would be prudent to get rid of or stay away from some weak bank stocks for now  Stocks carrying an unfavorable Zacks Rank are particularly expected to underperform We suggest dumping BankUnited  BKU   M T Bank Corporation  NYSE MTB   MTB   KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   KEY  and Webster Financial Corporation  WBS  as they carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  We also suggest to stay away from stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  including Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp  BK   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC    Co  WFC   Westamerica Bancorporation  WABC  and BofI Holding  Inc   BOFI     Check out our latest  for a more detailed discussion on the fundamental trends  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-spells-trouble-ahead-for-u.s.-banks-200145137,200145137

Nevertheless  market sentiments lifted as some of the major banking giants beat earnings expectations in the second quarter  signaling a potentially better picture for the industry as a whole this season Per our latest  article  overall earnings for the Finance sector in second quarter 2016 are expected to be down 3 3  year over year  Also  revenues are expected to be down 0 5   Notably  during the first quarter the sector reflected a 6 9  decline in earnings while revenues improved 3 3  With most of the companies set to release results  let s have a look at what s in store for the following firms  releasing results on Jul 20  before the opening bell M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB    Results of the Buffalo  N Y  based banking giant should reflect growth in net interest income driven by loan growth including the favorable impact from the Hudson City merger  Also  non interest income should get a boost owing to seasonally higher mortgage banking revenues We expect M T Bank to beat earnings expectations as our proven model shows that the company has the right combination two key components   Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and  of  0 48    Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 08 for the quarter was revised upwards 0 4  over the last 7 days Notably  the earnings surprise history for M T Bank has been decent M T BANK CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Northern Trust Corporation   NASDAQ NTRS     The company derives a significant part of its revenues from trust  investment and other servicing fees  These fees are highly dependent on the market value of clients  assets under custody  which  in turn  is directly linked to the performance of equity markets  Notably  Northern Trust s calculation of these fees considers a lag effect  i e   the computations are based on prior quarter end valuations  As the first quarter 2016 experienced weak equity markets  the company is not likely to record higher custody  servicing and management fees 
However  the company s revenues should get a lift from higher foreign exchange trading revenues due to increase in volatility in the second quarter on a sequential basis   Read more   Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company remained stable at  1 05 per share for the upcoming release  Further  the company has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  with an Earnings ESP of  0 95   making it difficult to conclusively predict an earnings beat this quarter

The Markets

Stocks traded on either side of the flatline on Tuesday as investors awaited the State of the Union Address  delivered on Tuesday evening  Investors often scrutinize the speech for any potential influences on equity market sectors for the year ahead  The equity market has generally reacted positively in the session following this event 
Since 1966  the S P 500 Index has gained in 58  of sessions that have followed  averaging a slight gain of 0 09   The average gain and frequency of success grows looking 7 and 30 days following the event  The large cap index has gained around 64  of the time 7 and 30 days following the address  averaging a return of 0 30  and 1 33   respectively  However  this is a pre election year  and  as we ve stated in the past  the President strives to be accommodative and business friendly during these periods as he seeks re election of either himself or his party 
Gains for the equity market during pre election years are typically more than double that of an average year  As a result of this business friendly approach  the average gain following the State of the Union Address tends to be significantly more than average years  The S P 500 has gained in 10 of the past 12 sessions following the State of the Union Address during pre election years  averaging a gain of 0 53   Looking out 7 and 30 days during pre election years has yielded gains in 75  of the periods  averaging returns of 0 80  and 3 27   respectively The three pre election years that didn t record a gain 7 or 30 days out  1979  1999  and 2003  still recorded gains for the entire year averaging 19   inline with the historical average for pre election years  The third year in the presidential election cycle can hold significant potential for equity markets  assuming negative catalysts don t interrupt the positive influence 







While activity in the equity market remained rather stagnant on Tuesday  the currency market continued to chart significant moves  particularly the Canadian Dollar  which ended at a new five and a half year low  Since July of last year  the Canadian currency has made a parabolic move lower  following the price of oil  the dollar is now the most oversold since January of last year  just ahead of a basing pattern that brought upon higher levels into the summer  This end of January low in the Canadian dollar is seasonally typical  the currency tends to strengthen in the spring  once again following the price of oil  The seasonal low in the Canadian Dollar  which occurs on January 29th  on average  may be near given the oversold nature of the currency  The trend remains firmly negative  as characterized by lower highs and lower lows  over a short  intermediate  and long term scale  Investors should be on the lookout for a bottoming pattern that will support the seasonal trade into the spring months 





Sentiment on Tuesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 80

Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil continues to the upside  The US Dollar Index looks to improve while US Treasuries continue to consolidate  The Shanghai Composite is also in consolidation mode but with a downward bias while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside in the short term 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts also suggest more upside  and are stronger looking on the weekly timeframe  with rising pennants on the daily timeframe giving minor caution of a short term pullback or consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

116450,337965,MTB,Stress Test Results  31 Banks Rejoice  2 Fail To Clear,opinion,Following the release of the Dodd Frank Act supervisory stress test 2016  DFAST 2016  results last week  the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 30 financial institutions out of 33 in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  CCAR   However  the capital plans of two of the remaining three have been rejected based on certain qualitative concerns  while the third plan received conditional consent on resubmission by Dec 29 The Fed s nod to most of the major U S  banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent  All the bank holding companies  BHCs  with  50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are part of DFAST 2016  Notably  33 BHCs that submitted their capital plans to the Fed in Apr 2016 account for approximately 80  of the total banking assets in the country The banks now have the privilege to increase dividends and buy back shares  Amid concerns that banks might not have sufficient capital to counter another financial crisis  the financial institutions were asked to submit their capital plans to the Fed  The banks were further intimated that payment of higher dividends will be restricted if they fail to meet the requirement of 4 5  Common Equity Tier 1  CET1  capital ratio  among other requirements Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd Frank financial services law  the stress tests were first introduced after the 2008 financial crisis  During the economic downturn  big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed while several others were on the verge of a meltdown  Such a situation compelled the U S  government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009  The environment of the last 6 rounds of stress tests along with the latest one is different from the first round  Conducted when the country was reeling under tremendous recessionary pressure  the first test was aimed at estimating how much the banks would lose if the economic downturn proved deeper than expected  Since then  the stress test rounds are precautionary measures amid an economic recovery The Federal Reserve s latest stress test scenario projections include input data supplied by the 33 banks participating in DFAST 2016 and models created by the regulatory staff and evaluated by a group of Fed economists and analysts  These models were developed with the intention to inculcate the impact of the macroeconomic and financial market factors that are included in the Supervisory Stress Scenario and distinctive factors of the banks  loans and securities portfolios  trading as well as other factors affecting losses  revenue and expenses Moreover  the Fed s stress test was conducted to find out whether the banks have enough capital to survive another financial crisis under the severely adverse scenario that assumed a decline of about 50  in equity prices  unemployment rate at a peak of 10  and a sharp fall in gross domestic product Last year  the 31 banks that participated passed the stress test  However  this time the capital levels of banks exhibited improvement despite tougher conditions  This year s severely adverse scenario also featured a path of negative interest rates Despite this  the declines in the four capital ratios projected by the Fed were less acute  The projections ranged from 2 6 percentage points to 3 9 percentage points compared with last year s range of declines from 2 9 percentage points to 5 2 Under the most severe scenario  the 33 banks would suffer  385 billion in loan losses over nine quarters  Also   113 billion in trading losses were included in the overall losses of  526 billion projected for the 33 BHCs in the aggregate over the nine quarters In aggregate  Common Equity Tier 1  CET1  capital ratio would fall from an actual 12 3  in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a post stress level of 8 4  in the first quarter of 2018  However  that is well above the 4 5  minimum set by regulators  Moreover  the Fed indicated that the 33 banks  common equity has been increased by more than  700 billion since 2009 which raised the ratio of high quality capital to risk weighted assets to 12 2  in the first quarter of 2016 from 5 5  in the first quarter of 2009 Banks that AcedWells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    Citigroup Inc    NYSE C    Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK    U S

that have received clearance from the Fed to raise their dividends or repurchase shares Among other banks  M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB   submitted an adjusted capital plan last week  which also got approved Further  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   received contingent approval on submission of its revised capital plan by Dec 29  as certain loopholes in its capital planning processes were addressed by the Fed  However  Morgan Stanley is allowed to carry on with its share buyback and dividend increase plans for the time being Banks that FailedAmong the 33 BHCs which submitted their capital plan to the Fed in Apr 2016  the plans of the U S  units of Germany based Deutsche Bank AG  DE DBKGn   DB  and Spain s Banco Santander  S A   MC SAN  have been rejected by the Fed based on certain  qualitative  reasons for the second consecutive year  The Fed believes that these banks have certain drawbacks in their capital planning processes and lack progress since Mar 2015 Recovery on the WayThis  however  is not the end  Major banks will have to undergo the Fed s stress test once every year  These would help increase the weak capital levels of banks  which are a looming threat to the economy  Also  these could eventually translate into lesser involvement of the taxpayers  money for bailing out troubled financial institutions However  the government must necessarily frame certain policies so that every industry participant contributes to the overall profitability  While the bigger banks have benefited greatly from the various programs launched by the government  many smaller banks are trying to catch up Though economic uncertainty is a prevailing factor  banks are actively responding to every legal and regulatory pressure  In fact  this has positioned the banks well to encounter impending challenges  As the sector is undergoing a radical structural change  it is expected to witness headwinds in the near to mid term  However  entering the new capital regime will significantly improve the industry s long term stability and security Nevertheless  the approval from the Federal Reserve to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments going forward Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days

116468,337983,MTB,An ETF To Play A 1Q Rally,opinion,Until yesterday  the stock market had lost its year end traction  and it is exclusively due to the unresolved Federal budget and the looming Fiscal Cliff and debt ceiling  Optimism among investors that something will certainly get done had fallen victim to political theater and the reality that our elected officials view compromise as a sure path to losing their next election  Nevertheless  investors have flashed signals that they are ready to rally in the event of any sort of Federal budget deal  And as I write this on New Year s Eve  a deal appears to be close at hand  nothing like taking it to the very last minute   and in response the major averages have either held or recaptured their psychological thresholds  Dow above 13 000  S P 500 above 1400  Nasdaq above 3000 and Russell 2000 above 800   Investors might be interested in an ETF with solid fundamentals that appears poised to perform among the best in a bullish environment  With a perfect Sabrient Outlook Score of 100 and a strong Bull Score  the SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  KRE  fits the bill   Sabrient s SectorCast model creates relative rankings of sectors and industries based on the bottom up aggregation of key scores for the constituent stocks  Our proprietary Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor model that considers forward valuation  return ratios  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analyst estimates  the quality of reported earnings  and the aggressiveness of accounting practices  In addition  our Bull and Bear Scores identify how a given equity is expected to perform in a bullish or bearish market   The Outlook score is forward looking based largely on the dynamics of Wall Street analyst sentiment  whereas Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent investor sentiment  As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for anticipated market conditions   KRE has a low forward P E  strong return on sales  and steady support among Wall Street analysts  Financial stocks tend to lead during bull markets  and with the Fed having vowed to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future  regional banks in particular are well positioned to reap the benefits of expanded lending to small businesses and real estate investors  The more well known Financial sector ETFs like IYF and XLF are held back in our rankings by their heavy weightings in the mega cap banks  But KRE is categorized by Morningstar in the  small cap value  style box and contains none of the big banks  which should help it to flourish in a bullish climate   The largest holdings in KRE include CapitalSource Inc  CSE   Popular Inc  BPOP   M T Bank  MTB   Signature Bank New York  SBNY   and First Republic Bank  FRC   most of which carry Buy ratings from Sabrient   However  stay vigilant  If the U S  economy were to go south  perhaps due to continued intransigence in the Federal budget negotiations or renewed distress in the eurozone  KRE s relatively low Bear score makes it more likely to underperform in a weak market  especially if we see a stalled housing recovery and resurgence in failures among regional banks ,2013-01-01,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-etf-to-play-a-1q-rally-149224,149224

116475,337990,MTB,4 Banks Set To Beat Earnings Despite Industry Challenges,opinion,"U S  banks  forming a broader part of the financial sector  have always drawn substantial attention from investors during the earnings season  The industry backdrop for banks remained tough in the first three quarters of 2014 and the fourth quarter was even tougher 
Results from the mega players reflect lackluster mortgage banking and client activities  soft trading volumes  restructuring expenses and elevated legal costs  Also  weak energy lending owing to the drastic fall in oil price was a major headwind  Further  stringent regulations continue to affect banks  investment activities and lead to higher compliance costs  As falling net interest income is expected to be more than offset by a marginal rise in fee and other income  overall revenue growth will remain modest  On the other hand  growth in interest income will likely remain muted owing to sluggish loan demand and persistent pressure on net interest margins from a still low rate environment  Also  any improvement in non interest revenues is anticipated to face adverse impact from declining mortgage banking income and continued slowdown in fixed income and currencies and commodities   FICC   income  However  investment banking should support fee income to some extent  driven by continued strength in M A and IPO activities  Additionally  expense control initiatives as well as stable balance sheets will serve as catalysts for growth  Also  favorable equity market and gradually improving macroeconomic factors  falling unemployment rates  rising GDP growth rate and stabilizing housing markets  are expected to act as tailwinds  Nevertheless  Major Banks seem to have suffered the most during the quarter with an expected year over year earnings decline of 13 7   However  Banks   Thrifts seem to have performed relatively better and are expected to witness earnings growth of 10 2   Though the overall banking scenario appears bleak  it is possible to turn the odds in your favor  Selecting a few banking stocks with a huge short term growth potential is expected to yield a solid return  We have picked a handful of stocks that will likely beat earnings estimates in their upcoming release  An earnings beat should raise investors  confidence in these stocks  leading to rapid price appreciation
