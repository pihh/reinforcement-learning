14987,236502,WM,Slave to sachets  How poverty worsens the plastics crisis in the Philippines,news,"By Karen Lema MANILA  Reuters    Armed with gloves  rubber boots and a rake   Mangrove Warrior  Willer Gualva  68  comes to Freedom Island in the Philippines almost every day to stop it being engulfed by trash   No one lives on the island  yet each morning its shores are covered in garbage  much of it single use sachets of shampoo  toothpaste  detergent and coffee that are carried out to sea by the rivers of overcrowded Manila    We collect mostly plastics here and the number one type are sachets   said Gualva  one of 17 people employed by the environment agency to help preserve the island and its forest  The agency  the Department of Environment and Natural Resources  DENR   calls them  Mangrove Warriors   and pays them slightly above  8 per day  Five days of coastal cleanup on the Manila Bay island last month yielded a total of 16 000 kg of trash  DENR data showed  the bulk of it plastics  including the sachets made of aluminum and blends of plastics  These packets give some of the poorest people in Asia access to everyday household essentials  For the multinationals that manufacture them  it s a way to increase sales by targeting customers who cannot afford bigger quantities  Such sachets are sold in most developing countries but the number consumed in the Philippines is staggering   163 million pieces a day  according to a recent study by environment group The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives  GAIA    That s almost 60 billion sachets a year  or enough to cover 130 000 soccer fields   In Manila s slum areas which are inaccessible to garbage trucks  sachets and other waste are thrown in estuaries or dumped on the street  and end up clogging drains and waterways   Money is hard to come by  so I only buy sachets   said Lisa Jorillo  42  a mother of four who lives in a slum in Manila s Tondo area  behind a beach blanketed by trash   It s likely the garbage will still be there when my son grows up   Jorillo said  referring to her four year old   The Philippines  law on solid waste is poorly enforced and the country doesn t regulate packaging manufacturing  The country is ranked third in the world for failing to deal with its plastics  according to a 2015 study by the University of Georgia  which said 81 percent of plastics waste in the country was mismanaged  GRAPHIC  When plastic is not fantastic    SACHETS FOR THE POOR About 14 million people live in Metro Manila  one of Asia s teeming mega cities  Overall  the Philippines has a population of 107 million people  and one fifth of them live below the national poverty line  described by the statistics agency as monthly consumption of less than  241 per person   Jorillo s family earns about 2 500 pesos   48  a week from the construction work that her husband does  and she and her family buy about 80 sachets of coffee  toothpaste and shampoo each month  In sea facing Manila  much of the trash ends up in the sea  The Philippines  Indonesia  Thailand  Vietnam and China account for 60 percent of the world s marine plastic  or 8 million tonnes annually  according to the Ocean Conservancy non profit  Environmentalists say the main culprits aren t governments or consumers  but the multinationals that churn out plastic packaging   They have money to do research that will remove the problematic packaging   said Sonia Mendoza  head of the Mother Earth Foundation  which promotes waste reduction  She said refilling stations could be one way to reduce the use of single use sachets  The environmental group GAIA studied non recyclable waste collected in Philippine cleanups and found that 60 percent of it came from just 10 companies  led by Nestle  S NESN    Unilever   L ULVR  and Procter   Gamble  N PG   Nestle declined to disclose the volume of sachets it produced or sold in the Philippines   FIGHTING MALNUTRITION Nestle said it was committed to finding ways to keep plastics out of oceans through plastic collection and recycling programs  but added that sachets prevented leakage of micro nutrients essential to addressing malnutrition  especially among children   Unilever did not say how many sachets it produces in the Philippines  but said its global plastic packaging production is 610 000 tonnes annually   The figure  Unilever said  includes  flexible packaging formats  used by 1 million micro businesses in the Philippines  Nestle and Unilever s target is for 100  of their packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025 worldwide   Unilever said it has a community based sachet recovery program in the Philippines where collected sachets are converted to school chairs and cement pavers  It also pilot ran shampoo and conditioner refilling stations this year  which it plans to scale up   P G referred questions to the industry group Philippine Alliance for Recycling and Materials Sustainability  PARMS  or the government s National Solid Waste Management  NYSE WM  Commission  NSWMC   The Philippines government does not have a clear strategy to tackle its plastics crisis  In an e mail response to Reuters  the DENR said it was in discussions with all manufacturers to identify ways to manage waste  It provided no details   Elsewhere in the region  Indonesia has a law requiring producers to manage non biodegradable packaging and the tourist island of Bali bans single use plastics  Thailand is between now and 2025 introducing bans on seven types of plastics most commonly found in the ocean  like bottle cap seals  disposable bags  cups and straws  Vietnam hopes to raise taxes on plastic bags and its prime minister has urged shops to stop using non recyclable plastics in cities by 2021  and countrywide by 2025   ECO BRICKS The Philippines industry group PARMS  which includes Unilever  P G and Nestle among its members  is building a 25 million pesos   475 000  facility that aims to turn sachets into plastic blocks and eco bricks   But Von Hernandez  global coordinator for the Break Free From Plastic movement  calls that  greenwashing    or only trying to appear more environmentally friendly   They are not really changing the true nature of their business   Hernandez said of the multinationals   The plastics industry is slated to grow exponentially  especially by 2030  The bulk of that is going to packaging and you can bet this is going to end up in sachets   Crispian Lao  president of PARMS  said every effort  even those which  may be perceived as small and insignificant   helps address the problem  Lao said sachets were a necessity for lower income groups  but added the industry is exploring other delivery formats and packaging alternatives   Cynthia Villar  a senator  says she is pushing for a radical re write of an existing waste law to force firms to collect  recycle and dispose of all single use plastics they produce   
 They always say they re willing to do it  But it s a different story altogether whether they ll do it  so we have to embody it in a law so they ll all follow   Villar told Reuters ",2019-09-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/slave-to-sachets-how-poverty-worsens-the-plastics-crisis-in-the-philippines-1968654,1968654
14988,236503,WM,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Waste Management  WM ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Waste Management  NYSE WM   which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This garbage and recycling hauler has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 16  
For the last reported quarter  Waste Management came out with earnings of  1 19 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 16 per share  representing a surprise of 2 59   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 11 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 74  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Waste Management  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Waste Management currently has an Earnings ESP of  9 17   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-waste-management-wm-200499414,200499414

142808,364323,WM,September Not As Tough As Feared ,opinion,"Even with all the ups and downs over the past several weeks  including trade shenanigans  inverting yield curves and now impeachment   the major indices were still in the green for September and mostly positive for the third quarter  
	Remember how we were all nervous heading into this month because of its reputation for being rough on stocks  
	Well  it certainly wasn t an easy month for anybody  but the Dow still managed to gain nearly 2  in September  Meanwhile  the S P was up about 1 7  and the NASDAQ improved around 0 5   
	Except for the NASDAQ  which plunged 2 7  last month   September s results pretty much offset August s drop and helped the indices to respectable results for the whole third quarter  
	The Dow and S P each climbed more than 1 2  in the quarter  while the NASDAQ was off only 0 01  despite all of its challenges  
	The month and the quarter finished up on Monday with a nice rally as Friday s fears of the U S  delisting Chinese companies was walked back by the White House  
	The NASDAQ came bouncing back with a rise of 0 75   or nearly 60 points  to 7999 34  The S P was up 0 50  to 2976 74 and the Dow increased 0 36   or nearly 100 points  to 26 916 83 
	Now we head toward the fourth quarter  If that sends a chill down your spine  you re not alone  Last year s fourth quarter was horrible  especially that Christmas Eve session  
	The editors aren t expecting a replay in 2019  The fortunes for this new quarter will probably rest on a couple of big events coming in the next few weeks  
	We ve got the big trade talks between the U S  and China in less than two weeks  Investors are skeptical that a deal will be reached  but this headline obsessed market could still get enough good news to help stocks move higher and perhaps reach new highs  
	And earnings season will begin at about the same time  Investors will get to see just how much trade and slowing global growth are impacting U S  companies  
	Most likely these events will have a much greater impact than any ghosts of fourth quarters past  Today s Portfolio Highlights   Blockchain Innovators  The portfolio added two very different picks on Monday  Chipmaker NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  is a rather obvious choice  especially since a new generation of GPUs will be a big catalyst for the future and help leave more recent problems behind  The other buy may not be as obvious  Waste Management  NYSE WM  is a garbage disposal business  but it s exploring blockchain solutions to create more efficiency for its garbage truck fleet  Read the complete commentary for more on today s moves Zacks Top 10 Stocks  The new update is live and it includes a change  Sheraz got out of the struggling Vocera  VCRA  pick and replaced it by adding AptarGroup  ATR   The new buy is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative dispensing systems for the beauty  personal care  home care  prescription drug  consumer health care  injectables  food and beverage markets  Read the full write up for a lot more  Black Box Trader  It s a busy week for the portfolio as it swaps out seven names  The stocks leaving the portfolio are

142811,364326,WM,Waste Management  WM  Reports Next Week  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when Waste Management  NYSE WM  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  4 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management 
For Waste Management  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  3 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Waste Management doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waste-management-wm-reports-next-week-what-to-know-ahead-of-the-release-200474087,200474087

142859,364374,WM,2 Safe And Stable Dividend Stocks To Help Retirees Ride Out Market Volatility,opinion,"One thing that future or current retirees hate is too much volatility in their portfolios  The key is to achieve a collection of stocks that provide smooth sailing  slow and gradual capital appreciation  and a regular income stream to help cover expenses in the golden years 
So  investors just starting out on their saving journey and keen to build up a nest egg should certainly consider some high quality dividend stocks to add to their portfolios  Companies with good managements  strong balance sheets  and dominant market positions are the best bets in this trade 
The following two dividend stocks have proved to be solid income generators for retirees  they belong to the group of equities that are able to perform well in times of economic turmoil as well as in times of stability 
1  Merck
The reason we love Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK  for a retirement portfolio is the healthcare giant s defensive nature and its growing dividend  Just like retailers  utilities  and telecom companies  health providers offer services that we can t afford to put off in a recession and economic swings don t typically curb the roll out of new drugs and devices 
The shares have gained almost 37  in the past 12 months  and closed up 0 2  at  81 17 on Friday 

Merck  a global healthcare provider  has had many successes in introducing blockbuster drugs  Its cancer treating Keytruda is the latest addition to its pipeline with sales growing rapidly  Recent trial results have made it a clear leader in lung cancer treatment and analysts expect it will bring close to  12 billion in sales by 2022 
The company also has many other older drugs that continue to provide a solid stream of cash  especially its vaccine segment that includes immunizations for measles  mumps and rubella  For a drug producer  spending on its R D is a matter of life and death  In October  the drugmaker said it plans to invest  16 billion in new capital projects through 2022  a 33  jump over the previous year 
With strong earnings momentum  a large R D budget and a growing dividend and buybacks  we believe Merck is a good long term bet  Last year  Merck boosted its dividend by 15  to  2 2 a share annually  That translates into an annual dividend yield of 2 7  
2  Waste Management
We create a lot of trash each day and someone has to take care of that trash  no matter if there is a recession or boom  The California based Waste Management Inc  NYSE WM  is well positioned to convert our trash into cash for its long term investors  The shares have risen 33  in the past 12 months  and closed Friday s session at  108 43 

The company manages the largest network of landfills  transfer stations  and recycling facilities in both the U S  and Canada  Its massive moat and huge cash generation mean a steady flow of income for retirees for years to come 
Last month  WM announced it will buy competitor Advanced Disposal Services Inc  NYSE ADSW  for around  2 9 billion  which the Wall Street Journal describes as one of the biggest solid waste company acquisitions in more than a decade  The deal brings together the largest and the fourth largest companies in the sector  further consolidating Waste Management s competitive advantage in the industry 
WM stock has proved to be a solid investment for long term investors  Over the past decade  the company has more than doubled its annual distribution to shareholders  Today  WM stock pays a  2 05 dividend per share annually  translating into a 1 87  annual dividend yield 
If the dividend had been re invested  investors made about 150  in total returns in the past five years  massively outperforming the S P 500 s approximately 50  gains  It s hard to predict if WM will continue to provide a similar payback  but its leading position in the industry suggests that it s a relatively safe bet for long term investors 
Bottom Line
Dividend stocks  such as Merck and WM  are safe bets if you want to build a portfolio that could provide you with a steady passive income in your retirement years  These stocks have the ability to outperform the broader market even when it s in a deep correction  or during periods of economic recession  Diversifying your portfolio with defensive stocks that pay regularly growing dividends is always a good strategy for retirees ",2019-05-27,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-safe-stocks-retirees-should-consider-to-buy-this-summer-200425306,200425306

This garbage and recycling hauler has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 45  
For the most recent quarter  Waste Management was expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share  but it reported  0 94 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 07 per share  while it actually produced  1 13 per share  a surprise of 5 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Waste Management  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Waste Management currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 70   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-waste-management-wm-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200442661,200442661

142897,364412,WM,Waste Management  WM  Q1 Earnings Preview  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when Waste Management  NYSE WM  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  3 67 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management 
For Waste Management  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 83  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 13  delivering a surprise of  5 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Waste Management doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waste-management-wm-q1-earnings-preview-whats-in-the-cards-200408504,200408504

142987,364502,WM,Waste Management  WM  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Waste Management  NYSE WM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 79 billion  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management 
For Waste Management  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of  1 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Waste Management doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waste-management-wm-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200385044,200385044

both earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017 supported by effective cost management Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are performing well  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline including biosimilar drugs  Additionally  the Zacks analyst thinks Amgen s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient However  the company has some challenges in store  given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature drugs  While Neupogen is already facing U S  biosimilar competition  Neulasta and Epogen could start facing the same next year Also the softness in Enbrel sales due to stiff competitive and pricing pressure is a key cause for concern  Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  You can   Shares of Comcast have lost  8 2  over the last three months  during which the Zacks Cable Television industry has declined  10 4   Comcast posted mixed third quarter 2017 financial results  Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand  with plans to include YouTube in its X1

the consensus mark Meanwhile  Q3 marked the ninth consecutive quarter of global comps growth and third consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth for McDonald s  The Zacks analyst likes the fact that McDonald s is trying to reinforce its position worldwide via various sales and digital initiatives  Also  increased focus on refranchising is expected to reduce its capital requirements  thereby facilitating EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run Yet higher costs along with currency headwinds may hurt profits  Also  a soft industry backdrop in the United States and macroeconomic concerns in some parts of the world might limit sales growth  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Waste Management and BB T Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks

143063,364578,WM,Regeneron  Nuance Communications  Waste Management  Waste Connections And Republic Services Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 17  2017   Regeneron  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Nuance Communications  NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Waste Management Inc  NYSE WM    NYSE         Waste Connections Inc   NYSE        and Republic Services Inc  NYSE RSG    NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Regeneron   NASDAQ       is a  48 billion biotechnology company based in Tarrytown  New York that develops drug therapies for a range of diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  asthma  pain  cancer and infectious diseases 
	The company is probably best known for Eylea  its treatment for wet age related macular degeneration  Since launching in 2011  Eylea surpassed  5 billion in global sales in 2016 as the drug continues to expand into additional therapeutic indications The Regeneron Story
	REGN was a sub  50 stock for most of its two decades as a public company until the launch of Eylea grabbed Wall Street s attention  They now boast 5 550 employees of which 730 possess an MD  PhD or PharmD degree 
	Regeneron utilizes its discovery platform to create fully human monoclonal antibodies and their nearly 3 decades of science R D has resulted in five FDA approved medicines and numerous product candidates  including 15 antibodies currently in clinical trials across multiple therapeutic areas 
	REGN s platform technologies include Targeted GenomicsTM  FunctionomicsTM  and Designer Protein TherapeuticsTM  Regeneron has drugs in clinical and preclinical development for the potential treatment of obesity  rheumatoid arthritis  cancer  allergies  asthma  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  constipating conditions  ischemia  and other diseases and disorders 
	Regeneron s platform VelociSuite technology has helped generate a broad array of promising human monoclonal antibodies  including the recently launched Praluent and Dupixent  and yields one of biotech s most full pipelines Why the Vault from  366 to  454 
	The company delivered their quarterly report on May 4 and despite an earnings miss  the outlook for sales of their recently approved and launched dermatitis drug Dupixent sent Wall Street analysts and investors scrambling to raise estimates and buy more shares 
	The Zacks EPS consensus for this year moved up from  10 16 to  10 52  representing 27  growth  And full year 2018 estimates jumped from  10 90 to  12 10 for 15  growth 
	Revenues are expected to hit  5 45 billion this year and  6 22 billion next year  for 12  and 14  sales growth respectively 
	But it s the early prescription data for Dupixent that has investors really excited  I bought shares of REGN on April 27 for my new  portfolio  inspired by what I thought was an irresistible dip to  360  Here s what I told my subscribers on Friday May 12   
	Once again  another week where REGN needs no explaining as the stock poked its nose over  450 at one point today  generating an open gain over 23   Our timing was very fortuitous as we caught a great asset near the bottom of expectations and the height of uncertainty  Now she s firing on all cylinders as sales ramp up for Dupixent as a first line systemic treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD  patients 
	The drug was launched at a WAC  wholesale acquisition cost  price of  37 000 annually and based on recent commentary from management and partner Sanofi  PA SASY   analysts believe that market access for the drug is progressing well  with coverage for several major payers PBMs secured  More than 1 800 healthcare providers have already written more than 3 500 prescriptions thus far 
	Since that is only about 25  of physicians targeted  second quarter prescriptions are expected to hit 6 500 with about 4 000 patients on the drug  If we multiply 4K X  37K we get  148 million for the year  divided by 4 for the quarter would equate to roughly  37 million in revenue  But these rough projections are based on the full price of  37K  Obviously  there will be discounts  etc 

  

Nuance Communications   NASDAQ       has been Bear of the Day many times in the past few years  I know because I wrote several of those reports from 2013 through 2015 when it seemed like shares could never get very far from  15 
	And despite its intriguing Dragon voice technology and notable ownership over the years by smart hedge fund titans like Carl Icahn  the single dynamic that continues to make NUAN a Zacks  5 Rank keeps cropping up  or rather  down 
	I m talking about earnings estimates of course  While 2016 looked promising as estimates headed back up over  1 for full year EPS  May of 2017 has brought an end to that party for the  5 5 billion NUAN 
	In the past week  the Zacks EPS consensus for the fiscal year ending in September has dropped from  1 06 to  0 78 
	And analyst moves for fiscal year 2018 have seen the consensus profit projection also fall about 27  from  1 13 to  0 82 

Drifting Sales  Sailing Whales
	The sales picture tells part of the story as revenues appear to flat line near  2 billion annually 
	This year s haul is expected to be  2 04 billion  only a 4  increase over last year  And next year s  2 11 billion top line will only represent 3 66  growth 
	Plus  these sales estimates may fall further too if analysts have not updated us yet fully on that component 
	And one investor who is not waiting around to find out anymore is Carl Icahn  In SEC quarterly filings this week it was revealed that he has now given up and liquidated his stake  In short  this investment  whale  has turned tail and sailed away 
	With  2 billion in annual sales  it s hard to say that this is a company you should give up on  But with a forward P E ratio near 25X and the  E  once again falling faster than the  P   it s probably best to stay on the sidelines at this time with NUAN 
	The Zacks Rank will let you know when the Dragon is safe again

3 Waste Removal Stocks in Focus as Clean Power Plan Pauses

	As the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a freeze on the ongoing litigation over the Clean Power Plan for 60 days  waste removal stocks largely gained prominence  Critics allege that the  stay order  on the court proceedings will likely help President Trump to either revise the plan or undo it completely 
	The Clean Power Plan was introduced in Aug 2015 by former President Obama to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity by 32  through 2030 compared to 2005 levels  It was estimated that power plants accounted for nearly 40  of the harmful carbon dioxide emissions in the U S  and a significant reduction in this pollutant was necessary to improve the quality of air 

	The law encouraged higher investments in renewable energy  natural gas and nuclear power to shift from coal fired power  However  the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the plan in Feb 2016  pending judicial review by a federal appeals court 
	With Obama s environmental policies taking a backseat and Trump s pro growth agenda with regulatory rollbacks gaining cynosure  waste removal stocks have been in the spotlight  Let s have an overview of three such stocks in the industry that are likely to gain in the near term Waste Management Inc   NYSE        Headquartered in Houston  TX  Waste Management is the largest provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America  The company provides collection  transfer  recycling and resource recovery  as well as disposal services to nearly 20 million residential  commercial  industrial and municipal customers  It is also a leading developer  operator and owner of waste to energy and landfill gas to energy facilities in the U S

	Waste Connections has a healthy long term growth expectation of 15 8   The stock has a VGM Score of  B  and a Zacks Rank  2 Republic Services Inc   NYSE        This Zacks Rank  2 stock is the second largest domestic non hazardous solid waste company in the U S  It provides non hazardous solid waste disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential applications across the country and Puerto Rico

143099,364614,WM,Getting It Wrong On Recycling ,opinion,"Let s see what those disparaging America s rate of recycling as  too high  either get completely wrong or fail to understand  You can read recent commentary suggesting that the recycling rate is too high    and  
The number one complaint is that it costs more to recycle some categories of waste than to put them into a landfill  What the critics fail to comprehend is that unlike a couple of generations ago when most landfills were owned and run by local governments  today most are run by profit making enterprises such as Waste Management Inc  N WM   and Republic Services Inc  N RSG   which haul some 80 percent of the nation s refuse  Those enterprises developed their large centralized landfills for the purpose of keeping down their disposal costs 
Since the private waste disposal industry has organized its infrastructure around cheap landfill disposal  it s no wonder that landfilling seems like the most cost effective option  It follows that if we Americans had built a waste infrastructure with the goal of zero waste as Germany did  our infrastructure would naturally have delivered lower costs for recycling than it does 
The Germans landfill about 1 percent of their waste compared to America s 68 percent  Germans recycle about 70 percent of their waste and burn almost all the rest to produce energy  Americans recycle about 25 percent of their waste and burn about 7 percent 
Consider this analogy  You can make your house energy efficient in two ways  You can build it to be energy efficient in the first place  Or  you can add energy efficient features later on  Which do you think would be more cost effective 
That s what we ve been facing with the boom in recycling  We are retrofitting a system designed for cheap landfilling rather than building a system designed for cheap recycling  which ought to be our goal  
But we must also consider that the narrowly defined cost of landfilling waste does not take into account the long term costs of monitoring and mitigating damage to soil and water from closed landfills far into the future  Private landfill operators are responsible for what happens for the first 30 years  After that  taxpayers pick up the bill  But only if officials decide to  Otherwise  the cost to human and animal health and the loss of value for properties affected is simply absorbed by those unlucky enough to live or work near a closed landfill 
Now  this is important  Current landfill technology which lines waste pits will not keep pollutants from leaking out forever  In the long run  whatever goes into landfills will eventually seep out with rainwater or sink into the soil below once the lining deteriorates 
Finally  landfills are a source of methane  a potent greenhouse gas  produced by rotting organic matter in the waste  Some of that methane is being captured and burned as fuel  But some of it is released into the atmosphere where it is driving climate change 
When we say that landfilling is cheaper  what we really mean is that landfilling is cheaper for us  not for those who come after us who will have to clean up the mess that keeps on giving 
The howls over the costs of recycling tend to reappear periodically when commodity prices sink as they have done so dramatically in the last year 
That s because recycled materials such as paper  plastic and metals compete with newly harvested or mined materials  When commodity prices are high  recycled material is in demand because it is cost competitive with virgin materials  During such periods nobody seems to complain about the supposed burdensome costs of recycling because recycled materials are fetching such healthy prices   Consequently  at such times the nation s editorial pages tend to be silent on the topic of trash  
When prices are low  the recyclers complain that they cannot earn enough for their recycled materials which must compete with low priced virgin material being dumped on the market by suppliers desperate for cash   Predictably  the nation s editorial pages start to take a closer look at trash when this is the case  
But just like forestry  oil and gas and mining companies and the manufacturers who rely on their raw materials  recyclers ought to have business plans that take into account the full commodity price cycle  Weyerhaeuser Company  N WY   the forestry giant  doesn t just close its doors when wood product prices are low  It has a plan for getting through to the next upswing 
While there is room for debate about what materials are currently most cost effective and environmentally important to recycle  that should not distract us from the goal of creating a cradle to cradle society  that is  one in which all products are designed to be converted into other materials or products at the end of their useful lives  The consequence of such design is practically zero waste 
Of course  it s no wonder that waste haulers are not particularly interested in a zero landfill goal since it would leave their existing landfills without customers 
But one simple policy change could make recycling much more attractive  even in times of low commodity prices  Tax trash  Tax anything that is dumped in a landfill  The higher the tax  the more likely someone will figure out how to 1  minimize waste in the first place and 2  recycle what waste remains more efficiently 
Any mention of a tax on trash would undoubtedly cause the lobbyists for waste haulers to darken the skies over Washington  state capitols or city halls where the mention was made  But that doesn t make a trash tax any less of a good idea as a way to get us all focused on the real goal  less trash  more recycling  and  with what we cannot currently recycle   using best practices ",2015-11-08,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/getting-it-wrong-on-recycling-270639,270639
143101,364616,WM,Waste Management  Major Moat And 13 Consecutive Dividend Increases,opinion,"Waste Management  N WM  is not widely known by dividend investors  but its moat and consistency are remarkable 
As the largest integrated waste management company in the country  WM possesses several key advantages that have enabled it to increase its dividend for 13 consecutive years 
While WM s operating history isn t as long as some other companies  its economies of scale  durability  unique assets  consistent free cash flow generation  and mission critical services make the company one of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks Business OverviewWM is the biggest integrated waste management company in North America and serves more than 21 million residential  commercial  industrial  and municipal customers  The company makes money by entering into contracts with customers to collect  transport  process  store  and dispose of their waste  WM owns a variety of assets to run its business  including landfills  truck fleets  transfer stations  recycling facilities  processing plants  and more 
2014 Revenue Mix  collection 54   landfill 18   transfer 9   recycling 9   other 10  2014 Collection Revenue Mix  commercial 40   residential 30   industrial 26   other 4 Business AnalysisThe trash business might appear to be a commodity industry at first glance  but it actually has substantial barriers to entry  As the largest player in the market  WM also carries several additional advantages 
First  it s worth mentioning that there really aren t any alternatives to trash disposal today  Consumers  municipalities  and businesses need to have their waste collected and taken off site  With the average American generating several pounds of trash per day  there is a constant need for WM s services 
All we see is a garbage truck that picks up our garbage can and drives on  but where does our trash really go  This is when WM s valuable  hard to replicate network of assets comes into play 
Waste that is not recycled or processed into forms of energy is taken to transfer stations  which consolidate waste into larger  long distance trucks  These trucks take the waste to distant disposal facilities and landfills 
WM owns 252 landfills  more than its next two largest competitors combined  The number of landfills has fallen from over 7 600 in the mid 1980s to about 1 900 in 2013  That s over a 75  decrease in less than 30 years  Government regulations  neighborhood restrictions  high start up costs  and environmental concerns have all played a factor in the decline of available landfills 
While the remaining landfills are larger and more efficient than their predecessors  there are only so many places that waste management companies can park trash  WM s competitors must pay WM a  tipping fee  to deposit waste at its landfills and use its transfer stations 
WM s ownership of key assets  dense waste collection network  and tipping fees allow it to maintain a lower cost profile than its peers  This results in more waste volumes from customers  greater route density  and higher returns on its capital 
In addition to the toll taking advantage WM has  new entrants also have a challenging time winning enough business to justify the significant investment needed to construct for their own disposal facilities  WM and other players already have contracts with customers  which typically last anywhere from two to six years 
WM has noted that more than 80  of its commercial and industrial customers have a contract length greater than three years  and the typical customer stays with WM for 10 years  New entrants have a difficult time securing the cash flow streams necessary to build their own trash disposal network 
Furthermore  WM s large network of recycling facilities  transfer stations  and landfills make its business more flexible to meet the needs of virtually any customer segment   municipalities  construction sites  healthcare facilities  commercial buildings  and many others  Generally speaking  customers prefer to contract with proven operators that can meet a variety of needs Key RisksWM s revenue growth is somewhat impacted by the amount of goods consumed by consumers and businesses  When economic activity slows  less trash is produced and WM is not as busy  However  its trucks still run their routes and incur the same operating costs  somewhat crimping profitability 
Besides economic activity  solid waste volumes are gradually impacted by more efficient product packaging and the level of recycling activity  which diverts trash away from landfills 
Landfills have also received increasing scrutiny from governments regarding their impact on the environment  further accelerating the trend towards recycling and what are known as waste to energy  WTE  plants  which generate electricity from waste and sell it to customers such as utilities 
Importantly  WM is the largest residential recycler in North America and has the financial firepower to invest in whatever operations are needed to maintain its moat  The company is also a leading renewable energy provider 
If anything  we think the  slowly  increasing shift towards recycling and renewables will further strengthen the market positions of the biggest players because smaller competitors are unable to make the vertical integration investments needed to compete 
Whether or not these activities will be equally profitable is another question  but WM should find a way to stay relevant with its scale and collection of assets 
Additionally  lower commodity prices are hurting WM s recycling operations  9  of sales   While not much can be done about this in the near term  WM is structuring new contracts and renewals to help it better deal with price volatility in the future and is improving operational efficiency 
WM s management team is focused on improving the company s return on invested capital  and we trust them to make the best decisions possible as it relates to recycling and WTE activities  which seem to have a more volatile return profile 
The company decided to divest a meaningful portion of its WTE business in late 2014 for  1 9 billion to maximize its focus on the core business  reduce earnings volatility  and improve its returns  We expect management to remain conservative with how they run the business and adapt to evolving waste management trends Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend 
Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
WM has one of the safest dividend payments that income investors can find  The company recorded a dividend Safety Score of 97  suggesting that its dividend is safer than 97  of all other dividend stocks in the market 
Over the last four quarters  WM s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios were 66  and 56   respectively  For such a stable and predictable company like WM  these ratios are healthy and appear to pose little risk 
Looking further back  we can see that WM s payout ratios have increased a bit over the last decade  but not by an extraordinary amount  In most years  the company s payout ratios remained between 40  and 60   leaving WM with plenty of dividend cushion and room for incremental growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Besides payout ratios  it is important to assess how well a stock performed during the financial crisis  A  safe  payout ratio can suddenly appear dangerous if earnings are very sensitive to the broader economy 
Fortunately for WM  consumers and businesses still have to consume a variety of goods regardless of how the economy is doing  Trash is a hard expense to avoid  WM s sales fell by 12  in 2009  reflecting lower trash volumes but still outperforming many other types of companies 
Importantly  WM s stock actually gained 5  in 2008  beating the S P 500 by 42  and reflecting its defensive characteristics 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Analyzing a company s return on invested capital can help us understand whether or not it has a moat  As seen below  WM has consistently recorded high single digit returns  In many ways  WM s business is somewhat like a utility company in that it practically has a monopoly in many local markets due to its landfills and extensive asset network  Since it is so capital intensive  the result is moderate but predictable returns on capital 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
WM has also been an excellent free cash flow generator  Free cash flow is the lifeblood of companies and allows them to reinvest and return capital to shareholders without requiring debt or issuing shares  WM is a free cash flow machine because of its long lasting assets  e g  landfills  truck fleets   customer contracts  and route density 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
A company s balance sheet can also impact the safety of a dividend payment  Companies with too much debt could unexpectedly fall on hard times and need to suspend their dividend in order to service their debt 
WM maintains significantly more debt than the average company  Its assets are capital intensive  but the company s consistent free cash flow generation reduces its credit risk significantly  WM also has over  1 4 billion in unused and available credit capacity  and the company has noted that only 8  of its total debt portfolio has floating interest rates in case rates finally do start to rise 
Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
WM s dividend Growth Score is a little below average at 43  While the company has consistently increased its cash flow generation and dividend  it operates in mature  slow growing markets  The company s payout ratio is also north of 55   which is still healthy but provides a bit less room for dividend growth than many other companies  especially considering the amount of debt on the balance sheet 
WM increased its dividend by 6 5  in December  making its thirteenth consecutive year of dividend increases  While it is only about halfway to joining the list of dividend aristocrats  WM has the predictable and durable business model needed to keep chugging along 
As seen below  WM s dividend growth had been decelerating over the past decade until its announced increase earlier this month  We expect low  to mid single digit dividend growth to continue  essentially matching the company s earnings growth rate 
Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationWM trades at 19 6x estimated 2016 earnings and offers a dividend yield of 2 8   which is significantly below its five year average dividend yield of 3 6  
With an expected long term earnings growth rate in the low  to mid single digits  we believe the stock offers total return potential of 6  to 9  per year 
WM doesn t appear to be a bargain for new money today  but we think the company s impressive durability and moat make it worth holding onto 
We expect to be rewarded with steadily improving earnings and growing dividend payments for years to come ConclusionWM is a rock solid business  The company s economies of scale  extensive network of well placed assets  ownership of increasingly rare landfills  annuity like revenues  the average commercial and industrial customer stays with WM for 10  years   and disciplined approach to capital allocation create a strong fundamental case to buy and hold WM forever  It s no wonder why Bill Gates  trust has made WM its third largest holding and also owns about 25  of WM s next largest competitor  Republic Services  N RSG  
We expect WM to continue improving its profitability over the coming years and rewarding shareholders with additional  albeit modest  dividend increases  For these reasons and more  we own WM in our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio and don t plan on selling anytime soon ",2015-12-31,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waste-management:-major-moat-and-13-consecutive-dividend-increases-378376,378376
143103,364618,WM,Cheap Oil s Surprising Loser  Recycling,opinion,"Believe it or not  one of the biggest victims of falling energy prices has been the recycling industry 
The problem is that  from a bottom line perspective  recycling doesn t always make economic sense when commodities are cheap 
Take Waste Management Inc  N WM   the nation s biggest recycler  for instance 
One year ago  it was able to sell a bale of translucent plastic for  230  Today  that same bale reaps a mere  112  And that s all due to the glut of cheap oil flooding the global markets 
When commodity prices were high  recyclers would pay municipalities for used aluminum cans and   as they could still turn a profit selling the recycled materials 
Now that trade has been turned on its head  Most local governments are receiving nothing for their recyclables   and in many cases  they re now paying companies to take the recyclables off their hands 
Furthermore  recycling isn t cheap  In fact  the energy  labor  and machinery costs necessary to recycle materials can sometimes be double the cost of sending them to a landfill 
For this reason  Best Buy Co Inc  N BBY  recently changed its in store e waste program  which was losing the company money  Now the retailer charges customers  25 for each TV and computer monitor recycled at its stores 
Problematic Plastics
At the end of the day  recycling is still a commodities business 
That means everything that s recycled   paper  plastics  metal  and glass   competes with the originally manufactured material  or  virgin  goods 
Crude oil and natural gas prices are the lowest they ve been in over a decade  And because energy is a large input cost for virgin goods  the end result is that it s now more economical to buy the virgin materials than it is to use recycled materials 
Indeed  virgin plastic  made from the by products of oil and natural gas production  is now much more competitive with recycled plastic  and that s caused the decline in the market value of recycled plastic 
The end result is that recyclers are struggling to stay in business 
United Plastic Recycling filed for bankruptcy in 2015  while Waste Management reduced the number of its recycling facilities to 100 from 130 and let go of over 900 personnel in the last two years  according to The New York Times 
Just last week California s largest recycler  rePlanet  announced that it will close 191 recycling centers and reduce its workforce by 278 people 
Single Versus Double Bottom Line
The problem  of course  is that recycling is good for the environment even when it s not economically sensible 
Put another way  the single bottom line is measured in dollars and cents  but the double bottom line factors in the environment  And recycling is an important part of the double bottom line 
When we stop reusing old materials  the land  sea  and air all suffer along with the health and well being of the Earth s inhabitants 
Luckily  we re improving corporate sustainability goals and devising ways of building a recycling infrastructure that would make the industry economical  However  this takes years to accomplish 
Fortunately there are innovators  game changers  and disruptive businesses that are already doing something to reduce or even eliminate recyclable waste  particularly in the area of single use plastics   and they re generating decent revenue in the process 
These businesses are getting smarter about design with some help and funding from the Silicon Valley based  for profit organization   an innovation forum  business accelerator  and investment fund 
The only fund currently investing in solutions to plastic pollution  Think Beyond Plastic sources and advances broad based disruptive innovations that measurably reduce plastic pollution  Of special interest are material  manufacturing  and design innovations  as well as recycling innovations  when it makes sense  
One business working with Think Beyond Plastic is Mango Materials  which produces biodegradable plastics from waste biogas  methane  that are economically competitive with conventional oil based plastics 
Another business  Thread International  sources plastic from the developing world and turns it into fabric  Thread not only cleans up the environment  but it also creates jobs around the world 
Still other businesses eschew the recycling route  acknowledging that it perpetuates the use of single use plastic  and instead choose to design new products to replace commonly used plastic ones 
Eco Baggeez  for instance  manufactures re sealable sandwich bags  which are a great alternative to the traditional plastic ones  while Weed Recede has created biodegradable  disappearing  mulch bags for farmers  landscapers  and home owners 
Finally  there s NewGen Surgical  which manufactures sustainably designed and biodegradable medical devices and surgical products from bagasse  the fibrous matter that remains from crushed sugarcane or sorghum stalks 
These are just a few examples of better alternatives to traditional plastics  all of which end up in landfills  oceans  and the air and never really go away 
So how does one profit from all of this 
Beyond just shorting traditional recyclers  one can invest in the businesses that are genuinely addressing the plastic problem with creative  practical  and economic solutions

143109,364624,WM,Waste Management  WM    3 Other Waste Removal Stocks To Buy,opinion,"The Waste Management industry broadly includes the waste collection services as well as the waste treatment and disposal services of hazardous  nonhazardous and recyclable materials  These include waste materials generated from industrial and commercial operations  household chores and medical services The waste materials are usually collected by local vehicles and transferred by long distance automobiles to various disposal facilities such as waste combustors  waste to energy plants   solid waste landfills and compost dumps  Proper waste management techniques help in recycling various discarded materials and reduce greenhouse gases by producing alternate sources of energy through sustainable development Industry DynamicsThe Waste Management industry is somewhat recession proof as steady demand from the residential and healthcare sectors nullify the vagaries of the industrial  construction and commercial business sectors  Although industry revenues were affected by the Great Recession to some extent  the impact was relatively much less as compared to other cyclical industries

143117,364632,WM,Waste Management  Time To Dump And Short,opinion,The chart for Waste Management  Inc   WM  is a classic demonstration of a broadening top formation where the Designated Market Maker does not want to tie up his inventory any longer than necessary  The blocks of August 1 and August 31 are  control blocks  he will use to maintain the current trend  The block of August 1 which traded at the beginning of the broadening top was most likely a distribution  The block of August 31 which traded at the end of the broadening top was most likely a short  If these assessments are correct  then the Designated Market Maker will need to lower the price in order to cover his short positions  Although these blocks are relevant to the extent that they will facilitate the short to intermediate price objectives of the Designated Market Maker  I do not believe they have the impetus to serve as a catalyst for a major trend reversal  Therefore  I expect this issue to revisit the baseline where the DMM will replenish his inventory and advance Waste Management to the ridgeline  in order to continue and preserve the current range bound trend  A few other technical characteristics which give rise to my suspicions that this issue is going lower are  Chart patterns   In addition to being much closer to the 52 week high   36 35  than the 52 week low   28 77  Waste Management is encountering resistance at what I consider to be a key point of the price structure  One ought not to ignore  the long red down candlestick on April 27  Waste Management is hitting resistance at the midway point of that candlestick which incidentally is very close to the price point of the block which traded on August 31  which  as previously stated  I believe is a short  Candlestick patterns   There are hanging men  doji and shooting stars which as you already know are neither bullish nor bearish  in and of themselves  but are biased on the basis of where they occur in the price structure  In this case  they appear at the top which would give them a bearish or downward bias  Volume   The spike in aggregate volume on August 31 and September 4 are indicative of the Designated Market Maker and other exchange insiders dumping at or near the highs to the investing public  Volume has subsided significantly which implies to me that demand is no longer being encouraged because his inventory levels are diminished and his short positions are established  It is important to understand that when the  talking heads  on the financial channels comment on the low volume in the market  they intimate that the volume needs to increase in order to validate a rally  I on the other hand view low volume as an indicator that the trend at the time will continue  I believe that heavy volume is a catalyst for reversals  That is to say that heavy volume in a topping market is bearish and heavy volume in a bottoming market is bullish  In the simplest of terms  the true center of gravity of any issue lies between the heavy volume at the ridgeline and the heavy volume at the baseline  On the basis of the foregoing  these are my views and observations  The Trade  I recommend establishing a short position in Waste Management  Open your short position  First Sell  with only   of whatever capital you intend to commit to Waste Management at  34 58 or better  Cost Average  Second Sell  the remaining   of the position at  37 35 and stop out at  38 81  Do not post your stop loss  I have said it before but it is so important that at the risk of being redundant and in an abundance of caution I will say it again  It is too easy for the Designated Market Maker to cash investors out by moving the price above or below your stop out and move the price right back up or down again  In addition  when a stop out is triggered it converts into a market order and that could be disastrous if the DMM decides to really take advantage  Remember the  Flash Crash   I would be looking to cover this position with a downside price target of  31 81  There is always the possibility that the trade may not work out  There Is Never A Sure Thing  particularly on a short  Investors must realize and recognize that there is never a sure thing  Sometimes events that have a low probability of occurring bring forth very serious consequences should they come into being  Investors must judiciously consider what the inherent practical limits are and how much they stand to gain in relation to the risks involved in establishing any position  In addition  persistence can become desperate folly by allowing a losing position to become a viable argument for deciding on a new position  Rather  such decisions should be based on the current and soon to be circumstances  Any position in which one unexpected factor has a significant impact on your portfolio is the result of poor planning  It is a fault most commonly associated with people who want to explain away their losses  SUN TZU   Art of War  Use an attack to exploit a victory  never use an attack to rescue a defeat   If you follow the process recommended and the trade does not work  the overall loss in this model is  3 000 00  That amounts to  003 of the overall portfolio  theoretically valued at  1 000 000   Finally  never be a brave and brainless investor because a fool and his money are soon parted  A
