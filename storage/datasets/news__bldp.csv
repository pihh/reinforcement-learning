194844,416360,BLDP,Why Ballard Power Systems Shares Popped 20 6  Today,news,"What happened 
Shares of Ballard Power Systems  NASDAQ BLDP  jumped as much as 20 6  in trading today on some good news from China  Shares settled slightly but were still up 14 2  at 11 30 a m  EST  
So what
China announced that it doesn t have plans to cut new energy vehicle subsidies in July of this year  the time of year it often cuts renewable energy subsidies  Last year  a cut to subsidies in July led to a drop in vehicle sales  so the government is giving some stability to the market by making this announcement now  

Vehicles haven t traditionally been a big market for Ballard but that could change in China  A joint venture it has with Weichai Power recently announced a  19 2 million order for membrane electrode assemblies from Ballard  These assemblies will go in vehicles made in China  so if the market continues to grow  Ballard may be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the U S  
Now what
The news from China is an incremental positive today  but there s no direct news about Ballard that long term investors should be concerned about  Traders seem to have taken a liking to fuel cell stocks recently and any bit of good news can send a stock higher  That seems to be what s happening today  While I think 2020 could be a very good year for Ballard as the fuel cell business matures and new markets emerge  this isn t a pop I would be buying today ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phgag,2058195

194917,416433,BLDP,Why Plug Power Is Up 45  In One Month ,opinion,"Plug Power Inc  NASDAQ PLUG  has a solid run in the bourses recently  Investors are showing interest in the company as it is engaged in the design and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cell systems which would replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity 
The stocks related to electric vehicles  lithium battery  and hydrogen fuel related stocks are in great demand this year  Two companies are in the forefront in the hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing  namely Plug Power and Ballard Power Systems Inc  NASDAQ BLDP  
The company released its fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on March 07  2019  Revenue grew 78  to  62 1 million and beat median analyst estimates by  1 42 million  Earnings per share came at   0 08 compared to   0 09 for 4Q 2017  which was shy of estimates by 1 cent  Adjusted EBITDA came at  0 5 million compared to a   7 6 million for the same period last year  This was the first time the company was able to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA and the management expects this trend to continue 
The company sold 1 700 GenDrive units when compared to 700 for the same period last year  There were three GenFuel sites sold this quarter  This helped the sales to soar  On a full year  basis revenue grew 75  to  175 million 
The management expects revenue growth to continue on account of strong growth in the material handling market  It will also announce four business announcements in 2019  Gross billings are expected to grow to  235 to  245 million 
The company s cash flows are negative  Another concern is that the debt is increasing and the management needs to improve the cash flows immediately and also make the debt repayments on time 
Where are the products used 
The material handling industry uses full service GenKey solution  Some of the features are these are designed to increase productivity  lower operating costs  and reduce carbon footprints  The company replaced lead acid batteries to power industrial vehicles such as lift trucks customers use in their distribution centers 
In December it announced the expansion of deployed GenDrive fleet at the Daimler manufacturing facility in Alabama  Daimler had deployed more than 400 Plug Power GenDrive systems in the material handling vehicles prior to this expansion 
Riley FBR has resumed the coverage on the stock with a  3 50 price target which suggests an upside of 40  to the current price  Riley likes PLUG s opportunities to secure a global distribution agreement with a well capitalized  integrated solutions provider to expand customer reach in Europe  Asia Pacific and certain Latin American countries  and establish a joint venture or partnership with one of the major industrial gas companies to secure a stable supply of hydrogen and drive down cost per kilogram 
Risks  The market cap is only  620 million  So there will be a lot of volatility  The company is yet to make profits  If there is an alternative to fuel cells then the revenue could drop significantly 
Conclusion  This is a high risk and high return stock  With the stock already up 93  year to date  there could be some profit booking  Revenue growth is very strong  However  the company should be able to make profits and then it would attract a lot of long term investors

benefited from excellent traction in the SubCom business as well as most of the company s harsh environment businesses including Automotive  Medical  Aerospace  Commercial Transportation and Appliances  However  prolonged softness in industrial markets coupled with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions like oil and gas volatility and slowdown in China restricted growth Segmental Performance Transportation Solutions revenues came in at  1 652 million in the quarter  up 1 9  on a year over year basis Orders in the transportation segment came in at  1 659 million compared with the year ago tally of  1 643 million  Though automotive organic sales growth in China and EMEA regions acted as tailwinds  weakness in industrial markets offset these improvements to some extent Communications Solutions continued to show weakness as revenues fell 10 3  year over year to  620 million  Orders also declined 14 9  to  399 million on a year over year basis  The lackluster performance of the communications business was largely on account of poor sales in Appliances and Data   Devices business lines  Data   Devices sales were impacted by Circuit Protection divestiture and product exits Industrial Solutions revenues picked up after a soft quarter  rising 5 3  year over year to  849 million in the quarter under review  Orders in this quarter rose 7 2  to  879 million  Growth in OEM and distribution orders drove sales  while the recently acquired Creganna also lent strength to the segment s top line  However  weakness in oil and gas markets and industrial equipment hurt growth to some extent The company s adjusted operating margin for the quarter expanded 20 basis points from the year ago quarter to 16 1  Liquidity   Cash FlowTE Connectivity exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  694 million  down from  701 million as on Jun 26  2015 The company generated free cash flow of  589 million in the quarter  up from  391 million in the prior year quarter Share Repurchase Program DividendDuring the quarter  the company returned  231 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends Other DevelopmentsThe quarter saw TE Connectivity expand its portfolio through the acquisition of Jaquet Technology Group  which makes innovative speed sensors for the auto  rail and power markets  This expands the company s scope of engineering and manufacturing expertise for sensor technology and adds to its automotive and industrial and commercial transportation portfolio During the quarter  TE Connectivity concluded the buyout of healthcare device company Creganna Medical Group for  895 million  in a bid to expand and emerge as the industry leader in high growth harsh environment applications The acquisition will enable TE Connectivity to double its medical business revenues to approximately  500 million and cement its position in the high growth minimally invasive medical device market  The company expects the deal to be accretive to the extent of  0 03 to adjusted earnings in the first full fiscal  while boosting interventional revenues by over  300 million Concurrent with the earnings release  TE Connectivity also revealed that it had inked an agreement to acquire Intercontec Group   a leading maker of high quality industrial metric circular connectors  The deal will further boost its position in harsh connectivity applications for the industrial market  Intercontec will be integrated into the Industrial Solutions segment OutlookTE Connectivity expects fourth quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 17  1 23 and revenues between  3 25 and  3 45 billion  The adjusted earnings and revenue figures incorporate the impact of Jaquet and Creganna acquisitions In light of the strong quarter  the company revised its full year fiscal 2016 guidance  It now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  3 97  4 03  previously guided in the range of  3 90  4 10  and revenues in the band of  12 15  12 35 million  previous guidance was  12 1  12 5 billion  TE CONNECT LTD Price and EPS Surprise   ConclusionThe company is currently experiencing a steady recovery in the automotive market and anticipates a rebound in its commercial transportation business in the forthcoming quarters  both of which hold immense potential  The company expects industrial orders to gain further traction  which is a sign of stabilization in the sector  However  the company continues to be bothered by the weakness in Chinese markets and foreign exchange volatility Going forward  TE Connectivity believes that the acquisition of Creganna and Intercontec Group will further boost its strong foothold in the harsh environment portfolio  The company has been undergoing restructuring in order to enhance its focus on the lucrative connectivity and sensor markets as well  These strategic steps are beginning to gain momentum  and will likely boost growth in the coming quarters In addition  though the exit of the Circuit Protection business may have impacted financials in the short run  we believe the company will now be able to channel its resources to more productive areas in the future  thereby augmenting long term growth TE Connectivity currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the industry are Ballard Power Systems Inc    NASDAQ BLDP    AU

194956,416472,BLDP,6 Platinum Plays For The  Eventual  Strike Resolution,opinion,"Over a million ounces of platinum have been lost to the South African mining strike  which is now entering its 20th week  The strike is one of the longest and costliest in recent history  It s an ugly situation  for sure 
Estimates suggest that a global shortfall of 1 22 million ounces now exists  As you can imagine  platinum prices have pushed vertical to  1 727 an ounce  Platinum  the most precious of metals  now enjoys the widest spread to gold prices   88 85  since August 2011 
At some point  the strike will end  Especially since the government is putting pressure on both sides to settle  So be ready  because there s a pot o  gold sitting at the end of this strike  In fact  this is one of the easiest profit plays I ve seen in the last five years 
Hint  What s the one thing in the world that can t exist without platinum  The answer  Fuel cells 
The fuel cell industry was cruising along prior to the strike With virtually no fanfare  it was among the top performing niche industries in the market  as shown by the NASDAQ OMX Fuel Cell Total Return Index  GRNFUELX  

Then the mining strike hit  and the bottom fell out of the rally  like a falling piano   Platinum  you see  is critical to the production of fuel cells  In fact  the properties in platinum that fuel cells depend on can t be replaced by any other resource on Earth 
Platinum helps generate power through the electrochemical reaction of oxygen and hydrogen  The unavoidable reality is that higher platinum prices will hit fuel cell manufacturers where it hurts most   their bottom lines 
Companies like Ballard Power  NASDAQ BLDP   ITM Power  LONDON ITM   Hydrogenics  NASDAQ HYGS   Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies Worldwide  NASDAQ QTWW   FuelCell Energy  NASDAQ FCEL  and AFC Energy  LONDON AFEN  have all experienced dramatic declines in their share prices
