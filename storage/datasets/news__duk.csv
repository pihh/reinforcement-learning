101193,322708,DUK,PG E to name TVA s Bill Johnson as CEO  source,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    PG E Corp is expected to name Bill Johnson as chief executive of the bankrupt California energy company facing  30 billion in wildfire liabilities  as soon as Wednesday  a source familiar with the private negotiations said on Tuesday  Johnson  who has been the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority since 2013 and is retiring on Friday  would not comment on the PG E rumors  A group of investors  including Knighthead Capital Management  Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management  have been pushing for Johnson to be hired  Before joining TVA  Johnson was the chairman  president and CEO of Progress Energy from 2007 2012 before it merged with North Carolina rival  Duke Energy  Corp  NYSE DUK   Another hedge fund  BlueMountain Capital Management  announced a slate of 13 directors  Last week California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote to PG E s interim chief executive officer expressing concern about the company s plans  He wrote  in a letter seen by Reuters  that he is  troubled to learn that PG E is primed to reconstitute its board with hedge fund financiers  out of state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations  regulation and safety    BlueMountain said last week that it has already proposed a slate of nominees with relevant safety  utility and clean energy expertise  as well as significant experience in the state of California  Its slate includes hedge fund manager Jeff Ubben  who is based in California  and former California Treasurer Phil Angelides  PG E faces crushing liabilities related to deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes  
A U S  judge on Tuesday ordered PG E not to pay shareholders dividends and instead use the money to fund its plan for cutting down trees to reduce the risk its equipment will spark more destructive wildfires in wooded areas of California ",2019-04-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pge-to-name-tvas-bill-johnson-as-ceo-source-1825583,1825583
101194,322709,DUK,Bankrupt PG E Names TVA s Johnson as CEO  Forms New Board,news," Bloomberg     PG E Corp  tapped Bill Johnson  the outgoing head of the Tennessee Valley Authority  to become chief executive officer and lead the California energy giant out of the biggest utility bankruptcy in U S  history 
Johnson  65  is joining the company after more than six years at the helm of TVA  the company said in a statement late Wednesday  PG E also named 10 new directors to its board    including former energy executives  restructuring experts  a former federal energy regulator and at least four California residents    as part of a management shakeup it promised in January  Shares climbed 1 5 percent to  18 75 in after hours trading 
As CEO  Johnson will be responsible for steering PG E through what s expected to be a contentious bankruptcy as activist investors  creditors  wildfire victims and California officials wrestle over restructuring a utility serving 16 million people in one of the world s largest economies  He replaces Geisha Williams  NYSE WMB   who resigned in January before the company filed for bankruptcy facing  30 billion in liabilities from wildfires its equipment has been suspected of igniting 
 I am humbled to take on this new challenge and am dedicated to meeting the high expectations that our customers  regulators and legislators have for PG E   Johnson said in the statement   While the challenges facing PG E and California are significant  by working together  we will overcome them to serve the best interests of our customers  
The appointments follow an intense  weeks long battle over the future management of PG E  Even California Governor Gavin Newsom joined the fight  urging the company to resist hedge fund picks and appoint directors who live in California 
Deal Struck
On Tuesday  PG E was said to strike a deal with a group of investors    Knighthead Capital Management  Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management    that own about 10 percent of the company s shares  The deal called for Johnson to be hired as CEO  along with the nomination of the 10 new board members  people familiar with the situation said  That group squared off against activist investor BlueMountain Capital Management  which had put forth its own slate 
Among the new directors being appointed are 

Jeffrey Bleich  a partner at the law firm Dentons and a California resident 
Nora Mead Brownell  a former member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Fred Fowler  former chief executive officer of the natural gas pipeline company  Spectra Energy  Corp  F SEP  
Meridee Moore  founder and CEO of San Francisco based alternative asset manager Watershed Asset Management 
Richard Kelly  former CEO of power utility  Xcel Energy  Inc  NASDAQ XEL  

Newsom didn t immediately respond to a request for comment  and it remains to be seen how the appointments will be received in Sacramento 
State Senator Bill Dodd  who helped shepherd utility legislation last year  said he shared the governor s reservations ahead of PG E s announcement  Newsom voiced concerns about a slate of directors PG E was proposing to appoint last week  and the utility had made only three changes in the list it issued Wednesday  Dodd said  citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter 
 When you look at a slate of 13 candidates  from my vantage point  with the heavy lifting that PG E has to do going forward  that raises some real concerns   Dodd said 
Less Than a Day
Johnson  who announced his retirement from the TVA in November  may be best known as the man who served as CEO of  Duke Energy  Corp  NYSE DUK   for less than a day  He had been appointed as part of the company s  17 8 billion takeover of Progress Energy in 2012 but was replaced eight hour later with James Rogers  the former Duke CEO who was supposed to become executive chairman  Johnson received an exit package estimated to be worth more than  40 million 
He was appointed that same year to his post at TVA  a corporate agency of the U S  government that supplies electricity to power companies serving 10 million people in the Southeast 
Before the appointments  Newsom publicly criticized PG E s plans to revamp its board with what he described as  hedge fund financiers  out of state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations  regulation and safety   He urged the company to consider a board made up primarily of Californians 
BlueMountain had meanwhile nominated 13 directors including former California treasurer Phil Angelides  National Transportation Safety Board ex chairman Christopher Hart and Jeff Ubben  chief executive officer of activist investor ValueAct Capital Management  The firm said in a statement Wednesday that it ll  carefully evaluate the nominees put forward  before commenting 
A Worthy CEO
Johnson has already drawn some opposition 
Clean energy advocacy group Vote Solar said in a statement that his track record falls short of what  PG E s customers deserve   The group pointed to the lack of solar and wind power on TVA s coal dependent system  Coal made up more than a quarter of TVA s portfolio last year  with solar and wind accounting for just 3 percent  according to the company s website 
PG E noted in its statement that  under Johnson s leadership  TVA retired more than half of coal generation  cutting the utility s carbon emissions by about 50 percent over the last decade

101195,322710,DUK,Trump Said to Seek Limit on State Power Over Pipelines,news," Bloomberg     Developers have been trying for six years to build a 124 mile natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York  Despite winning a federal approval in 2014  the project is still no closer to reality 
Enter President Donald Trump  who on Wednesday is poised to issue an executive order to promote projects like the long stalled Constitution Pipeline  according to people familiar with the matter who asked for anonymity to discuss it before a formal announcement 
The move seeks to short circuit regulators in New York who have denied the planned pipeline a crucial permit  invoking their powers under the Clean Water Act to reject projects they deem a threat to water supplies and the environment  Other states and tribes have wielded the power to restrict a coal export terminal and hydropower project on the U S  West Coast 
The Clean Water Act wasn t  intended to give a state veto power   said Dena Wiggins  president of the Natural Gas Supply Association   The actions New York is taking not only impact New York  they are impacting the entire Northeast  because we can t get a pipeline through the state in order to provide gas service to the Northeast  
But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said that  no corporation should be allowed to endanger our natural resources   and vowed the state  will not relent in our fight to protect our environment  
Trump s order  slated to be unveiled during a visit to the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center in Crosby  Texas  comes as the president continues to chafe at regulatory barriers he says throttle the full potential of American  energy dominance   while keeping the nation hooked on foreign gas imports 
Trump also is set to issue an executive order aimed at boosting cross border energy infrastructure  following long delays on high profile projects such as TransCanada Corp  s Keystone XL oil pipeline  according to two people familiar with the matter 
The edict represents a reprise of earlier presidential memos and orders Trump issued in 2017 in a bid to hasten permitting of U S  energy infrastructure  The order slated to be released Wednesday focuses on promoting projects with facilities or land transportation crossings at U S  borders 
Trump s action is unlikely to jump start widespread construction  since it s up to Congress    not the president    to restrict states  authority under the Clean Water Act  And the initiative isn t expected to solve legal problems thwarting several pipelines in the Mid Atlantic U S   which hinge on inadequate Interior Department reviews    not formal objections from states 
Still it marks a formal push by Trump to rein in states that have emerged as a major barrier to constructing pipelines 
Even if it s not a  silver bullet   the pipeline order  will be construed as opening the door to overcoming these hurdles that states are throwing up   said Christi Tezak  managing director at ClearView Energy Partners 
Trump s pipeline order is set to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to revise its handbook for how states can use their certification power to vet projects that cross wetlands  rivers and other bodies of water 
Those Section 401 certifications    named for a provision in the Clean Water Act    are supposed to be approved  denied or waived by states and tribes within a year of a project application  Yet federal regulators have said the one year clock can be restarted whenever developers submit new or revised applications for state review 
Fights over state permits have led to years long delays and protracted federal court battles  with some analysts urging investors to consider  elevated risk premiums  in making decisions about projects designed to cross some particularly challenging states 
Prime Location
In addition to the Constitution pipeline  a joint venture between Cabot Oil   Gas Corp  NYSE COG    Williams  NYSE WMB  Cos    Duke Energy  Corp  NYSE DUK   and AltaGas Ltd   New York also has denied water quality certifications for Millennium Pipeline Co  LLC s CPV Valley lateral project in the state s Orange County and National Fuel Gas Co  s Northern Access project 
The denials have drawn scrutiny because of the state s prime location  standing between a prolific shale gas formation and consumers throughout the Northeast U S  that are hungry for it  Limited pipeline capacity and other legal constraints prompted the region to import natural gas from Russia last year 
 New York will continue to use all available means to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce states  ability to protect our water resources   the state s Department of Environmental Conservation said in an emailed statement 
Trump s order can t override provisions in the Clean Water Act that give states a powerful role vetting such projects  Tezak said 
 An executive order cannot take off the table the ability of a state to say no for reasons it believes are appropriate  and the venue for adjudicating that is not the White House     it s the courts  Tezak said  But  what states will be constrained from doing is meaningfully extending the process  
Federal courts and regulators are already moving in the same direction  Even without Trump s order  analysts say they expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to soon overrule New York s denial on the grounds it came too late 
Environmentalists have blasted the plan  
 This executive order is nothing but an attempt to trample people s rights to protect their air  water  and climate from polluting oil and gas pipelines   said Greenpeace USA Climate Campaigner Rachel Rye Butler 
The president s effort also has rankled some Republicans    including governors in the Western U S     who say his initiative threatens to infringe states  rights 
The Western Governors Association warned Trump in a Jan  31 letter that curtailing  the vital role of states in maintaining water quality within their boundaries would inflict serious harm to the division of state and federal authorities established by Congress

101224,322739,DUK,PG E CEO to Leave With Utility at Brink of Bankruptcy,news," Bloomberg     PG E Corp  Chief Executive Officer Geisha Williams  NYSE WMB  is leaving as California s largest utility owner nears potential bankruptcy 
The San Francisco based company has begun a search for a new CEO following Williams  departure  according to a statement issued Sunday  PG E general counsel John Simon will take the helm in the meantime  Williams  57  took over as CEO in March 2017 and is leaving after a catastrophic three months for PG E 
The company has seen two thirds of its market value wiped out since November s Camp Fire    the deadliest wildfire in California s history  Its debt has been downgraded to junk and state regulators have called for a management shakeup  Investigators have been probing whether the power giant s equipment ignited the fire  along with its potential liability for blazes that devastated Northern California s wine country in 2017    costs that may tally as much as  30 billion 
Williams couldn t immediately be reached for comment Sunday 
The company s deepening financial crisis has forced California regulators and policy makers to consider a bailout package and PG E is weighing whether to file for bankruptcy  The utility is planning to notify employees as soon as Monday that it may make a Chapter 11 filing within 15 days  people familiar with the plan said Saturday  Such a notice would be required by state law 
The departure of Williams    one of the world s most powerful women in business    thins the ranks of the roughly two dozen women running S P 500 companies  She was one of a group of women occupying the C suite at power companies    including  Duke Energy  Corp  NYSE DUK   s Lynn Good  El Paso Electric Co  s Mary Kipp  PNM Resources Inc  s Pat Vincent Collawn and Sunrun Inc  s Lynn Jurich 
The daughter of Cuban political refugees  Williams became the nation s first Latina CEO of a Fortune 500 company when she took over PG E  Her departure follows the exit of three PG E executives earlier this month    Patrick Hogan  senior vice president of electric operations at PG E s utility unit  Kevin Dasso  vice president of electric asset management  and Gregg Lemler  vice president of electric transmission 
Under Williams  PG E spent millions of dollars trying to convince state lawmakers to change a legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation  under which utilities are liable for damages if their equipment is found to have sparked a wildfire  even if they weren t negligent  Williams called the doctrine bad public policy that made utilities the default insurer in the state  She said the wildfires were a symptom of climate change with hotter and drier conditions sparking more frequent and intense blazes 
While state lawmakers rejected PG E s request to change wildfire liability law  they did pass legislation in August that will help PG E pay for lawsuits arising from the wine country fires  Three months later  however  the utility s equipment again was being looked at as a possible source of the Camp Fire  which killed 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise 
Support for PG E s management eroded even further in December when state regulators accused the utility of falsifying records related to locating and marking underground gas lines from 2012 through 2017    years in which the company was trying to convince the public that it had cleaned up its act after a 2010 pipeline blast that killed eight in San Bruno  California 
The disclosure prompted a key state lawmaker  Bill Dodd  a state senator from Napa who helped draft the fire legislation that was helpful to PG E  to call for a management shakeup at the company

101252,322767,DUK,Special Report  U S   clean coal  program fails to deliver on smog cuts,news,"By Tim McLaughlin  Reuters    Champions of coal say the superabundant fossil fuel can be made environmentally friendlier by refining it with chemicals   a  clean coal  technology backed by a billion dollars in U S  government tax subsidies annually  But refined coal has a dirty secret  It regularly fails to deliver on its environmental promises  as electric giant  Duke Energy  Corp  NYSE DUK  found  Duke began using refined coal at two of its North Carolina power plants in August 2012  The decision let the company tap a lucrative federal subsidy designed to help the American coal industry reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides   also known as NOx  the main contributor to smog and acid rain   along with other pollutants  In nearly three years of burning the treated coal  the Duke power plants collected several million dollars in federal subsidies  But the plants also pumped out more NOx  not less  according to data from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency analyzed by Reuters  The NOx emission rate at Duke s Marshall Steam Station power plant in Sherrills Ford  North Carolina  for example  was between 33 percent and 76 percent higher in the three years from 2012 to 2014 than in 2011  the year before Marshall started burning refined coal  the EPA data shows  The utility also discovered that one of the chemicals used to refine the coal  calcium bromide  had reached a nearby river and lakes   raising levels of carcinogens in the water supply for more than a million people in greater Charlotte Duke stopped using refined coal at the plants in May 2015 because of the water pollution problems  said spokeswoman Erin Culbert  Bromide levels in the region s drinking water dropped sharply several months later  said Barry Gullett  the city s water director  in a 2015 memo  Duke s experience reflects a fundamental problem with the U S  clean coal incentive program  a Reuters examination has found  Refined coal shows few signs of reducing NOx emissions as lawmakers intended  according to regulatory documents  a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data  and interviews with power plant owners  scientists and state environmental regulators  Consumption figures compiled by the U S  Energy Information Administration show that American power plants are on track to burn about 160 million tons of clean coal in 2018   a fifth of the U S  coal market  That amount would generate about  1 1 billion in incentives at the current tax credit amount of  7 03 per ton  But most of the plants receiving the subsidy failed to reduce NOx emissions by 20 percent   the threshold required under the policy   in 2017 compared to 2009  the last year before they started burning refined coal  according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data on power plant emissions  Reuters identified 56 plants that burned refined coal in 2017 using data from the U S  Energy Information Administration and disclosures from energy companies and refined coal developers  Only 18 of that group reduced NOx emissions by more than 20 percent in 2017 compared to 2009  And 15 of those 18 only reported the improvements after installing or upgrading pollution control equipment or switching a portion of power production to cleaner burning fuel  complicating the question of whether their pollution reductions are attributable to refined coal  At 22 of the 56 plants  NOx emissions were higher in 2017 while burning refined coal than they were when using raw coal in 2009  As a group  the fleet of U S  power plants that burn refined coal also underperformed the rest of the industry in cutting emissions of NOx  the Reuters analysis found  NOx emissions rates declined 19 percent among the 56 power plants that reported burning refined coal in 2017  That compares with a 29 percent reduction by 214 other coal fired power plants over the same period  The analysis included U S  coal fired power plants with at least 100 tons in annual NOx emissions in 2017  Investors in plants that failed to show substantial NOx emission cuts collected the tax credit anyway because the Internal Revenue Service allows them to prove emissions reductions with laboratory tests  The results of those tests   conducted for several hours a couple of times a year   often do not translate to real world improvements at plants that burn millions of tons of coal annually  The IRS  which approves applications for the tax credit  declined to comment on the design or effectiveness of the testing regimen   It s hard to hang your hat on refined coal as the way to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions   said Ron Sahu  an environmental engineer who has consulted with utility companies  the EPA and the U S  Justice Department on power plant emissions   Sahu  who reviewed the data and methodology used by Reuters  said the analysis shows refined coal has little to no impact in reducing NOx emissions at actual power plants   It s clear that any benefit from refined coal can easily be overwhelmed by modest changes in combustion conditions  at power plants  Sahu said   It s debatable that a tax credit should be given for NOx reduction   Reuters sent its analysis of EPA emissions data to every major utility operating power plants that burn clean coal  along with the leading U S  investors who finance clean coal facilities in partnerships designed to take advantage of the subsidy  Most companies declined to comment or did not respond  The handful that did respond did not contest the findings of the analysis   We do agree with the overall assessment that emission controls have a more measurable impact on emissions reductions over refined coal   DTE Energy  a Detroit based utility that uses refined coal  told Reuters  The Edison Electric Institute  which represents the U S  electric utility industry  did not respond to requests for comment  The law requires all refined coal producers seeking the subsidy to show that burning their product can lead to a 20 percent cut in NOx emissions  The producers also must show a 40 percent reduction in either mercury or sulfur dioxide  They are given the choice of which of those two pollutants to target  Refined coal investors tend to target mercury as the second pollutant for cuts  according to disclosures by the corporations involved in the program  That s because reducing mercury emissions with refined coal is a cost effective way for plants to comply with other  relatively new EPA regulations governing the pollutant  Utilities already have spent tens of billions of dollars on equipment to filter out sulfur dioxide  making additional reductions of that gas more difficult  The subsidy program has been more successful at combating mercury than NOx  the analysis found  The mercury emission rate at power plants burning refined coal product  for example  fell 75 percent between 2009 and 2017  more than the 40 percent cut required to qualify for the subsidy  Some of those cuts can also be attributed to other pollution control measures  such as the installation of scrubbers that filter coal plant exhaust  according to the EPA  High exposure to mercury can damage the intestines  kidney and nervous system  according to the EPA  Sulfur dioxide and NOx can cause lung damage  The refined coal subsidy was adopted by Congress and signed into law by President George W  Bush as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004  alongside credits for generating renewable energy from solar and wind  The legislation had broad bipartisan support and generated little public debate  The subsidy is set to expire in 2021  and coal state lawmakers  including North Dakota Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer  are moving to extend it for another decade   The tax credit program is bridging the divide to make coal clean and beautiful   said Cramer  borrowing President Donald Trump s two favorite adjectives to describe coal  Trump has promised to advance the interests of the coal industry to support blue collar energy jobs  His administration has argued coal provides a more reliable fuel for power generation than natural gas  solar and wind  which can be more easily interrupted by pipeline problems or uncooperative weather  The White House did not respond to requests for comment   TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE  In one of the industry s first refined coal ventures  power plant operator Associated Electric Cooperative Inc in 2010 signed a 10 year deal with affiliates of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  to burn refined coal at the New Madrid and Thomas Hill power plants in Missouri  As a tax credit investor  Goldman worked with Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc to build refined coal facilities next to the cooperative s power plants  A refined coal operation typically costs about  6 million to develop  featuring new conveyor belts and sprayers to move and treat the coal with chemicals  according to presentations to investors by Advanced Emissions  Silos also are installed to store the refined coal chemicals  The deal called for the utility to sell raw coal to the Goldman led investment group at cost  and then buy it back at a discount after it was treated  saving the utility millions of dollars  disclosures show   Goldman and its investment partners collected about  63 million in gross tax credits from the program in 2017  based on an estimate in Associated s annual report that its plants used 9 million tons of coal that year  Goldman Sachs declined to comment  Associated had no upfront cost for the refined coal facility and contributes nothing to its annual operating costs  It forecast the arrangement would bring in  7 million to  9 million in annual revenue through at least 2018   The project at first was questioned as simply too good to be true   the utility wrote in its 50th anniversary report released in 2011  The money making deal also illustrates how the potential benefits of refined coal on air quality can be erased by a variety of complex factors  The New Madrid plant in southeast Missouri  for example  has seen its production of NOx soar to a higher rate than any other U S  coal plant while burning refined coal  In 2017  the plant s NOx emission rate was 298 percent higher than it recorded in 2009  before New Madrid started burning clean coal  according to the EPA  During the first quarter of 2018  the rate jumped even further  to seven times the 2009 level  Associated Electric said the increase in NOx emissions at New Madrid was due in part to the cooperative s purchasing tradable pollution credits through the U S  cap and trade system  The market based system sets an overall limit on pollution  and allows power plants that cut their pollution to earn credits that can be stockpiled or sold to other polluters  When large volumes of credits are generated  the cost of buying them can be lower than the cost of running pollution control equipment   At times during the last seven years Associated has met compliance with emissions rules by purchasing NOx credits from the cap and trade markets  rather than running the control equipment all year   the electric cooperative said in a statement  which it issued through Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally  The National Mining Association  which represents the U S  coal industry  supports extending the tax credit  It said the cap and trade system was the primary reason NOx emissions went up at many power plants in the Reuters analysis  The association said clean coal lowers emissions  but provided no data to support the claim  Duke Energy said in a statement that routine changes in electricity demand can also make clean coal ineffective in reducing NOx by changing boiler temperatures and catalyst conditions in pollution control devices  Sahu  the environmental consultant  said refined coal is most effective at reducing NOx emissions when a utility burns the fuel at a relatively low temperature  something that typically occurs when electricity demands on the plant are low  But using low temperatures over an extended period can also damage power plant boilers by causing corrosion and soot buildup  he said  Conversely  burning the coal at a relatively high temperature   more common during high demand periods   can reduce the risk of damage but limit the effectiveness of smog reductions  The Grand River Dam Authority stopped burning refined coal at its Oklahoma power plant last year because corrosion and other problems outweighed any upside  said John Wiscaver  head of GRDA s corporate communications   We had too many problems with refined coal   he said  TROUBLED WATERS Refined coal has also led to contamination of water supplies for more than a million people  according to regulators and utility officials  In 2012  the South Carolina Department of Health   Environmental Control noticed elevated levels of bromides  the chemicals used to treat refined coal  in the Santee Cooper Lake Moultrie public water system  said Tommy Crosby  a spokesman for the agency  The South Carolina plant s refined coal operation stopped spraying bromide on the coal burned at the Cross Generating Station out of concern for the elevated levels of cancer causing trihalomethanes  Crosby said  and the levels decreased within six months  Trihalomethanes are created when bromide mixes with the chlorine in treated drinking water  The plant s refined coal facility was financed by global insurance firm AJ Gallagher  Boston based mutual fund giant Fidelity and a U S  subsidiary of France s Schneider Electric  PA SCHN  SE  Fidelity declined to comment on the elevated TTHM levels and pointed out that federal limits were not exceeded  Schneider Electric and AJ Gallagher declined to comment  The North Carolina town of Mooresville  downstream of Duke s Marshall power plant  saw its trihalomethanes surge as high as 127 parts per billion at times in 2015  after the facility discharged bromide used to treat coal into a nearby lake  according to the town s drinking water quality report  That did not trigger a violation of federal clean water rules because the town s annual average of 54 parts per billion that year was below the maximum trihalomethane contaminant level of 80 parts per billion  The same was true of the South Carolina plant  where trihalomethane levels in 2012 rose to 67 parts per billion  Over the past decade  however  many studies have shown that exposure to trihalomethanes at much lower levels than the federal limit raises the risk of cancer and of problems during pregnancy  Some people who drink water containing TTHMs in excess of the maximum standard over many years may experience problems with their liver  kidneys  or central nervous system  and may have an increased risk of getting cancer  according to the EPA  In 2016  the EPA included bromide in the Safe Water Drinking Act as an unregulated contaminant to be monitored by public water systems  Research by Jeanne VanBriesen  director of Carnegie Mellon University s Center for Water Quality in Urban Environmental Systems  found that bromide additives used to reduce mercury could significantly boost trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies downstream of coal plants  Her 2017 study focused on 22 drinking water systems serving 2 5 million people in Pennsylvania  Once Duke Energy halted refined coal operations at the North Carolina plant  bromide dropped about 75 percent in the nearby Catawba River  Zachary Hall  director of environmental science at Duke  said in a February 2017 deposition given to the Southern  NYSE SO  Environmental Law Center  Duke officials concede that bromide applications contributed to the elevated trihalomethane levels  
 While bromides from our facilities were not the sole cause   Duke s Culbert said   we felt it was important to partner with downstream water utilities and suspend the program  ",2018-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/special-report-us-clean-coal-program-fails-to-deliver-on-smog-cuts-1708172,1708172
101254,322769,DUK,Special Report  Little lab on the prairie clears path to big  clean coal  profits,news,"By Tim McLaughlin  Reuters     Clean  coal is a rich vein for American investors to mine  thanks to a lucrative subsidy offered by the U S  government  For many producers of the fuel  the path to profit leads through a laboratory at the University of North Dakota  The school s Energy and Environmental Research Center reported earning about  5 million in fiscal 2015 16 performing laboratory tests that qualify clean coal producers for the subsidy  On any given day  EERC technicians take a sample of up to one ton of the coal from a producer and burn it in a miniature boiler to determine whether it reduces a specific pollutant enough to make the grade  A stamp of approval from EERC  or a handful of other labs serving the industry  unlocks a tax credit worth more than  7 a ton to producers and their investors  The subsidy  enjoyed by more than 50 clean coal operations stretching from West Virginia to Wyoming  costs U S  taxpayers about  1 billion annually  Technically speaking  EERC s services aren t necessary to win the credit  Producers simply need to prove that their product  also known as refined coal  is cutting their emissions of targeted pollutants   a 20 percent cut in nitrogen oxide output plus a 40 percent reduction in mercury  To do that  they can submit the comprehensive data that s measured around the clock at America s smokestacks   in real world conditions  instead of a lab   and reported regularly to the Environmental Protection Agency  But almost all investors choose instead to pay laboratories like EERC for testing that lasts one day  according to industry executives and disclosures by refined coal producers to environmental regulators  The reason  The lab results almost always show a bigger cut in pollution than the real world data  And the reductions demonstrated in the labs often do not translate to actual pollution reductions at power plants  according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data  interviews with utility executives  and disclosures by power plants  The testing regimen casts doubt on whether the subsidy works as intended  said Ron Sahu  an environmental engineer who has consulted with utilities  the EPA and the U S  Justice Department on power plant emissions   That s a huge leap to give a tax credit based on results from a highly idealized lab test   he said  John Harju  the EERC s vice president of strategic partnerships  said the tests are valid and objective measures of performance   We do the tests  and the results are what they are   he said  Refined coal appears effective in reducing mercury emissions at actual power plants  But it shows little sign of reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide  or NOx  a key element in creating smog and acid rain and a primary target of the subsidy program  according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data  interviews with industry officials  and regulatory disclosures  Between 2009  before utilities began burning refined coal  and 2017  the last year for which full year data is available  NOx pollution rates declined 19 percent among power plants burning refined coal  compared to 29 percent at plants burning raw coal  according to the Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data  Over the same period  22 of the 56 U S  utilities that burned refined coal actually recorded higher NOx emissions rates  Only 18 of them recorded a cut of 20 percent or more   It s one of those things that should come with a label that says   Mileage may vary in the field    said Martin Hopper  general manager of the MSR Public Power Agency in Modesto  California  which co owns New Mexico s San Juan Generating Station  The Internal Revenue Service  which administers the tax credit program  agreed to accept lab results from subsidy applicants a decade ago  That move came after investors argued to U S  Treasury and IRS officials in 2007 that lab controlled tests make it easier to isolate how refined coal performs  eliminating complicating factors at play in a full sized boiler  according to David Lowman  a partner at law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP  who represented the industry in the negotiations  The IRS declined to comment on its decision   When issuing guidance  the IRS and Treasury invite comments concerning our requirements and  based on this  updates can be made to better administer the law   the U S  tax agency said in a statement  FAILING REAL WORLD TESTS Over the past decade  the IRS has handed out billions of dollars of refined coal subsidies to companies on the basis of test results that show they are producing a cleaner burning form of coal  The semi annual lab tests often don t reflect the reality at power plants  That s because plants generally do not operate under optimal conditions for reducing NOx while burning refined coal  according utility officials and power plant disclosures to environmental regulators  A typical power plant s NOx emission rate often fluctuates as operators adjust the flow of air to the combustion chamber and other equipment to meet demands on the facility to produce electricity  Coal that burns hot and fast during wide open air flow  for example   a setting used when demand surges   will produce more NOx pollution than coal burning at lower temperatures with lower air flow  In 2010  the IRS said it altered its testing requirements in a way that allowed labs to use different air control settings in the two different tests needed to compare refined coal to raw coal  according to a January 2011 article by two Ernst   Young executives in The Tax Adviser magazine  Although the agency s reasoning for the change was unclear  the article said the practical effect would be to make the tests easier to pass  The IRS and EERC declined to comment on the policy change  The EERC said in a statement to Reuters that it has used substantially reduced airflows while burning refined coal  resulting in lower NOx emissions for the same energy output  The price of emissions credits under the U S  cap and trade program can also influence a power plant s rate of pollution  Coal plants that purchase the credits are allowed to emit more pollution  and in recent years it has been cheaper to buy credits than to run pollution control equipment at peak effectiveness  As a result  a plant burning refined coal can see its NOx levels spike if pollution controls are turned down or off  regardless of the type of coal it burns  EPA data shows    Refined coal is just one of many factors that influence real time NOx levels   said Erin Culbert  a spokeswoman for  Duke Energy   NYSE DUK   the largest U S  utility  And when utilities decide to burn refined coal  tax credit investors   often Wall Street firms   have no control over how utility owners run their coal plants  Several utilities have told environmental regulators that they tried to demonstrate pollution reductions big enough to qualify for the subsidy at actual plants  but failed  according to their disclosures  During a trial run using refined coal at the Stanton Energy Center in Orlando  Florida  in 2010  NOx emission rates increased by 10 percent compared to raw coal  instead of declining  Two other trial runs at Stanton that year proved inconclusive  according to a copy of the results viewed by Reuters  The plant ultimately decided not to burn refined coal  according to regulatory filings  Stanton declined to comment for this story  Coal plants achieve most of their reduction in smog pollution through investments in other technology  including equipment that works like the catalytic converter in a car or truck to convert NOx into benign nitrogen and water  Or they cut pollutants by simply switching from coal to cleaner natural gas  or by using a mix of both fuels  The Brunner Island power plant in Pennsylvania  for example  reduced its NOx emission rate by 63 percent in 2017 compared to 2016  thanks to new natural gas burners and piping  said Todd Martin  a spokesman for Talen Energy  owner of the coal plant  Some utilities have conceded that they can t replicate the lab test results they use to win the subsidy at their power plants  St  Louis based utility  Ameren Corp   NYSE AEE  told regulators in 2013 that it was not confident that a 21 percent NOx reduction achieved by refined coal at EERC could be replicated in the field if it burned the product  according to correspondence with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources related to permitting for a facility near St Louis  Ameren has two plants in the state that have generated refined coal tax credits for Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Alabama based Coal Emissions Reduction Technologies LLC  investors in the facilities that produce clean coal ultimately burned by Ameren  Ameren declined to comment on refined coal s ability to reduce NOx  The Alabama investment group did not return phone calls seeking comment  The two plants burned 6 7 million tons of refined coal in 2017  according to EIA  At the 2018 tax credit amount of  7 03 per ton  using that much refined coal would yield nearly  47 million in annual tax credits  Ameren said it uses a number of different strategies to reduce pollution at its plants  including refined coal   Those strategies have resulted in   significant reductions in  sulfur dioxide   NOx and mercury emissions   Ameren said in a statement  Whelan Energy Center in Hastings  Nebraska  also burns refined coal  but mainly as a way to cut mercury emissions and to benefit from the subsidy  Plant officials never considered using clean coal for reducing smog pollution because they don t believe it s effective  said Marty Stange  environmental supervisor at Hastings Utilities  an owner of the plant   We never really looked at it for NOx reduction   he said  The laboratory testing is a much safer bet for companies to qualify for the refined coal tax credit  It s unusual for a clean coal sample to fail an emissions test in a lab setting  said Murray Abbott  president of Chem Mod LLC  the leading supplier of chemicals used for refined coal s emission reductions  Murray said plants usually can t reproduce the cuts his company s chemicals achieve in lab results because utilities typically run their plants with power production and costs in mind  not just emissions reductions   It s tough to show the same level of emission reductions at full scale   he said  GO TO LAB The EERC lab in Grand Forks is a popular destination for refined coal tax credit investors  according to contract disclosures by the school  Utility DTE  for example  paid EERC  581 000 to conduct an undisclosed number of refined coal emissions tests at its North Dakota lab in fiscal 2015 2016  according to EERC contract disclosures  DTE s refined coal operations generated  103 million in tax credits that year  according to DTE s annual report  DTE declined to comment on the testing of its coal at EERC labs  EERC was well placed to become the refined coal industry s laboratory for testing after the subsidy was adopted in 2004  EERC was officially founded in 1951 as the Robertson Lignite Research Laboratory  a federal facility under the U S  Bureau of Mines that tested the qualities of different types of coal  The  5 million in revenue EERC generated in the 2016 16 fiscal year amounted to 14 percent of its total grants and contracts  according to University of North Dakota budget disclosures   It s a fair chunk of work around here   said the EERC s Harju  Highlighting EERC s central role  Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota referred to its lab testing when he introduced legislation in February to extend the refined coal tax credit after it expires in 2021   This would not only benefit the coal generating power plants in North Dakota that use refined coal  it will also support the work of the EERC  which provides services to facilities around the nation to verify that the refined coal meets the standards required to claim the credit   Hoeven said in a press release  And in April  U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry named Harju to the National Coal Council  a federal advisory board for formulating coal policy  EERC s small test boilers are designed to mimic the performance of actual power plants  lab officials say  Its combustion test facility has an output capacity of less than 1 megawatt per hour  compared to at least several hundred megawatts per hour at a typical coal plant  The lab uses several devices to simulate pollution control equipment in place at a utility  such as scrubbers  Asked whether the boiler settings are fine tuned to improve refined coal s environmental performance  Harju said he was not an expert in such technical details  EERC declined to comment on how often its clients fail to pass its laboratory tests  but Chem Mod s Abbott said such failures are rare  EERC officials declined to provide further technical specifics about its testing process  
 We re just an independent validator of performance   Harju said   It s an arm s length effort  ",2018-12-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-little-lab-on-the-prairie-clears-path-to-big-clean-coal-profits-1710130,1710130

101320,322835,DUK,Two U S  coal miners see growth amid sector s gloom,news,"By Richard Valdmanis  Reuters    U S  electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal fired power generators in the coming years  extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry  But not every U S  coal company sees a bleak future   Ramaco Resources  O METC   which produces coal for steel mills  and Consol Energy  N CEIX   which supplies coal to larger power plants  have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks  President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation  But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy  Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline  Ramaco  for example  expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth  despite the slump in U S  demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators  And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal fired power into a strength  It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon   making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close   We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce   said David Khani  Consol s Chief Financial Officer   This isn t true for everyone   Consol  which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania  boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to  81 4 million  and it aims to bump that to  125 million in 2018  according to its filings  Ramaco  meanwhile  more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to  75 million  making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U S  mines  The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry  Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector  Overall  the U S  coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent  according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly traded miners   a rebound from years of steep declines  targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding  Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending   They re spending as much as they need to  to maintain production   said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan  U S  coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons  down from 1 17 billion tons a decade ago  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  NEW MINES Ramaco s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia  Virginia and Pennsylvania  said Randall Atkins  Ramaco s executive chairman   The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600 000 in 2017   The company said the downturn in the U S  thermal coal industry has little to do with its business  It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe   Met coal is a proxy for steel  which is in turn a proxy for a nation s GDP   Atkins said   The world finds itself economically in a good place   He said Trump s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market  but that foreign demand for U S  exports also remains strong  Ramaco s share price has been volatile since launching last year  It is trading at about  6 80  up from about  4 late last year after strong earnings estimates  But that s only about half of its share price last year  in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed  LEMONADE FROM LEMONS Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered  meanwhile  by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls  Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn  It plans to serve  very large  retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired   said CFO Khani   Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity  he said  providing room for growth   The EIA predicts that coal fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close  Industry wide  plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now  Consol   whose shares are up to about  31 a share from about  22 late last year   supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion  N D   Southern  N SO   Duke  N DUK  and DTE  N DTE   Both Consol and Ramaco applaud the Trump administration s pro coal stance  but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere

101343,322858,DUK,A year after Trump s election  coal s future remains bleak,news,By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    A year after Donald Trump was elected president on a promise to revive the ailing U S  coal industry  the sector s long term prospects for growth and hiring remain as bleak as ever  A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year   much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U S  coal rather than presidential policy changes  U S  utilities are shutting coal fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas  along with wind and solar power  And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U S  coal   We re not planning to build any additional coal facilities   said Melissa McHenry  a spokeswoman for American Electric Power  one of the largest U S  utilities   The future for coal is dictated by economics   and you can t make those kinds of investments based on one administration s politics    Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP s capacity for power generation  a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030   For a graphic on coal production  demand and employment  see    The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends  As some energy experts have said all along  the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office  A White House official did not respond to a request for comment  Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry  said Luke Popovich  a spokesman for the National Mining Association  which represents major U S  coal companies    The government is no longer against us   he said   We now only have market forces to contend with   Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election  The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan  meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants  ended an Obama era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands  ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams  and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement  Now Trump s Energy Secretary  Rick Perry  is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90 day supply of coal on site  The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants  a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable  While the full impact of Trump s coal policy could take years to understand  the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand  energy analysts and utility officials said   BACK 100 PERCENT  Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation  The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978  Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003   We re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent   Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016  So far  progress has been limited  U S  coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year  to 790 million tons  according to the Energy Information Administration  But 2018 output is expected to decline  The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51 900 in October  up about 2 200 since November 2016   but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak  according to the Labor Department  On November 1  Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet  saying   It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners   But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U S  coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia  according to James Stevenson  a coal analyst at IHS Markit  During the first six months of 2017  Asian countries took in 7 5 million short tons of U S  coal  up 97 percent over the same period in 2016  according to the EIA  That demand will soon fade  Stevenson said   We are not going to get a repeat of 2017   he said of the spike in exports   OBSOLETE  Forecasts from utilities and the U S  government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound  Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13 600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018  That follows a loss of nearly 8 000 MW this year and 13 000 MW in 2016  according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data   By 2025  coal fired power plant capacity will dip to 226 380 MW  down about 30 percent from 2011  according to EIA  Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close  bringing the number of plants that shut  or plan to  to 265 since 2010   a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain  according to the Sierra Club  which has campaigned against coal  Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power   and not by environmental regulations   Duke Energy   NYSE DUK   one of the country s largest utilities  has shut down more than 5 400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2 000 MW by 2024  Over the next decade  Duke plans to invest  11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power   and nothing in new coal fired generation  said spokesman Rick Rhodes  A Nov  2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis   which has two of the largest coal producers in its district  Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc   said coal fired power plants  may eventually become obsolete   Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook  Peabody expects a  modest number  of coal power plant retirements in the coming years  with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output  spokesman Vic Svec said  Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast   Robert Murray  the chief executive of privately held Murray Energy Corp   one of America s biggest underground miners   said Trump could do more for the industry  The administration  Murray said  should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health  But Trump s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives  which have bi partisan backing  And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so called  endangerment finding  on emissions that is the basis of many fossil fuel regulations  given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it  Murray Energy  meanwhile  announced on Oct  31 it will buy a 30 5 percent stake in a coal mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources  LLC  The deal might help the companies cut costs  but it s unlikely to help workers  Murray said about 200 of 1 000 jobs in Utah could be lost ,2017-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/a-year-after-trumps-election-coals-future-remains-bleak-846542,846542

101380,322895,DUK,Hurricane Irma poses toughest test for U S  nuclear industry since Fukushima,news,"By Scott DiSavino and Timothy Gardner  Reuters    Hurricane Irma will pose the toughest test yet for U S  nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011  Irma was on course to hit South Florida early on Sunday after slamming Cuba as a Category 5 storm  It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour  210 km per hour  on Saturday  but was expected to strengthen before reaching Florida  bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors  The National Hurricane Center s forecast track shows Irma making landfall on the southwest side of the Florida Peninsula  west of the two nuclear reactors at the Turkey Point plant   The operator  Florida Power   Light  FPL   has said it will shut Turkey Point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant  The reactors are about 30 miles  42 kilometers  south of Miami  FPL said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in Florida at St Lucie  which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state s east coast  about 120 miles  193 km  north of Miami   We will shut the reactors down 24 hours before Category 1 force winds are forecast to hit   FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy told a news conference  FPL said both Turkey Point and St Lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet  6 meters  above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges  But South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at Turkey Point  which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool  At Fukushima in Japan  an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown    The whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind  the real problem from my perspective is water   Stoddard said  He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors   The real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool   Peter Robbins  an FPL spokesman  said  Mayor Stoddard is wrong  Turkey Point is safe and is ready for Hurricane Irma   U S  nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since Fukushima  The U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost  Nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems   Things are better today than in March 2011  Time will tell whether better proves good enough   said Dave Lochbaum  director of a watchdog group  the nuclear safety project  at the Union of Concerned Scientists  The NRC said it was posting more inspectors at the two Florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in Georgia and South Carolina should the storm head that way  The NRC said the plants should not be compromised by Irma s storm surge   The storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites  designs   said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell  Both Florida plants have previously weathered major storms  Turkey Point took a hit from Hurricane Andrew  a Category 5 storm  in 1992  damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site  Repairs cost about  90 million  St Lucie withstood the back to back impact of Hurricanes Frances  Category 2  and Jeanne  Category 3  in 2004  FPL shut St Lucie last October as Hurricane Matthew skirted the Florida coast  Lochbaum said the NRC and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding  In January 2014  about 50 000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the St Lucie plant after a heavy downpour  An NRC study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after Fukushima  There is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in Florida which stopped operating in 2009  That is the Crystal River plant  owned by  Duke Energy  Corp  N DUK   Duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant  Once in storage  the fuel no longer needs cooling   The NRC s Burnell said Duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of Irma  He said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power  even though it has been shut for years  Irma is expected to disrupt much of Florida s power supply  FPL  the state s largest electric company  has warned Irma could cut service to about 4 1 million of its nearly 5 million customers  FPL is one of four large publicly traded utilities in Florida  Other natural disasters since Fukushima have shut some plants  An earthquake in Virginia in 2011 shut Dominion Energy Inc s  N D  North Anna plant for about 2 1 2 months  the time it took to complete a full damage

101381,322896,DUK,Irma knocks out power to nearly four million in Florida  utilities,news,"By Scott DiSavino and Jessica Resnick Ault
 Reuters    Hurricane Irma knocked out power to nearly 4 million homes and businesses in Florida on Sunday  threatening millions more as it crept up the state s west coast  and full restoration of service could take weeks  local electric utilities said 
Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm  the second highest level on the five step Saffir Simpson scale  but by afternoon as it barreled up the west coast  it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour  177 kph  
So far  the brunt of the storm has affected Florida Power   Light s customers in the states  southern and eastern sections  and its own operations were not immune  either 
 We are not subject to any special treatment from Hurricane Irma  We just experienced a power outage at our command center  We do have backup generation   FPL spokesman Rob Gould said on Sunday 
FPL  the biggest power company in Florida  said more than 3 2 million of its customers were without power by 10 p m   0200 GMT Monday   mostly in Miami Dade  Broward and Palm Beach counties  More than 200 000 had electricity restored  mostly by automated devices 
The company s system will need to be rebuilt  particularly in the western part of the state  Gould said   That restoration process will be measured in weeks  not days  
FPL is a unit of Florida energy company  NextEra Energy Inc   N NEE  
Large utilities that serve other parts of the state  including units of  Duke Energy  Corp  N DUK    Southern Co   N SO  and Emera Inc  TO EMA   were seeing their outage figures grow as the storm pushed north 
Duke s outages soared to 390 000 from 60 000 in a span of four hours on Sunday evening  and the company warned its 1 8 million customers in northern and central Florida that outages could ultimately exceed 1 million 
The company updated its website on Sunday evening with a warning to customers that outages may last a week or longer 
Emera s Tampa Electric utility said the storm could affect up to 500 000 of the 730 000 homes and businesses it serves  and over 180 000 had already lost power 
The utilities had thousands of workers  some from as far away as California  ready to help restore power once Irma s high winds pass their service areas  About 17 000 were assisting FPL  nearly 8 000 at Duke and more than 1 300 at Emera 
Tampa Electric told customers on Sunday  however  that response crews were halting work because of the high winds 
FPL said on Friday that Irma could affect about 4 1 million customers  but that was before the storm track shifted away from the eastern side of the state  Its customers are concentrated in Miami Dade  Broward and Palm Beach counties 
NUCLEAR PLANTS SAFE
The utility said its two nuclear plants were safe  It shut only one of the two reactors at its Turkey Point nuclear plant about 30 miles  48 km  south of Miami on Saturday  rather than both  because the storm shifted  It plans to leave both reactors in service at the St  Lucie plant about 120 miles  193 km  north of Miami because hurricane force winds are no longer expected to hit the sites 
There is also spent nuclear fuel at Duke s Crystal River plant  about 90 miles  145 km  north of Tampa  The plant  on Irma s current forecast track  stopped operating in 2009 and was retired in 2013 
In a worst case scenario  the spent fuel could release radiation if exposed to the air  but a federal nuclear official said that was extremely unlikely 
 That fuel is so cold  relatively speaking  it would take weeks before there would be any concern   said Scott Burnell of the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission

101458,322973,DUK,U S  stocks mixed  as strong jobs report provides support for rate hike,news,"Investing com    U S  stocks were mixed on a volatile  choppy day of trading after the release of arguably the strongest monthly national employment report on the year bolstered the case for a December interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve 
On Friday morning  the U S  Department of Labor said in its October national employment report that nonfarm payrolls surged by 271 000 last month  the largest increase since last December  The unemployment rate dipped by 0 1  to 5 0   while average wages soared by 0 4   sharply above consensus estimates of a 0 2  gain  Over the last 12 months  hourly wages have spiked by 2 5   their strongest annual increase in more than six years 
A rate hike  though  is largely viewed as bearish for U S  equities as investors pile into the dollar and fixed investments to capitalize on higher yields 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 70 points shortly after the release before rallying several times throughout the session to close in the green  At the close of trading on Friday  the Dow stood at 17 910 33  up 46 90 or 0 26  on the day  The Dow closed higher for the fifth consecutive week  The NASDAQ Composite Index also extended its streak of weekly gains to five after edging up 19 38 or 0 38  to close at 17 910 33 
The S P 500 Composite Index  meanwhile  fell 0 73 or 0 03  to 2 099 20  as six of 10 sectors closed in the red  Stocks in the Financials and Technology sector led  while stocks in the Utilities industry lagged  plunging more than 3 7  on the session  Utilities lose their attractiveness in higher rate environments  as rising debt level could impact their creditworthiness  Stocks in  Duke Energy  Corporation  N DUK   CenterPoint Energy Inc  N CNP  and Public Service Enterprise Group  N PEG  all fell by more than 5  on the day 
Financial stocks dominated the Dow  as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  finished as the top two performers of the session  Goldman Sachs gained 7 29 or 3 80  to 199 31  while JP Morgan added 2 03 or 3 05  to close at 68 47  Annual gains in both major banks still remain in the single digits for the year  The worst performer was UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  N UNH   which lost 1 71 or 1 47  to close at 114 52  United Health  one of the largest health insurers in the U S   closed as the worst performer on the Dow twice this week 
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was NVIDIA Corporation  O NVDA   which soared 3 88 or 14  to 31 59  after the Silicon Valley manufacturer of 3 D graphics processors crushed revenue and earnings expectations for its third quarter  Earlier on Friday  Nividia shares surged as high as 31 93 to reach a 52 week high  The worst performer was Delaware based pharmaceutical company Incyte Corporation  O INCY   which plummeted 15 71 or 13 45  to 101 05  after worse than expected results of a selective study on Epacadosat  its IDO1 inhibitor 
Nividia also finished as the top performer on the S P 500  just ahead of  Monster Beverage  1990 Corp  O MNST  which jumped 17 96 or 13 58  to 150 20  amid stronger than expected earnings attributed to its partnership with an international Coca Cola bottler  The worst performer was TripAdvisor Inc  O TRIP   which saw its quarterly earnings slump last quarter due in part to slower than expected display and click based advertising growth  Shares in Trip Advisor fell 5 49 or 6 61  to 77 62

101471,322986,DUK,U S  utilities worry about cyber cover after Ukraine grid attack ,news,By Jim Finkle  Reuters    U S  utilities are looking hard at their cyber vulnerabilities and whether they can get insurance to cover what could be a multi billion dollar loss after hackers cut electric power to more than 80 000 Ukrainians last month  The Dec  23 incident in Ukraine was the first cyber attack to cause a power outage  and is one of just a handful of incidents in which computer hacking has caused physical effects on infrastructure rather than the loss or theft of electronic data  A similar attack in the United States could cripple utilities and leave millions of people in the dark  costing the economy more than  200 billion  an insurance study estimated last year   Security experts  insurance brokers  insurers and attorneys representing utilities told Reuters that the Ukraine attack has exposed long standing ambiguity over which costs would be covered by insurance in various cyber attack scenarios    People in the insurance industry never did a great job clarifying the scope of coverage   said Paul Ferrillo  an attorney with Weil  Gotshal   Manges who advises utilities  Cyber insurance typically covers the cost of attacks involving stolen personal data  Some general property and liability policies may cover physical damage from cyber attacks  but insurers do not always provide clear answers about coverage for industrial firms  said Ben Beeson  a partner with broker Lockton Companies   That has led to some unease among U S  utilities   When you get these kind of headline grabbing cyber incidents  there is obviously a flurry of interest   said Dawn Simmons  an executive with Associated Energy and Gas Insurance Services  or AEGIS  a U S  mutual insurer that provides coverage to its 300 or so members   Getting a policy that includes cyber property damage is not cheap  Sciemus Cyber Ltd  a specialty insurer at the Lloyd s of London insurance market  charges energy utilities roughly  100 000 for  10 million in data breach insurance  The price balloons to as much as seven times that rate to add coverage for attacks that cause physical damage  said Sciemus Chief Executive Rick Welsh   INDUSTRY WARNINGS  Security experts have warned for several years that a cyber attack could cause power outages due to the growing reliance on computer technology in plants that is accessible from the Internet   In the Ukraine attack  hackers likely gained control of systems remotely  then switched breakers to cut power  according to an analysis by the Washington based SANS Institute  Ukraine s state security service blamed Russia for the attack  while U S  cyber firm iSight Partners linked it to a Russian hacking group known as Sandworm Team   Utilities are now trying to determine if they have insurance to cover these kinds of attacks  and if not  whether they need it  said Patrick Miller  founder of the Energy Sector Security Consortium  an industry group that shares information on cyber threats   American Electric  Power Company Inc  N AEP    Duke Energy  Corp  N DUK   Nextera Energy Inc  N NEE  and PG E Corp  N PCG  are among publicly traded utility companies that have warned of their exposure to cyber risks in their most recent annual reports to securities regulators  and that their insurance coverage might not cover all expenses related to an attack   Representatives with AEP  Duke and PG E declined to disclose the limits of their insurance  Officials with Nextera could not be reached for comment   The potential costs of an attack in the United States are huge  Last year Lloyd s and the University of Cambridge released a 65 page study estimating that simultaneous malware attacks on 50 generators in the Northeastern United States could cut power to as many as 93 million people  resulting in at least  243 billion in economic damage and  21 billion to  71 billion in insurance claims  The study called such a scenario improbable but  technologically possible    There are precedents  including the 2010  Stuxnet  attack that damaged centrifuges at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility and the 2012  Shamoon  campaign that crippled business operations at Saudi Aramco and RasGas by wiping drives on tens of thousands of PCs   In late 2014  the German government reported that hackers had damaged an unnamed steel mill  the first attack that damaged industrial equipment  Details remain a mystery  AMBIGUITY OVER COVERAGE  It s getting a little competitive just to get a carrier quoting your policy   said Lynda Bennett  an attorney with Lowenstein Sandler  who helps businesses negotiate insurance  Some insurers have cut back on cyber coverage in response to the increase in the number and types of breaches  she added  American International Group Inc  N AIG   for example  will only write cyber policies over  5 million for a power utility after an in depth review of its technology  including the supervisory control and data acquisition  SCADA  systems that remotely control grid operations    There are companies that we have walked away from providing coverage to because we had concerns about their controls   said AIG executive Tracie Grella  AIG and AEGIS declined to discuss pricing of policies  It seems likely they will find coverage more in demand after the Ukraine attack   A lot more companies will be asked by their stakeholders internally  Do we have coverage for this type of thing   said Robert Wice  an executive with Beazley Plc  which offers cyber insurance   Whether they actually start to buy more or not will depend on pricing

101493,323008,DUK,Dynegy cuts exposure to wholesale power with deals worth  6 25 billion,news,"By Anannya Pramanick
 Reuters    Power company Dynegy Inc  N DYN  said on Friday that it would buy coal and gas power plants for  6 25 billion to increase its presence in two less regulated eastern U S  markets 
Dynegy shares rose as much as 22 5 percent in early trading 
The deals for select assets of Duke Energy Corp  N DUK  and Energy Capital Partners will nearly double Dynegy s national generating capacity and allow the company to retail electricity in Illinois  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Michigan  increasing its exposure to the PJM and New England markets 
The acquisitions are the latest in a series of deals aimed at minimizing exposure to the volatile wholesale power market  and analysts expect consolidation to continue 
Earlier this year  Wisconsin Energy Corp  N WEC  said it would buy Integrys Energy Group Inc  N TEG  for  5 71 billion about two months after Exelon Corp  N EXC  agreed to buy Pepco Holdings Inc  N POM  for  6 83 billion to cut exposure to the wholesale power market 
 The structure of the PJM  Pennsylvania  New Jersey  Maryland  marketplace is more transparent and probably  in the long term  more beneficial to  power  generators   ISI Group analyst Jon Cohen said 
Dynegy emerged from bankruptcy in 2012  less than a year after its unit filed for protection from creditors  burdened by costly power plant leases    
The company said it intends to issue about  5 billion in new unsecured bonds and  1 25 billion in equity and equity linked securities to fund the deals 
At the end of June  the company had long term debt of about  1 97 billion 
Chief Executive Robert Flexon expects the deals to triple the company s 2015 adjusted EBITDA and add to free cash flow per share in 2015 and beyond 
Houston  Texas based Dynegy also expects to realize nearly  500 million in tax savings from the deals 
Dynegy will buy Duke Energy s non regulated Midwest commercial generation business for  2 8 billion in cash 
The business includes ownership interests in 11 power plants and Duke Energy Retail Sales  Duke Energy said

101512,323027,DUK,Why Duke Energy  DUK  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Duke Energy  DUK   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This electric utility has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 10  
For the most recent quarter  Duke Energy was expected to post earnings of  1 69 per share  but it reported  1 79 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 92   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 98 per share  while it actually produced  1 12 per share  a surprise of 14 29  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Duke Energy  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of  0 38  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 13  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-duke-energy-duk-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200500714,200500714

101530,323045,DUK,INTERVIEW Duke CEO sees nuclear front runners emerging,news,"  Duke CEO sees GE as less aggressive in nuclear space
   Says industrial power demand still down
 By Braden Reddall
 SAN FRANCISCO  June 24  Reuters    Duke Energy Corp Chief
Executive Jim Rogers sees Areva and Toshiba s Westinghouse
emerging as front runners in the design of reactors for a
much anticipated U S  nuclear revival 
 While Rogers felt there was room for more than one reactor
technology  he said GE Hitachi seemed to be overshadowed by the
aggressive approach of the other two firms 
  You re already starting to see a sorting out   he said in
an interview on the sidelines of a San Francisco meeting of the
U S  power industry  hosted by the Edison Electric Institute 
 Duke  the third largest U S  nuclear power provider  has
applied to build two Westinghouse reactors in South Carolina 
 But the company said last week it was also looking at
building a 1 600 megawatt reactor in Ohio with France s Areva 
along with uranium enrichment company USEC Inc and UniStar    a
joint venture of U S  based Constellation Energy Group Inc and
Electricite de France SA 
 Bringing in partners was vital given the cost of building a
reactor  Rogers said 
  To build one nuclear plant with our own balance sheet is a
 bet the company   move    he said  adding that there should be
more consolidation of the U S  power industry anyway given the
need for scale in general 
 He also said demand from industrial customers of Charlotte 
North Carolina based Duke remained weak due to the economic
slump   It s off  it s not coming     it s still off  
 Rogers  who has become a leading industry advocate for
 green  causes  argued that any utility s mix of energy should
be varied due to the risks involved in backing just one 
 Consequently  Duke  which is also the third largest U S 
producer of electricity from coal  is betting on carbon capture
and sequestration  CCS  technology to reduce coal s CO2 output
   despite lingering doubts about whether it will work 
  It s kind of like the nuclear renaissance also  which is
five to 10 years away   Rogers said of CCS 
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has received 17
applications to build 26 new reactors in the United States  The
nuclear industry expects to have four new reactors in service
by 2016 and as many as eight by 2018 
 Rogers said a big advantage of nuclear  particularly as
intermittent power sources such as solar and wind develop  was
the fact it provided power more than 90 percent of the time 
compared with less than 75 percent for coal plants 
 Duke owns and operates about 39 000 MW of generating
capacity in North America and Latin America  markets energy
commodities  and transmits and distributes electricity to about
4 million U S  customers in the Carolinas and the Midwest 
 Rogers  who has been a CEO in the power industry for two
decades  said there were very good business reasons behind his
public advocacy for energy efficiency 
  I want to be in a position when I ask permission to build
a nuclear plant that I ve done everything I can to reduce usage
on my system  so that I have credibility when I say I need a
nuclear plant

101532,323047,DUK,Duke Energy s Coal Ash Agreement Too Narrow  Advocates,news,"By    Duke Energy Corporation s  NYSE DUK  recent agreement to clean up a toxic coal ash spill in North Carolina and Virginia doesn t do enough to address questions about the utility s broader coal related pollution problems  clean water advocates say 
Duke  the nation s largest power company  signed an agreement on Monday with environmental and wildlife officials from both states requiring the utility to pay any  reasonable  cost associated with a Feb  2 sludge spill at its power plant near Eden  N C   the Associated Press reported  The accident sent coal ash  a byproduct of coal generation  floating down 70 miles of the Dan River  which also flows into Virginia  The agreement also requires Duke to foot the bill for continued monitoring by government agencies of the spill s impact on the area s aquatic ecosystem 
But it doesn t shed any light on what steps Duke might take to prevent future coal ash spills or to address current groundwater contamination at its other coal facilities in North Carolina   There s still the possibility that North Carolinians will be on the hook for the remainder of the cleanup   Amy Adams  the North Carolina coordinator at Appalachian Voices  told International Business Times 
Duke operates 33 ash dumps at 14 power plants across the state  which  together  contain more than 100 million tons of the byproduct  All of the facilities are located near rivers and lakes that supply towns with drinking water and all of Duke s unlined waste pits are contaminating groundwater  according to state environmental officials  Coal ash  which looks like a thick gray sludge  contains toxic heavy metals like arsenic  mercury and lead 
The utility said it spent  15 million to contain the Dan River spill and its immediate damages  and it told investors in an SEC filing that it doesn t expect the remaining cleanup expenses to be large  the Charlotte Business Journal noted  But Duke said it could cost up to  10 billion to change the way it stores and processes coal waste at all of its North Carolina facilities  an expense Duke could pass on to its electricity customers  Regulators are still assessing how coal ash is stored at the 14 plants    five of which received violation notices this spring for failing to secure storm water permits 
The agreement also leaves questions about where Duke will store all the coal ash it intends to remove from its other facilities  John Runkle  an attorney at NC WARN  a Durham  N C  based climate advocacy group  said   We re very concerned about any plans for the ultimate storage of that  waste    he said   We want to make sure that we re not just passing the problem on  
Advocates said they were  however  generally encouraged by Duke s cleanup agreement  largely because it continues to loop federal agencies like the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency into the response efforts  The utility and its state regulator  the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources  DENR   have both come under intense scrutiny after the Dan River spill raised concerns over their allegedly chummy ties  Just weeks after the accident  federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into DENR s relationship with Duke regarding its coal ash dumps 
 It gives at least some level of comfort that we re not just dealing with the same two entities that created this situation   Adams said  She added that agencies  are going to be looking at more than just the removal of the ash  They ll be taking a much more holistic approach   The agreement  is a good move for the health of the river  

Jeff Brooks  a spokesman for Duke Energy  said the agreement is  a positive step forward that will provide benefits to the Dan River basin   In response to advocates  concerns that the agreement leaves questions unanswered  he explained that it was never intended to address them 
 It doesn t encompass any action that will take place at our other facilities or encompass how the other coal ash basins will be managed   Brooks said   It s tied to assessing any damages along the  Dan  River and developing a cooperative plan for trying to remediate that  
He added that Duke is taking a  scientific  deliberate approach  to evaluating its next steps for each of its coal ash facilities in North Carolina 
Peter Harrison  a staff attorney at the Waterkeeper Alliance  said that Monday s agreement  is a good start  but we ll have to see where it goes  I think there s still cause for skepticism  given the utility s recent string of coal ash violations 
He noted that a separate coal ash decision was also reached this week  A federal court ruled that conservation groups represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center could proceed with their lawsuit against Duke  which accuses the utility of violating the Clean Water Act and polluting Sutton Lake  a public fishery near Wilmington  N C  The law center commissioned a study last year of the lake s fish that found deformities consistent with elevated levels of selenium  a toxic element in coal ash ",2014-06-11,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/duke-energy's-coal-ash-agreement-too-narrow:-advocates-289156,289156

101540,323055,DUK,Worried About Oil Peaking  Check Out These 3 Clean Energy Stocks,opinion,"Does it make sense to invest in traditional oil stocks when there is a clear shift to producing energy through clean sources  like wind and solar  The debate on that topic has been raging for almost a decade now  especially after the shale gas revolution in the U S 
A recent insight on the subject came from the world s biggest oil company   Saudi Aramco   SE 2222   which concluded its initial public offering  IPO  last week  valuing the company at  1 7 trillion  Global oil demand may peak within the next 20 years  according to an assessment included in the company s prospectus 
In the offering document  Aramco used a forecast from industry consultant IHS Markit Ltd  that sees oil demand peaking around 2035  Under that assessment  demand growth for crude and other oil liquids will be  leveling off  at that time  In a chart included in the prospectus  the Saudi oil giant showed global oil demand falling between 2040 and 2045 
A second demand scenario in the prospectus assumes a faster transition away from fossil fuels  In that case  oil demand is expected to peak in the late 2020s  just a few months away  Aramco acknowledged in the document that climate change policies  may reduce global demand for hydrocarbons and propel a shift to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels such as gas or alternative energy sources  
That kind of assessment from the world s leading source of oil clearly makes a strong case for investing in companies that are at the forefront of the clean energy revolution  Here are our three favorite stocks from this segment of the industry that long term investors would do well to stash in their portfolios

Among the clean energy producers  we like Bermuda based Brookfield Renewable Partners  NYSE BEP  because of its dominant position in the field and its diversified asset base Recent statistics bolster the case for BEP  The International Energy Agency sees continued strong growth in renewables through 2022  with renewable electricity capacity forecast to expand by over 920 GW   an increase of 43  Brookfield s diversity   it operates hydroelectric  wind  solar and biomass facilities among its other renewables operations   and depth  with 17 400 MW of capacity and 876 facilities in North America  South America  Europe  and Asia  give the company a broad array of services The partnership recently declared a quarterly cash distribution of  0 515 per unit  which is growing at a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of around 6   According to the company s latest earnings report  Brookfield Renewable Partners generated  590 million in funds from operations  FFO  in the first nine months of 2019  showing a 25 5  year over year jump Going forward  BEP expects its FFO per unit to keep rising at a CAGR above 10  through 2024  as it acquires more companies and adds more capacity to its clean power  As per its latest earnings report  Brookfield Renewable is targeting a sustainable distribution with increases aimed at 5 9  annually  on average Trading at  47 47 at Friday s close after surging 83  this year  BEP stock has proved to be a great bet for its investors  But we still like its annual dividend of  2 06  yielding 5 8   and its potential for future growth 
2  Nextera Energy
We like utilities for the long term for one simple reason  they invest billions of dollars to build assets which generate solid income for their investors  As long as customers continue to pay their utility bills  the cash will keep rolling in 
In this space  we particularly like Nextera Energy  NYSE NEE   the Florida based utility that has scaled up by providing clean energy  which will be hard for competitors to match  Nextera is the largest U S  provider of renewable energy  generating electricity from the wind and sun  It also operates a large natural gas pipeline business as well as a growing energy storage operation 
The big difference between Nextera and other traditional utility companies is that its growth wasn t funded by a massive injection of debt  Instead  the company very smartly used the government subsidies and tax breaks offered to clean power producers  It mostly sells the output to utilities  many of which must procure power from green sources to meet state mandates 
The utility plans to invest  40 billion on its development projects through the end of next year  This should help fuel growth  especially at a time when the renewable market opportunity is huge and the company has already scaled impressively  Half the power generating capacity added in the U S  in 2017 was wind and solar  according to the Energy Information Administration  versus 29  in 2010 
Nextera is expanding beyond its traditional utility customers to build wind farms and solar parks directly for large corporations  such as Google parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   some of which want to run facilities with green energy for financial and public relations purposes  the Wall Street Journal reported in June 
This mix of clean energy and energy storage businesses has rewarded investors handsomely  Shares closed Friday at  234 39  following their 127  jump in the past five years  With a dividend yield of 2 13   NextEra pays an annual dividend of  5 a share  The company plans to raise that by between 12  and 14  through the end of 2020 
3  Duke Energy
 Duke Energy   NYSE DUK  is another attractive option if you plan to boost your portfolio with a reliable utility stock which is expanding its clean energy operations  Following a major restructuring of its assets in recent years  the utility sold off its carbon based power assets and foreign operations  buying a natural gas utility and expanding its reach in renewable power 
Owning Duke shares makes sense for long term investors because the company s regulated business models make its cash flows predictable  meaning there s little risk of negative surprises  Duke has a  37 billion development plan to run until 2022 to support the company s inflation beating dividend growth 
Through its diversified power  gas and storage businesses  Duke plans to deliver between 4  and 6  annual dividend growth  The stock closed Friday s session at  89 76 after falling about 8  from its five year high reached in early October  offering a good entry point to investors who will get more yield  now 4 2   from the annual dividend of  3 78 
Bottom Line
Investing in clean energy stocks  in our view  is a safe bet if you pick the right stock with the intention to remain invested  As the shift away from traditional energy sources continues  these companies will gain more prominence in the energy mix and could become acquisition targets for established oil giants seeking more relevance in the rapidly changing environment ",2019-12-09,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/worried-about-oil-peaking-check-out-these-3-clean-energy-stocks-200491085,200491085
101561,323076,DUK,DAVOS Hard times mean hard nosed M A for those with cash,news,"By Ben Hirschler
 DAVOS  Switzerland  Jan 30  Reuters    Mergers and
acquisitions will get a fillip from consolidation in hard hit
industries despite the financial downturn  as the strong eat the
weak 
 M A business has slumped in the past year but companies with
strong balance sheets are out bargain hunting 
 Business leaders meeting in Davos this week said they saw
opportunities in the global downturn  though leverage is out and
a hard nosed focus on cost cutting is the order of the day 
  We re going to see further waves of consolidation as weaker
players are taken over by stronger players   said Mark Foster 
global head of management consulting at Accenture 
  The retail industry is going to go through a big
consolidation phase  as will the consumer goods  pharmaceuticals
and communications industries  
 With economies around the globe tipping into recession and
credit markets gummed up  the volume of mergers worldwide
dropped 30 percent last year  according to data from Thomson
Reuters 
 That decline isn t going to reverse any time soon but Pfizer
Inc s  68 billion deal to buy Wyeth  announced on Monday  shows
big deals    especially where they offer big cost reductions   
can still be done 
 In the same sector  Roche Holding AG on Friday launched a
hostile bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it doesn t
already own  at a lower price than one offered in July 
 These moves are likely to spark more M A in healthcare 
where cash flows remain strong despite deep seated structural
problems due to a  cliff  of patent expiries 
 Other potential predators  however  will not fare so well 
 Dow Chemical Co CEO Andrew Liveris    a Davos veteran    was
notable for his absence in the Swiss ski resort this week  after
failing to close his firm s planned acquisition of rival Rohm
and Haas Co by a deadline of Jan  27 
 
 MORE OPPORTUNITIES
 Bankers and executives say the recession presents openings
for cash rich suitors in a number of industries 
  The big sector  obviously  in terms of restructuring  is
financial services   said Blackstone Group senior managing
director John Studzinski 
  There is also an enormous amount of work in energy and
infrastructure     I think that trend will continue  
 Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers is among those watching closely
for the chance to buy attractively priced assets 
  The opportunities will only increase over time and we re
always looking for opportunities to strengthen our position   he
said 
 Elsewhere  software maker Adobe Systems Inc said it would be
 aggressive  with small acquisitions this year  medical devices
maker Medtronic Inc plans a series of bolt on purchases and
electronics retailer Best Buy Co is eyeing bankrupt store
locations 
 With cash now upper most in executives  minds  deal makers
will be wary rather than gung ho 
  There will be a lot of opportunities  The key question is
what is good to do for the good of the company and I think we
should be very cautious about opportunities and not run too
fast   said Maurice Levy  head of French advertising giant
Publicis 
 Acquisition finance remains tight and many private equity
firms are no longer able to fund deals through cheap debt  which
plays into the hands of companies with internally generated
funds  according to Tony Poulter  global head of consulting at
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
  CEOs are focusing on the fact that this is a good time to
gain market share but clearly they are not got to do it at any
price   he said 
  I think people are going to be looking for opportunities
but they are obviously more risk averse  They are going to want
to be confident that the opportunities are secure and
well priced

101562,323077,DUK,REFILE GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Rebuilding risk portfolio,news," Refiles to change date to March 27 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  March 27  Reuters    Investors will look to rebuild
risk portfolios next week as an expected euro zone interest rate
cut and a G20 summit are likely to buoy world stocks which are
on track for their best monthly gain ever 
 World stocks  measured by MSCI  have risen nearly 5 percent
this week  gaining 21 percent since hitting a 5 1 2 year low
earlier this month and on track for one of their strongest
monthly performances on record  The cost of insuring sovereign
and corporate bond debt against default has also eased sharply 
 Quantitative monetary policy easing by the world s major
central banks  Washington s latest bank bailout plan and
tentative improvement in forward looking economic data have all
contributed to increasing investor risk appetite 
 In what investor George Soros said is a  make or break
event   Group of 20 leaders are expected to discuss detailed
measures to combat the worst economic crisis since the 1930s
with financial regulation and fiscal stimulus set to be on the
top agenda 
 Also next week  the European Central Bank is expected to cut
interest rates by half a percentage point to a record low of one
percent  The region s policymakers have said the central bank
could start buying corporate bonds in an unorthodox measure to
support the economy 
 The MSCI world equity index has gained three weeks in a row
as the first quarter comes to an end  However  year to date it
is down more than 8 percent  reflecting broad underweight
positions held by investors  
  With the stabilisation of several leading indicators 
stable volatility and investors strongly underweight  the equity
rally can develop further into Q2   said Cyril Beuzit  global
head of interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas 
  Quantitative easing and attempts to ring fence toxic assets
currently held in the financial sector balance sheet have
improved the chances of the economy rebounding  and the
combination of these two measures may unblock credit flows  
 Central banks in the United States  Japan  Britain and
Switzerland have all moved to adopt unconventional monetary
easing measures  which prompted government bond yields to fall 
 
 INCOME STRATEGY
 Falling government bond yields have made the relative
valuation of equities more attractive than that of bonds 
 According to UBS  the trailing dividend yield on the
European equity market  excluding financials  stands at 5 2
percent  This compares with a 10 year euro zone government bond
yield of 3 1 percent 
 Even if dividends were cut by 30 percent  these stocks still
yield more than government bonds 
 And dividends are gaining more investor interest at a time
when interest rates and bond yields are hitting rock bottom 
 Credit Suisse says its long term data shows that reinvested
dividends are the main driver of total returns  Seventy two
percent of total returns in the United States and 92 percent in
Britain have come from reinvested dividends 
 The Swiss bank estimates that for the first time in more
than 50 years the dividend yield of the U S  stock market is
higher than the 10 year Treasury yield and more than two thirds
of European stocks and nearly half of U S  stocks have a
dividend yield above their government bond yields 
 The risk for pursuing investment income via holding stocks
with higher dividends is that companies could slash dividends to
bolster balance sheets 
 Credit Suisse says dividends have fallen so far by 20
percent in Europe and the United States  Assuming earnings fall
to as far below trend as in previous downturns and an average
payout ratio  the bank expects U S  dividends to have a further
15 percent downside  with 25 percent in Europe 
 U S  companies with a dividend yield above 3 percent with
what Credit Suisse reckons as having a sustainable dividend
included Duke Energy  Pfizer  Intel and Microsoft 
  Not only do high dividend yield stocks tend to outperform
when markets are falling  they also outperformed in the first
year of the last bull market   the bank said in a note to
clients 
 Pan European stocks yielding more than 4 percent  rated
 buy  by UBS  include BP  RWE  Novartis and Rio Tinto 
 Barclays Capital also recommends buying energy  materials
and industrial sector stocks  which also work as hedges against
inflation 
 It also recommend overweight investment grade credit  Within
this sector  the bank favours overweighting senior financial
debt  particularly in Europe 
  We believe that an increase in portfolio risk exposure is
warranted   Tim Bond  head of asset allocation strategy at
Barclays  said in a note to clients 
  The underlying fundamental trend in the credit cycle has
swung towards a slow easing of conditions  a trend that
government fiscal and monetary policies are likely to amplify 
Credit easing regimes are invariably associated with improving
risk appetite  ",2009-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/refile-global-markets-weekahead-rebuilding-risk-portfolio-40153,40153
101563,323078,DUK,3 Utility Stocks That Could Power Higher After Their Q3 Earnings Reports,opinion,"With the Federal Reserve having already cut interest rates twice this year  utility stocks considered defensive dividend income investments have soared as the group tends to outperform in a low interest rate environment 
The sector s main ETF  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU   was the market s top sector performer in the third quarter  gaining 11  and outpacing the S P 500 s 8  increase over the same timeframe  The ETF is up 21  since the start of the year 

NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization  reported better than expected third quarter results on Tuesday  Oct  22  sending its shares soaring to a fresh all time high  We highlighted NextEra in last week s post as a utility stock to watch  
Delving deeper into the sector  here are three stocks with strong upside potential to consider ahead of their quarterly earnings reports 
 
1  Duke Energy
 As one of the largest electric and natural gas utilities in the U S    Duke Energy   NYSE DUK  provides electricity to almost eight million retail customers in six states across the Southeast and Midwest regions  
Shares of the Charlotte  North Carolina based corporation ended at  95 32 on Tuesday  not far from their recent 52 week high of  97 37 reached on Oct  4  giving it a market cap of roughly  69 5 billion    

Duke Energy next reports earnings before the U S  market opens on Nov  8  Consensus calls for earnings per share  EPS  of  1 69 for the third quarter  up from EPS of  1 65 in the same period a year earlier  Revenue is forecast to rise almost 8  YoY to  7 13 billion  
The stock surged around 10 5  so far in 2019  as investors flock to the attractive dividend yield in the face of falling interest rates  The corporation now has one of the highest yields in the sector after it recently increased its quarterly cash dividend by almost 2  to  0 945 per share  This represents an annualized dividend of  3 78 and a yield of 3 96   
 
2  Southern Company 
 
The second largest utility provider in the U S  in terms of customer base is Southern Company  NYSE SO   Through its subsidiaries  it serves nine million gas and electric utility customers in six states across the southern U S 
Shares  which are up around 40  year to date  closed at  61 44 yesterday  not far from a record high of  62 36 touched on Sep  24  At current levels  the Atlanta  Georgia based giant has a valuation of roughly  64 2 billion 

Third quarter earnings are scheduled to be released on Oct  30 ahead of market open  Consensus calls for EPS of  1 16  up from earnings of  1 14 per share in the year ago period  Revenue is forecast to total  6 19 billion  compared to sales of  6 16 billion in the same quarter a year earlier 
The stock s hefty dividend payout and attractive yield make Southern an even likelier candidate to outperform in the months ahead  The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of  0 62 per share  This represents an annualized dividend of  2 48 and a yield of 4 06  
3  Dominion Energy 
 
Dominion Energy  NYSE D  is a power and energy supplier serving more than five million retail energy customers in seven states across the Midwest  mid Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U S 
Shares are up nearly 16  since January 1  reaching a fresh 52 week high of  83 23 yesterday  before closing at  82 82  The market cap is currently  66 5 billion 

The Richmond  Virginia based company  is expected to publish third quarter earnings ahead of the market open on November 1  Consensus estimates call for the utility provider to post earnings of  1 14 per share  down a penny from EPS of  1 15 in the year ago period  Revenue  however  is forecast to grow a whopping 30  from the same quarter a year earlier to  4 48 billion 
In February  Dominion declared that it was increasing its quarterly cash dividend by almost 10  to  0 9175 per share  This represents an annualized dividend of  3 67 and a yield of 4 47   making it an extremely attractive play at a time of declining rates ",2019-10-23,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-utility-stocks-that-could-power-higher-after-their-q3-earnings-reports-200476452,200476452
101564,323079,DUK,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Duke Energy  DUK ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Duke Energy  DUK   This company  which is in the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This electric utility has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 38  
For the last reported quarter  Duke Energy came out with earnings of  1 12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 98 per share  representing a surprise of 14 29   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 21 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 24 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 48  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Duke Energy  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Duke Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 12   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 8  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

101566,323081,DUK,Duke Energy  DUK  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Duke Energy  DUK  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 82 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 89  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Duke Energy 
For Duke Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Duke Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Duke Energy would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  14 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

101593,323108,DUK,Is Duke Energy  DUK  Outperforming Other Utilities Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Utilities space have likely heard of Duke Energy  DUK   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Utilities peers  we might be able to answer that question 
Duke Energy is one of 121 companies in the Utilities group  The Utilities group currently sits at  5 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  DUK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DUK s full year earnings has moved 1 56  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Our latest available data shows that DUK has returned about 9 75  since the start of the calendar year  Meanwhile  the Utilities sector has returned an average of 4 80  on a year to date basis  This means that Duke Energy is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
To break things down more  DUK belongs to the Utility   Electric Power industry  a group that includes 65 individual companies and currently sits at  72 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 21 50  so far this year  so DUK is slightly underperforming its industry in this area 
Investors in the Utilities sector will want to keep a close eye on DUK as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-duke-energy-duk-outperforming-other-utilities-stocks-this-year-200470321,200470321
101594,323109,DUK,What Makes Duke Energy  DUK  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Duke Energy  DUK   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Duke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if DUK is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this electric utility holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For DUK  shares are up 1 04  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 0 29  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 03  compares favorably with the industry s 1 88  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Duke Energy have increased 8 63  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 55  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  0 99  and 3 69   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to DUK s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  DUK is currently averaging 2 808 329 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with DUK 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DUK s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 92 to  4 98 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that DUK is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Duke Energy on your short list ",2019-10-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-duke-energy-duk-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200471077,200471077

101638,323153,DUK,This Little Known Class Of Stocks Will Thrive As Rates Go Down And Volatility Up,opinion,"An entire class of high yield stocks just got a big boost 

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced last Wednesday that the central bank will cut interest rates by 0 25  
But we expected this  Investors had already priced in a 100  probability that the Fed would cut rates  according to global brokerage CME Group 
This is the second rate cut in the last three months  But it s only the beginning 
As I ll explain shortly  I expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates two more times this year 
This is great news for a special class of high yield stocks called preferred stocks  That s because preferred stocks surge when interest rates fall 
Stocks That Are Sort of Like Bonds
Let s start with the basics  There are two main types of stock  common and preferred 
When you own preferred shares  you own a slice of the company  And the value of that slice the share price can go up or down over time  In that sense  it s just like owning common stock 
However  preferred stocks also pay a fixed dividend  This makes them a bit like bonds   More on bonds in a moment  
Not all publicly traded companies issue preferred shares  It s most common among banks and other financial firms 
Also  you don t need to jump through any special hoops to buy preferred shares  They re accessible through an ordinary brokerage account 
So what s the trade off 
Well  preferred stocks generally have less upside than common stocks  But they generally also have less downside  This can be a great thing when stock market volatility is rising 
A Good Way to Steady Your Portfolio
Income investors should own some preferred stocks for two key reasons 
First  preferred stocks tend to be much more stable than common stocks 

HSBC  NYSE HSBC  provides a good example of this  Take a look at the company s preferred and common shares over the last year in the chart below 
As you can see  its preferred shares  the black line  have fluctuated far less than its common shares  the green line  




This kind of stability isn t limited to HSBC  It s the norm for preferred stocks  This is why they can help stabilize your overall portfolio 
US stocks have been on a roller coaster ride over the past few months  making this all the more important right now 
The second reason to own preferred stocks is their high yields 
Yields 3X Higher Than Most Stocks
I focus on safe and reliable dividend paying stocks 
Preferred stocks fit that bill  That s why I keep around 5  of my portfolio in preferred stocks 

The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF  NASDAQ PFF  is a good proxy for preferred stocks in general 

As you can see in the table below  PFF s dividend yield is almost two thirds higher than the yield on the iShares Select Dividend ETF  NASDAQ DVY   our proxy for high dividend common stocks 

PFF s yield is also over three times higher than the yield on the S P 500 




Remember  preferred stocks pay a fixed dividend  usually every month or quarter  This makes them a bit like bonds  And the company must satisfy these payments before it pays a dividend on its common stock 
Like bonds  preferred stocks are also very sensitive to interest rates 
When interest rates rise  the value of preferred stock falls  The opposite is also true  When interest rates drop as they have recently the value of preferred stock goes up 
Interest Rates Will Keep Dropping
If you own preferred stock  interest rates are your friend right now 
Here s why 
The Fed kept interest rates near 0  from 2008 to 2016  This made it much cheaper for businesses to borrow money  pushing up the prices of things like houses and stocks 
Then between 2016 and 2018  the Fed started to hike interest rates 
Eventually  the weight of higher rates and the Fed signaling they would head even higher became too much to bear  The combination pushed stocks down 20  from October to December last year 
The big market selloff seemed to spook the Fed into abandoning higher interest rates  I expect it to cut rates two more times before the end of the year 
Again  this is great news for preferred stocks  Let s take a look at three of your top options here 
Three Preferred Stocks to Buy Now
One of the best ways to buy preferred stock is through an exchange traded fund  or ETF 

SPDR Wells Fargo Preferred Stock ETF  NYSE PSK  is a great way to go  The fund holds preferred stocks from banks like Citi Group  PNC Financial  NYSE PNC   and HSBC  It also pays a 5 8  dividend yield  Plus  PSK has a low expense ratio of 0 45   So you re not losing money to excessive management fees 

The First Trust Preferred Securities and Income ETF  NYSE FPE  is another good choice  The fund is mostly made up of real estate preferred shares from companies like Emera Inc   NiSource Inc  NYSE NI    and Catlin Insurance Company  It also pays a 5 6  dividend yield  This ETF is very liquid  trading an average of 1 1 million shares per day 

Last  we have the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF  NYSE PFXF   The fund mainly holds utility preferred stock like AT T  NYSE T    Duke Energy   NYSE DUK   and Southern Company  NYSE SO   It also pays a 5 2  dividend  The company also has the lowest expense ratio of the bunch at 0 41  
You might recall that I told readers to buy preferred stock back in April  ahead of the recent rate cuts  With more cuts looming  now is the time to add these stable  high yield stocks to your portfolio if you haven t already ",2019-10-01,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-littleknown-class-of-stocks-will-thrive-as-rates-go-down-and-volatility-up-200469554,200469554

In the last three weeks we have seen the stock break through the ceiling of resistance and move higher  however  not perhaps with the conviction one might wish  Note the falling volume and in last week s price action the stock rallied to  95 70 before closing at  93 90 on a deep wicked candle with high volume so we can expect some short term weakness 
Long term with the deep platform of support now in place and with the price action approaching a low volume node on the VPOC indicator  this is one stock I expect to continue higher and confirmed by the trend monitor indicator which has now reverted to bright blue on the weekly chart  Analysts will be looking toward the next earnings release on November 1 with a forecast of  1 73 against  1 65 for the equivalent quarter in 2018  and which if achieved should help to drive further momentum into the stock ",2019-09-16,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duke-energy-breaks-out-but-lacks-conviction-200465100,200465100

101704,323219,DUK,3 High Yielding Utilities To Hedge Your Volatile Portfolio,opinion,"High yielding stocks are looking increasingly attractive as fear driven investors buy up US Treasuries and plummet their yields  In these rocky markets high yielding utility stocks provide you with not only a robust yield  2  5  generally   but they also help hedge your portfolio against the broader market risk with their exceptionally low betas that won t track with the rest of your portfolio 
The past 2 weeks have been the most volatile markets that we have seen since January  The escalating trade war and global economic cool down are weighing on investors  decisions  The inverted yield curve is a product of investor fear  The Federal Reserve s Fed Funds rate  overnight rate  is keeping short term rates steady around 2  while distressed investors are buying up long term bonds pushing those yields down 
The inverted yield curve is causing more fear in the market and accentuating the inversing even further in an endless cycle of panic  Below is the current yield curve for US Treasury Bonds 

Here is what that same yield curve looked like 1 year ago today  a relatively normalized yield curve  

Most investors will tell you that this is a sign of an impending economic downturn but the only thing this shows me is fear and an impending economic slowdown may very well come from this self fulfilling prophecy 
Below I have provided some safe portfolio options for these times of market distress and uncertainty 
Dominion Energy    NYSE D   
I have had my eye on dominion for some time now  getting in and out of at prices level I was comfortable with  I had the solace of a 5  dividend knowing that if the price didn t bounce I would still be made whole  Dominion has remained a very steady investment growing roughly 6  in 2019 
Dominion operates in 18 states and serves over 17 5 million customers  The firm has secured earnings for more than 95  of its assets insuring that its profits are safe  The company is investing a  26 billion in existing infrastructure which is expected to drive 5  additional earnings in perpetuity 
This stock has a significant amount of regulated earnings making this investment low risk and the 5  dividend is much more attractive than the 1 5  yield that the 10 year treasury bond is providing 
Duke Energy    NYSE DUK   
Duke energy has been trading in a tight range over the past 52 weeks  roughly half that of the S P 500  The stock has only seen about 5  growth since the beginning of the year  which is underperforming the industry and the market 
The 4 2  dividend and  12 beta make this stock quite attractive in this era of high volatility and low yields 
Duke is planning on investing  37 billion over the next 4 years  which is expected to produce an additional 6  earnings growth over the next 5 years
NextEra Energy    NYSE NEE   
NextEra is a leading clean energy supplier in the US and has outperformed its industry as well as markets with returns over 28  so far this year  This stock has seen unbelievably consistent grow  with its 2019 low on the first day of the year and hit its all time high today  This stock doesn t seem to be phased by market volatility and still provides investors with a savvy 2 4  dividend 
NextEra energy is exactly what its name describes  the next generation of energy  More than 50  of this firm s energy is generated from a renewable source or nuclear powerplant  while the remaining 46  is generated gas natural gas  The company is expected to have a compounded annual growth rate of 6  8  through 2021 
This stock may not provide the same ultra high dividend that Dominion and Duke grant  but it gives investors the most dependable upward moment with very little effect from the broader markets 
Take Away
In this time of uncertainty  it is prudent to ensure that your portfolio is properly hedged against significant downfalls  These three utility stocks will give your portfolio a boost in yield and lower your overall beta

101705,323220,DUK,2 Dividend Stocks That One Could Buy Even In A Recession,opinion,"The urge to sell your stocks and move on the sidelines is hard to resist when the word  recession  starts grabbing the headlines and the value starts plunging 
Wednesday was one such day when U S  stocks suffered one of the deepest sell offs of the year  The S P 500 dropped almost 3  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 800 points in its worst rout of the year 
While equities recovered mildly in Thursday s session  the underlying driver of the losses was more significant  What made investors believe recession might just be round the corner was a strong signal from the bond market  where 10 year Treasury notes briefly yielded less than 2 year Treasury notes 
This  inversion  of the yield curve is generally taken as a warning sign that the economy is about to slow down or contract  This fear is in the back of investors mind  especially after ten years of non stop expansion since the global financial crisis 
But a recession  when and if it comes  doesn t mean that every sector of the market will suffer  The good news is that Investors who have been building their income portfolio may get better opportunities to further add to their positions 
To help you better prepare for the possible recession  or a major economic slowdown  we have picked the following two dividend stocks that you can buy now to add some stability to your portfolio 
1   Duke Energy  
Utilities are generally more stable stocks  as consumers will continue to need gas and electricity even the worst of economic contractions  That s the reason why investors rush into utilities in times of uncertainty  these companies offer higher dividends and steady cash flows 

All charts powered by TradingView
In this space  we like Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  due to its attractive dividend yield and diversified operations  which are well positioned to produce steady cash flows 
The company has a  37 billion development plan to run until 2022 to support the company s inflation beating dividend growth Through its diversified power  gas and storage businesses  Duke plans to deliver between 4  and 6  annual dividend growth 
The stock  which has gained almost 10  in the past 12 months  yields 4 24   That translates into  0 945 a share quarterly dividend 
That kind of return will look quite juicy if we re entering a persistently low interest rate environment as indicated by the bond market where the yield on the government 30 year bond has fallen below 2  for the first time on Aug  14

Consumer staple is another area of the market where investors take refuge when the risk of a recession rises  The logic behind this move is simple  while cutting back spending on vacations and other luxury items  consumers are highly unlikely to stop buying toothpastes and dish washing soap 





Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   the multinational consumer staple manufacturer  is a stock we recommend when volatility drives markets and investors seek slow but steady capital growth with regular dividend payments 
After a remarkable run of the past 12 months that sent PG stock soaring 44   this name doesn t come cheap  At 23  P G s forward price to earnings multiple is getting closer to the highest level in the past five years  But the company s growth momentum suggests that shares of the maker of Bounty paper towels  Gillette razors  and Tide laundry detergent have still more room to run 
In its most recent earnings report in late July  P G reported its best quarter of organic sales in more than a decade  Organic sales growth  which excludes items like acquisitions and currency effects  expanded a higher than expected 7  in P G s fiscal quarter  far surpassing last year s 1  growth  The company beat its 4  organic sales growth target for the fiscal year by a full percentage point 
Yielding 2 58  per annum  P G pays  0 745 a share quarterly dividend which has been rising consistently 
Bottom Line
A recession is  no doubt  a time when prudent investors should reduce their risks and avoid investing in stocks whose fate is closely tied with economic growth  But if you re a long term investors aiming to generate passive income  any market downturn could present opportunities to buy solid dividend paying stocks  Utilities and consumer staples are the two defensive areas of the market that could offer you this opportunity ",2019-08-16,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-dividend-stocks-that-one-could-buy-even-in-a-recession-200455713,200455713

U S  Bancorp s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past three months  gaining  1 9  vs  a decline of  1 4   Further  the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  having beaten expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
The company s second quarter 2019 results reflect elevated interest and fee income  partly mitigated by higher costs and provisions  The Zacks analyst thinks U S  Bancorp will likely get support from its solid business model  core franchise  relatively higher interest rates and diverse revenue streams  
Further  strategic acquisitions and rising loans and deposit balances have strengthened the company s balance sheet  However  escalating costs due to its ongoing investments in technology and likely increase in legal expenses remain concerns  Also  significant exposure to commercial loans remains a headwind for the company

Shares of Duke Energy have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining  12 2  vs  12 1   Duke Energy ended second quarter 2019 on a solid note  with both earnings and revenues exceeding expectations  It invests heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects  It expects to invest about  37 billion in its overall growth projects in the 2019 2023 time frame  
The Zacks analyst thinks this investment plan will drive earnings base growth in its combined electric and gas businesses by approximately 6   over the next five years  However  the company already has a notable long term debt of  54 3 billion as of Jun 30  2019  compared with  51 1 billion at 2018 end

These products coupled with restructuring in the Consumer Health unit have strengthened Glaxo s competitive position  We are encouraged by the company s initiatives to focus on its oncology pipeline  
However  stiff competition  genericization and pricing pressure on key drugs in the Pharma segment are hurting sales  Particularly  pricing pressure and competitive dynamics are hampering sales of Glaxo s respiratory products 
Importantly  a generic version of its top selling drug Advair has been launched  which is significantly eroding the drug s sales  Also  competitive pressure on HIV drugs is rising in 2019

Energy   NYSE DUK    NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE    Dominion Energy   NYSE D   and Southern Company   NYSE SO   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Florida Braces for Hurricane Dorian  Utilities in FocusHurricane Dorian continued to batter the coasts of Bahamas on Sep 1 and 2  bringing in heavy rains and wind gusts exceeding 200 miles an hour  per The Wall Street Journal   It hit the Bahamas as a category 5 hurricane but has now weakened to a category 4 storm per the U S  National Hurricane Center s  NHC  latest update The hurricane   deemed as the strongest this year so far in the world   is projected to make landfall in Florida on late Tuesday and then in Georgia  North and South Carolina in the following days Impact on UtilitiesIn times of natural calamities like hurricanes  the  sector tends to suffer  The rampage caused by heavy winds and catastrophic flooding affects transmission lines  forcing thousands to deal with power cuts  Notably  the National Weather Service has warned of hurricane strength winds  several feet of storm surges and the risk of dangerous flash floods along much of the Florida coastline in the coming days No doubt  once the catastrophic storm hits the coast of Florida  utilities  operations in the state will suffer  resulting in widespread power outage  Considering the fact that Florida is the third most populated city of the United States  demand and subsequently consumption of electricity is also high  Therefore  some of the top utility players of the United States have significant operations in this state   Dorian s estimated impact on the state s properties is expected to hamper the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines Utilities in FocusWe have handpicked a few Utility players that have operations in Dorian s expected pathway and are thus expected to bear the brunt of the storm  In fact  a few of these utilities have announced their emergency infrastructure strengthening initiatives  These utilities carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which makes them worthy of retention in investors  portfolio  You can see  Duke Energy  This electricity provider expects Dorian to bring tropical force winds that will cause significant damage to its infrastructure and widespread power outages due to flying debris  fallen trees  downed poles and lines  Thus  the company has put nearly 6 500 transmission and distribution personnel in place to support power restoration in Florida  which is nearly three times the typical number of crew in the state NextEra Energy  Its subsidiary  Florida Power   Light Company  expects that a large portion of its service area will be impacted by Dorian and may experience power outages for potentially prolonged periods  Thus  it has arranged for nearly 16 000 personnel to work on restoration and is working to get more resources from across the country before the storm s landfall Dominion Energy  This Zacks Rank  3 stock has extensive operations in the Carolinas  Per media sources  it has arranged for 40 tree contractors and plans to bring in extra line workers to help with the storm s aftermath Southern Company  This company s largest electric subsidiary  Georgia Power  is reportedly monitoring the storm  adjusting plans for response and coordinating with emergency partners  including the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and the National Weather Service  It has already activated its storm command center in Atlanta  GA Bottom LineThere s no doubt that utilities in Dorian s expected pathway are doing their best to restore power in the event of an outage and taking necessary infrastructural initiatives to weather storm effects  However  restoring power after a massive storm can be extremely challenging due to strong winds and widespread flooding  Thus  the infrastructural strength of these utilities will be put to test when the hurricane actually hits  Their share price may also take a hit Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated  150 billion in this industry every year  more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana Now that 8 states have fully legalized it

101744,323259,DUK, 2 Step  Retirement Blunder To Avoid,opinion,"I run into a lot of investors who think retirement investing is a two act play 
In Act 1  when you re younger  you try to balloon your nest egg with high risk growth stocks that pay little  and often no  dividends 
Then  in Act 2  as you near and enter retirement  you pivot to the big dividends you need to pay your bills 
Trouble is  this approach exposes you to far too much risk  so today I m going to show you a better way 
Your Best Play  Big Dividends and Growth Right Now
I m talking about 10 funds that can hand you dividends up to 9 8  right now  plus annual returns of 10  or more 
More on those and one  in particular  that should be on your short list now shortly 
For now  these funds all have one thing in common  beyond their outsized dividend payouts   they invest in utilities  a group of stocks whose high dividends tend to grow over time  thanks to rising demand for power  water and life s other essentials 
I know what you re thinking  how the heck can these funds get dividends up to 9 8  from utilities  The big names in the sector like Southern Company  NYSE SO    Duke Energy   NYSE DUK  and   American Electric  Power  NYSE AEP  yield 4 3   max 
I ll explain in just a few seconds more  First  let me tell you what these funds are not  ETFs 
The benchmark Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  offers diversified utility exposure  sure  But it yields just 3  today though its dividend is growing  albeit slowly  
XLU s Sleepy Payout Growth  
If you have time  buying and holding XLU will get you yield much bigger than 3  on your original investment  Say  for example  you bought the fund a decade ago today you d be pocketing a 6 7  yield on your initial buy  thanks to the growth of XLU s price and dividend 
  Builds Your Yield Over  a Long  Time
But we don t want to wait 10 years to get a 6   yield  We want those payouts today and as I said off the top  there are 10 unique funds that can get us there right now 
Financial Freedom in a Flash
The secret   in particular those that hold utilities  Yields of 6   and yes  even 9 8   are common in this space  as is the potential for bigger total returns than you d see from individual utility stocks or ETFs 
Let s do a quick dive into how this is possible with CEFs  Then I ll reveal those 10 utility CEFs paying up to 9 8  in just a few seconds more  I ll also show you a standout utility CEF pick a fund boasting a growing 7 4  dividend that s demolished the sector as a whole in the past decade 
How CEFs Pay Massive Dividends
CEFs issue a fixed number of shares to invest in a particular asset class or sector  and those shares trade on the open market  As a result  a CEF s market price is often higher or lower than the net asset value  NAV  of the assets in its portfolio 
Here s the upshot  when a CEF s NAV is higher than its market price  you not only get those assets at a discount  but you also get the dividend at a discount  since the fund managers are mainly focused on the yield on NAV  That can boost a CEF s yield considerably 
Let me show you how this works 
Right now   tracks 10 CEFs specializing in utilities  Each pays a dividend much higher than XLU  with yields on their market prices ranging from 6  to 9 8   And because of their different discounts  the yield on NAV these funds need to earn to sustain those payouts can vary considerably 

Let s zero in on the Macquarie Global Infrastructure Total Return Fund  MGU   with a 13 02  discount to NAV  That means it only needs to earn 6 31   its current yield on NAV  to sustain its 7 4  yield  on market price  
That s partly why MGU been able to sustain its payout and grow it almost three times faster than XLU in the last decade 
A 7 4  Dividend That s Growing Like a Weed 
With its big discount  MGU is one of the more appealing utilities funds  But how has it performed in the long run 
Very well indeed 

This chart shows the long term annualized return  either 10 years or since inception  whichever is shortest  of each fund 
MGU ranks third  despite having the largest discount of any utilities fund  While that discount is slightly smaller than MGU s long term average  the difference is so small as to not be a worry  That s also a big contrast from the BlackRock  NYSE BLK  Utilities Infrastructure and Power Opportunities Trust  BUI   with an 11 1  premium that s far ahead of its long term average 5 2  discount to NAV 
Plus  MGU has crushed XLU  the benchmark utility ETF 
MGU Tops the Utility Sector
The bottom line here is pretty clear  by going the CEF route and through MGU  in particular shareholders have grabbed a bigger  faster growing income stream and larger total returns than the  safe  index investor 
5 More Big Dividends  8    the ETF Companies Hate 
There s a simple reason why you never hear about CEFs in the media or from your adviser  the ETF companies throw huge marketing dollars at  dumb  funds like XLU 
I say XLU  and other ETFs  are  dumb  because they use a computer algorithm to track an underlying index in XLU s case  a market cap weighted basket of utilities that mainly trade on the S P 500 
But ETFs pay off for the big fund companies with no management team to pay  the money these funds bring in is mostly profit  But as I just showed you with MGU  ETFs often underperform high yielding CEFs with a veteran pro at the top 
And dividends 
ETFs aren t in the same league as CEFs  especially when you consider that XLU is the cream of the ETF dividend crop  The popular SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is even worse  with a pathetic 1 8  payout 
So let s look past the marketing hype with 5 other CEFs I want to show you today  They come from across the economic spectrum  with the exception of utilities  which makes them a great fit with MGU  
Here s what you get with this high yielding CEF  5 pack   which   
Massive dividends I m talking 8   on average  with the highest yielder of the bunch above 9  
Incredible performance  One of these picks delivered a 929  return since inception  nearly 5 TIMES the market s return in that time 
Outstanding discounts These funds all trade at big discounts to NAV I m talking 10  and even 11 3  setting us up for big upside  I m forecasting 20   price gains in the next 12 months

What s Next for Duke Energy

The previous post highlighted the strong level which had developed around the  91 price per share  and which continues to hold firm  Here we have moved to the daily timeframe where we have two significant coincident levels  The first of these is the volume point of control denoted with the yellow dashed line  and the second is the blue dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator  One is based on volume and the other on price  The yellow dashed line represents the fulcrum of the market for this stock  in other words  the market is in price agreement  This represents the heaviest transacted volume on the chart  and therefore we expect to see further consolidation and resistance as the stock approaches this region  And the same principle applies to the blue dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator  which signals by its width the strength of such of region  Here again  this is a very well developed area  and therefore it was no surprise to see the stock bounce off the  90 area as both levels came into play simultaneously  The good news from a longer term perspective is that once price breaks through and away from this area  a strong trend will develop with excellent areas of support and resistance then coming into play ",2019-07-02,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/price-and-volume-levels-cap-advance-for-duk-200436308,200436308

101786,323301,DUK,Duke Energy Continues To Build Resistance At  90 ,opinion,"Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  is another stock where levels are now pivotal to any future progress higher  and much as for GE  it is the volume point of control and resistance overhead which are the defining the technical picture and likely to continue to do so for the near future on the daily chart 
In this case  it is the cluster of two regions at  90 per share which are helping to pin the stock to a very tight trading range around the volume point of control below  As we can see from the chart  one of these levels is blue and much wider than the second which is red and less strong  However  acting in tandem this is an immensely strong ceiling of resistance which has already been tested several times over the last few weeks  as each effort to rally is repulsed  The accumulation and distribution indicator for NinjaTrader delivers these levels automatically increasing them visually in width each time a level is tested and duly holds firm 
Below at  89 20 sits the volume point of control confirming the heaviest concentration of transacted volume with further deep regions below and above and presenting significant barriers to any move higher or lower  If this stock is to rally further  then the ceiling of resistance at  90 has to be breached and on excellent volume  If it is  the door will then be open to a sustained move through  91 50 and beyond  supported by the trend monitor indicator which remains firmly bullish ",2019-07-17,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duke-energy-continues-to-build-resistance-at-90-200440552,200440552

101788,323303,DUK,Duke Energy  DUK  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Duke Energy  DUK  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 69 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 49  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Duke Energy 
For Duke Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 09  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Duke Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Duke Energy would post earnings of  1 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  2 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Duke Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duke-energy-duk-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200447192,200447192
101816,323331,DUK,Here s What Will Cause The Next Recession ,opinion,"Each of the last three recessions contained elements of extraordinary financial instability  For example  Savings   Loan  S L  institutions used federally insured deposits to make reckless real estate loans in the 1980s  When the Federal Reserve raised its overnight lending rate more than 300 basis points between March 1988 and March 1989  a real estate bubble burst  hundreds upon hundreds of S L s fell apart  and the 1990 1991 recession damaged livelihoods 

Not surprisingly  one finds comparable patterns of financial senselessness in the late 1990s and again in the mid 2000s  Never before levels of margin debt had been employed in the late 1990s to participate in dot com mania  When the Greenspan Fed raised interest rates 200 basis points to contain the stock market s  irrational exuberance   the Internet bubble popped  millions of tech workers lost their jobs  and the 2001 recession hindered economic well being 

Were things really any different by the time we arrived at the housing bubble s bursting  Banks heedlessly served up subprime loans to nearly anyone with a pulse and a pen  When the Federal Reserve raised its overnight lending rate more than 400 basis points between the summer of 2004 and the summer of 2006  the residential housing balloon exploded  the subprime catastrophe worsened  and the Great Recession slammed hundreds of millions of Americans 

It is easy to see why so many people want the Fed to refrain from raising rates ever again  Whenever the Fed has embarked on a rate hiking campaign in the recent past  bad events have followed 
What scores of easy money cheerleaders ignore  however  is the real reason behind the scenes of the disastrous outcomes  Specifically  the Fed s manipulation of lower rates for extended periods inflates stock  bond and real estate values  fostering a wealth effect  Yet that same wealth effect is subject to monstrous reversal when hyper inflated asset bubbles rupture 

Maybe the financial system is much stronger this time around  Or maybe the Fed has learned its lesson from past mistakes and will act much faster to curtail an unwinding of the  wealth effect  
However  there s a problem with the assumption that the Federal Reserve will be successful in saving stocks  bonds and real estate going forward  Specifically  the credit cycle itself is in jeopardy 
Consider a substantial area of vulnerability  leveraged loans  In the Federal Reserve s own Financial Stability report  the central bank called out the  1 trillion market and its declining credit standards  Indeed  it would seem to be a larger problem than the  650 billion in  subprime  
Put another way  the risky area of corporate debt has doubled since 2010  Similarly  the number of companies requiring these loans  1000 plus  has surged 56  since 2010 

On a global scale  floating rate loans to companies with bad credit and high debt to earnings ratios have reached  1 3 trillion  Not only is that twice the leveraged loan market from last decade  it is twice the size of the  subprime  peak 
There s also the issue of investors throwing in the towel  It may not be an exodus at this juncture  but the trend has been less than friendly 

An equally challenging circumstance  The proliferation of BBB rated investment grade debt  In fact  in a market of  6 trillion plus  nearly 50  of the debt rests at the lowest possible rating  BBB  to be considered  investment grade   Just one notch above  junk  
The concern is that a tidal wave of downgrades from  investment grade  to  junk  would make it far more expensive for those companies to raise money  They might be forced to dilute their stock shares by issuing stock to shore up balance sheets  Or cut dividends  Indeed  any action to reduce debt and to improve or maintain a rating would likely hurt corporate stock performance 

Surely  households are doing well  right  Employment data show that employees are working  Consumer data show that people are consuming 
An issue at the household level  People are spending money that they do not have  Non housing consumer debt  which includes revolving credit  auto loans and student loans  has soared more than 50  since the Great Recession 
Is  4 trillion really something to sneeze at  We are talking about  4 trillion in non mortgage interest and principal that goes on for an indefinite length of time   obligations that would become particularly challenging if a recession knocked these folks out of the employment seat 

Granted  the mainstream media are going to focus on the topsy turvy world of tariffs and trade  They cannot ignore 700 point intra day sell offs on a Monday in May  can they 
What they are missing  though  is the notion that the China U S  trade dispute is not the reason for the recession that people may fear  The trade war might be  or might not be  the catalyst  or the pin  that pricks the  Everything Bubble  already in existence  Indeed  it is the severity of a  wealth effect reversal  that will cause the next recession 

Should the trade war get out of hand  many will be calling for the Fed to slash interest rates  And it s not like market cheerleaders aren t already lobbying for the Fed to backstop any additional financial market declines 
As I emphasized in The Attractiveness of a Defensive Stock Strategy and Why Modest Risk Renting Will Outshine Extreme Risk Taking  there are more attractive risk reward paths than blind faith in 100  equity allocations  I ve talked about my preference for low volatility in ETFs like Invesco S P Mid Cap Low Volatility  XMLV   I ve discussed the ways that non cyclical sectors like Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  and Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  would be worthy on a relative basis  while recognizing the high valuations 
Some of my best producers continue to be in the hybrid camp  Higher quality preferred stock like Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   DUKH  5 125  Junior Subordinated comes to mind  ETF fans should look into VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials  PFXF

101819,323334,DUK,Duke Energy s Attempts To Rise Blocked By Strong Resistance,opinion,"If you ve ever wondered about the power of support and resistance based on price action  then look no further than Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  which has seen its efforts to rise repeatedly brought to a halt as the very well defined ceiling of resistance at  91 comes into play  time and time again  However  it is this aspect of technical analysis when combined with an understanding of volume and price that its true power is revealed and in particular during late April and early May 
At this time there was a further attempt to breach this strong region of price resistance as denoted by the blue dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator which develops these lines ever thicker  the more they are tested and so give a clear signal of both strong and less strong levels  Late April saw this level tested once more  but note the volume associated with the two green candles   it is low to average on both  The price action itself suggests weakness with the deep upper wicks to the candles  but with the volume confirming the lack of buying  the resistance level simply adds yet further confirmation to this already weak picture 
Last week s price action once again was on average volume suggesting this weakness remains in the ascendancy as the stock trades around the  88 per share price  Below there is little well developed price support with only weak potential platforms at both  87 and  85 80  and with low volume nodes on the Quantum volume point of control indicator for NinjaTrader extending down to the  83 per share area  this looks likely to be the next stopping point in the longer term  Moreover  with the trend monitor now in a transitional phase of dark red  the outlook for Duke does not look encouraging ",2019-05-29,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duke-energy-and-the-power-of-support-and-resistance-200425852,200425852

101822,323337,DUK,Sector ETF Week In Review  Market Trends Towards Defensive Sectors ,opinion,"Sector ETF Week In Review For June 10 14
Summary
Defensive sectors won the day last week 
The longer term table is mixed  but aggressive and defensive sectors are performing on equal terms 
Investors should maintain a defensive posture 
The market is still trending towards defensive sectors  Investors are advised to over allocate towards utilities  staples  and real estate  Health care   another defensive sector   is mixed due to increased talk of regulation and generally negative press 
Let s start with last week s performance table 

Overall  7 10 industries rose  but the pace of increase was less than impressive  Consumer discretionary   2 34  led the pack  indicating a potentially aggressive stance  However  defensive sectors  utilities  staples  and real estate  fill out the top four  Technology   a key sector for bulls   was off marginally 
The 1 month table is defensive as well 

Basic Materials are higher  not due to increasing global growth  in fact  there is continued weakness in trade which is a net negative for the sector  but lower interest rates  But like the 1 week table  defensive sectors fill out the top four spots  Tech and discretionary s performances are modest at best  Once again  Energy is down 

The 3 month table is mixed  The top four spots are half aggressive and half defensive  However  staples  the top performing sector  rose 1  more than discretionary  which holds the number two spot  and real estate is only underperforming technology by 50 basis points  spots three and four   In other words  from a performance perspective  the results are fairly evenly mixed between bullish and bearish sectors 
Let s take a deeper look at the top ten stocks of the key defensive sectors  starting with consumer staples 

All the charts above are for the 6 month time frame  With the exception of the tobacco companies  Altria  NYSE MO   middle row  far left and Philip Morris  NYSE PM   bottom left   all are in solid southwest to northeast upward sloping patterns  The corresponding moving averages  20 day in blue and 50 day in red  all show strong bullish trends 
The 10 largest components of the utility sector also have bullish charts 

With the exception of Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   top row  second from right   all the above charts are either rallying or in the process of consolidating sideways  With the markets believing that the Fed is now more likely to cut rates  expect this sector to move sideways as a worst case scenario 
Let s next look at the XLV s 10 largest holdings 

Because of negative press  high prescription drug prices  high health insurance costs  increased talk of nationalizing health care from the political left   this sector s charts are mixed  Three issues  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   top row  far left  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   top row  second from right  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  middle row  far left  are bearish  Four charts  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   top row  second from left  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK   and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   middle right charts  are bullish  The others are mixed 
Finally  there are the nine largest members of the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ   the largest holding is a Vanguard Fund  

With the exception of Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   middle row  far right   the nine largest members of the VNQ are all rallying  Note the strength of the moving averages  again  with the exception of Simon Property Group  each 20 line  in blue  and 50 line  in red  is moving higher  with the 20 above the 50 and prices using the moving averages for technical support 
The above data is very clear  defensive sectors have the strongest bid in the market  With the exception of health care  the largest components of each respective ETF have solid charts and are moving higher

101849,323364,DUK,Here s What Will Cause The Next Recession,opinion,"Financial professionals frequently opine that asset prices are a function of economic conditions  Assets like stocks  bonds and real estate rise in value when the economy is expanding  They fall in value when the economy contracts 
The problem with those statements is that they represent a flawed understanding of 21st century credit cycles  In particular  recessionary pressures did not cause the tech wreck  2000 2002  nor the housing collapse  2008 2009   rather  the bursting of each asset bubble sparked the recession that followed 
Let s examine the respective timelines 
In the latter half of the 1990s  the Federal Reserve s easy money policies became even easier when the central bank slashed rates to contain the Asian Currency Crisis  1998   The Fed then scrambled to restrict the ubiquitous use of credit by rapidly tightening overnight lending rates from 1998 s low of 4 75  to May of 2000 s pinnacle of 6 5  

Perhaps  unfortunately  the dot com balloon had been pricked  3 2000   The severe price depreciation  particularly in tech stocks  led to consumers feeling much less wealthy and to businesses laying off millions of employees  Importantly  the stock bear occurred a full year prior to the recession s inception in 2001 
What about the Great Recession in 2008  After many years of extremely loose monetary policy on the part of the Fed  tightening of the overnight lending rate topped out at 5 25  in 2006  Housing prices peaked at that very same time  They began dropping in earnest by 2007  Meanwhile  financial stocks via SPDR Financial Select Sector  NYSE XLF  fell 20  in 2007 

Once again  an asset bubble had burst  And a wealth effect reversal was underway  triggering a recession where millions lost their livelihoods and hundreds of millions slowed their consumption to a crawl 
In the same vein  then  the next recession will not cause stocks to plunge 30   40  or 50  in value  Rather  when the  Everything Balloon  pops  real estate prices will drop significantly and stocks will fall precipitously  The severity of the wealth effect reversal will trigger the next recession 
It is critical for investors to understand that the Federal Reserve knowingly and deliberately sparks psychological wealth effects  Members on the Fed s Open Market Committee  FOMC   particularly previous chairs like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen  believe that actively encouraging higher asset prices increases the confidence of consumers and businesses  In turn  people spend more  aiding economic expansion 
What many FOMC members do not understand  or do not discuss  is how ultra accommodating monetary policy creates more than wealth effects  It also creates asset bubbles  And when an asset bubble inevitably bursts  a wealth effect reversal eviscerates an economy 
Consider how household net worth as a percentage of economic growth used to be relatively stable   See the orange semi circle below   After backing away from the  gold standard  in the 70s and shifting toward a consumption based economy in the 80s  policymakers have consistently banked on credit to fuel conspicuous consumerism  The problem  Unsustainable wealth effects reverse themselves once asset bubbles explode 

Effectively  ultra loose monetary policies keep the cost of credit exceptionally low for an extended period of time  The Federal Reserve s active manipulation fosters a wealth effect  but it also fosters an asset bubble  When the balloon inevitably pops  corporations batten down their hatches  unemployment surges and consumers rein in their consumption  This is the way that recessions happen today 
Why do older investors need to concern themselves with recognizing the pattern  For one thing  near retirees and retirees cannot afford to spend many years getting back to a break even point with their portfolios  In order to maintain their standards of living  most will require inflation adjusted rates of return that are much greater than what the 21st century has delivered thus far 
Take a look at the SPDR S P 500 Trust  SI SPY  With dividends reinvested  its real return is less than 3  
Keep in mind  we have 2 9  real returns as we sit atop all time record highs for stocks on the back side of the longest bull market in history  Eventually  the  Everything Balloon  will tear  exacting a hefty toll on the annualized percentages 

There s more  Near retirees and retirees are not going to invest 100  of their portfolios in stocks alone  Yet real returns for total bond market assets are in the same general area as real returns for stocks since 2000   Naturally  those bond assets traveled a less risky path  
However  the Federal Reserve s determination to depress the cost of credit forevermore limits the prospects of bond returns in the future  Can a total bond index be counted on for 3  real returns over the next 20 years when the nominal yield for a 10 year Treasury is 2 5   Hardly  Even the manipulation of bond yields lower has limits 

For scores of folks looking to maintain their standards of living throughout retirement years  real returns of 2 9  are not likely to be sufficient  Perhaps it will need to be 3 9  or 4 9  
Sadly  due to Federal Reserve policy  this will not be achieved in risk free CD savings  Nor is it likely to occur by holding a 60 40 mix of stocks and bonds for the next 20 years 
Indeed  there are harsh consequences of Federal Reserve activism  Near retirees and retirees will need to be more active to meet their inflation adjusted rate of return requirements 
They re going to have to sell some stuff to limit the bearish outcome of the bursting of the  Everything Balloon   Similarly  in the depths of recessionary despondency  they re going to need the wherewithal  and principal  to buy great stuff at huge discounts 
Granted  it may not be possible to  time  market based decisions perfectly  Nevertheless  there are simple methods that have beaten  or matched  the market over time with far less statistical risk  e g   drawdown  Sharpe  Sortino  etc   
For now  my near retiree and retiree client base participate in upside gains  but with decidedly less risk than chasing the dragon  On the stock side of the ledger  I am opting for dividends and defense with ETFs like iShares MSCI Minimum Volatility  USMV   Vanguard High Dividend  VYM  and Invesco S P MidCap Low Volatility  XMLV  
On the income side  I employ  preferreds  from companies whose investment grade debt profiles are several steps removed from  junk  status  Think Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK  5 125  Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2073  DUKH  and or Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK   Inc  5 75  Junior Subordinated Debenture due 2052  SWJ   At this precarious moment in time  I am also fond of the ultra short term income ETFs that produce 2 35  2 55  like Invesco Ultra Short Duration  GSY  and JP Morgan Ultra Short Term Income  JPST

101882,323397,DUK,Investors Brace For The Impact Of The Economic Reality,opinion,"2019 has been a strange year so far  On Wall Street  everything has been coming up roses for investors up to this point  Stock prices have risen more than 10 percent year to date  and the horrible crashes of late last year are quickly fading from memory  Meanwhile  the real economy is literally falling to pieces right in front of our eyes  Debt delinquencies are at unprecedented levels  bankruptcies are soaring  retail stores are closing at a record pace  this is the worst economy for farmers since the early 1980s  exports are plummeting and a brand new real estate crisis has now begun  Economic cancer is rapidly spreading throughout our country  and the U S  economy is deteriorating at the fastest pace that we have seen since the last recession  So how long will it be before Wall Street catches up with economic reality 
The retail industry is being hit particularly hard  At the end of last week  major retailers announced 465 store closings in a single 48 hour period 

The  retail apocalypse  is alive and well this week with major chains such as Gap  JCPenney  Victoria s Secret and Foot Locker  NYSE FL  all announcing massive closures  totalling the death of more than 465 stores over the last 48 hours 

And those closings already bring the grand total for 2019 to  a whopping 4 309 store closures  

That builds on recent store closure announcements by Gymboree  Payless ShoeSource  Charlotte Russe and Ann Taylor parent company Ascena Retail  to name a few  A whopping 4 309 store closures were announced by retailers just in the first two months of this year  Coresight Research said in a research note on Friday  That s well ahead of the number of announcements the market research firm was tracking this same time a year ago  it said 

The term  retail apocalypse  is being thrown around so frequently these days that it has almost lost its meaning  but the worst is yet to come 
Meanwhile  layoffs are starting to come fast and furious now  For example  I was recently made aware of major job cuts that just happened in North Carolina 

Duke Energy Corp  NYSE DUK   eliminated 1 900 positions in its latest round of job reductions  largely through voluntary buyouts but with some involuntary layoffs included 

For the first time since the last recession  I think that it is time to start visiting sites like Daily Job Cuts on a regular basis once again  Millions of Americans lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009  and a lot of you can still remember how painful that was 
In the middle of the country  the big news is  the farm apocalypse   Last week  we learned that farm debt has now jumped 30 percent since 2013 

 Farm debt has been rising more rapidly over the last five years  increasing by 30  since 2013   up from  315 billion to  409 billion  according to USDA data  and up from  385 billion in just the last year   to levels seen in the 1980s   Perdue said in his testimony to the House Agriculture Committee 

As a result of this giant mountain of debt  a ton of small and mid size farms are going under  As I noted the other day  farm debt delinquencies have now reached the highest level that we have witnessed in 9 years 
I really don t understand the people that are telling us that everything is going to be okay 
Everything is not okay  and things are getting worse with each passing day  ISM s manufacturing survey just hit the lowest level in 26 months  and for a whole bunch more extremely ominous economic numbers please see my previous article entitled  18 Really Big Numbers That Show That The U S  Economy Is Starting To Fall Apart Very Rapidly  
Of course  it isn t just the U S  that is hurting  Up north  Canada is literally teetering on the brink of recession 

The Canadian government shocked the professional financial and economic media with their latest fourth quarter GDP release showing the economy has essentially come to a grinding halt at 0 1  growth 

And over in Europe  things are arguably even worse  Germany is supposed to have the strongest economy in the entire region  but they are also right on the brink of recession 

The country s economy just escaped entering recession territory last month  with GDP growing at just zero percent following a 0 4 percent contraction in the previous three month period  But Germany could be just weeks away from a recession threatening double whammy as a potential no deal Brexit and Donald Trump s warning to hike car tariffs by up to 25 percent could send the economy tumbling  Chancellor Angela Merkel s ministers have entered into a frantic plan to avert an economic catastrophe which could end Europe s biggest economy s golden growth for a decade 

This is a global economic slowdown  and many believe that it will be even worse than what we experienced in 2008 
But as I have previously warned  we aren t just heading toward an economic storm  Everything that can be shaken will be shaken  and that includes our governmental institutions 
On Sunday  we learned that the House Judiciary Committee is opening an investigation into obstruction of justice by President Trump  The following comes from Reuters 

The House Judiciary Committee will seek documents from more than 60 people and organizations as it begins investigations into possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Donald Trump  the panel s chairman said on Sunday 
Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told ABC s  This Week  the panel wanted documents from the Department of Justice  the president s son Donald Trump Jr  and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg  among others 

This is going to be a year of great governmental shaking  And no matter which side emerges victorious from the legal struggles and from the election of 2020  the truth is that our governmental institutions will never be the same again 
From 2016 through 2018  America experienced a time of relative peace and prosperity  and a lot of people out there were convinced that this bubble of unsustainable false prosperity could continue indefinitely 
Now it is becoming very clear what is ahead of us  and a lot of people are starting to freak out ",2019-03-04,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investors-brace-for-impact-as-the-cancer-that-is-ravaging-the-real-economy-start-200394245,200394245
101883,323398,DUK,Global Utilities ETF  JXI  Hits New 52 Week High,opinion,"For investors seeking momentum  iShares Global Utilities ETF  is probably on radar now  The fund just hit a 52 week high  which is up roughly 14 2  from its 52 week low price of  46 42 share 
But are more gains in store for this ETF  Let s take a quick look at the fund and the near term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed 
JXI in Focus
The fund looks to track the S P Global  NYSE SPGI  1200 Utilities Sector Index  which measures the performance of companies that are part of the utilities sector of the economy  Nextera Energy  Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  and Dominion Energy are the top three holdings of the fund  Countries like United States  60 88    United Kingdom  6 53   and Spain  6 23   get the top three geographic allocation  It charges 47 bps in fees  see   
Why the Move 
The dovish Fed in 2019 has put a check on the rise on bond yields  This in turn has favored a rate sensitive and high yielding sector like utilities  Not only in the United States  rates are likely to remain subdued globally given growth worries  This kind of environment normally benefits utilities investing 
More Gains Ahead 
The fund has a   which hints at more gains  So  there is definitely still some promise for those who want to ride on this ETF a little longer  However  if U S  China trade tensions are resolved  there is likely to be growing appetite for risks  which may go against this safe haven fund

101886,323401,DUK,5 Standout Utility Stocks For A Durable Portfolio,opinion,Upbeat economic growth coupled with a healthy labor market is expected to lift prices of goods and services in the United States  And the Fed is expected to tackle inflation by hiking interest rates  This will invariably lead to an uptick in fixed income yields  Utility stocks  in the meanwhile  better known as bond substitutes  are likely to take a hit  However  this isn t the scenario as utility stocks have retained their glory After all  inflation has remained relatively contained  U S  consumer prices increased marginally last month  supporting the case for the Fed to hold off further hiking rates in the near future  The consumer price index increased 1 5  from year ago levels  while core inflation that excludes volatile items like food and energy costs  rose 2 1   The Fed stated that the central bank will stick to its patient stance on monetary policy as long as core inflation continues to be near 2  In fact  analysts polled by International Business Times see no rate hike in Fed s March meeting  The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 2 25 2 50  at its upcoming policy meeting  It s also worth mentioning that the Fed kept rates unchanged at its Jan 29 30 meeting Moreover  utility companies being capital intensive have high levels of debt  Hence  a low interest rate environment will help such businesses clear debt and book profits  Conversely  higher interest rates along with increased debt  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  will impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to increased cost of operations Coming back to inflation  it shouldn t rise anytime soon as technology giants continue to suppress inflationary pressure  Just look at how Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   is building pressure on all consumer products  So  with inflation remaining subdued  utility stocks have huge room to rally  Here s a list of five of them that are worth a look  American Electric PowerAmerican Electric Power Company  Inc    NYSE AEP   engages in the generation  transmission  and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers in the United States  This electric public utility

Chicago  IL   April 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Energy Transfer   NYSE ET    Williams Companies   NYSE WMB    Cabot Oil and Gas   NYSE COG    Duke Energy Corp    NYSE DUK   and TransCanada Corporation   TO TRP   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Will Trump s Orders Revamp the U S  Pipeline Industry 
In a bid to boost the U S  oil and energy sector  President Trump is set to sign a couple of executive orders to fast track oil and gas pipeline projects  Making good on his campaign promises  Trump is likely to overhaul some environmental permits to mitigate the roadblocks on energy infrastructural development and aid the energy companies to avoid unnecessary red tape 
Well  this is not the first time that Trump will be intervening by signing new orders to expedite the pipeline projects in the United States  He did sign executive orders in 2017  just a few days after he took upon his new administration  for smoothing the track for Keystone XL and Energy Transfer s Dakota Access Pipeline 
Clean Water Act Reform in the Cards 
Environmental protests and state authorities  attempts to block energy infrastructure projects have induced intervention by Trump  who is planning to roll out orders to trim regulations and speed up interstate pipeline construction 
It is most likely that Trump will direct Environmental Protection Agency to reform the Clean Water Act  under which energy companies are supposed to obtain state approvals for the construction of pipeline projects that are green lit by the federal government  Trump s orders will be aimed at streamlining sanctioning procedures and limiting the state s involvement in Clean Water Act permits 
Notably  the long stalled Constitution Pipeline project which is jointly owned by Williams Companies  Cabot Oil and Gas  Duke Energy Corp  and Atlas Gas  has been denied a water permit by the New York state regulators  crushing the hopes of the companies to bring the pipeline online by 2019  While Cabot sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   both Williams Companies and Duke Energy carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
The New York State Department has denied water quality certification to Millennium Pipeline s Valley Lateral project  New York s DEC had also refused a Clean Water Act certification for National Fuel Gas Company s Northern Access Project in April 2017  which was finally rescinded by the FERC last October  The state s ruling was overturned as it took longer than the stipulated time for the review of the pipeline 
Trump is poised to issue orders that will promote such projects reeling under water permit hurdles  While Trump s orders can t quash states  authority in assessing the pipeline projects under the Clean Water Act  these can surely prohibit the state regulators from delaying the review process and curbing their powers to some extent 
Will Cross Border Pipeline Projects Get a Boost 
The President is set to issue an order to stimulate the cross border energy infrastructure by curbing the environmental reviews of the pipeline projects whose construction are delayed  as was the case with TransCanada Corporation s Keystone XL pipeline  The order is likely to limit the State Department s power to review the environmental impacts of cross border infrastructure projects  While the permit decisions of the project are expected to rest with the President only  the State Department will just be responsible for advising the government on the pipeline projects within a specified timeframe 
Final Thoughts
Well  Trump s broader goal is to reduce energy prices by revitalizing the infrastructural projects in a country  which is witnessing high production of oil and gas even amid takeaway constraints  We know that Trump gets enraged over rising oil prices and has resorted to twitter many times  criticizing OPEC actions and blaming it on high prices  The President believes that regulatory barriers on pipeline development stifle the nation s progress toward energy independence 
Even if the orders will not be able to jump start widespread development of infrastructural projects  these will represent a formal push by the President to curb the State Department s intervention  which has been apparently becoming a major threat to the construction of pipelines

101919,323434,DUK,Analysts Estimate Duke Energy  DUK  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Duke Energy  DUK  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 61 billion  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 1  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Duke Energy 
For Duke Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Duke Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Duke Energy would post earnings of  1 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 65  delivering a surprise of  7 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Duke Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-duke-energy-duk-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200385152,200385152

101959,323474,DUK,5 High Yielding S P 500 Stocks To Buy For A Volatile 2019,opinion,It s time again for the end of the year stock market performance review  More importantly  it time to make predictions for 2019 After experiencing one of the least volatile year in 2017  the U S  stock market took investors for a wild ride in 2018  In a turbulent year for the S P 500   which tracks the biggest U S  listed companies   the index veered between record highs and steep dives  As the  tough  year comes to a close  the market is on pace for its worst December performance since 1931  with its record bull run appearing to end amid the specter of steep 2018 losses With just a trading day to go  let us look back at Wall Street s 2018 performance in more depth  plus what to expect in 2019 2018  A Tumultuous Year for the S P 500In the United States  the market got 2018 off to a phenomenal start as investors cheered lower tax bills and economic barometers showing solid growth trends  The S P 500 gained almost 6  in the first month of 2018 itself  Despite some bumps along the way   mainly fears about inflation and the escalating U S  China trade war   the index soared to an all time high closing of 2 930 75 on Thursday  Sep 20   the 19th record close this year  The benchmark was buoyed by a strong domestic economy  robust job market and encouraging corporate earnings reports Sadly  the market was unable to stay in the milestone territory and trouble started to brew  with S P 500 experiencing a brutal sell off  The dramatic equity rout over the past three months wiped out gains for the year  pushing the market into the red for 2018  In fact  the index is now down more than 15  since its September highs   just short of a bear market  Despite last week s upbeat rally  the S P 500 benchmark has lost nearly 7  of its value so far this year Myriad woes  including weaker earnings growth  stalemate on the trade front with China  Fed rate hike  partial government shutdown and slowing global economy are blamed for the heavy autumn selling  Plunging crude oil prices  which recently hit 17 month lows  added to already existing concerns about the pace of global economic demand growth With investors becoming increasingly nervous amid all the moving variables  the market is set for its worst yearly decline since 2008 Will 2019 Be Another Roller Coaster Ride For 2019  analysts anticipate it is going to be more of the same Factors like lingering investor uncertainty over U S  China trade relations  rising interest rates and moderating corporate earnings growth are expected to slow down the economy in the coming quarters  The budget standoff between President Donald Trump and Congress  faltering health of the global economy and political turmoil in Europe are weighing on the market too But it s not all doom and gloom according to economists  We still have unemployment at multidecade lows  while inflation is in check  Wage growth is holding firm and holiday spending was the strongest in years     Based on these conflicting economic data and events  more wild market swings appear imminent in 2019 Dividend Investing to the RescueAs evident from the market story  stocks can take a sudden turn for the good  or bad   making stock picking a risky game  Every good stock also has its bad day  which further adds to the risk  With uncertainty ruling the markets  it is not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes Dividend stocks are always the investors  preferred choice as they provide steady income and cushion against market risks  These stocks   displaying solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals   are generally less volatile in nature and hence  are dependable when it comes to long term investment planning  Moreover  they are proven outperformers over the long term and a safe bet to create wealth while offering sizable yields on a regular basis How to Pick the Best Stocks Although the benefits of dividend investing cannot be stressed enough  one should keep in mind that not every company can keep up with its dividend paying momentum  Hence  a cautious strategy needs to be followed in order to select the best dividend stocks with potential for steady returns To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of

101962,323477,DUK,If 2019 Is 2008  Then These Are The Safest Dividends,opinion,"If you re like many income investors I hear from  you re probably worried that 2019 is already shaping up to be a repeat of 2008  The media doesn t help   the talking heads like to conjure up fear because it draws eyeballs to the TV screen and clicks to Internet articles 
But what if they re right  In a moment we ll discuss the safest dividends for a serious pullback 
First  let me calm you down and add that a 2008 rerun is not our most likely scenario  As generals tend to fight the last war  investors tend to fear the last bear market  The next bear is likely to have its own unique  charm    causes and effects   and we d like to figure out that flavor ahead of time 
If there s more to this pullback than we ve seen  then its affinity for utility stocks is worth noting  The S P 500 made its recent high on September 20  but don t tell that to these dividend payers because they ve shrugged off the broader market s pullback
This Bear s Favorite Buy  Utilities 
I ve been down on the utility sector for two years now and have specifically picked on blue chips Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  and Southern Company  NYSE SO  repeatedly  I don t have anything against these firms  but I also don t recommend buying them when their stocks are pricey and their yields are low  as they are today 
The problem with  dividend desperation    paying too high a price for too low a yield   is that you end up collecting your payout but losing as much or more in price when the stock s multiple contracts to its usual levels  And that s exactly what s played out with DUK and SO  Their price to earnings  P E  ratios have contracted by 5  and 6  respectively as investors pay less for the same dividend  This has resulted in total returns of  not much 
Our Utility Pans Treaded Water
Is this recent  divergence  between these two large utilities and the broader market a significant tell  Perhaps  but neither stock interests me yet because both are still pricey  Their current P Es  still around 20  are higher than they ve been over much of the past decade  And their yields  at 4 3  and 5 4  respectively for DUK and SO  aren t yet high enough to qualify for our 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio 
Fortunately we don t have to settle for these pedestrian utility yields or their expensive stock prices  We can run these stocks through my Dividend Conversion Machine to double their yields to 8   9  and more   without adding any additional risk 
A Dividend Party Like It s 2009
Nobody wants a repeat of 2008  but everyone wants another chance at 2009  Unfortunately most investors were too scared then to take advantage of once in a lifetime yields  Our two utilities  for example  were paying their highest levels in years 
Generous Dividend Yields   For a Moment

102003,323518,DUK,Fed Ignores Markets  Rate Hike Woes  5 Utilities Picks,opinion,In a move which reasserted its position as an independent institution  the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for the fourth time in 2018  By doing so  the central bank dashed the hopes of investors and defied President Trump  Earlier this week  Trump had tweeted that he found it incredible that the Fed was even considering another hike The Fed did strike a dovish note by reducing the number of projected rate hikes for 2019 from three to two  However  this is clearly not to the markets  liking  Additionally  the Fed Chair sounded somewhat concerned about the economy in his post meeting press conference  This is sure to spark volatility in already gloomy market conditions   Utilities stocks have been the biggest sector wise gainers this year with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  up 3 5  year to date  Their superior dividend yields and steady revenues make them good choices in a tough economic environment  Investing in this class of stocks would make for a smart move right now Fed Hikes Rate  Projects Two for 2019On Dec 19  the Federal Reserve increased its target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2 25  to 2 5   This is the ninth such hike since the bank started to normalize rates in December 2015  It is also the fourth hike for the year  which comes despite frequent tweets from President Trump opposing such moves Several market pundits have also questioned the Fed s resolve to keep hiking rates at a time when markets and the economy face multiple headwinds  The Fed did strike a partially dovish note by reducing its projected hikes for 2019 from three to two However  investors were hoping that the Fed would indicate that it wouldn t hike rates at all next year  The language of the Fed s policy statement also stressed that further rate hikes would be appropriate though there were indications that further policy moves would be increasingly data dependent Economic Outlook LoweredThe Fed also seemed to account for global headwinds  market volatility and prevailing trade tensions by lowering its outlook for the economy  The central bank now believes that U S  GDP will grow at 3  in 2018  lower than September s estimate of 3 1   For 2018  GDP growth is projected at 2 3   lower than the earlier estimate of 2 5  Further  estimates for core inflation for this year and 2019 have been reduced to 1 9  and 2   each down 0 1   However  unemployment estimates for this year and the next have remained unchanged  But the Fed has upwardly revised unemployment projections for 2020 from 3 5  to 3 6  and for 2021 from 3 7  to 3 8  Our ChoicesThe Fed s call to raise rates for the fourth time in 2018 was along expected lines  However  its resolve to continue with the process of normalizing rates next year hasn t gone down well with investors  Further  it has lowered its economic forecasts for the next couple of years Taken together  its latest policy statement will have investors for safe haven stocks  These stocks have been particularly popular this year with utilities leading the pack  Incidentally  utilities have notched up the highest sector wise gains for 2018 up to now The above average dividend yields and steady revenues make this class of stocks great options at a time when a downturn looks near  Adding them to your portfolio would make for a prudent choice  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Otter Tail Corporation   NASDAQ OTTR   is primarily

102034,323549,DUK,Economic Uncertainty  Get Protection With Duke Energy  Enbridge,opinion,"Stocks that provide safety and consistent income have been out of favor for many years  As an unprecedented bull run continued  many investors put all their eggs in the growth basket 
But now that many high flying technology stocks have reversed course  the importance of slow moving income stocks is gaining attention  That area of the market provides a hedge against times of extreme volatility and economic slowdown 
In this segment  we particularly like power and gas utilities due to the defensive nature of their businesses and their highly regulated revenue  In fact  utilities that provide power  gas and water to homes and offices don t just pay dividends  but have  in most cases  regularly increased those payouts for decades 
Due to the changing market dynamics  we see investors increasingly embracing defensive income stocks over growth momentum plays as we enter in 2019  Here are our two top utility picks 
Duke Energy s Plan Will Support Dividend Growth
With an annual dividend yield of 4 27  and  3 71 a share payout  Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  is an attractive utility stock to own  Duke is a well diversified power and gas utility serving some of the key markets in the U S 

Through its diversified power  gas and storage businesses  the utility plans to deliver between 4  and 6  annual dividend growth  We believe the utility is well positioned to reward its long term investors following a major restructuring in its portfolio in recent years 
That shakeup included selling carbon based power assets and foreign operations  buying a natural gas utility and expanding its reach in renewable power  Today the utility s business is largely driven by regulated assets and long term contract businesses consisting of midstream pipelines and renewable power 
The company has a  37 billion development plan to run between 2018 and 2022  This level of spending is mainly targeted at regulated assets to support the company s inflation beating dividend growth 
After rising about 9  during the past three months  Duke stock has outperformed the major indices  showing that it s receiving capital flows that are moving to less risky assets as markets go through a period of downturn  Even with these gains  the utility s 4  plus dividend yield is attractive enough to make a long term bet on this stock 
Enbridge Is Attractive Long Term After Recent Share Weakness
Calgary based Enbridge  NYSE ENB  is another utility stock that we find attractive due to its juicy 6 28  annual dividend yield that translates into  2 03 a share payout 

Enbridge is the largest pipeline operator in North America  with its network handling 28  of the crude oil produced in the region  The company also moves about 22  of all natural gas consumed in the U S   serving key supply basins and demand markets 
Due to this significant role in the region s energy infrastructure  Enbridge stock is a relatively safe bet for the long run  The company s strong cash generating capability through a regulated rate structure also makes it a dependable stock to earn stable income during any recession or market downturn 
In addition  Enbridge has an excellent dividend history  Over the past 20 years  its payout has grown at an average compound annual growth rate of 11 7  
Enbridge is expecting 10  growth in the annual dividend through 2020 as it undertakes  22 billion worth of development projects 
Enbridge stock is down about 18  this year as the company goes through a major restructuring  selling some non core assets and cutting its high debt load 
Once done with this exercise  we see a major upside in this stock  most likely in the next 12 months 
For long term investors  this is a good time to buy Enbridge as its valuations are compelling 
Bottom Line
Investing in utility stocks looks boring with their slow growth and almost bond type returns  But these defensive stocks are ideal for long term investors whose objective is to earn steadily growing income  Duke and Enbridge fit the bill ",2018-11-29,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/economic-uncertainty-get-protection-with-duke-energy-enbridge-200363298,200363298

102075,323590,DUK,Florence Threatens Commodities,opinion,"Hurricane Florence 
There has never been a storm quite like this  If Hurricane Florence makes landfall in North Carolina or Virginia  as a Category 4 storm  it will be the first storm of such a strong magnitude to hit so far north  If it impacts  damage will be major  and we pray that there are no fatalities 
The markets are already being moved by Hurricane Florence as the Carolinas and Mid Atlantics prepare for this massive hurricane  Not only is it being felt in energy where the oil market prices rallied initially in the path of the storm  only to sell off later as it fears of potential demand destruction  While millions are in the path of the storm  they are being advised to fill up their gas tanks and to get away  Others are worried that surge in demand may be the last uptick for a while 
Most of the refineries in North Carolina are more inland but there are worries that flooding and power outages could shut down the Colonial Pipeline  the main line to move gasoline and diesel from the Houston  Port Arthur and Lake Charles refineries northeast  running through states in the Southeast to its end point in Linden  New Jersey 
Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  is warning that widespread power outages are likely in North Carolina and South Carolina   lasting multiple days to weeks  Natural gas demand will drop as the power burn will fall off 
Other commodities are at risk as well  from cotton to soybeans to hogs  LON HOGS  and cattle  Not only does the hog market have to deal with the rapidly expanding African Swine Fever  that has caused thousands of hogs to be culled in China  it now has to brace for the impact on one of the largest hog producing states in North Carolina 
Lumber is also on the rise as the area is not only a production area  but also because it is likely that much will be needed to rebuild what is expected to be major damage 
And if Florence was not enough  the Atlantic is just a hotbed of storm activity that will keep markets in a state of high volatility as hedgers and speculators scramble to stay ahead of the storms  Reuters reports that Isaac  formerly a Category 1 hurricane  has weakened to a tropical storm but was expected to be at or near hurricane strength when it approaches the Leeward Islands this week  the U S  National Hurricane Center said  Then you have Hurricane Helene that is looking like it has a boomerang tract  and then you have two other tropical waves that could become tropical storms in a few days 
This comes as oil traders look to OPEC and Russia to see if they have a plan to replace Iranian oil  India is appealing to them as already rising oil and gas prices are causing protests in the country  Reuters reported that U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry met Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih on Monday in Washington  as the Trump administration encourages big oil producing countries to keep output high  Perry will meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday in Moscow 
The New York Times is reporting that  The Trump administration  taking its third major step this year to roll back federal efforts to fight climate change  is preparing to make it significantly easier for energy companies to release methane into the atmosphere  Methane  which is among the most powerful greenhouse gases  routinely leaks from oil and gas wells  and energy companies have long said that the rules requiring them to test for emissions were costly and burdensome 
The Environmental Protection Agency  perhaps as soon as this week  plans to make public a proposal to weaken an Obama era requirement that companies monitor and repair methane leaks  according to documents reviewed by The New York Times  In a related move  the Interior Department is also expected in coming days to release its final version of a draft rule  proposed in February  that essentially repeals a restriction on the intentional venting and  flaring   or burning  of methane from drilling operations 
Today there is a lot to pray for  Not only do we pray for those in the path of the storms but the heroes and victims of the September 11th attacks on freedom  God Bless them and we will never forget ",2018-09-11,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-091118-200343294,200343294
102076,323591,DUK,The Safest Dividend Stocks For A 2008 Repeat,opinion,"If you re like many income investors I hear from  you re probably worried about a repeat of 2008  The media doesn t help   the talking heads like to conjure up fear because it draws eyeballs to the TV screen and clicks to Internet articles 
And so what if they re right for once  In a moment we ll discuss the safest dividends for a serious pullback 
First  let me calm you down and add that a 2008 rerun is not our most likely scenario  As generals tend to fight the last war  investors tend to fear the last bear market  The next bear is likely to have its own unique  charm    causes and effects   and we d like to figure out that flavor ahead of time 
If there s more to this pullback than we ve seen  then its affinity for utility stocks is worth noting  The S P 500 made its recent high on September 20  but don t tell that to the  utes  which are finally getting up off the mat 
This Bear s Favorite Buy  Utilities 
I ve been down on the utility sector for two years now and have specifically picked on blue chips Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  and Southern Company  NYSE SO  repeatedly  I don t have anything against these firms  but I also don t recommend buying them when their stocks are pricey and their yields are low  as they are today 
The problem with  dividend desperation    paying too high a price for too low a yield   is that you end up collecting your payout but losing as much or more in price when the stock s multiple contracts to its usual levels  And that s exactly what s played out with DUK and SO  Their price to earnings  P E  ratios have contracted by 5  and 6  respectively as investors pay less for the same dividend  This has resulted in total returns of  not much 
Our Utility Pans Treaded Water
Is this recent  divergence  between these two large utilities and the broader market a significant tell  Perhaps  but neither stock interests me yet because both are still pricey  Their current P Es  still around 20  are higher than they ve been over much of the past decade  And their yields  at 4 4  and 5 3  respectively for DUK and SO  aren t yet high enough to qualify for our 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio 
Fortunately we don t have to settle for these pedestrian utility yields or their expensive stock prices  We can run these stocks through my Dividend Conversion Machine to double their yields to 8   9  and more   without adding any additional risk 
A Dividend Party Like It s 2009
Nobody wants a repeat of 2008  but everyone wants another chance at 2009  Unfortunately most investors were too scared then to take advantage of once in a lifetime yields  Our two utilities  for example  were paying their highest levels in years 
Generous Dividend Yields   For a Moment

102114,323629,DUK,Top Analyst Reports For Schlumberger  Walgreens Boots   BNY Mellon ,opinion,"Wednesday  June 20  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Schlumberger  SLB   Walgreens Boots  WBA  and BNY Mellon  BK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Schlumberger s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry over the last year  gaining  0 4  vs   5 8   Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with presence in every energy market across the world  
Also  in all the operating business segments  the company is among the top players  The firm has been banking on growing hydraulic fracturing work in the U S  land market  The Zacks analyst thinks that being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects  Schlumberger is better positioned than most peers to take up new offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America  
However  the company s rising project startup costs are a concern  Schlumberger s total debt is four times its total cash balances  Compared with its peer group  the firm has higher long term debt to equity ratio  which reflects more levered balance sheet 
 You can   
Shares of Walgreens Boots have underperformed the Zacks Drug Stores industry over the last year  losing  17 3  vs   13 2   Walgreens Boots  last reported second quarter fiscal 2018 marked the company s highest sales in the last eight quarters  Also  the company s increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International is encouraging  
Moreover  the company has been gaining on account of strategic tie ups  The Zacks analyst is currently looking forward to the company s alliance with Express Scripts aiming to expand their existing group purchasing efforts  
This apart  the company s decision to acquire a 40  stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China looks promising as it should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots  worldwide retail pharmacy business  However  declining Retail Pharmacy sales was a disappointment  Also  ongoing generic drug inflation is hurting Walgreens  pharmacy margin  The company faces tough competition along with currency fluctuations 
 You can   
BNY Mellon s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last three months   4 9  vs   5 3    The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  Higher interest rates  rising loan demand and steadily improving fee income are expected to aid revenue growth  
Also  potential lesser regulations  lower tax rates and cost saving initiatives are likely to drive profitability in the quarters ahead  However  the Zacks analyst thinks concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based income remains a matter of concern  If there is any change in individual investment preferences  regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities  it might hamper the company s financials

102115,323630,DUK,PJM Region  Utilities Stocks Updates  AES  PPL    ,opinion,"Summary
The PJM region is home to some of the most prominent US utilities 
There are four companies that are in a clear uptrend  Here  take AES 
There are another four companies that are trading at near 52 week lows  Here  take PPL 
The PJM Utility market covers Illinois to Virginia 

And it contains some of the largest and most prominent utility companies 

Let s take a look at the yearly charts of its large publicly traded members 

We can break these charts down into two types  those that are in a rally  The AES Corp  Exelon Corp  NYSE EXC   FirstEnergy Corp  NYSE FE   and Public Service Enterprise Group  NYSE PEG   and those that are trading at near 52 week lows  American Electric Power Company  NYSE AEP   Dominion Resources  NYSE D   Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   and PPL Corp  NYSE PPL   This gives us two distinct groups to analyze for two different reasons  Let s look at them as two groups  starting with those in a rally 

Table from FINVIZ com  maintained by author 
First Energy Corp   NYSE FE  has the highest dividend but AES Corporation is only 17 basis points lower  An additional negative for FE is their current bankruptcy situation  From their latest 10K 

 On March 31  2018  FES  including its consolidated subsidiaries  FG  NG  FE Aircraft Leasing Corp   Norton Energy Storage L L C  and FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp  and FENOC filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court  See Note 3   Discontinued Operations   for additional information  

As utility investors are a conservative lot  this is a deal breaker 
Right now  the market as a whole is expensive  so comparing PEs isn t meaningful  But forward PEs can shed some light on potential future valuation 

AES is a global renewable energy company  From their latest 10K 

Incorporated in 1981  AES is a power generation and utility company  providing affordable  sustainable energy through our diverse portfolio of thermal and renewable generation facilities and distribution businesses  Our vision is to be the world s leading sustainable power company that safely provides reliable  affordable energy  We do this by leveraging our unique electricity platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions our customers need 

The following charts  also from their latest 10K  show the breakdown of various income statement numbers 


The big reason the stock has done well is that they re mostly involved with renewable energy 

AES does not have a clean income statement  they ve posted a net loss in the last two years due to costs associated with closing operations  The real financial story is in their cash flow statement  from Morningstar com  

Utilities are cash hogs  Because of their large physical plant  it s standard for investing expenses to be larger than cash from operations  This explains why the industry is dependent on the debt market for most of their cash needs  But AES is in a minority of utilities that can generate sufficient cash to fund investment  In 2013  2014  and 2016  the company s internally generated cash was more than their investment expenses  This gives the company far more financial flexibility than their competitors 
As for the stocks at near a 52 week low  the clear winner is PPL  First of all  it s the cheapest on a future and current PE basis 

And they have the highest dividend 

PPL has operations throughout the PJM region and the United Kingdom 

PPL Corporation  a utility holding company  delivers electricity and natural gas in the United States and the United Kingdom  The company operates in three segments  U K  Regulated  Kentucky Regulated  and Pennsylvania Regulated  It serves 411 000 electric and 326 000 natural gas customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky  525 000 customers in central  southeastern  and western Kentucky  and approximately 28 000 customers in 5 counties in southwestern Virginia  and 3 customers in Tennessee  The company also provides electric delivery services to approximately 1 4 million customers in Pennsylvania  and operates electricity distribution networks in the United Kingdom  as well as delivers natural gas to customers in Kentucky  generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky  and sells wholesale electricity to 10 municipalities in Kentucky  PPL Corporation was founded in 1920 and is headquartered in Allentown  Pennsylvania 

Let s take a look at some of the key financial data for the company 

Total revenue dropped between 2014 2015  but has been steady since  For the last three years  the company has reported operating income between 37  41   However  net income is much more variable  that s been reported between 9  25   Debt assets are 47     which is modestly high  but not prohibitive  The most impressive number is their EBITDA percentage which has been over 50  for the last three years 
To conclude  we have two potential buys from the PJM region  AES and PPL  AES is in a solid uptrend because of its clean energy business model while PPL is trading near a 52 week low with a very high dividend  Either would be appropriate for a utility investor

102116,323631,DUK,3 Of Our Favorite 4   Yielding Utility Stocks Today,opinion,"Investors seeking income look for a mix of safety  predictability  and higher yields  Utility stocks fit this description 
Utility stocks are popular in the investing community for their generous dividends  safety  and stability  As these stocks usually operate in regulated monopolies  they have fairly predictable earnings growth 
On the other hand  utilities tend to be slow growth stocks  This means investors should pay great attention to their valuation before purchasing them  If you overpay for a slow growth stock  it can take several years of growth to  make up for  the inopportune purchase price 
In this article  we will analyze three of our favorite utility stocks that offer a dividend yield greater than 4  
Southern Company  NYSE SO  
Southern Company is a major energy utility  which serves about 9 million customers in the U S  via its subsidiaries 
Southern has dramatically underperformed the market and its peers in the last five years  It has gained just 5  whereas S P has rallied 66  and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU  has advanced 34   The major reason behind the underperformance of Southern is its poor execution in the construction of its Vogtle nuclear units  The project has incurred several delays and cost overruns and will not be in full operation until the end of 2022  Even worse  although it has greatly increased the debt load of the company  it will contribute less than 6  of its earnings when it comes online 
The other burden of the stock is its excessive debt pile  Due to its poor execution and the acquisition of AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  for  12 billion in 2016  Southern has almost doubled its net debt  from  42 3 billion in 2013 to  79 4 billion this year  This debt load is about 27 times the annual earnings of the company  Moreover  as  14 6 billion of debt matures in the next five years  The company will have to refinance this debt at higher rates due to the interest rate hikes of the Fed 
On the other hand  the stock has been punished by the market for the above issues  As a result  it is currently offering a 5 0  dividend yield  which is near an 8 year high  In addition  Southern has raised its dividend for 18 consecutive years and has not cut it for 72 consecutive years  Moreover  management expects to grow the earnings per share by about 5  per year in the upcoming years  Therefore  investors can purchase the stock at an almost 8 year high yield while they can also rest assured that the dividend will continue to rise in the years ahead 
Due to the negative effect of rising rates on the debt of the stock and its tendency to issue new shares at a 3  average annual rate  we prefer to be conservative and assume 2 5  annual earnings per share growth for the next five years  Moreover  the stock is now trading at a price to earnings ratio of 16 4  which is higher than its 10 year average of 15 9  As the stock is likely to revert to its average valuation level over the next five years  it will incur a 0 6  annualized drag due to contraction of its valuation level  Therefore  given its 5 0  dividend  the stock is likely to offer a 6 9  average annual return over the next five years 
Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D 
Dominion Energy is an electric utility  with more than 6 million customers in eight states 
While the company has grown its earnings per share at a 2 9  average annual rate during the last decade  it expects double digit growth rate this year thanks to a reduced tax rate and the start up of its Cove Point LNG project  The first cargo was loaded in April and Dominion has sealed 20 year take or pay export contracts in order to secure its future cash flows 
Dominion has an enviable dividend record  as it has paid uninterrupted dividends for 90 consecutive years  Moreover  it expects to grow its earnings per share by at least 12  this year and about 7  per year in the next two years  As a result  it will easily fulfill its guidance for dividend growth rate of 10  until 2020 and 6  10  after 2020  Thus Dominion currently offers an attractive 4 8  dividend yield and exceptional dividend growth rate for a utility stock 
The stock is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 17 2  which is higher than its historical average of 16 5  If the stock reverts to its average valuation level over the next five years  it will incur a 0 8  annualized drag due to contraction of its valuation level  If we take into account its 4 8  dividend and assume 5 8  annual earnings per share growth going forward  Dominion is likely to offer a 9 8  average annual return over the next five years 
Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  
Duke Energy is a regulated electric utility that serves more than 7 million customers and distributes natural gas to more than 1 5 million customers 
The company has markedly grown its debt load in recent years  from  68 5 billion in 2012 to  93 5 billion this year  As this debt pile is about 30 times the annual earnings of the company and the interest expense  eats  about a third of the operating income  the rising interest rates are likely to somewhat burden the company in the upcoming years 
Nevertheless  thanks to the rate hikes in its regulated business and the growth in the number of its customers  Duke Energy is on track to grow its earnings per share by 4  this year  Moreover  management has provided guidance for approximate 5 0  annual earnings per share growth over the next four years 
Thanks to this growth  management expects to grow the dividend at an approximate 5 0  annual rate over the next five years  The company has a remarkable dividend record  as it has paid uninterrupted dividends for 91 consecutive years  Given the current 4 4  dividend yield of the stock  investors can purchase the stock at an enticing yield and rest assured that the dividend will continue to rise at a decent pace 
Duke Energy is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 16 9  which is lower than its historical average of 17 5  However  it is critical to note that the rising interest rates exert downward pressure on the valuation of utility stocks  as they render their dividend less attractive  Therefore  we will not assume any expansion of the price to earnings ratio of the stock in the years ahead  Overall  Duke Energy is likely to offer a 9 4  average annual return over the next five years thanks to 5 0  annual earnings per share growth and its 4 4  dividend 
Final Thoughts
The above three utility stocks offer attractive dividend yields and enticing expected 5 year returns  Nevertheless  if a recession does not show up in the upcoming years  the Fed will continue to raise interest rates aggressively 
As higher rates negatively affect utilities in two ways  namely higher interest expense and a lower price to earnings ratio  utilities are likely to continue to underperform the market in such a scenario 
On the contrary  they are likely to outperform the market in the event of a recession thanks to their stable cash flows and recession resistant business model  People need utility services  and pay for them  regardless of the economic environment

102142,323657,DUK,Utility ETFs Draw Attention Amid Shift To Clean Sources ,opinion,"Utility ETFs are safe havens by virtue of the regulated nature of their stocks  business  The predominant domestic focus also shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues 
Utility operators are gradually changing the source of electricity production  Abundant cheap natural gas and declining installation costs of renewable sources like solar and wind are acting as tailwinds for the sector  The regulated utilities are also getting ample support from the administration to shut down old and less profitable fossil fuel plants and replace them with more technologically sound new generation units 
Apart from generating electricity from clean sources  utilities are also focused on strengthening transmission and distribution lines  Meanwhile  natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver the product to end users  Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  There is increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during a peak demand period 
These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects 
The rise in Fed interest rates six times since December 2015 is going to hurt utilities  We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase the cost of capital  and restrain their ability to consistently pay out dividends 
First quarter earnings of the utility sector are expected to increase 19  on the back of 4 0  revenue growth  Cost control  new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the first quarter reporting cycle   On the other hand  earnings from the S P 500 members are expected to improve 23 2  on the back of 8 7  revenue growth 
Given the stable performance of utilities  the time is ripe to focus on utility ETFs that cash in on the benefits of individual utility stocks and pass them on to investors

102144,323659,DUK,Is The Coal Industry s Trump Induced Revival Short Lived ,opinion,"The coal industry is faced with numerous challenges from domestic and international markets  In the U S   strong competition from natural gas  stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from the commodity 
Moreover  coal producing countries like Australia and Indonesia   along with  importantly  a stronger greenback   are making the export market fiercely competitive for U S  coal players 
Also  in line with the policy laid down by the Paris Agreement  leading energy companies operating in Europe have announced that they will not invest in any new coal fired power plants post 2020  This will certainly dampen the prospects of coal in European countries 
Even without the Clean Power Plan  utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   Dominion Energy  D  and Duke Energy Corp   DUK  were already investing hugely to create a green energy generation portfolio and have enhanced their focus on electricity from clean fuel sources 
The Clean Power Plan has been repealed by President Trump  Despite that  new investments are being directed toward natural gas and renewable based power production due to the clean burning nature of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more solar and wind power 
Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal  some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy  In response to the anti carbon drive  utility operators are shutting down coal based power plants and directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables  U S  coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016  at 739 million short tons  MMst  since 1978 
Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 
Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is natural gas  another fossil fuel  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production  and a shale gas boom in onshore United States  is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past 
Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 
A recent U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   release projected that coal production in the United States will drop 3  year over year to 751 million short tons  MMst   The decline is attributable to a 4  drop in domestic consumption of coal and an expected 9  drop in coal exports  Coal production is expected to remain flat in 2019 
The EIA release showed that natural gas contributed 32  to total energy generation in 2017  Its share is expected to go up to 33  in 2018 and further increase 100 basis points to 34  in 2019  On the other hand  the share of coal is expected to drop from 30  in 2017 to 28  in 2019 
In addition to power generation  natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 
Environmental Legislation  Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 
This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 
The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry  Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone  The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry s prospects 
Duke Energy will invest  11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low carbon future  By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables  the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30  since 2005 
American Electric Power Company  NYSE AEP   AEP   a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  has announced its plan to add 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in its portfolio by 2030 and lower its emission levels by 60  from 2000 levels by 2030  You can see  
Majority of the power plants retired over the last decade in the United States were based on fossil fuels and among them a major chunk used coal to produce electricity  So  the ongoing reduction in usage of coal will hurt its long term prospects 
Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy  Usage of alternate energy is on the rise  with more utility scale solar projects being commissioned across the country 
The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising  Per the report  the 2014 to 2017 time period  renewable sources accounted for more than 50  of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States  Out of the 32 GW new plants planned to be added in 2018  nearly 36  will come from renewable sources  The rising popularity of the alternate energy source is undeniable and may hurt the prospects of coal 
Rising Competition  Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers  Per the EIA release  coal exports   that touched 97 0 million tons in 2017   will drop to 88 1 million tons in 2018 and further decline to 84 6 million tons in 2019 
Bankers Retreat  Capital intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions  Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas based power projects 
To Conclude
Even though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry  it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused  Over the past year  new jobs were added in the coal industry  but questions remain on the sustainability of this revision over the long run 
To overcome difficulties and remain viable  coal producers are idling coal mines  lowering headcount  delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines  Despite these initiatives  coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down cycle  as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term 
Billions of dollars have already been invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals  so at this juncture going backward to dirty coal might not be a smart choice for our planet  Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet  according to a vast majority of climate scientists ",2018-05-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-coal-industrys-trumpinduced-revival-shortlived-200319534,200319534

release showed that natural gas contributed 32  to total energy generation in 2017  Its share is expected to go up to 33  in 2018 and further increase 100 basis points to 34  in 2019  On the other hand  the share of coal is expected to drop from 30  in 2017 to 28  in 2019 In addition to power generation  natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors Environmental Legislation  Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry  Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone  The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry s prospects Duke Energy will invest  11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low carbon future  By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables  the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30  since 2005 American Electric Power Company  a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  has announced its plan to add 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in its portfolio by 2030 and lower its emission levels by 60  from 2000 levels by 2030  You can see  Majority of the power plants retired over the last decade in the United States were based on fossil fuels and among them a major chunk used coal to produce electricity  So  the ongoing reduction in usage of coal will hurt its long term prospects Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy  Usage of alternate energy is on the rise  with more utility scale solar projects being commissioned across the country The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising  Per the report  the 2014 to 2017 time period  renewable sources accounted for more than 50  of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States  Out of the 32 GW new plants planned to be added in 2018  nearly 36  will come from renewable sources  The rising popularity of the alternate energy source is undeniable and may hurt the prospects of coal Rising Competition  Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers  Per the EIA release  coal exports   that touched 97 0 million tons in 2017   will drop to 88 1 million tons in 2018 and further decline to 84 6 million tons in 2019 Bankers Retreat  Capital intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions  Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas based power projects To ConcludeEven though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry  it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused  Over the past year  new jobs were added in the coal industry  but questions remain on the sustainability of this revision over the long run To overcome difficulties and remain viable  coal producers are idling coal mines  lowering headcount  delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines  Despite these initiatives  coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down cycle  as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term Billions of dollars have already been invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals  so at this juncture going backward to dirty coal might not be a smart choice for our planet  Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet  according to a vast majority of climate scientists Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Zacks Investment

102174,323689,DUK,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Xcel Energy  NextEra Energy And Duke Energy,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 2  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Utilities  Part 1  including Xcel Energy Inc    NASDAQ XEL    NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE   and Duke Energy   NYSE DUK   Industry  Utilities  Part 1Link  The first four months of 2018 have been eventful  with a Fed rate hike  U S  China tariff war threats and tensions in Syria wiping out yearly gains from all the major indexes  The S P 500 index is off its highs for the year and currently remains barely in positive territory  while the Technology heavy Nasdaq composite is up  2 1  in the year to date period Stock market investing is no doubt a risky venture  and even well thought out investment strategies at times fail to generate desired returns  Against this backdrop  let us focus on the domestic focused  capital intensive utility stocks that assure investors steady performance and regular dividend yields  Utility stocks are subject to heavy regulation  both at the federal and state levels  Utilities are known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow Utilities  aside from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions  are also focused in improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks  They are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity  We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the U S  due to increasing production of electricity from renewable sources and support to the power grid Utilities are also undertaking long term plans to shift transmission lines underground in weather sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages  The introduction of smart meters are helping users make efficient use of electricity Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to end users  Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  The utilities are using the latest technology to upgrade and maintain their existing infrastructure to increase reliability of their services  Xcel Energy Inc  received approval from Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to use drones beyond their operators  vision to survey transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring So  to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  The rate sensitive  capital intensive utility stocks also had to accommodate the Fed rate hike The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares  These developments could lower the attractiveness of utilities  and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment However  utilities across the United States have gained from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from January 2018  Utility operators decided to pass on the benefits to their customers  and the majority of them have enjoyed a decline in monthly bills The unemployment rate in the United States was static at a historical low of 4 1  for the last six months  In addition  the United States Building Permits increased 4 4  in March 2018 to 1 379 thousand  The new permits had exceeded the U S  building permit average of 1355 99 thousand from 1960 to 2018  All these factors indicate an increase in demand for residential utility services All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity  gas and water  The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial  commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance Utilities TransformingIn August 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from the 2005 levels  President Trump has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  This new development will help in running the coal fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected The U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   estimates that U S  energy related CO2 emissions declined by 861 million metric tons or nearly 14  from 2005 to 2017  EIA now projects that carbon dioxide emissions will rise 1 8  from 5 143 million metric tons in 2017 to 5 237 million metric tons in 2018  primarily due to an increase in coal usage in power plants  In 2019  energy related CO2 emissions will be about 13  lower than 2005 levels However  utilities are focusing overall on sources of fuel that help to lower emission levels  Large solar power plants and extensive development of wind farms are indicating a shift in preferences relating to fuel sources among utilities  We notice that utility operators like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy have already invested and plan to spend more on creating green energy generation portfolio Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the  classification  utilities are a stand alone sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  The rural wire line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector  but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power  Gas Distribution and Water Supply We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries in two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one  To learn more visit  About   Two out of three industries related to the utility sector   Gas Distribution  Electric Power and Water Supply   fall into the first group  having the Zacks Industry Rank of  81   110 and  232  respectively Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive  with two major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank Utilities Trading at Mid RangeThe valuation of the sector  Considering Gas Distribution  Water Supply and Electric Power industry  looks attractive at present  The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19 4X forward 12 month EPS estimates  the Gas Distribution industry is trading at 20 7X while the Electric Power industry is trading at 13 4X compared with the S P 500 trading average of 17 5X The current 20 7x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares

  The current 13 4X multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five year range of 11 4X to 16 2X  median of 13 5X  The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five year ranges

102176,323691,DUK,Can Utilities Return Value On Investments Amid Rising Rates  ,opinion,"Utility companies are among the safest investment bets  yet they have their share of weaknesses  Regulatory burdens  weather variation and increased debt loads amid rising interest rates are the major concerns  While the Trump administration is expected to lower the industry s regulatory burden  an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop 
Let s look into the factors which might deter investors from investing in the utility space 
Debt Levels   Rising Rates
Utilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to maintain organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas  So  the debt levels of this industry are generally higher compared with the other industries  Low rates have helped the utilities to invest in infrastructure and upgrades cost effectively 
Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements 
The rise in Fed interest rates six times since December 2015 it going to hurt utilities  We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase cost of capital  restraining their ability to pay consistent dividends  We suggest that investors take note of outstanding debts and current ratio  both of which indicate the company s ability to meet its debt obligations 
In addition to higher interest rates having a direct negative impact through increased financing burden  utility stocks and other high yielding equities tend to struggle in a rising interest rate environment since the relative attractiveness of their high yields gets diminished by fixed income instruments 
Weather a Headwind
Weather plays a vital role in driving demand for utility services  A normal winter and summer season assure higher demand for utility services  However  a milder winter and a cooler summer results in lower demand for utility services 
The hurricane season  which officially spans from Jun 1 to Nov 30  poses the toughest challenges for the utility operators in the United States  We have seen the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year that exceeded billions of dollars 
Utilities like Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   DUK  and NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE    NEE   both Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  have made substantial investments in Florida in the last few years to strengthen their power delivery systems  You can see  
However  despite making substantial investment in strengthening infrastructure  we have seen that it is really difficult to ascertain in advance the disruption and damage from these storms 
Safe but Limited Growth Potential
Investment in these highly regulated defensive utilities is considered safe  Even though utilities pay regular dividends and make share buybacks  the scope of capital appreciation is quite limited for investors in this space  Share prices in this sector do not jump the way they do in the technology sector  so the returns are never dramatic  The utility sector has returned 2 3  in the past five years compared with the S P 500 s gain of 70 3  
Competition with Bonds
These reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  The ongoing increase in interest rates will definitely make bonds with its yields another attractive investment option for risk averse investors  driving them away from the utility space 
Fed s interest rates hikes are a drag for rate sensitive sectors like utilities  Making things worse  the Fed might hike interest rates two more times in 2018  if economic conditions remain conducive 
Utilities to Avoid for the Time Being 
We presently recommend investors to stay away from the following utilities with an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that these utilities are not profitable investment options now 
Spark Energy Inc   SPKE  currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   It saw an average negative surprise of 139 18  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate 2018 earnings per share declined by 27 6   in the past 60 days  In last one year Spark Energy s share have lost 29 5  
Middlesex Water Co   MSEX  delivered an average negative surprise of 14 14  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share declined by 8 8   in the past 60 days  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Middlesex Water s shares have lost 3 4  in the last six months

102177,323692,DUK,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Duke Energy  NextEra Energy  Spark Energy And Middlesex Water,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 3  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Industrials  Part 2  including Duke Energy Corporation   NYSE DUK    NextEra Energy Inc    NYSE NEE    Spark Energy Inc    NASDAQ SPKE   and Middlesex Water Co    NASDAQ MSEX   Industry  Industrials  Part 2Link  Utility companies are among the safest investment bets  yet they have their share of weaknesses  Regulatory burdens  weather variation and increased debt loads amid rising interest rates are the major concerns  While the Trump administration is expected to lower the industry s regulatory burden  an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop Let s look into the factors which might deter investors from investing in the utility space Debt Levels   Rising RatesUtilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to maintain organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas  So  the debt levels of this industry are generally higher compared with the other industries  Low rates have helped the utilities to invest in infrastructure and upgrades cost effectively Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements The rise in Fed interest rates six times since December 2015 it going to hurt utilities  We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase cost of capital  restraining their ability to pay consistent dividends  We suggest that investors take note of outstanding debts and current ratio  both of which indicate the company s ability to meet its debt obligations In addition to higher interest rates having a direct negative impact through increased financing burden  utility stocks and other high yielding equities tend to struggle in a rising interest rate environment since the relative attractiveness of their high yields gets diminished by fixed income instruments Weather a HeadwindWeather plays a vital role in driving demand for utility services  A normal winter and summer season assure higher demand for utility services  However  a milder winter and a cooler summer results in lower demand for utility services The hurricane season  which officially spans from Jun 1 to Nov 30  poses the toughest challenges for the utility operators in the United States  We have seen the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year that exceeded billions of dollars Utilities like Duke Energy Corporation and NextEra Energy Inc   both Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  have made substantial investments in Florida in the last few years to strengthen their power delivery systems  You can see  However  despite making substantial investment in strengthening infrastructure  we have seen that it is really difficult to ascertain in advance the disruption and damage from these storms Safe but Limited Growth PotentialInvestment in these highly regulated defensive utilities is considered safe  Even though utilities pay regular dividends and make share buybacks  the scope of capital appreciation is quite limited for investors in this space  Share prices in this sector do not jump the way they do in the technology sector  so the returns are never dramatic  The utility sector has returned 2 3  in the past five years compared with the S P 500 s gain of 70 3  Competition with BondsThese reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  The ongoing increase in interest rates will definitely make bonds with its yields another attractive investment option for risk averse investors  driving them away from the utility space Fed s interest rates hikes are a drag for rate sensitive sectors like utilities  Making things worse  the Fed might hike interest rates two more times in 2018  if economic conditions remain conducive Utilities to Avoid for the Time Being We presently recommend investors to stay away from the following utilities with an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that these utilities are not profitable investment options now Spark Energy Inc  currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   It saw an average negative surprise of 139 18  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate 2018 earnings per share declined by 27 6   in the past 60 days  In last one year Spark Energy s share have lost 29 5  Middlesex Water Co  delivered an average negative surprise of 14 14  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share declined by 8 8   in the past 60 days  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Middlesex Water s shares have lost 3 4  in the last six months Bottom LineAt the end of the day  we believe that rise in interest costs will continue to hurt utilities  However  these

102178,323693,DUK,Should VictoryShares US EQ Income Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF  CDC  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"Launched on 07 01 2014  the VictoryShares US EQ Income Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF  CDC  is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market 
The fund is sponsored by Victory Capital  It has amassed assets over  690 38 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Value
Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above  10 billion  Considered a more stable option  large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts 
Value stocks are known for their lower than average price to earnings and price to book ratios  but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates  While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long term performance  growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets 
Costs
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 35   putting it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 2 93  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk  it is still important to look into a fund s holdings before investing  Luckily  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector  about 25 60  of the portfolio  Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Duke Energy Corp   DUK  accounts for about 1 64  of total assets  followed by Xcel Energy Inc   NASDAQ XEL  and Consolidated Edison Inc   NYSE ED  
The top 10 holdings account for about 15 05  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
CDC seeks to match the performance of the CEMP U S  Large Cap High Dividend 100 Long Cash Volatility Weighted Index before fees and expenses  The CEMP U S  Large Cap High Dividend 100 Long Cash Volatility Weighted Index is an unmanaged index and generally consists of the common stock of the 100 highest dividend yielding stocks of the CEMP U S  18 Large Cap 500 Volatility Weighted Index 
The ETF has lost about  1 40  so far this year and was up about 8 55  in the last one year  as of 05 08 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  42 21 and  48 75 
The ETF has a beta of 0 73 and standard deviation of 11 24  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 103 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Bottom Line
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs  transparency  flexibility  and tax efficiency  these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors

102214,323729,DUK,Duke Energy To Provide  38M In Tax Savings To Customers,opinion,"Duke Energy Corp    NYSE DUK   will offer a notable  38 million in annual tax savings on electric and natural gas bills for its customers in Ohio and Kentucky  beginning from April and May 2018  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that came into effect on Jan 1  2018  clearly led to this entire bill reduction Details of Projected Tax SavingsIn particular  Duke Energy s customers  residing in Ohio  would save approximately  20 million in annual tax on their electric bills  Beyond this tax saving proposition  the company s Ohio based unit has also proposed state regulators for lowering natural gas bills by about  3 million  commencing from May Duke Energy also proposed tax savings for Kentucky based customers as the state regulators reviewed its proposal  recommending an allocation of around  15 million of tax act benefits Our ViewThe latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately  various companies are passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills  Being no exception  Duke Energy has also followed the same path and must have reduced its electricity as well as natural gas rates  which in turn has allowed it to reward the customers with tax savings Notably  this rate reduction is in line with the company s earlier made recommendation  during the fourth quarter earnings call  of using the lower tax rates to reduce utility rates for the customers in the near term as well as aid in offsetting future rate increases We have witnessed some other utilities in the recent past  directing the federal tax savings to reduce bills for the customers  Notably  utilities  including the likes of NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE    AVANGRID   NYSE AGR   and WGL Holdings   NYSE WGL    have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers Moreover  the recent tax reform will enable Duke Energy to increase the utility rate base  which occurs due to low tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation  resulting in lower deferred taxes  which in turn increases rate base  As a result  the company is projected to witness a higher rate base growth along with an increase in the company s earnings growth Price MovementDuke Energy has edged down 5 9  in the last 12 months compared with the broader  s decline of 47 3   The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel  electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company

102215,323730,DUK,Utilities Week In Review  April 16 20,opinion,"Summary
With Treasury yields topping out for now  utilities should continue to outperform the broader market 
Bad news continues for Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D  
Other stocks in the sector are also performing well 
Let s begin with a look at interest rates  Utilities are very influenced by the credit market for two reasons  First  this sector competes with bonds for investors  as bond yields become more competitive with utility yields  expect investors to buy more bonds  Second  utility companies are heavily dependent on debt financing  As yields rise  so do utilities  fixed costs  which can eat into utility profits 

The 10 year CMT rose at the beginning of the year  climbing from about 2 3 to a little under 3   This sent the stock market and the utility sector lower  But bond yields have hit a bit of a ceiling  One of the main reasons is that inflation   which is one of the primary inputs into yields   is still very tame 

The Y Y percentage change in PCEs is still below 2   And the moving averages for the Y Y percentage change are low with little reason to move above 2  anytime soon 
Add these elements together and you have a ceiling for Treasury yields 
Next  let s look at the NYSE XLUs performance relative to the NYSE SPYs 

The XLUs continue to improve relative to the SPYs  In fact  they remain one of the strongest performing sectors  A look at the sector s chart explains why 

The XLUs have been in an uptrend since early February  There is now an upward sloping trend line that connects lows from early February  early March  late March  and mid April  This is a trudging rally  every step forward is accompanied by a step back  While this is certainly not exciting  it s actually a far healthier rally because it indicates that traders are thinking about their decisions incrementally 
The weekly chart is also very encouraging 

For most of 2017  prices were using the 20 week EMA for technical support  But when the Treasury market started to sell off at the end of last year  utility prices broke through both the 20  and 50 week EMA  Now prices have found support on a Fibonacci fan and are slowly moving higher  Momentum  the MACD in the top panel  is about to turn more bullish 
And finally  the daily EMA chart is positive as well 

The MACD  top panel  is once again moving higher  And the shorter EMAs  the 10 day is green while the 20 day is red  are both moving higher again  Each is also above the 50 day EMA  another bullish development 
Let s next turn to some of the larger individual members of the XLUs 

Let s start with the worst performer   Dominion  NYSE    Its takeover of Scana  NYSE SCG  is now   please see my analysis of the deal   

Dominion Energy Inc  s  7 9 billion takeover of troubled utility owner Scana Corp  NYSE SCG   is looking even less likely to happen after a bill passed by South Carolina legislators late Wednesday 
The state Senate voted to cut the money Scana can collect from customers for a half finished nuclear power project the company scrapped last year  Dominion has threatened to call off the merger with Scana should legislators make such a move  and the company reiterated Wednesday that it stands by previous statements  Scana fell as much as 2 6 percent to  36 26 in after markets trading 

As a result  the stock price is still very weak 

Dominion can t catch a technical break  It tried to rally last week  but hit resistance at the 20 day EMA when the above referenced news story broke  The EMAs are bearishly aligned  the shorter EMAs are below the longer EMAs  which continues to pull the averages lower  and momentum is weak 
Let s now turn to the top of the list by looking at NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE   which I ve discussed twice in the last month  see   

NEE had resistance in the upper 150s  which prices broke through in mid March  They have since been moving sideways  Momentum is moving lower  but so far prices are using the previous resistance area  the upper 150s  as technical support  Fundamentally  the company is sound  which explains why it continues to find a bid 
Southern Company  NYSE SO  is also performing well relative to the SPYs 

Its chart is more akin to the XLUs   Southern s prices are below the 200 day EMA and are trudging higher  The EMAs are slowly turning to a more bullish orientation and momentum is rising  I reviewed the company s 2017 performance at the end of February  While the results were generally positive  there is ongoing shareholder litigation which is concerning 
Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK  is also performing well relative to the SPYs 

Again we have a chart that is similar to the XLUs   a trudging rally  I reviewed Duke s latest performance earlier this year and concluded 

Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  remains a technical buy at current levels  Their revenues and margins are increasing while yielding 4 71   But also remember that the fixed income market is repricing risk  adding a headwind to utilities trading 

Finally  American Electric Power Company Inc  NYSE AEP  is looking very interesting 

There are two ways to look at this chart  The first is that prices have formed a short term double top as prices hit resistance at the 200 day EMA  The second is that prices are consolidating below the 200 day EMA before they make a run above this technical barrier  I m opting for the latter  based on the stock and sector momentum relative to the SPYs  I reviewed AEP earlier this year  it remains a well diversified utility

102281,323796,DUK,Can The Coal Industry Withstand Challenges Ahead ,opinion,"The coal industry remains beleaguered  with challenges from domestic and international markets  In the United States  strong competition from natural gas  stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from coal 
Moreover  coal producing countries like Australia and Indonesia   along with  importantly  a stronger greenback   are making the export market fiercely competitive for U S  coal players  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   release  coal exports   that touched 95 1 million tons in 2017   will drop to 80 1 million tons in 2018 and further decline to 74 7 million tons in 2019 
Even without the Clean Power Plan  utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE   Dominion Energy  D  and Duke Energy Corp   DUK  were already investing hugely to create a green energy generation portfolio  and have enhanced their focus on electricity from clean fuel sources 
The Clean Power Plan has been repealed by President Trump  Despite that  new investments are being directed toward natural gas and renewable based power production due to the clean burning nature of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more solar and wind power 
Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal  some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy  In response to the anti carbon drive  utility operators are shutting down coal based power plants and directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables  U S  coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016  at 739 million short tons  MMst  since 1978 
Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 
Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is natural gas  another fossil fuel  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production  and a shale gas boom in onshore United States  is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past 
Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 
The EIA release showed that natural gas has contributed 32  to the total energy generation in 2017 and its share is expected to go up to 33  in 2018 and further increase 100 basis points to 34  in 2019  Coal contributed 30  to total mix in 2017 and its contribution is expected to fall below 30  in 2018 and drop to 28  in 2019 
In addition to power generation  natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 
Environmental Legislations  Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 
This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 
The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry  Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone   The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry s prospects 
Duke Energy will invest  11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low carbon future  By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables  the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30  since 2005 
WEC Energy Group Inc   WEC   a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  has announced its plan to retire Pleasant Prairie coal fired power plant in second quarter 2018 and remove nearly 1 200 MW of coal fired production from the generation mix  You can see  
Per the EIA release  nearly 47  of the utility scale power plants retired in the United States within 2008 to 2017 were powered by coal 
The old and comparative small coal fired units were retired and this trend is expected to continue til 2020  Emission is one of the primary reasons behind the retirement  along with federal and state policies that impact operation of a plant 
Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy  Usage of alternate energy is on the rise  with more utility scale solar projects being commissioned across the country 
The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising  Production from renewable  excluding hydroelectric  is expected to increase to 1 089 billion kWh per day in 2018  reflecting an increase of 2 9  from 2017 levels  Production per day is expected to improve to 1 182 billion kWh per day in 2019  reflecting an increase of 8 5  from expected 2018 levels  These renewable additions will eat into coal s share of electricity generation 
EIA report also showed nearly 50  of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States in 2017 came from renewable sources  The rising popularity of the alternate energy source is undeniable  and it adversely hurts the prospects of coal 
Rising Competition  Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers 
Bankers Retreat  Capital intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions  Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas based power projects 
To Conclude
Even though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry  it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused  The new policies from the Trump administration might bring in temporary relief for the coal miners but we are skeptical about the long term viability of the policies 
Billions of dollars are already invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals  so the question arises for policy makers whether it will be feasible to revive the coal industry in the long run  Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet  according to a vast majority of climate scientists 
At present  we will advise investors to stay away from Westmore Coal Co   WLB   which not only carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   but has also delivered negative earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  Additionally  its 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss has widened to  5 13 from  4 95 in the last 60 days 
To overcome difficulties and remain viable  coal producers are idling coal mines  lowering headcount  delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines  Despite these initiatives  coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down cycle  as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term

102318,323833,DUK,Factors That Could Impact The Utility Sector s Returns,opinion,Though utility companies are among the safest investment bets  they have their share of weaknesses  Regulatory burdens  weather variation and increased debt loads are major concerns  While the Trump administration is expected to lower the industry s regulatory burden  an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop Let s look into the factors which might deter investors from investing in the utility space Debt Levels   Rising RatesUtilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to maintain organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements We believe that a rising interest rate environment could add to the woes of utility operators  as it will increase cost of capital  restraining their ability to pay consistent dividends  We suggest that investors take note of outstanding debts and current ratio  both of which indicate the company s ability to meet its debt obligations Weather a HeadwindWeather plays a vital role in driving demand for utility services  A normal winter and summer season assure higher demand for utility services  However  a milder winter and a cooler summer results in lower demand for utility services The credit rating firm  Moody s has estimated that hurricanes Harvey and Irma will lead to around  150  200 billion loss in the United States and additional  20  30 billion economic expenses owing to disruption of services NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE    NEE   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  and Duke Energy Corp   DUK  have made substantial investments in Florida in the last few years to strengthen their power delivery systems  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here However  the hurricanes caused damages to the solar panels installed in the state  Repairing and restoration of the solar panels will result in additional expenditures for the companies that already have made substantial investment in solar power generation Competition with BondsThese reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  The ongoing increase in interest rates will definitely make bonds with its yields another attractive investment option for risk averse investors  driving them away from the utility space The Fed raised interest rates in four of the last five quarters  December 2016  March 2017  June 2017 and December 2017   which is a drag for rate sensitive sectors like Utilities  Making things worse  the Fed might hike interest rates thrice in 2018  if economic conditions remain conducive The increasing interest rates will raise the cost of capital for the utilities and might adversely impact its ability to carry on with dividend payment and share buybacks  making the high interest bearing bonds a more alluring option for investors Safe But Limited Growth PotentialInvestment in these highly regulated defensive utilities is considered safe  Even though utilities pay regular dividends and go for buybacks  the scope of capital appreciation is quite limited for investors in this space  Share prices in this sector do not jump the way they do in the technology sector  so the returns are never dramatic Utilities to Avoid for the Time BeingWe presently recommend investors to stay away from the following utilities with an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that these utilities are not profitable investment options now Black Hills Corporation  BKH  currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   It saw an average negative surprise of 6 18  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings per share declined 4 0  and 5 9   respectively  in the last 90 days  Black Hills Corporation has lost 3 1  last year versus 6 5  rally of the Zacks Electric Power industry it belong to Connecticut Water Service Inc   CTWS  saw an average negative surprise of 14 27  in the last four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings per share declined 3 6  and 3 5   respectively in the last 60 days  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Connecticut Water Service stock has gained 2 8  last year  much lower than Zacks Water Supply industry s gain of 22 9  Bottom LineAt the end of the day  we believe that rise in interest costs will continue to hurt utilities  However  these fundamentally strong utilities are here to stay forever as we are yet to come out with any alternatives to their services The changes in the U S  administration might result in intensity of regulation  which has some positive impact on their performance due to increasing operation costs  The utilities are gradually converting their operation from non regulated to regulated nature  which will again provide stability to earnings A makeover in the utility space is already underway  but the decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan will help the utilities continue with the coal fired units for longer than previously expected

102319,323834,DUK,Bomb Cyclone Ravages U S  Coast  3 Utilities In Focus ,opinion,"Even though the northern part of the United States usually experiences extreme climatic conditions during winter  this year has been especially harsh owing to a snowy nor easter  bomb cyclone   The cyclone hit the coasts of Florida and Southeast United States on Jan 3  and South Carolina  North Carolina  Virginia  Delaware and New Jersey the next day 
The bitter cold wave enveloped the entire East Coast as well as the MidWest of the United States  causing heavy snowfall in the East Coast from Maine to North Carolina  as per Reuters   resulting in wide spread power cuts  Extensive outages were reported in these regions  which might have led the broader  s performance to dip  Evidently  the Utility sector dropped 1 4  since the beginning of 2018 

Impact on the Economy
Bomb cyclone spurred heating oil and natural gas demand in turn raising their price  Per The New York Times report  the cost of residential heating oil at the end of December 2017 surged 13  to  2 92 a gallon  compared with the same period in 2016 
Being the major residential and commercial heating fuel in the Northeast and most widely used by power plants  U S  natural gas demand also remained near record highs last week  Consequently  U S  spot natural gas and power prices on Jan 4 rose to their highest in years in several regions  as per Reuters  
The catastrophic back to back hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 in the United States have already led to a damage of  306 billion  The extreme winter storm and the cold waves  expected to continue for a while per the National Weather service  along with other catastrophes that usually take place each year  are likely to result in similar if not more damage 
Impact on Utilities
The severe storm followed by heavy snowfall and high winds initially caused electricity outages in almost 80 000 homes and businesses on the U S  Atlantic coast  Power outages have also hit thousands of customers in Florida and the Southeast 
Per a North American Electric Reliability Council report  plants in the Southern part of the United States suffered outages  as they weren t designed to operate at such low temperatures  Meanwhile  outages at coal fired facilities and problems delivering natural gas to plants in the 13 state region that includes Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also affected the system adversely 
Although the storm dented electric utility services at varied parts of the nation  none of the major utilities reported any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system  thanks to their advanced infrastructural development  In fact  utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some customers who were hit by the storm overnight 
However natural gas pipeline constraints in the Northeast have been posing challenges to the grid operator  Currently  natural gas accounts for about one third of U S  power generation  roughly on par with coal  However  there is significant opposition to new pipeline construction in the densely populated Northeast  which sits just above the major natural gas producing region in Pennsylvania  Ohio and West Virginia 
This becomes an issue during cold snaps  when residences that rely on natural gas for home heating  compete for supplies with power plants  Therefore  utility service providers in this region are expected to suffer a big blow from this storm 
3 Utilities to Watch
During the bomb cyclone  utility providers in the nation tried their best to restore the system  However  depending on the extent of the damage as well as severity of weather conditions prevalent in the outage sites  complete restoration was not possible  This may have led the below mentioned utilities to suffer in the equity market immediately following the devastating storm 
Duke Energy Corp    NYSE DUK    This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power  It carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Thousands of Duke Energy customers in North and South Carolina suffered power cuts over the week  according to the utility s online outage tracker   The company appealed to customers to lower their energy use citing extreme cold temperatures that can put pressure on their electricity system 
The company s share price dropped 3 4  on a year to date basis  underperforming the broader sector s decline of 1 4  

Eversource Energy   NYSE ES    This company transmits and delivers electricity and natural gas  It also carries a Zacks Rank  3 
High population creates problem for new pipeline construction for natural gas in New England  wherein natural gas accounted for half of the region s electric power in 2016  National Fuel warned that it expects outages in New England that could take multiple days to restore  With Eversource being the largest energy provider in the region  the storm has affected its share price 
The company s share price dropped 2 2  on a year to date basis  underperforming the broader sector s decline of 1 4  

Entergy Corp    NYSE ETR    This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power  It carries a Zacks Rank  3 
The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid  Entergy Corp  which operates the Pilgrim Station  has not yet said when the station will restart 
The company s share price dropped 1 6  on a year to date basis  underperforming the broader sector s decline of 1 4  

To Sum Up
In general  extreme weather conditions provide an impetus to utility services demand which in turn raise utility bills  Therefore  utility providers should have gained in the United States  following the terrific snowy storm  However  the share price performance of the stocks shows a different picture 
Nevertheless  the increased utility bills that consumers have already paid  relative to the peak demand at the time of this storm  can be expected to get reflected in the improved Q1 results for these utilities as well as others  Further  once weather conditions starts to improve from the second half of January  as expected by weather reports  these utilities will be able to restore the outages full fledged  post which their share price may take a positive rebound  In fact  each of them carrying a Zacks Rank  3 is a further indication that these stocks are worth adding in your watchlist

Buy rated Wal Mart s shares have been strong performers lately  with the stock up  32 1  over the last six months  outperforming the S P 500 s  13 3  gain in the same time period  Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT   recently announced plans to drop the  hyphen  and  stores  from its name to officially emerge as an omnichannel retailer  
The company has been riding on its robust past record  which derives strength from constant e commerce initiatives  like buyouts  alliances  surging grocery business and improved delivery systems  Thanks to these trends  along with solid traffic  Walmart s third quarter fiscal 2018 marked its ninth and 13th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise and comps growth  respectively  
Also  the company s international business remains a growth driver  However  costs associated with technological and e commerce investments  mix impact from growing e commerce operations and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart s gross margin for a while now  Stiff competition and volatile consumer spending also pose threats 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated 3M have gained  11 8  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has gained  1 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes 3M s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets  
Moreover  3M is continuing with its portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets that no longer fit in its strategy and continues to make investments in other lucrative markets  Portfolio management  investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which 3M intends to focus  3M also intends to continue investing in capital expenditures and R D to support organic growth as it aims a prudent capital structure strategy and increased capital deployment  
Furthermore  3M is standardizing its business processes through a new  global ERP system and expects to save  500 to  700 million annually by 2020  However  high pension expenses continue to be a drag on the company s bottom line 
 You can   
Buy rated Union Pacific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC  over the last six months  While Union Pacific has gained 29 5   the industry it belongs to and Norfolk Southern have rallied 15 5  and 25   respectively  in the same time period  
The Zacks analyst expects volume growth to aid Union Pacific s results in the fourth quarter of 2017  Key segments like intermodal and chemicals should drive growth  Detailed results should be out on Jan 25  The company s efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payouts are also impressive  Its efforts to cut costs to drive its bottom line are encouraging too  
The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be made out from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been revised 0 7  upward over the last 60 days  However  declining automotive volumes and high debt levels are concerns

102343,323858,DUK,3 Dividend Yielding Utility Stocks To Buy In 2018,opinion,"Perennial demand for electricity and utility services has made the Utility Sector a safe haven for investors  Consistent demand enables a smooth flow of cash to utility operators  They in turn use this cash to reward shareholders by paying stable dividends 
In fact  for income investors  this sector has always been a lucrative one with utility stocks generating strong dividend yields  As we near the end of 2017  it seems to be a good time for investors to review the prospects of utility stocks and accordingly reshuffle their portfolios 
Rising Prices Boost Growth Prospects
In a recent release  the U S  Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U S  residential electricity price will increase 3 4  in 2017 and 3 2  in 2018  This will surely benefit electric utility operators  Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector  Undoubtedly  such price increases will boost earnings of the utilities and enhance dividend payouts 
Regular Dividends  A Major Positive
A major positive for utility stocks has been their regular dividend payout strategy  Even during times of recession  households and communities still need power  water  heat and telecommunications  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009  when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly 
We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy   NYSE CNP   and Duke Energy Corp    NYSE DUK    which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 
Trump Administration  A Boon 
Stringent regulations implemented by President Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels  Although for environmental protection Clean Power Plan was an apt decision  it was putting pressures on utilities   President Trump s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal  After all  Coal still accounts for nearly 30  of the electricity produced in the United States 
Trump s promises to deregulate the sector and remove environmental hurdles will be beneficial for utilities  Fewer regulations will help to lower operating costs and increase the lives of power production facilities 
Key Bets
Utility operators are currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source  coal  is gradually being replaced by natural gas and other alternative energy resources like solar power as is evident from increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity 
May be realizing that fact that our ultimate future lies in renewable resources  large utilities like NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE   and Duke Energy continue to take initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources  even when Trump is against the Clean Power Plan 
With only a month or so remaining before we step into 2018  let s take a look at the utility stocks which continued with their dividend payout strategy amidst this transition 
With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener  we have narrowed down our search to the following utility stocks each of which has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a dividend yield of more than 3   You can see 
First on our list is Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn    OTC DTEGY    which provides telecommunications services  The company currently boasts a dividend yield of 3 70 
Next is Consolidated Edison Inc    NYSE ED    a diversified utility holding company with subsidiaries engaged in both regulated and unregulated businesses  The company currently boasts a dividend yield of 3 15 
WEC Energy Group  Inc    NYSE WEC   is another valuable stock  It is a diversified holding company  engaged in the generation and distribution of electricity  The company currently boasts a dividend yield of 3 02

102377,323892,DUK,Coal Industry Continues To Fight Tough Battle ,opinion,"The coal industry remains beleaguered  with challenges from domestic and international markets  In the United States  strong competition from natural gas  stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from coal  In the last year  the coal industry has returned 2 1  compared with 16 2  gain of the S P 500 
Moreover  coal producing countries like Australia and Indonesia   along with  importantly  a stronger greenback    are making the export market fiercely competitive for U S  coal players 
Even without the Clean Power Plan  utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE   Dominion Resources  NYSE D   D  and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   DUK  were already investing hugely to create a green energy generation portfolio  and have enhanced their focus on electricity from clean fuel sources 
The Clean Power Plan has been repealed by President Trump  Despite that  new investments are being directed toward natural gas and renewable based power production due to the clean burning nature of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more solar and wind power 
Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal  some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy  Companies like Patriot Coal and Walter Energy had tried all possible means to remain solvent  but the harsh reality is that coal demand is gradually going down 
In response to the anti carbon drive  utility operators are shutting down coal based power plants and directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables  U S  coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016  at 739 million short tons  MMst  since 1978 
Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 
Environmental Legislations  Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 
This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 
The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry  Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone   The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry s prospects 
Duke Energy will invest  11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low carbon future  By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables  the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30  since 2005  American Electric Power Co   Inc   AEP   a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  has eliminated over 5 500 megawatts  MW  of coal fired capacity from its generation portfolio  You can see  
Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is natural gas  another fossil fuel  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production  and a shale gas boom in onshore United States  is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past 
Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 
The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  expects natural gas to contribute 32  of the total energy generation in 2017 while coal is projected to represent 31   However  in 2018  share of natural gas is expected to improve 33  while coal s share will remain unchanged 
In addition to power generation  natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 
Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy  Usage of alternate energy is on the rise  with more utility scale solar projects being commissioned across the country 
The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising  In 2016  U S  Renewables consumption was 10 138 quadrillion Btu in 2016  which is expected to increase 7 2  year over year to 10 863 quadrillion Btu in 2017  Consumption in 2018 is expected to increase further by 0 3  to 10 890 quadrillion Btu 
These renewable additions will eat into coal s share of electricity generation  Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U S  states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix 
The extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar and Production Tax Credit for wind will drive expansion of renewable generation units at the cost of coal  Making use of the government support  NextEra Energy expects to bring online nearly 2 800 5 400 MW of new wind projects over the 2017 2018 timeframe 
Rising Competition  Stronger Dollar  Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia as well as a stronger dollar  which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers 
Bankers Retreat  Capital intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions  Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas based power projects 
To Conclude
Even though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry  it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused  The new policies from the Trump administration might bring in temporary relief for the coal miners but we are skeptical about the long term viability of the policies 
Investors are still in dilemma whether to start investing in coal industry again  Contura Energy Inc   CNTE   which acquired some of the core assets of Alpha Natural Resources Inc   has backed off from its plan of Initial Public Offering  citing lack of investor interest 
Billions of dollars are already invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals  so the question arises for policy makers whether it will be feasible to revive the coal industry in the long run  Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet  according to a vast majority of climate scientists 
At present  we will advise investors to stay away from Westmore Coal Company  WLB   which not only carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   but has also delivered negative earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  Additionally  its 2017 estimates have gone down 32 8  in the last 60 days to a loss of  4 58 per share 
To overcome difficulties and remain viable  coal producers are idling coal mines  lowering headcount  delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines  Despite these initiatives  coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down cycle  as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term

102380,323895,DUK,5 Safe Bet Utility Stocks Poised To Beat Q3 Earnings ,opinion,With the Q3 earnings season kicking off  Utility companies are preparing to release their numbers in the next couple of weeks  Notably  the gained 3  in the third quarter Factors Boosting the UtilitiesA major factor which boosts the utility sector is that there exists no substitute for the energy related services rendered by the utilities  The endless demand for electricity and utility services will never cease to exist  thereby conferring a consistent flow of revenue to these companies  Thus utilities are considered as a safe haven Utilities generate more or less stable earnings unless any sudden event impacts their operations adversely  This regulated nature of operations provide them stability and in turn they reward their shareholders with steady dividend rates Moreover  the predominant domestic focus shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues  Also the major utility providers make frequent modernizations of their grid system and distribution networks to offer seamless flow of electricity to customers  In fact  it is these modernization initiatives that saved the grid systems from getting severely damaged from the widespread hurricane rampage that hit the coastal U S  in the last couple of months Further  stringent emission regulations implemented by Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels  Although it is a favorable development from the environmental point of view  utilities had to make huge investments to ease the transition to renewables However  President Trump s recent initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan on economic growth grounds is expected to give a temporary breather to utilities that produce major part of their electricity from coal On the other hand  realizing the need for clean energy a number of major utility providers like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corporation   NYSE DUK   have already taken initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources  Considering the fact that renewable energy is the ultimate future of energy resources  these initiatives will boost the growth of alternative energy utilities  in the long run We believe  over time  a constructive utility rate environment and increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewable sources will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base Earnings Expectations for UtilitiesPer our   as of Oct 11  Q3 earnings for the Utility sector is expected to be down 2 9   while sales for the same is estimated to be up by 1 5   Operations of major utilities like NextEra  Duke Energy and American Electric Power Corporation   NYSE AEP   that have extensive business in the hurricane affected states of Texas and Florida were affected adversely  Although a minor section of their grid system got damaged severely  they were compelled to stall electricity distribution  These outages are expected to weigh on their Q3 earnings  which in turn may have dragged down this sector s overall earnings expectation for the quarter Nevertheless  going ahead  in 2017  this sector is expected to exhibit an earnings improvement of 2 1  and sales growth of 4 4   This indicates an improvement in the results of these stocks ahead of Q3 How to Identify Potential Winners Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist  One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Moreover  investors constantly seek stocks that not only maintain stability but produce respectable returns for shareholders  Keeping that in mind  we have herein added Return on Equity  ROE  in our selection criteria for screening high cash returning utility stocks that are poised to beat Q3 earnings 5 Solid Bets Here are five utility stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises  with a ROE greater than 10   in their upcoming announcements BCE  Inc    TO BCE   is Canada s largest communications service provider and serves as the holding company for Bell Canada  The company provides local and long distance phone service to

102391,323906,DUK,Key Predictions For Q3 Earnings Reports Of DUK  AEE  CNP  PNW,opinion,The third quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark  Total earnings for the 327 S P members that have already released results are up 7 8  year over year on 6 5  higher revenues  with 74 9  beating earnings and 65 7  topping revenue estimates Combining the results of the 372 S P 500 members with the index s members yet to report  we expect total third quarter earnings to be up 5 6  year over year on 5 5  higher revenues Amid this backdrop  let us focus on  this earnings season  Earnings from the utility space were expected to drop 3 8  on 1 1  lower revenues as of November 1  Notably  10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline  Read more details in the weekly  Notably  capital intensive utilities were impacted by increased interest rates in March and June  this year  In addition  the utilities operating in Texas and Florida were severely hurt by the hurricanes  Harvey and Irma  With the rising interest rates  the stable  regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns  consequently making them a more attractive option for investors Therefore  to maintain their performance level  these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives  modernizing transmission and distribution lines  upgrading infrastructure and focusing more on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission   Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third quarter 2017 results on Nov 3 Duke Energy Corporation   NYSE DUK   witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 0 98  in the previous quarter Last month  Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida  As a result  Duke Energy s electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County  The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work  which included rebuilding this system  These must have increased the third quarter expenses of Duke Energy  which we believe might weigh down on its bottom line For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7 8  year over year  The same for sales are anticipated to drop 1 1  to  6 75 billion According to our proven model  stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  have higher chances of beating estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Our proven model does not show that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because the company has an  of  0 78  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 55  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 56  Moreover  it carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell    Read more    As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Ameren Corporation   NYSE AEE   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14 49  in the last quarter In soon to be reported quarter  Ameren s earnings are expected to be affected by a non cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share  primarily at the parent company  Again  owing to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois  the bottom line will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share In this regard  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren s third quarter earnings reflects 9 9  decline Our proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 31  Moreover  it carries a Zacks Rank  4   Read more    Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP   pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 38 10  in the second quarter In the third quarter  Hurricane Harvey has severely hit the city of Houston  TX   which is the primary service region of CenterPoint  Though the company didn t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants  it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the quarter On the brighter note  the unemployment rate in CenterPoint Energy s service territories is better than the national average  An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state  thereby improving the company s performance For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third quarter earnings projects a decline of 1   Meanwhile  the same for revenues of  2 02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6 7  on a year over year basis Our proven model does not show that

Corporation Commission approved the company s first rate review agreement in five years  This decision is likely to act as a strong catalyst for the company s growth  since it will boost Pinnacle West s Arizona Public Service unit s revenues by an estimated 3 3   Notably the new rates  effective from Aug 19  will increase the residential bill by approximately 4 5  or about  6 per month  We may expect the rate increase to get reflected in improved revenues of APS in the to be reported quarter Meanwhile  the company projects to witness extended outages at its Four Corners power plant  in the second half of this year for the installation of pollution control equipment  This is expected to push up its operating and maintenance cost for third and fourth quarters of 2017  which in turn may dent the bottom line for coming quarters Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle West is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP

102410,323925,DUK,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NextEra Energy  Duke Energy  American Water Works And Aqua America,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 11  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Utilities  Part 2  including NextEra Energy  NYSE   NYSE NEE        Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE   NYSE DUK        American Water Works Company  NYSE   NYSE AWK       and Aqua America Inc   NYSE   NYSE WTR       Industry  Utilities  Part 2Link  The utility sector is currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source  coal  is being replaced by natural gas  and we could notice increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity  Stringent emissions regulations enacted by President Obama also prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels President Trump s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal  Coal still accounts for nearly 30  of the electricity produced in the United States However  even without the Clean Power Plan  some large utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE      and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE      have taken the initiative to produce more electricity from natural gas and alternative sources We believe there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation  A constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables  and supporting clean coal powered projects will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector Stable Demand   Rising PricesA major positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for its services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This lends revenues and cash flow a high level of stability and visibility In a recent release  the U S  Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U S  residential electricity price will increase 3 4  in 2017 and 3 2  in 2018  which will surely benefit the utilities  Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector  The increase in prices will  no doubt  boost earnings of the utilities Regular Dividend   Share BuybacksUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability  These operators  in turn  reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and Duke Energy  which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now CenterPoint Energy  currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has a quarterly dividend rate of 26 75 cents and a dividend yield of 3 61   You can see  In the second quarter  Duke Energy s board of directors approved a 4 1  increase in the quarterly dividend rate  The current quarterly dividend rate is 89 cents  with a dividend yield of 4 08  Focus on R D   Extension of ITC PTCIn their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines  which helped in the efficient usage of energy Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources In addition  the utility friendly moves of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the companies  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation Mergers and AcquisitionsUtility sector operators don t shy away from merger and acquisition  M A  activities to supplement organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades We believe that in a mature energy market like the United States  M As represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space We are noticing major acquisitions in the water utility space  American Water Works Company  NYSE      closed several acquisitions in the first half of 2017  adding nearly 22 000 customers through acquisition and organic growth  The pending acquisition when closed could increase the company s customer base by 34 000 in 2017 Another major player in the water utility space  Aqua America Inc   NYSE       successfully completed a few acquisitions as of Aug 2  2017 adding 1 002 customers  Its pending acquisition  when closed over the course of the year  will add another 11 087 customers to its existing base To Sum UpStable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features  In addition  relaxed emission regulations under the Trump administration should act as a tailwind for the utility sector We notice a transition in the utility sector with more focus on clean energy generation  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is most important driving factor for the utilities There has been increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during peak demand period  The utilities are also regularly investing to strengthen their infrastructure to serve customers more efficiently The defensive nature and stable performance demonstrated by the utility sector has driven investors to look for a safe haven in this space  In the last six months  the Utility sector has returned 6 4  to investors compared with 4 9  gain of the S P 500  So staying invested in these regular dividend payers often regarded as a  bond substitute  will be a safe option for jittery investors 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be

102423,323938,DUK,What s Holding PPL Back ,opinion,"PPL Corporation  NYSE PPL  is an electric utility company whose stock price has been treading water the past year  While the market as a whole is up over 12   PPL stock has managed to just eek out a 2  gain  And earnings are not an issue 
So what could be holding this stock back from growing  Today we are going to look at what potential issues investors feel PPL faces and whether or not they are reasons to avoid the stock 
What s Holding PPL Back 
As I mentioned  PPL has been treading water  The first thing investors look at when this happens is earnings  In their latest earnings report  earnings per share came in at  0 52 which beat estimates by  0 03  Revenues came in at  1 73 billion  missing estimates by  60 million  This was a drop in revenue by 3 5  compared to last year 
On the surface  nothing looks like it should concern investors  In fact  earnings have been growing ever since PPL spun off Talon Energy 
So if it s not earnings that are an issue what is it  There are only two issues I see at play with this stock  The first is exchange rate and currency risk 
PPL does 70  of its business in the United States  The other 30  of earnings comes from the United Kingdom  As a result of this  there can be fluctuations in earnings based on the value of the US Dollar versus the Great Britain Pound 
The other issue is debt  While not much debt is due in the next few years  PPL does have a sizeable chunk of debt that is coming due both in 2020 and 2021 
Are These Issues A Concern 
The thing I don t understand is why the stock is being punished for these 2 issues  First  PPL hedges itself against currency risk  They have hedges in place through 2020 and if need be  they can hedge more after that 
So while there is a risk there  the company is making sure that risk is greatly minimized and will have very little impact on earnings 
When it comes to debt  we have over 2 years before a large portion of debt needs to be repaid  That is plenty of time to pay it down or issue new debt with a future due date to pay off this debt 
So to this investor  these issues aren t a reason to avoid this stock 
Why You Should Invest In PPL
So should you be an investor in PPL  I think so 
The company is working hard to enhance its smart grids so that it can better serve its customers in the years to come  In addition  the company estimates that it will be able to grow earnings annually between 4 5  and 6   Add in the 4  dividend and you are looking at a 10  return on a utility company  Not too shabby  It reminds me of Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   which I recently wrote about 
PPL expects it will be able to grow its dividend by 4  annually through 2020 as well 
Final Thoughts
PPL has a lot going for it  I can t wrap my head around why so many investors are scared of this stock  There are some risks  but the company has done its due diligence to keep these risks at bay 
For me  I only see potential with a hint of downside risk  And when I can invest in a stable company and earn 10  annually  I jump at the opportunity

102426,323941,DUK,Utility ETFs To Safeguard Your Portfolio,opinion,"Utility ETFs are safe havens by virtue of the regulated nature of their stocks  business  The predominant domestic focus also shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues 
 
Utilities provide basic services like electricity  gas and water that can never go out of business  Their ability to boost shareholders  value through consistent dividend payments makes them all the more attractive 
 
Over the last few years  we have noticed that utilities are changing their preference of fuels in producing electricity  In the United States  natural gas currently contributes the largest portion of the fuel mix and has removed coal from the top spot   Read   
 
Utilities  apart from generating electricity  focus on strengthening transmission and distribution lines  Meanwhile  natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver the product to end users  Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  So  to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets 
 
Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  Utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment  However  the Fed raised interest rates for three consecutive quarters  December 2016  March 2017 and June 2017   which will certainly hurt utilities 
 
The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase the cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividend and buy back shares  These developments could lower the attractiveness of utilities and investors might turn to bonds as alternative sources of investment 
 
Second quarter earnings in the utility space increased 7  on the back of 7 7  revenue growth  Earnings from the utility sector are expected to increase 2  on the back of a 4 5  improvement in total revenues in 2017  Read   
 
Given the stable performance of utilities  the time is ripe to focus on utility ETFs that cash in on the benefits of individual utility stocks and pass them on to investors

102453,323968,DUK,Duke Energy  Perfect For Conservative Investors,opinion,"Are you looking for a solid stock with predictable returns  Are you a conservative investor who is not looking for a lot of risk  Then Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  is the perfect stock for you 
As a utility company  Duke Energy has everything going for it  They have made strategic moves that have paid off and as a result  they have become the largest utility in the United States  During this time  it seemed as though Wall Street shunned the stock  not realizing what the future held for this company 
But Wall Street has since noticed and the stock price is now close to  90 a share  But I think it can go much higher  Below  you will find out why Duke Energy is a perfect stock to own 
The Business Of Duke Energy
A few short years ago  Duke Energy was a utility company that relied heavily on coal for power  But in the last few years  the electric giant has shuttered coal and turned to natural gas and other renewable energy sources as the United States pushes utilities to begin using more and more cleaner energy 
The move has paid off 
Currently  about 90  of Duke s business is in the regulated market  This means that prices are controlled by the government  On the one hand  this looks like a problem  seeing as how it will slow growth  But by dealing with a regulated market  Duke Energy and its shareholders can more easily predict future earnings  In other words  the more regulated the market  the more stable the company and the stock 
Of course  in order to survive as a business you need customers  Duke has continued to increase both commercial and residential customers annually and in both their electric and natural gas segments 
When Duke Energy recently reported earnings  they missed on earnings per share by  0 01 coming in at  1 01  Revenues also missed  this time by  640 million  coming in at  5 16 billion  However  this was an increase of 3  compared to the prior year 
Even with the miss in estimates  Duke Energy reaffirmed full year 2017 earnings 
The Future For Duke Energy
The future looks bright for Duke Energy  They are looking towards the future with a 3 pronged plan 
Modernize the grid
Grow natural gas infrastructure
Continue push toward clean energy
With this plan in place  Duke expects to grow earnings between 4 6  annually through 2021  That doesn t sound like much  but you also have to take into account the dividend the company pays  They recently increased the dividend by 4   and this marks the 91st consecutive year of paying a dividend 
The current yield on Duke Energy stock is 4   So when you add this to the projected earnings growth  you are looking at a stock that you can expect to return close to 10  annually for the next 5 years  Not bad for a company that deals with a regulated market 
The only downside to the stock is the small percent of earnings that come from its international business  With this segment  you run many risks  including political and currency risks 
However  seeing that less than 10  of the company s earnings come from international business  any trouble faced here should be small and not affect earnings greatly 
Final Thoughts
At the end of the day  Duke Energy is a perfect stock for conservative investors  As a utility company  the stock won t face many headwinds and the company should be able to continue to meet expectations 
In fact  this stock could be a great addition to the portfolio of most investors  as a 10  annual growth rate is not something that many stocks can boast about

102456,323971,DUK,Utility Industry Outlook   September 2017,opinion,"The Utility sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for utility services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand  The very basic nature of these services also results in heavy regulation  both at the federal as well as state levels Utility business is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows   Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that add to their attractiveness to income oriented investors Over the last few years  we have noticed that utilities are gradually changing their preference of fuels to produce electricity  In the United States  natural gas currently contributes the largest portion of the fuel mix and has removed coal from the top spot Utilities  apart from generating electricity  focus on strengthening transmission and distribution lines  Meanwhile  natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver the product to the end users  Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  So  to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  Utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment  However  the Fed raised interest rates for three consecutive quarters  December 2016  March 2017 and June 2017   which will certainly hurt utilities The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividend and buy back shares  These developments could lower attractiveness of utilities and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment Weather continues to impact the operation of utility services  Hurricane Harvey has left many customers in Texas without power  as major power transmission lines were out of service due to the storm  Restoration services are gradually making things normal but we believe that these outages will hurt the earnings goal of utilities operating in the region  Also  before this catastrophe could be dealt with  Hurricane Irma  a Category Five storm is making its way and could impact regions from Caribbean to Florida However  utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which give their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been a headwind for many other industries lately  Utilities are also gaining from customer growth  proper cost control and the latest electric rates  The Dow Jones Utility Average is up 12 6  year to date  as of Sep 5  2017  Repeal of Clean Power Plan  Impact on UtilitiesHistorically  electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  In line with this  in August 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from 2005 levels To adhere to the Clean Power Plan  some utilities had taken steps to bring down emission levels  which included the shutting down of old coal based power plants  investing in emission control equipment  and increasing the share of natural gas and alternate energy sources in electricity generation There was  however  strong opposition to the enforcement of Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on industries like coal apart from utilities The Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants President Trump acted on his pre election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  The move toward repealing the Clean Power Plan will benefit coal focused electric utilities like American Electric Power Company  NYSE AEP   AEP  Even if these amendments take time to be implemented  it will benefit coal based utilities as they will be able to run their units for a longer period than expected earlier Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification  utilities are a standalone sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  The rural wire line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector  but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power  Gas Distribution and Water Supply We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries in two groups   the top half

fall under the first group  with a Zacks Industry Rank of  72 and  101  respectively  while Water Supply with a Zacks Industry Rank of  208 falls in the second group Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive  with two of the major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank Utility Valuations Look  Full The valuation of the sector  Considering Gas Distribution  Water Supply and Electric Power industry  looks expensive at present  The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 20 2x forward 12 month EPS estimates  Gas Distribution industry is trading at 24 1x while Electric Power industry is trading at 15 4x compared with S P 500 trading average of 19 4x The current 24 1x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five year range of 16 6x to 24 1x  median of 19 9x  while 20 2x multiple for Water Utilities compares to five year multiple ranged from a low of 12 4x to a high of 23 3x  median of 18 5x   The current 15 4x multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five year range of 11 5x to 16 4x  median of 13 9x  The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five year ranges  but are clearly toward the high end of those ranges  Since the utilities are trading near high end of historical averages  we can consider these valuation levels as anything but  full  at this juncture Earnings

Category Five storm is making its way and could impact regions from Caribbean to Florida However  utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which give their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been a headwind for many other industries lately  Utilities are also gaining from customer growth  proper cost control and the latest electric rates  The Dow Jones Utility Average is up 12 6  year to date  as of Sep 5  2017  Repeal of Clean Power Plan  Impact on UtilitiesHistorically  electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  In line with this  in August 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from 2005 levels To adhere to the Clean Power Plan  some utilities had taken steps to bring down emission levels  which included the shutting down of old coal based power plants  investing in emission control equipment  and increasing the share of natural gas and alternate energy sources in electricity generation There was  however  strong opposition to the enforcement of Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on industries like coal apart from utilities The Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants President Trump acted on his pre election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  The move toward repealing the Clean Power Plan will benefit coal focused electric utilities like American Electric Power Company  NYSE      Even if these amendments take time to be implemented  it will benefit coal based utilities as they will be able to run their units for a longer period than expected earlier Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification  utilities are a standalone sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  The rural wire line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector  but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power  Gas Distribution and Water Supply We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries in two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week

Gas Distribution and Electric Power   fall under the first group  with a Zacks Industry Rank of  72 and  101  respectively  while Water Supply with a Zacks Industry Rank of  208 falls in the second group Our present outlook for the utility sector is positive  with two of the major industries placed in the first group of the Zacks Industry Rank Utility Valuations Look  Full The valuation of the sector  Considering Gas Distribution  Water Supply and Electric Power industry  looks expensive at present  The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 20 2x forward 12 month EPS estimates  Gas Distribution industry is trading at 24 1x while Electric Power industry is trading at 15 4x compared with S P 500 trading average of 19 4x The current 24 1x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five year range of 16 6x to 24 1x  median of 19 9x  while 20 2x multiple for Water Utilities compares to five year multiple ranged from a low of 12 4x to a high of 23 3x  median of 18 5x   The current 15 4x multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five year range of 11 5x to 16 4x  median of 13 9x  The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five year ranges  but are clearly toward the high end of those ranges  Since the utilities are trading near high end of historical averages  we can consider these valuation levels as anything but  full  at this

102458,323973,DUK,Factors That Make Utility Stocks A Safe Investment Choice,opinion,"The utility sector is currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source  coal  is being replaced by natural gas  and we could notice increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity  Stringent emissions regulations enacted by President Obama also prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels 
President Trump s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal  Coal still accounts for nearly 30  of the electricity produced in the United States 
However  even without the Clean Power Plan  some large utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE  and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   DUK  have taken the initiative to produce more electricity from natural gas and alternative sources 
We believe there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation  A constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables  and supporting clean coal powered projects will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 
In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 
Stable Demand   Rising Prices
A major positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for its services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This lends revenues and cash flow a high level of stability and visibility 
In a recent release  the U S  Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U S  residential electricity price will increase 3 4  in 2017 and 3 2  in 2018  which will surely benefit the utilities  Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector  The increase in prices will  no doubt  boost earnings of the utilities 
Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks
Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability  These operators  in turn  reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly 
We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP  and Duke Energy  which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 
CenterPoint Energy  currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has a quarterly dividend rate of 26 75 cents and a dividend yield of 3 61   You can see  
In the second quarter  Duke Energy s board of directors approved a 4 1  increase in the quarterly dividend rate  The current quarterly dividend rate is 89 cents  with a dividend yield of 4 08  
Focus on R D   Extension of ITC PTC
In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines  which helped in the efficient usage of energy 
Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 
In addition  the utility friendly moves of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the companies  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 
Mergers and Acquisitions
Utility sector operators don t shy away from merger and acquisition  M A  activities to supplement organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 
We believe that in a mature energy market like the United States  M As represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 
We are noticing major acquisitions in the water utility space  American Water Works Company  AWK  closed several acquisitions in the first half of 2017  adding nearly 22 000 customers through acquisition and organic growth  The pending acquisition when closed could increase the company s customer base by 34 000 in 2017 
Another major player in the water utility space  Aqua America Inc   WTR   successfully completed a few acquisitions as of Aug 2  2017 adding 1 002 customers  Its pending acquisition  when closed over the course of the year  will add another 11 087 customers to its existing base 
To Sum Up
Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features  In addition  relaxed emission regulations under the Trump administration should act as a tailwind for the utility sector 
We notice a transition in the utility sector with more focus on clean energy generation  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is most important driving factor for the utilities 
There has been increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during peak demand period  The utilities are also regularly investing to strengthen their infrastructure to serve customers more efficiently 
The defensive nature and stable performance demonstrated by the utility sector has driven investors to look for a safe haven in this space  In the last six months  the Utility sector has returned 6 4  to investors compared with 4 9  gain of the S P 500  So staying invested in these regular dividend payers often regarded as a  bond substitute  will be a safe option for jittery investors

102496,324011,DUK,Solar Stock Faceoff For The Solar Eclipse ,opinion,"On Monday  grid operators throughout the country will scramble to deal with the impact of diminished sunlight during the first total solar eclipse in the continental United States since 1979  There shouldn t be any power outages  but engineers for utilities such as Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  have been  to prepare  which reflects the growing importance of solar to the U S  energy system 

At the forefront of this growth in solar energy are the two largest solar companies in the U S  by market cap  First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  and SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  In this article  we will judge FSLR and SPWR on five key categories 

Profitability
Corporate Governance
Free Cash Flow Yield
Growth Opportunities
Valuation

With investors  eyes turned towards the sun today  which of these solar stocks is the best bet to make your portfolio shine 

Profitability

The most important metric we look at for any company is return on invested capital     ROIC is the best measure of corporate performance and has the most   As Figure 1 shows  First Solar has consistently earned a superior ROIC to SunPower over the past decade 

Figure 1  FSLR and SPWR ROIC Since 2006



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

There s no competition in this category  First Solar has the much better track record of profitability 

Corporate Governance

Superior profitability in the past means nothing if those profits cannot be maintained in the future  Many highly profitable companies have gone on to destroy shareholder value through overpriced acquisitions or wasteful spending  Compensation plans that reward executives for maximizing ROIC are the best way to ensure a focus on shareholder value 

First Solar ties a significant portion of executive s long term stock grants to ROIC  We have some concerns over the way the company calculates ROIC especially with its decision to exclude certain stock based compensation but it s still encouraging that the company rewards executives for superior capital allocation 

On the other hand  SunPower s primary metric for calculating executive bonuses is  Adjusted EBITDA   a metric also famously used by   NYSE VRX   There s no comparison  First Solar s executive compensation plan is much more shareholder friendly 

Free Cash Flow Yield

Cash is king  The value of any business ultimately comes down to its ability to generate  for investors  Figure 2 compares First Solar and SunPower on the basis of free cash flow yield over the past decade 

Figure 2  FSLR and SPWR Free Cash Flow Yield Since 2007



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

It s the same story as Figure 1  Over the past decade  First Solar has earned a superior free cash flow yield in every year but one  This competition is starting to look awfully one sided 

Growth Opportunities

Even though they re both in the solar industry  First Solar and SunPower have very different business models  SunPower focuses on high efficiency panels that are ideal for rooftop solar installations  while First Solar s thin film panels hold up better in harsh environments and appeal to large scale utilities 

Growth in the rooftop solar industry   putting a damper on SunPower s outlook  First Solar  on the other hand  has some significant growth opportunities as  aim to supplement their power grids with solar energy 

Both companies face significant near term pressure as a glut of new supply has caused solar panel prices to plummet  but First Solar has the better opportunity to offset that decline 

Valuation

These companies are difficult to compare on most valuation metrics due to the fact that First Solar earns a positive after tax operating profit    while SunPower has lost money for the past two years  However  there are still a couple metrics we can use to compare the two 

First Solar has an enterprise value invested capital  a cleaner version of price book  of 0 61  while SunPower s EV IC is 0 80 

For enterprise value revenue  it s 1 31 for First Solar against 1 76 for SunPower 

It s a clean sweep  First Solar beats SunPower in all five categories and is the better stock to buy for investors seeking exposure to the solar industry

102498,324013,DUK,Will Continued Investments Drive Alternative Energy Stocks ,opinion,"Despite the uncertainty related to U S  tax policy or commitment to fight climate change  the momentum achieved by the renewable energy sector is unlikely to subside  Contracts from small  to medium size companies will continue to flow in even if large corporations choose to tread cautiously 
The declining cost of energy storage should further aid the penetration of renewable resources  The underlying driver for each of these market trends is significant customer demand for renewables  It is expected that the renewable space will continue to innovate in the remainder of 2017 to offer consumers clean  affordable renewable energy 
Stocks in the Zacks Alternative Energy industry  part of the Zacks Oil Energy sector  were up 4 3  in the last year against a 9 5  loss for the Oil Energy sector and 10 7  gain for the S P 500 index  Since Nov 8  the Zacks Alt Energy industry is up 16 2  against 10 6  loss for the Oil Energy sector and 17 2  gain for the S P 500  This shows that Trump s presidency hasn t harmed the industry as anticipated 
Solar and wind   two major alternative energy sources   are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting 
Wind and solar are not only essential when it comes to reducing carbon emissions but also have a remarkable contribution in saving lives  This is because these renewable sources edge out fossil fuels and reduce air pollutants in addition to carbon emissions  This leads to improved air quality  with a corresponding drop in premature deaths 
According to recent reports  renewable energy has surpassed nuclear power as a percentage of U S  energy generation  Declining cost of solar generation is anticipated to be the driving factor behind a dramatic increase in renewable power 
Again  the extension of key renewable tax credits and reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs will be driving the alternative energy space s growth trajectory 
Moreover  former President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan   which is still valid  has propelled the sector northward  Efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a positive for renewable energy stocks  As per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   in 2016  CO2 emissions declined 1 7   Going ahead  energy related CO2 emissions are expected to decline 0 5  in 2017 
The plan urged utility providers to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water  Some of such utilities are Duke Energy Corp   DUK  and NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG    NRG   Both Duke Energy and NRG Energy carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
The EIA observes that even if the Trump administration abolishes the Clean Power Plan  the renewable space will continue to grow in the U S  albeit at a slower rate  EIA projects U S  renewable generation capacity to grow by an average of 1 9  per year between 2017 and 2050 
Apart from this  Francesco Starace  chief executive of Italy based Enel  MI ENEI   the largest European power company  said that investment in renewable energy across the globe including the U S  will continue to grow regardless of President Trump s attempt to revive fossil fuels  This is because investment in renewable energy was primarily driven by technological progress and market forces and hence any amendment in U S  federal policy will have a marginal effect  He added that Enel has plans to invest  5 2 billion in renewable generation  mainly wind and solar power  both in Europe and the U S   over the next three years 
Realizing growth opportunities in the renewable energy space  companies from other domains have also expressed their interest to invest in solar stocks  In line with this  e commerce giant Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  will bring online five new solar farms  totaling 180 megawatts  MW   to help power its massive cloud data centers  The new solar facilities  located in Virginia  will be connected to the grid by the end of 2017  Amazon also has other renewable projects underway  which will be completed by this year 
Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s strengths 
Extension of ITC  Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation 
On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  rushed developers to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 
Moreover  the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired in 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out 
The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will increase almost 10 gigawatts  GW  between 2017 and 2018 in the U S   given considerable rise in consumption in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the period 
The EIA expects wind energy capacity additions of 14 GW in 2017 2018  With these additions  total wind capacity will reach 95 GW by the end of 2018 
Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp   SPWR  and First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR    FSLR  are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the U S  and China 
The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move intended to close a gap in which Chinese companies could use solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs 
Imposing of these anti dumping duties has benefited many U S  alternate energy companies like Vivint Solar  Inc   VSLR   Enphase Energy  Inc   ENPH  and First Solar  While Vivint Solar carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Enphase Energy and First Solar carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
The Sun Is Everywhere  Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Residential solar is undeniably gaining on utility scale solar in the U S  in a marked change in industry dynamics 
Among the renewable energy pack  rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corp  has an innovative game plan  This downstream solar company plays on its strength  providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the U S  California based SolarCity s MyPower loan plan allows its customers to own their solar systems and still pay less for electricity when compared to leasing them through power purchase agreements 
China s Solar Plans  China continues to hold the leading position around the globe in solar power installations  Last year  Chinese overseas investment in renewable energy projects was a record  25 billion  The country s energy agency announced that it will invest  364 0 billion in renewable power generation by 2020 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said China had installed a total of 101 82 GW of solar capacity by June 2017  after adding 24 4 GW in the first six months of 2017  It is expected to reach 110 GW soon  the target Beijing had aimed to achieve by 2020 
Per the 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   China has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency  The FYP also plans to achieve non fossil fuel fired energy consumption of around 15  by 2020 and 20  by 2030 
China s solar industry is expected to produce 25  more panels in 2017 compared with last year  supported by domestic sales and demand from the U S  and emerging markets  Again  in the long term  there is great potential for China s solar industry to develop  with the walk out of the U S  from the Paris Accord 
India s Solar Initiatives  While the U S  and China have led the industry in recent years  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure for electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has a target of adding 175 GW of solar  wind and other renewable energy by 2022 
India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly  It is expected that around 1 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity will be added in 2017  up 75  from 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 
At the end of 2016  India boasted a pipeline of around 14 GW of utility scale projects  out of which 7 7 GW is expected to be commissioned this year  It is expected that the country will add a total of 9 4 GW in 2017  This new forecast is higher than the one provided earlier this year  In May  it was projected that India will add 8 8 GW in 2017 as a result of which the country will  become the world s third biggest solar market after China and the U S 
The India Solar Compass report  a quarterly update on the Indian solar market  stated that in the second quarter of 2017 solar sector tariffs in India fell below the vital threshold of INR 3 per unit  making solar power the cheapest new source of power in the country 
The report additionally said that the expected new utility scale capacity addition in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 will be 1 565 MW and 2 265 MW  respectively  Of the 9 4GW in 2017  total rooftop solar capacity is expected to be 1 056 MW 
Company wise  First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  In 2016  First Solar connected a 130 MW utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 
JA Solar Holdings Co   Ltd  s  JASO  investment plans in India include a 500 MW solar module facility  which will be operational by this year  Another Chinese player Trina Solar Ltd earlier announced its plan to build 700 MW capacity for solar cells and 500 MW capacity for solar modules in the country  These are encouraging signs for the industry in India 
Solar in Japan  Japan has been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search of new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market as the government has set a goal of generating 12  of power from solar PV by fiscal 2030  up from the present level of 4  
In particular  the solar power boom in Japan ramped up considerably in 2016  Electricity generation from solar PV alone grew to 4 3  last year  up from 2 7  in 2015  Overall  in 2016  renewable energy sources comprised 14 2  of total electricity generation  It has been projected that Japan will install 8 GW of solar PV in 2017 
Japan s need for electricity was on the rise  particularly after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident  which triggered a complete phase out of all nuclear reactors in the country  Presently  the Japanese government is looking for alternate resources to meet the growing need for power in this industrial hub 
Summing Up
It is evident that demand for renewables is strengthening at a rapid clip  Moreover  the gradual expansion of the solar markets should bode well for all global players and instill confidence in the industry over the long term  The increased adoption was mainly due to the booming residential PV market and continued realization of the utility sector s double digit GW project pipeline

change  the momentum achieved by the renewable energy sector is unlikely to subside  Contracts from small  to medium size companies will continue to flow in even if large corporations choose to tread cautiously The declining cost of energy storage should further aid the penetration of renewable resources  The underlying driver for each of these market trends is significant customer demand for renewables  It is expected that the renewable space will continue to innovate in the remainder of 2017 to offer consumers clean  affordable renewable energy Stocks in the Zacks Alternative Energy industry  part of the Zacks Oil Energy sector  were up 4 3  in the last year against a 9 5  loss for the Oil Energy sector and 10 7  gain for the S P 500 index  Since Nov 8  the Zacks Alt Energy industry is up 16 2  against 10 6  loss for the Oil Energy sector and 17 2  gain for the S P 500  This shows that Trump s presidency hasn t harmed the industry as anticipated Solar and wind   two major alternative energy sources   are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting Wind and solar are not only essential when it comes to reducing carbon emissions but also have a remarkable contribution in saving lives  This is because these renewable sources edge out fossil fuels and reduce air pollutants in addition to carbon emissions  This leads to improved air quality  with a corresponding drop in premature deaths According to recent reports  renewable energy has surpassed nuclear power as a percentage of U S  energy generation  Declining cost of solar generation is anticipated to be the driving factor behind a dramatic increase in renewable power Again  the extension of key renewable tax credits and reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs will be driving the alternative energy space s growth trajectory Moreover  former President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan   which is still valid  has propelled the sector northward  Efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a positive for renewable energy stocks  As per U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   in 2016  CO2 emissions declined 1 7   Going ahead  energy related CO2 emissions are expected to decline 0 5  in 2017 The plan urged utility providers to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water  Some of such utilities are Duke Energy Corp   NYSE      and NRG Energy Inc   NYSE       Both Duke Energy and NRG Energy carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The EIA observes that even if the Trump administration abolishes the Clean Power Plan  the renewable space will continue to grow in the U S  albeit at a slower rate  EIA projects U S  renewable generation capacity to grow by an average of 1 9  per year between 2017 and 2050 Apart from this  Francesco Starace  chief executive of Italy based Enel  MI ENEI   the largest European power company  said that investment in renewable energy across the globe including the U S  will continue to grow regardless of President Trump s attempt to revive fossil fuels  This is because investment in renewable energy was primarily driven by technological progress and market forces and hence any amendment in U S  federal policy will have a marginal effect  He added that Enel has plans to invest  5 2 billion in renewable generation  mainly wind and solar power  both in Europe and the U S   over the next three years Realizing growth opportunities in the renewable energy space  companies from other domains have also expressed their interest to invest in solar stocks  In line with this  e commerce giant Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  will bring online five new solar farms  totaling 180 megawatts  MW   to help power its massive cloud data centers  The new solar facilities  located in Virginia  will be connected to the grid by the end of 2017  Amazon also has other renewable projects underway  which will be completed by this year Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s strengths Extension of ITC  Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  rushed developers to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 Moreover  the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired in 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will increase almost 10 gigawatts  GW  between 2017 and 2018 in the U S   given considerable rise in consumption in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the period The EIA expects wind energy capacity additions of 14 GW in 2017 2018  With these additions  total wind capacity will reach 95 GW by the end of 2018 Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp   NASDAQ      and First Solar Inc   NASDAQ      are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the U S  and China The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move intended to close a gap in which Chinese companies could use solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs Imposing of these anti dumping duties has benefited many U S  alternate energy companies like Vivint Solar  Inc   NYSE

102528,324043,DUK,Duke Energy Plans To Build Solar Power Plants In Kentucky,opinion,Electric services provider  Duke Energy Corporation   NYSE DUK    recently revealed its plans of constructing three solar facilities in Northern Kentucky  These solar units will incorporate 31500 solar panels and generate over 6 8 megawatts  MW  of electricity  Notably  these stations will directly serve the customers of Kentucky Details of the ProjectOut of the three units  Walton Solar Power Plants 1   2  will be built in Kenton County  The site will have 19 000 solar panels installed and the capability of generating more than 4 MW of electricity The third one   Crittenden Solar Power Plant   will be located in Grant County and will incorporate 12 500 panels  This plant will produce more than 2 7 MW of electricity The company has laid down plans of completing a major part of the construction by the end of 2017  On being operational  these plants will be able to offer electricity to almost 1 300 average sized homes Duke Energy s Take on the ProjectWith increasing demand for electricity in Kentucky  Duke Energy aims at making most of the opportunity by setting up more solar power plants in the state  Moreover  cost of building solar projects is cheaper than before  making it more cost competitive compared with other sources of power generation  Being an experienced solar power supplier  Duke Energy enjoys a competitive edge over peers in reaching out to more customers  The company already serves 850 000 customers in the Ohio Kentucky region The three solar power plants set to be constructed in Northern Kentucky will complement Duke Energy Kentucky s existing power generation fleet in Kentucky  which incorporates a 650 MW coal fired plant and a 500 MW gas fired facility Our ViewThe solar energy market in the U S has evolved greatly in past few years  Since 2008  solar installations in the country have grown seventeen fold from 1 2 gigawatts  GW  to an estimated 30 GW today Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the U S  and other international areas  We appreciate the company s efforts of expanding its scale of operations  pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment In pursuit of green energy  the company has invested more than  5 billion since 2007  As of Mar 2017  Duke Energy Renewables owns and operates about 2 894 MW of renewable energy out of which 583 MW is solar Despite President Trump s withdrawal of the U S  from the Paris agreement and the strong steps taken by his administration to abolish the Clean Power plan  utilities are still inclined toward adopting renewable as source of energy  This is because  although Trump is currently aiming to revive the coal industry  no one can deny the fact that renewable energy is the future Notably  2 044 MW of solar PV were installed in the U S   in first quarter 2017 to reach 44 7 GW of total installed capacity  enough to power 8 7 million American homes  Moreover  the industry is forecasted to nearly triple over the next five years  surpassing 100 GW nationwide  according to the U S  Energy Department Naturally  other utilities like Xcel Energy Inc    NYSE XEL   and Westar Energy  Inc    NYSE WR   are

Apart from this  Francesco Starace  chief executive of Italy based Enel  MI ENEI   the largest European power company  said that investment in renewable energy across the globe including the U S  will continue to grow regardless of President Trump s attempt to revive fossil fuels  This is because investment in renewable energy was primarily driven by technological progress and market forces and hence any amendment in U S  federal policy will have a marginal effect  He added that Enel has plans to invest  5 2bn in renewable generation  mainly wind and solar power  both in Europe and the U S   over the next three years

Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s strengths 
Extension of ITC  Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation 
On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  rushed developers to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 
Moreover  the wind power industry benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired at 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out 
The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will increase almost 10 gigawatts  GW  between 2017 and 2018 in the U S   given considerable rise in consumption in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the period 
The EIA expects wind energy capacity additions of 14 GW in 2017 2018  With these additions  total wind capacity would reach 95 GW by the end of 2018 
Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp   SPWR  and First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR    FSLR  are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the U S  and China 
The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It has also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move is intended to close a gap in which Chinese companies could use solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs 
The Sun Is Everywhere  Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Residential solar is undeniably gaining on utility scale solar in the U S  in a marked change in industry dynamics 
Among the renewable energy pack  rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corp  has an innovative game plan  This downstream solar company plays on its strength  providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the U S  California based SolarCity s MyPower loan plan allows its customers to own their solar systems and still pay less for electricity when compared to leasing them through power purchase agreements 
China s Solar Plans  China continues to hold the leading position around the globe in solar power installations  Last year  Chinese overseas investment in renewable energy projects was a record  25 billion  The country s energy agency announced that it will invest  364 0 billion in renewable power generation by 2020 
The National Energy Administration  NEA  said installed PV capacity climbed to 77 42 GW at 2016 end  with the addition of 34 54 GW during the year  The agency expects that the country will add over 110 GW of PV capacity in the 2016 2020 time frame 
Per the 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   China has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency  The FYP also plans to achieve non fossil fuel fired energy consumption of around 15  by 2020 and 20  by 2030 
India s Solar Initiatives  While the U S  and China have led the industry in recent years  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure for electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has a target of adding 175 GW of solar  wind and other renewable energy by 2022 
India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly  It is expected that around 1 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity will be added in 2017  up 75  from 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 
At the end of 2016  India boasted a pipeline of around 14 GW of utility scale projects  out of which 7 7 GW is expected to be commissioned this year  It is expected that the country will add a total of 8 8 GW in 2017  becoming the world s third biggest solar market after China and the U S 
Year 2017 is expected to be significant for the solar power sector in India  with total installed capacity reaching 18 GW 
First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  In 2016  First Solar connected a 130 MW utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 
JA Solar Holdings Co   Ltd  s  JASO  investment plans in India include a 500 MW solar module facility  which will be operational by this year  Another Chinese player Trina Solar Ltd   TSL  is planning to build 700 MW capacity for solar cells and 500 MW capacity for solar modules in the country  These are encouraging signs for the industry in India 
Solar in Japan  Japan has been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search of new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market as the government has set a goal of generating 12  of power from solar PV by fiscal 2030  up from the present level of 4  
In particular  the solar power boom in Japan ramped up considerably in 2016  Electricity generation from solar PV alone grew to 4 3  in last year  up from 2 7  in 2015  Overall  in 2016  renewable energy sources comprised 14 2  of total electricity generation  It has been projected that Japan will install 8 GW of solar PV in 2017 
Japan s need for electricity was on the rise  particularly after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident  which triggered a complete phase out of all nuclear reactors in the country  Presently  the Japanese government is looking for alternate resources to meet the growing need for power in this very industrialized nation 
Summing Up
It is evident that demand for renewables is strengthening at a rapid clip  Moreover  the gradual widening of the solar markets should bode well for all global players and instill confidence in the industry over the long term  The increased adoption was mainly due to the booming residential PV market and continued realization of the utility sector s double digit GW project pipeline

China s Solar Plans   China continues to hold the leading position around the globe in solar power installations  Last year  Chinese overseas investment in renewable energy projects was a record  25 billion  The country s energy agency announced that it will invest  364 0 billion in renewable power generation by 2020 

	The National Energy Administration  NEA  said installed PV capacity climbed to 77 42 GW at 2016 end  with the addition of 34 54 GW during the year  The agency expects that the country will add over 110 GW of PV capacity in the 2016 2020 time frame 

	Per the 13th Five Year Plan  FYP   China has set a target of attaining 150GW to 200GW of solar PV capacity by 2020  It also intends to shift focus from grid scale expansion to quality and efficiency  The FYP also plans to achieve non fossil fuel fired energy consumption of around 15  by 2020 and 20  by 2030 

India s Solar Initiatives   While the U S  and China have led the industry in recent years  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure for electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has a target of adding 175 GW of solar  wind and other renewable energy by 2022 

	India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly  It is expected that around 1 1 GW of rooftop solar capacity will be added in 2017  up 75  from 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 

	At the end of 2016  India boasted a pipeline of around 14 GW of utility scale projects  out of which 7 7 GW is expected to be commissioned this year  It is expected that the country will add a total of 8 8 GW in 2017  becoming the world s third biggest solar market after China and the U S 

	Year 2017 is expected to be significant for the solar power sector in India  with total installed capacity reaching 18 GW 

	First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  In 2016  First Solar connected a 130 MW utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 

	JA Solar Holdings Co   Ltd  s  NASDAQ        investment plans in India include a 500 MW solar module facility  which will be operational by this year 

Solar in Japan   Japan has been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search of new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market as the government has set a goal of generating 12  of power from solar PV by fiscal 2030  up from the present level of 4  

	In particular  the solar power boom in Japan ramped up considerably in 2016  Electricity generation from solar PV alone grew to 4 3  in last year  up from 2 7  in 2015  Overall  in 2016  renewable energy sources comprised 14 2  of total electricity generation  It has been projected that Japan will install 8 GW of solar PV in 2017 

	Japan s need for electricity was on the rise  particularly after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident  which triggered a complete phase out of all nuclear reactors in the country  Presently  the Japanese government is looking for alternate resources to meet the growing need for power in this very industrialized nation 

Summing Up

	It is evident that demand for renewables is strengthening at a rapid clip  Moreover  the gradual widening of the solar markets should bode well for all global players and instill confidence in the industry over the long term  The increased adoption was mainly due to the booming residential PV market and continued realization of the utility sector s double digit GW project pipeline

102564,324079,DUK,Utility Stocks Make Secure Bets On Multiple Factors,opinion,"Donald Trump s presidency is expected to benefit defensive and domestic oriented utilities immensely  even though conventional wisdom runs counter to this view in light of historical underperformance of high dividend stocks in a rising interest rate backdrop 
During his election campaign  Trump had vowed to lower the regulatory pressure on domestic manufacturers and suggested increased investment in energy infrastructure  The new administration has started to work on these lines  with Trump signing an executive order to repeal the Clean Power plan 
This is based on Trump s view of climate change being  a Chinese Hoax  aimed at making U S  manufacturing  non competitive   This should keep fossil fuel based electricity generation afloat longer than expected 
The abolishment of the Clean Power Plan will give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal  Coal still accounts for nearly 30  of the electricity produced in the U S 
However  even without the Clean Power Plan  some large utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE  and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   DUK  have taken the initiative to produce more electricity from natural gas and alternate sources 
We believe there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation  A constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables  and supporting coal powered projects by infrastructure investments will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 
In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 
Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks
Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability  These operators in turn reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly 
We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   CNP  and Duke Energy  which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 
CenterPoint Energy  currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has a quarterly dividend rate of 26 75 cents and a dividend yield of 3 92   You can see  
Duke Energy s current quarterly dividend rate is 85 5 cents  with a dividend yield of 4 10  
Stable Demand   Rising Prices
A major positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for its services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This lends revenues and cash flow a high level of stability and visibility 
In a recent release  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  predicted that the annual average U S  residential electricity price will increase 2 4  in 2017 and 2 3  in 2018  which will surely benefit the utilities 
Focus on R D   Extension of ITC PTC
In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines  which helped in the efficient usage of energy 
Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic  PV  sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 
In addition  the utility friendly move of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the utilities  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 
Mergers and Acquisitions
Utility sector operators don t shy away from Merger and Acquisition  M A  activities to supplement organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 
We believe that in a mature energy market like the U S   M As represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 
We are noticing major acquisitions in the water utility space  American Water Works Company  AWK  closed several acquisitions in the first quarter of 2017  largest among them being that of Shorelands Water Company  which added 11 000 customers to the company s existing customer base  The pending acquisition when closed could increase the company s customer base by 33 000 in 2017 
Another major player in the water utility space  Aqua America Inc   WTR   successfully completed a few acquisitions in the first of 2017  Its pending acquisition  when closed over the course of the year  will add another 8 600 customers to its existing base 
To Sum Up
Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features  In addition  relaxed emission regulations under the Trump administration will act as a tailwind for the utility sector 
We can have different fuel types like coal  oil  natural gas  nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry 
Though the back to back interest rate hikes  Dec 2016 and Mar 2017  will increase the cost of operation for utilities  these fundamentally strong companies should be able withstand the challenges and continue to deliver stable performances  The defensive nature and stable performance demonstrated by the utility sector has driven investors to look for a safe haven in this space  Regular dividend payers are often regarded as a  bond substitute  and consistent performing utilities continue to be safe investment options for jittery investors

Last quarter  the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 5 94   However  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  the average surprise being a negative 1 20  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP  Duke Energy has an  of  1 29   That is because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 57 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 55  This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Please check our that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises Zacks Rank  Duke Energy has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates 
Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of Duke Energy s Zacks Rank  3 and  1 29  ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat 
 DUKE ENERGY CP Price and EPS Surprise
 

    
What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Duke Energy continues to develop its domestic infrastructure business  In this connection  the recently completed acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas and the expansion of the company s natural gas infrastructure platform are expected to support its transition to a lower carbon future 
Moreover  favorable weather conditions are expected to drive sales in the third quarter  which has been traditionally the company s strongest quarter over the year 
Further  at the onset of the third quarter  management filed a request with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina to raise the base rate which will boost the company s revenues by about  79 million  Also  the company s recent investments in energy infrastructure will enable it to offer affordable  reliable and cleaner energy to customers  These investments  in turn  are expected to make a stronger case for the rate hike proposal 
Duke Energy has also been making significant investments in cleaner energy resources and technologies to modernize its energy grid and provide better services to customers  The company s growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across its service territories  particularly in the Southeast  also buoy optimism 
Considering these positives  the company continues to expect 2016 earnings in the range of  4 50  4 70 per share 
For the third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  1 55 a share  reflecting an increase of 5 15  year over year  while the consensus for revenues is pegged at  6 68 billion  implying 3  year over year growth 
Other Stocks to Consider

102626,324141,DUK,5 Utility Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Their Q3 Earnings Releases,opinion,"With majority of the sectors  except Retail and Consumer Discretionary  on the verge of wrapping up their Q3 reporting cycle  the overall growth picture appears to be quite encouraging when compared to the past few earnings seasons  We note that the results of 63 3  of the utility stocks that have already reported position the sector in the top third of the 16 Zacks sectors in terms of year over year earnings growth   
In fact  utilities have already recorded earnings growth of 15 9  compared with the S P 500 s average year over year growth of just 1 6   For Q3 as a whole  earnings for the utilities are expected to be up 13 8  on 5 3  higher revenues compared with 2 4  and 1 4   respectively for the S P 500 members 
In this context  it is imperative to mention that historically utility stocks have been a safe haven for risk averse investors given the regulated nature of their business  domestic orientation of the stocks that protect them from frequent currency fluctuations and the fact that the sector is a provider of basic services to the economy 
Moreover  utility stocks pay consistent dividends and steady price  which make them ideal for investment  According to USA Today  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 7 9  in 2011  the Dow Jones Utility Average rose 5 6  over the same period  post the great depression  
Also  this sector is primarily a non cyclical one and thus acts as a shield for investors during economic downturns  May be that s why amid the widespread volatility that has been causing global sell offs since last year  the Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  improved  12 9  in one year compared with the S P 500 s return of just 0 89  over the same time frame Recent Factors Driving Utility Stocks
The recent changes in laws and regulations  including the U S  Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  Clean Power Plan  CPP   requires states to reduce carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions from existing fossil fuel generators  As a result  renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power are gaining rapid popularity 
As per the latest report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   published in Aug 2016  electricity generation from renewables is expected to increase 99  by 2030 and 152  by 2040 from 2015 level  under CPP requirements  Naturally the latest trend in the Energy Utility space involves companies transitioning their business from using coal fired generators to renewable energy sources 
Moreover  the utility sector is also known for its capital intensive nature  Because of this  utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment that is currently prevalent in the U S  economy  With the U S  presidential vote scheduled next week  the Fed has retained the present rate for now  However  talks hinting at a rate hike before the end of the year could hamper the growth momentum of the sector  Nevertheless  we expect the inherent strength of this sector to keep the momentum going 
The U S  economy is also showing consistent signs of improvement with the unemployment rate coming down to 5  in Sep 2016 from 5 1  in Sep 2015  Moreover  the country s real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2 9  in the third quarter of 2016  as per estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  In the second quarter  real GDP increased 1 4  
We expect the aforementioned factors to strongly encourage investors to invest in utility stocks How to Pick the Right Stocks

Picking the right stock for your portfolio for assured returns could appear a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the utility space  One way to narrow down the list of choices is by looking at stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive

102627,324142,DUK,AES Corp  AES   A Beat In The Cards This Earnings Season ,opinion,"The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   is set to release third quarter 2016 results  before the opening bell on Nov 4 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 5 56   Moreover  AES Corp missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 6 45  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement AES CORP Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that AES Corp is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP  AES Corp has an  of  3 13   That is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 33 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 32 cents  This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  Please check our that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises Zacks Rank  AES Corp has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates 
Also  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of AES Corp s Zacks Rank  3 and  3 13  ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat 
What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
With respect to portfolio optimization  AES Corp has been witnessing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations in Brazil  To capitalize on this trend  the company agreed to sale its 100  ownership interest in Sul  its most material utility business in Brazil  This sale will result in approximately  470 million in equity proceeds 
As of its second quarter earnings call  the company is currently seeking regulatory approval for this transaction and expects to close it before the end of 2016  Including  the proceeds from the sale of Sul  AES Corp plans to close a total of  540 million in asset sales this year 
In terms of its construction projects  the company expects to witness consistent progress and considers these programs to be its most significant growth drivers  During the third quarter  AES Corp received approval for the 1 4 gig watts Southland repowering project from the California Utility Commission  Currently  it expects to complete the construction of its 5502 mega watt plant in Chile  on time and on budget  sometime later in 2016 
However  in Brazil  despite observing modest improvement in energy demand in recent times  the company expects to witness negative growth during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 
While the company s first half adjusted EPS was impacted by higher tax rate and softness in U S  power prices  the majority of its earnings are expected to be generated in the second half of 2016 owing to expectations of a lower effective tax rate  the realization of cost savings initiatives and reduced scheduled maintenance work 
For the third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects a decline of 16 67   while the consensus for revenues hints at a rise of 3 41  on a year over year basis

102634,324149,DUK,Utility ETFs To Shelter Portfolio From Market Turmoil,opinion,"Exchange traded funds  ETFs  not only offer the flexibility of stocks  but also protect investors from market turmoil  Utility ETFs are one of the safest investment options as they include utilities in their portfolio  Utilities are a safe bet given the regulated nature of their business that gives their revenues a high level of certainty  The predominantly domestic focus also shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues  All the utility ETFs discussed below have returned in excess of 14  year to date 

	Utilities provide basic services like electricity  gas and water that can never go out of business   this is their most basic fundamental strength  Their ability to boost shareholders  value through consistent dividend payments makes them all the more attractive  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 13 4  year to date  as of Oct 17  2016  compared with the S P 500 s 4 1  return over the same time frame   Read   

	The utility sector is presently at a crossroads after the release of the new emission standards by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  The finalized Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  To meet the new emission standards  the utility sector needs to witness the retirement of aged coal plants and higher capital investment in natural gas and alternate energy fired electricity generation units 

	In this context  the Federal Reserve s cautious monetary stance and its decision to keep the interest rate unchanged have been beneficial for the utilities  However  Fed officials are now hinting at an interest rate hike before the end of this year  provided that overall economic conditions are conducive for such a move   Read   

	It s quite obvious that an interest rate hike will have the biggest impact on utilities among all other sectors as this capital intensive space requires regular funding for the maintenance and expansion of the existing infrastructure  In addition  adhering to stringent emission norms calls for the extra expenses 

	Amid the uncertainties surrounding an interest rate hike  earnings of the utility sector is expected to increase 4 8  in the third quarter of 2016 on 3 9  growth in revenues   In sharp contrast  the S P 500 is expected to witness an overall earnings decline of 2 9  

	Given the positive sector outlook  now is the right time to focus on utility ETFs that capture the benefits of individual utility stocks and pass them on to the investors

	Chicago  IL   October 05  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Utilities  Part 2  including CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   NYSE     Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   NYSE     Great Plains Energy Inc   NYSE     Westar Energy Inc   NYSE   andAmerican Water Works Company  NYSE      

	Industry  Utilities  part 2

	Link  

	The global market is far from being stable  thanks to possibilities of a Fed rate hike  uncertainties surrounding the Presidential Election in the U S   the volatility in oil prices and sluggish growth in China  To counter the overall uncertainty  an investor should opt for defensive plays like utilities that known for their stability even amid global turmoil 

	The utility sector is at a crucial juncture after the release of new emission standards by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  last August  The finalized version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  An EPA report also indicates that nearly  600 billion will be required to be invested in the water sector over the next two decades to get uninterrupted water and wastewater services of high quality 

	Larger utilities with more financial strength and better access to capital are favorably placed to achieve regulatory compliance  This is also likely to trigger more consolidation in the utility landscape  be it the water or the electric utilities  For the electric utilities  the focus is definitely on generating electricity from natural gas and renewable sources  As a result  we expect to see higher solar installations across the U S  as solar power currently contributes only 1  of total electricity produced in U S 

	The combination of steady electricity price gains and stable to improving demand will drive the utility sector  A decline in the unemployment rate  increase in hourly earnings of average workers and higher demand for utility services are acting as tailwinds for the utilities 

	Rising up to the environmental challenge  utility companies are steadily improving their operations by investing in more environment friendly power generation facilities  A recent release from the U S  government s Energy Information Administration  EIA  projects other renewables used in the electric power sector to increase from 2 6 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 8 8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting growth of 5  

	The report also forecasts hydropower generation in the electric power sector to increase from 2 3 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 2 8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting growth of 0 8  

	Moreover  the report indicates U S  coal based generation to drop from 17 2 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 13 1 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting a decline of 1 1  

	We believe a constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables and investments in infrastructure upgrade projects will enable the utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 

	In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 

Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks

	Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability and removes volatility from future earnings  These operators in turn reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends without fail 

	We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy  NYSE      andDuke Energy  NYSE       which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 

	In Jan 2016  CenterPoint Energy increased its quarterly dividend by 4  to 25 75 cents  In Jul 2016  Duke Energy increased its quarterly dividend by 3 6  to 85 5 cents 

Stable   Growing Demand

	The biggest positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for its services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This gives revenues and cash flows a high level of certainty and visibility 

	Due to the planned reduction in coal powered units  the EIA forecasts total U S  electricity generation in 2016 to average 11 2 terawatt hours per day  marginally below 2015 generation  The EIA expects total electricity generation to grow by 1 6  in 2017 

Focused on R D   Extension of ITC PTC

	In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have brought new smart meters  and transmission and distribution lines  into operation without compromising on energy efficiency 

	Utility operators are also benefiting from ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic  PV  sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 

	In addition  the utility friendly move of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the utilities  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 

Mergers and Acquisitions

	Utility sector operators don t shy away from M A activities to supplement their organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 

	We believe that in a mature energy market like the U S   mergers and acquisitions represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 

	In May 2016  Great Plains Energy Inc   NYSE      announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Westar Energy Inc   NYSE     The merger  reportedly valued at  12 2 billion  includes about  8 6 billion in total stock and cash consideration  and  3 6 billion of Westar Energy s debt  Recently  shareholders of the both companies approved the merger 

	We are also likely to see major acquisition activities in the water utility space  During the first half of 2016 American Water Works Company  NYSE      closed 10 acquisitions  adding 7 556 customers to its customer base  The 13 pending acquisitions will add 47 845 customers to its existing base 

	You can see   

To Sum Up

	We can have different fuel types like coal  oil  natural gas  nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry 

	Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features 

	Without a doubt  the likely interest rate hike before 2016 end will further increase the borrowing cost for the utilities  With all eyes set on the next move  the Fed Chair might increase rates if she finds overall economic factors strong enough for the next liftoff  While Fed officials are seriously considering a hike before the end of 2016  still low interest rates will definitely benefit utilities 

	Volatility in the markets has also driven investors to seek protection in the utility space  These regular dividend payers are often regarded as a  bond substitute  and consistent performing utilities continue to be safe investment options for jittery investors

102685,324200,DUK,Duke Energy To Sell Bulk Of International Assets For  2 4B,opinion,"Duke Energy Corporation   NYSE DUK   has recently signed twin sell out deals  worth a total value of  2 4 billion  to finally reduce its international exposure  This leaves the company with the 25  equity stake it has in National Methanol Company  NMC  overseas  which its management plans to retain  The after tax gains from the transactions are expected to contribute to the company s debt reduction 
The Twin Deals
Per the terms of one of the contracts  I Squared Capital   an independent global infrastructure investment manager   will purchase Duke Energy s international assets situated in Peru  Chile  Ecuador  Guatemala  El Salvador and Argentina  for a total enterprise value of  1 2 billion  This will mark the company s final exit from its Latin American business 
These Latin American assets of Duke Energy include hydroelectric and natural gas generation plants  transmission infrastructure and natural gas processing facilities  totaling 2 300 megawatt  MW  of installed capacity  This deal requires Argentina s antitrust approval  although the approval is not a condition of closing 
Under the terms of the second agreement  clean energy company   China Three Gorges Corporation   has agreed to acquire Duke Energy s entire Brazilian business  consisting of eight hydroelectric plants and two small hydro power plants  for a total of  1 2 billion  These assets represent an accumulative installed capacity of 2 090 MW DUKE ENERGY CP Price
    
Reason Behind the Sell Out
Duke Energy s International Energy segment has been underperforming for past few quarters  owing to ongoing draught conditions in Brazil  decreased demand in both Brazil and Latin America  as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates hampering the company s results overseas  Consequently  in Feb  2016  Duke Energy announced its near term plan of divesting its International Energy business segment  excluding the equity investment in NMC and give more emphasis on growing its operations in the domestic front 
Management expected this sale to improve the company s risk profile and enhance its ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time 
Our View
In the business world  there lies no value in retaining non profitable assets  Considering the widespread volatility prevailing across Latin America  as well as persistent fluctuations observable in oil price amid skepticism of an OPEC production cut  it has become quite difficult for energy stocks to survive  especially in low demand regions like Latin America 
Inevitably  Duke Energy s future prospects in its international business segment are bleak  at least in the near term  Hence  a divestment strategy is a wise option to adopt  We believe  with this sell out  the company will now be able to focus on nurturing its core domestic business  wherein it has recently completed the  1 8 billion worth Piedmont Natural Gas takeover 
Notably this latest buyout will increase the company s total regulated business mix to over 90   thereby supporting its earnings and dividend growth objectives  Moreover  the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings in 2017 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Duke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   A few better ranked stocks in the utility sector include DTE Energy Company   NYSE DTE    Edison International   NYSE EIX   and Xcel Energy Inc    NYSE XEL    All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
DTE Energy has witnessed a 0 6  rise in its last 5 days  stock price  This company s current year consensus estimate improved 0 8  in last 7 days 
Edison International has witnessed a 1 08  rise in its last 5 days  stock price  On average  the company witnessed an earnings surprise of 8 00  in trailing 4 quarters

102745,324260,DUK,Will Obama s Green Energy Plan Drive Alt Energy Stocks ,opinion,"The extension of key renewable tax credits  reduced solar photovoltaic  PV  capital costs and low natural gas prices  along with state level renewable mandates  will be driving the alternative energy space s growth trajectory 
After months of suffering from collapsing oil prices  green energy companies suddenly seem to be on firmer footing now  The Paris climate change summit gave the renewables sector a shot in the arm last year  while Congress  vote to extend federal subsidies for renewable energy has further perked up the space 
Solar and wind energy got a major boost from the environmental tax credit extension that came as part of the  1 15 trillion federal spending bill  which also lifted a 40 year ban on exporting American crude oil  The latest report from the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   also shows that renewable energy will be the fastest growing power source through 2040  accounting for 27  of total U S  generation 
Solar and wind are gradually transforming the way we produce and consume energy  driving the ongoing global energy transition  Although some better established sources of alternative energy   hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power   CSP   are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting 
Moreover  declining capital costs for technologies are improving their competitiveness  As per Solar Energy Industries Association s   SEIA    national solar PV system pricing fell up to 17  over the course of 2015 
Here we take a look at the alternative energy space and attempt to identify this nascent industry s growing strengths 
President s Green Energy Plan   Clean energy  has long been the focus of the current administration  President Obama s  Climate Change Action Plan  and the favorable green energy trends have already done a lot in pushing the sector northward 
On Dec 15  2015  Congress passed an extension and modification of federal tax credits for new wind and solar generators  The new environmental tax credit extension allows solar power companies to keep claiming federal Investment Tax Credits   ITC   at 30  of the price of solar energy systems installed by businesses or homeowners  The ITC  which was earlier set to expire at the end of 2016  was forcing developers to rush to finish projects  Now they look good through 2019 with the five year extension  However  the credit will start to decline  going down to 10  in 2022 
The wind sector also benefited significantly from the production tax credit   PTC   extension  The PTC  which had expired at 2014 end due to Congressional gridlock  was extended through 2020  However  the PTC that pays 2 3 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated will be gradually reduced over the next four years before being completely phased out 
In addition  the Obama administration s efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a net positive for renewable energy stocks  On Aug 3  2015  the White House revealed the final version of its ambitious climate policy  This Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  program seeks to cut CO2 emissions from the nation s power plants 
The administration has vowed for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  This version turns out to be a little stronger than the draft proposal released last summer  wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29  by 2025 and 30  by 2030 
The plan sets carbon pollution reduction goals for power plants and requires states to implement plans to meet these goals  States have until this month to submit plans  but all must comply by 2022  of U S  electricity and coal plants are the largest source of carbon emissions in the country  Increasing regulatory mandates to safeguard the environment will be a catalyst for renewable stocks 
The proposed rule has influenced utility providers like NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG    NRG   Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE   SRE  and Duke Energy Corp  NYSE DUK    DUK  to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind and water 
The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will expand by more than 13 3 GW between 2016 and 2017 in the U S   in tandem with considerable consumption growth in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California  along with North Carolina  Nevada  Texas and Georgia  will account for most of the projected utility scale capacity additions over the said period 
Anti Dumping Duties and Solar Trade War  Washington imposed import duties on solar panels and other related products from China and Taiwan  The U S  believes that Chinese manufacturers have benefited from unfair subsidies offered by their government  U S  solar stocks like SunPower Corp   SPWR  and First Solar Inc  NASDAQ FSLR    FSLR  are expected to make the most of the trade conflict between the U S  and China 
The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC    in Dec 2014  set anti dumping duties at about 52  on most module imports from China and at 19 5  on most imports of Taiwanese cells  It has also slapped 39  anti subsidy tariffs on most China made panels  The move is intended to close a gap in which Chinese companies could use solar cells made in Taiwan to avoid paying higher tariffs 
The Sun Is Everywhere  Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to the end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Residential solar is undeniably gaining on utility scale solar in the U S  in a marked change in industry dynamics 
Among the renewable energy pack  rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corp   SCTY  has an innovative game plan  This downstream solar company plays on its strength  providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the U S  California based SolarCity s MyPower loan plan allows its customers to own their solar systems and still pay less for electricity when compared to leasing them through power purchase agreements 
India s Solar Initiatives  While the U S  and China have been in the forefront in recent years in driving the industry  other nations are also developing their home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure to solve the electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  which has committed to generate 40  of its total power capacity from renewable sources by 2030 
India is striving to enhance its solar energy capacity to 100 GW by 2022  which will include 60 GW from grid connected solar projects and 40 GW from rooftop solar  The pace of installation is projected to accelerate rapidly with a forecast of installing 4 8 GW in 2016  This has kindled the interest of global solar players in the Indian market 
First Solar and SunEdison Inc  have ample businesses in India and  together with local firms  are investing considerably in the country  Recently  First Solar has connected 130 megawatts   MW   utility scale solar power to the nation s grid  These plants are part of a 260 MW project portfolio wholly owned by First Solar in India 
JA Solar Holdings Co   Ltd  s  JASO  investment plans in India include a 500 MW solar module facility which will be operational by 2017  Another Chinese player Trina Solar Ltd   TSL  is planning to build 700 MW capacity for solar cells and 500 MW capacity for solar modules in the country  These are encouraging signs of the solar industry s prospects in India 
Solar in Japan  Japan has been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search of new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market as the government has set a goal of generating 22 24  of power from renewable energy sources by fiscal 2030 
Japan s need for electricity was on the rise  particularly after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident  which triggered a complete phase out of all nuclear reactors in the country  Presently  the Japanese government is looking for alternate resources to meet the growing need for power in this very industrialized nation 
According to Japan  Group unit Padaeng Industry  PDI  Asia Solar will invest in three projects totaling 13 MW in the nation  The first installation of 2 MW array in Nanao  Ishikawa prefecture is expected to be operational by the third quarter of 2016 
Summing Up
It is evident that demand for renewables is strengthening at a rapid clip  Moreover  the gradual widening of the solar markets should bode well for all global players and instill confidence in the industry over the long term  The major uptake was mainly due to the booming residential PV market and continued realization of the utility sector s double digit GW project pipeline 
The tax credit renewal brings a fresh lease of life to solar adoption  Plus   the extension is likely to add another 140 000 jobs or more   as per SEIA

102747,324262,DUK,Utilities Continue Offering Stability Amid Overall Uncertainty,opinion,"The global market is far from being stable  thanks to possibilities of a Fed rate hike  uncertainties surrounding the Presidential Election in the U S   the volatility in oil prices and sluggish growth in China  To counter the overall uncertainty  an investor should opt for defensive plays like utilities that known for their stability even amid global turmoil 
The utility sector is at a crucial juncture after the release of new emission standards by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  last August  The finalized version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  An EPA report also indicates that nearly  600 billion will be required to be invested in the water sector over the next two decades to get uninterrupted water and wastewater services of high quality 
Larger utilities with more financial strength and better access to capital are favorably placed to achieve regulatory compliance  This is also likely to trigger more consolidation in the utility landscape  be it the water or the electric utilities  For the electric utilities  the focus is definitely on generating electricity from natural gas and renewable sources  As a result  we expect to see higher solar installations across the U S  as solar power currently contributes only 1  of total electricity produced in U S 
The combination of steady electricity price gains and stable to improving demand will drive the utility sector  A decline in the unemployment rate  increase in hourly earnings of average workers and higher demand for utility services are acting as tailwinds for the utilities 
Rising up to the environmental challenge  utility companies are steadily improving their operations by investing in more environment friendly power generation facilities  A recent release from the U S  government s Energy Information Administration  EIA  projects other renewables used in the electric power sector to increase from 2 6 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 8 8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting growth of 5  
The report also forecasts hydropower generation in the electric power sector to increase from 2 3 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 2 8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting growth of 0 8  
Moreover  the report indicates U S  coal based generation to drop from 17 2 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 13 1 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040  reflecting a decline of 1 1  
We believe a constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables and investments in infrastructure upgrade projects will enable the utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 
In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 
Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks
Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability and removes volatility from future earnings  These operators in turn reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends without fail 
We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   CNP   and Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   DUK   which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 
In Jan 2016  CenterPoint Energy increased its quarterly dividend by 4  to 25 75 cents  In Jul 2016  Duke Energy increased its quarterly dividend by 3 6  to 85 5 cents 
Stable   Growing Demand
The biggest positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for its services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This gives revenues and cash flows a high level of certainty and visibility 
Due to the planned reduction in coal powered units  the EIA forecasts total U S  electricity generation in 2016 to average 11 2 terawatt hours per day  marginally below 2015 generation  The EIA expects total electricity generation to grow by 1 6  in 2017 
Focused on R D   Extension of ITC PTC 
In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have brought new smart meters  and transmission and distribution lines  into operation without compromising on energy efficiency 
Utility operators are also benefiting from ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic  PV  sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 
In addition  the utility friendly move of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the utilities  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 
Mergers and Acquisitions
Utility sector operators don t shy away from M A activities to supplement their organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 
We believe that in a mature energy market like the U S   mergers and acquisitions represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 
In May 2016  Great Plains Energy Inc   GXP  announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Westar Energy Inc   WR  The merger  reportedly valued at  12 2 billion  includes about  8 6 billion in total stock and cash consideration  and  3 6 billion of Westar Energy s debt  Recently  shareholders of the both companies approved the merger 
We are also likely to see major acquisition activities in the water utility space  During the first half of 2016  American Water Works Company  AWK  closed 10 acquisitions  adding 7 556 customers to its customer base  The 13 pending acquisitions will add 47 845 customers to its existing base 
Another player in the water utility space  Aqua America Inc   WTR   completed several acquisitions in its service territories  adding 5 396 customers  as of Aug 2  2016   Thanks to strategic acquisitions and organic growth  the company expects to expand its customer base by 1 5  to 2  in 2016  Aqua America currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  
To Sum Up
We can have different fuel types like coal  oil  natural gas  nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry 
Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features 
Without a doubt  the likely interest rate hike before 2016 end will further increase the borrowing cost for the utilities  With all eyes set on the next move  the Fed Chair might increase rates if she finds overall economic factors strong enough for the next liftoff  While Fed officials are seriously considering a hike before the end of 2016  still low interest rates will definitely benefit utilities 
Volatility in the markets has also driven investors to seek protection in the utility space  These regular dividend payers are often regarded as a  bond substitute  and consistent performing utilities continue to be safe investment options for jittery investors

Based in Charlotte  NC  Duke  along with its subsidiaries operates as an energy company in both the United States and Latin America  Based in data from Statista  Duke is the largest energy company in the U S  in terms of market value  The company has a current market cap of  56 3 billion 
Earlier this year  the Department of Environmental Quality in North Carolina ordered Duke to pay the fine  which the company has since contested  Duke first pleaded guilty to nine violations of the Federal Clean Water Act in May of 2015  It was supposed to pay  102 million in fines for allowing its coal ash dumps at five power plants to illegally pollute the environment 
Specifically  it was revealed that Duke s pollution had entered the Dan River  Investigations began after a pipe collapsed under a coal ash dump in 2014 and seeped into the river   Later  prosecutors found that the company had been illegally dumping toxic discharge since 2010 
The  6 6 million case is an offshoot of the original 2014 spill  According to the Charlotte Observer  Duke believes the fine amount is arbitrary and that the company is not being treated fairly  North Carolina is proposing penalties for pollution violations dating as far back as January 2012  but the company does not believe that is appropriate 
This is not the first time that Duke has continued to appeal a fine  In 2015  the company was handed a  25 million fine over groundwater pollution at a closed power plant  However  after many appeals it was able to reduce the fine to  7 million 
Duke s case is one of many in the conversation involving our current means of energy production  Coal burning power plants release harmful toxins such as arsenic  mercury amongst many others  which result in acid rain and damage water supplies 
Even so  shares of the company are up nearly 16  year to date  and earnings estimate revisions have not moved much  Current quarter estimates stand at  1 51 in earnings per share while full year estimates stand at  4 59 respectively  Both of these estimates are down a cent from those of 60 days ago

102848,324363,DUK,Utility ETFs Always A Safe Option For The Investors,opinion,"Exchange traded funds  ETFs  not only offer the flexibility of stocks  but also protect investors from market turmoil  Utility ETFs are one of the safest investment options as they include utilities in their portfolio  Utilities are a safe bet given the regulated nature of their business that gives their revenues a high level of certainty  The predominantly domestic focus also shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues  All the utility ETFs discussed below have returned in excess of 21  year to date   Read   

	Though demand for utility services like electricity  gas and water varies with the swings of the economy  the fortunes of these companies don t vary to the same extent as the economic cycle  After all  these companies providing basic services can never go out of business   this is their most basic fundamental strength  Their ability to boost shareholders  value through consistent dividend payments makes them all the more attractive  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 24 1  year to date  till Jul 8  2016  compared with the S P 500 return of 4 2  over the same time frame 

	The utility sector is presently at a crossroads after the release of the new emission standards by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  The finalized Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  To meet the new emission standards  the industry needs more capital investments going forward   Read    

	In this context  the Federal Reserve s cautious monetary stance and its decision to keep the interest rate unchanged during the first half of 2016 will be beneficial for the utilities  Moreover  the Brexit referendum and the global financial turmoil in its wake might deter Fed officials to go for another rate hike later this year 

	Earnings from utilities are expected to increase by 21 0  in the second quarter of 2016 on a 2 4  increase in the top line   In contrast  the S P 500 is expected to suffer an earnings decline of 6 2  on 0 6  lower revenues 

	Given the positive utility sector outlook  it is wise to focus on utility ETFs which will capture the benefits from individual utility stocks and pass them on to the investors

102900,324415,DUK,If You Seek A Stable Portfolio  Utilities Are A Must,opinion,"The utility sector is at the crossroads after the release of the new emission standards by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  last August  The finalized version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  An EPA report also indicates that nearly  600 billion will be required to be invested in the water sector over the next two decades to get uninterrupted water and wastewater services of high quality 
Evidently  larger utilities with more financial strength and better access to capital are favorably placed to achieve regulatory compliance  This is also likely to trigger more consolidation in the utility landscape  be it the water or the electric utilities  For the latter  the focus is definitely on generating electricity from natural gas and renewable sources  As a result  we expect to see higher solar installations across the U S  The extension of investment tax credits and production tax credits will further support solar and wind installations in the next few years 
The combination of steady electricity price gains and stable to improving demand will drive the utility sector  A decline in the unemployment rate  increase in hourly earnings of average workers and higher demand in residential and other customer classes are tailwinds for the utilities 
Rising up to the environmental challenge  utility companies are steadily improving their operations by investing in more environment friendly power generation facilities  A recent release from the U S  government s Energy Information Administration  EIA  projects renewables used in the electric power sector to increase by 11 3  in 2016 and by 4 4  in 2017 
The report also forecast hydropower generation in the electric power sector to increase by 9 1  in 2016 and then decline by 0 6  in 2017  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to grow by 13 3  in 2016 and by 8 6  in 2017 
The report indicates U S  coal consumption in electric generation will decline by 58 million short tons  MMst  or 8  year over year in 2016  The decline will largely be due to higher demand for clean burning  low priced natural gas and unseasonably warm temperatures during winter that reduced overall electricity generation 
We believe a constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables and investments in infrastructure upgrade projects will enable the utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 
In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 
Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks
Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability and removes volatility from future earnings  These operators in turn reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends without fail 
We have a long list of companies who are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders  Notable among them are companies like CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   CNP   Connecticut Water Service Inc   CTWS  and Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   DUK  who have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now 
In Jan 2016  CenterPoint Energy and Duke Energy increased their quarterly dividend rates by 4  and 3 8  to 25 75 cents and 82 5 cents  respectively  while in Jan 2016  Connecticut Water Service raised its payout by 5 6  to 28 25 cents 
Stable   Growing Demand
The biggest positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for their services  The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver  This gives revenues and cash flows a high level of certainty and visibility 
Due to the planned reduction in coal powered units  the EIA forecasts total U S  electricity generation in 2016 to average 11 2 terawatt hours per day  marginally below 2015 generation  The EIA expects total electricity generation to grow by 1 6  in 2017 
Focused on R D   Extension of ITC PTC 
In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have brought new smart meters  and transmission and distribution lines  into operation without compromising on energy efficiency 
Utility operators are also benefiting from ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic  PV  sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 
In addition  the utility friendly move of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the utilities  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 
Mergers and Acquisitions
Utility sector operators don t shy away from M A activities to supplement their organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 
We believe that in a mature energy market like the U S   mergers and acquisitions represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and also lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 
In Mar 2016  Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC   EXC  completed the much awaited acquisition of Pepco Holdings and has plans to invest  23 billion in regulated assets during the 2016 2018 time frame  which will help in earnings growth of 7  to 9  
In May 2016  Great Plains Energy Inc   GXP  announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Westar Energy Inc   WR  The transaction has an estimated value of  12 2 billion  including  3 6 billion of Westar Energy 
On Feb 1  2016  Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D    D  announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Questar Corp   STR   Dominion will require to shell out nearly  4 4 billion and assume Questar s outstanding debt  The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2016 subject to regulatory approvals 
We are also likely to see major acquisition activities in the water utility space  During the first quarter of 2016  American Water Works Company  AWK  closed seven acquisitions adding 6 868 customers to its existing customer base  The seven pending acquisitions will add another 33 752 customers  Another player in the water utility space  Aqua America Inc   WTR  has also completed several acquisitions in its service territories  adding 5 250 customers  as of May 3  2016  to its existing customer base 
To Sum Up
We can have different fuel types like coal  oil  natural gas  nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry 
Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features 
Without a doubt  the increase in interest rates in Dec 2015 has raised the borrowing costs for the utilities  With all eyes set to the next move of the Fed  it appears that the Fed chair has abandoned all plans of a rate hike in June citing weakness in international markets and lower than excepted job additions in May  Though Fed officials are seriously considering a hike in July or September  low interest rates for now will definitely benefit the utilities 
Volatility in the markets has also driven investors to seek protection in the utility space  These regular dividend payers are often regarded as a  bond substitute  and consistent performing utilities continue to be a safe investment option for jittery investors ",2016-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-you-seek-a-stable-portfolio,-utilities-are-a-must-200135775",200135775

In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have brought new smart meters  and transmission and distribution lines  into operation without compromising on energy efficiency 

Utility operators are also benefiting from ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic  PV  sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 

In addition  the utility friendly move of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the utilities  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 

Mergers and Acquisitions

Utility sector operators don t shy away from M A activities to supplement their organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the companies  the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 

We believe that in a mature energy market like the U S   mergers and acquisitions represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and also lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 

To Sum Up

We can have different fuel types like coal  oil  natural gas  nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity  but we do not have any alternative to electricity  Similarly  clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute  This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry 

Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features 

Without a doubt  the increase in interest rates in Dec 2015 has raised the borrowing costs for the utilities  With all eyes set to the next move of the Fed  it appears that the Fed chair has abandoned all plans of a rate hike in June citing weakness in international markets and lower than excepted job additions in May  Though Fed officials are seriously considering a hike in July or September  low interest rates for now will definitely benefit the utilities 

Volatility in the markets has also driven investors to seek protection in the utility space  These regular dividend payers are often regarded as a  bond substitute  and consistent performing utilities continue to be a safe investment option for jittery investors

102949,324464,DUK,What Is In Store For These Utility ETFs This Earnings Season ,opinion,"The utilitysector appears to be in great shape as chances of the Fed hiking rates in the nearterm have dropped significantly after the Fed Chair Janet Yellen s dovish comments  which were further reinforced by Fed Bank of New York President William C  Dudley  Dudley said that due to the uncertain U S  economic outlook  a cautious and gradual approach to interest rate increases is expected  read    

This raised the appeal for utility stocks  which offer solid dividend payouts and excellent capital appreciation over the longer term  Further  thanks to the sector s low correlation with the market  huge swings in the stock market don t have any effect on utility stocks  The utility sector is thus considered a defensive play or safe haven in turbulent times 

Uncertainty over rate hikes  weaknesses in the global economy and mixed domestic data have benefited the sector  In fact  utility ETFs saw smooth trading with Utilities Select Sector SPDR    Vanguard Utilities ETF     iShares Dow Jones US Utilities    and Fidelity MSCI Utilities ETF    gaining over 10  each in the last three months  as of April 25  2016  

Investors must be interested to know how the sector might be performing in the first quarter 2016 earnings season to help them make an investment decision 

Although utility stocks are yet to report  as per the  report  it is one of the few sectors that are expected to show earnings growth in the quarter  Utilities are expected to post earnings growth of 5 3  in the first quarter compared with a decline of 1 6  in fourth quarter 2015 

However  just looking at the overall sector outlook is not enough Let s also look at how the individual stocks to which the utility ETFs have significant exposure are expected to perform  We have highlighted the earnings prediction for some of these companies below 
Zacks Surprise Prediction

102950,324465,DUK,Why Utility ETFs Are Gaining Despite Dull Q1 Earnings,opinion,"The utility sector failed to impress in its first quarter results with earnings barely in line with lowered estimates and revenues coming in lower than expectations  This is also true for some of the major players in the space like Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK     and Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D       Although some companies like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE     managed to beat on earnings and revenues  growth numbers were disappointing 

As per our  report  earnings of all the utility companies that have reported so far are down 5 1  year over year for the first quarter of 2016  with 42 9  of the companies beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  revenues are down nearly 9 1  for the quarter  with only 28 6  of them surpassing the consensus mark 

However  the slowdown in U S  economic growth  Chinese market turbulence and volatile oil prices along with other factors resulted in a bearish environment  which led to demand for securities from sectors that provide a safer option  Thus  the utility sector  which is considered to be one of the defensive options when the market is exhibiting a high level of volatility  managed to remain in the green over last 10 days despite dull results  read    

Below we have highlighted the quarterly results of the aforementioned utility companies in detail 
Duke Energy

103000,324515,DUK,Time To Worry About Utility ETFs ,opinion,"Utilities   one of the best performing sectors of 2014   started the year on a good note with smart gains logged for January  An uncertain global economic outlook  interest rate cuts in developed to emerging markets  sliding commodity prices  political instability in Greece and a surprise move by the Swiss central bank to abandon its currency cap against the euro created panic among investors driving treasury yields lower at the start of the year  read    However  the sector has lately given up almost all of its gains and in fact is trading in the red in the year to date frame  The most popular product in the space   SPDR Select Sector   Utilities  NYSE XLU   has lost 7 4  in the past one month as against a 4  return by SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  over the same time frame  An improved U S  economy and a strong U S  jobs report have sent government bond yields sharply higher in the past few weeks  making the utility sector less attractive  The U S  economy has added more jobs than expected in January  fuelling optimism about the strength of the job market  Moreover  the U S  average hourly earnings rose at a better than expected pace of 0 5  in January  The upbeat labor market data has raised optimism about the pace of economic growth  leading many to believe that a rate hike by the Fed is surely on the cards this year  Expectations of a rate hike this year has caused the 10 year Treasury bond yield to spike to a four week high of nearly 2   a sharp and sudden increase from levels which were in the 1 65  range earlier in the month  read     Utilities are quite sensitive to interest rates though they offer steady and strong yields  Thus  rising Treasury yields  an improving U S  economy and strength in the jobs market have reduced the appeal of utilities as investors are shunning defensive bets to move to sectors more closely tied to growth  Moreover  utility companies rely on a large amount of debt for conducting operational activities  Hence  any rise in interest rates would push up their borrowing costs  Given the rising yields and concerns over a hike in short term rates this year  below we have highlighted some of the large cap funds in this space which have been among the hardest hit by the move towards cyclical securities and away from safety  Investors who believe that this is just the beginning of the slide in the space should clearly stay away from this space

103001,324516,DUK,March Madness Round 1  Kinder Morgan A Slam Dunk Over Duke Energy,opinion,"In a showdown between Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI  and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK   Kinder Morgan will dribble circles around Duke  If we re playing on college basketball metaphors  Kinder Morgan is Duke University while Duke Energy would be some obscure community college in Wyoming 

I m probably not being fair to Duke Energy here  It is by no means a bad company within its industry  It just so happens that Kinder Morgan is a long time holding of mine and one of my favorite stocks at current prices 

Kinder Morgan is the largest energy infrastructure company in North America with about 80 000 miles of pipelines in operation  And while Kinder Morgan has not been completely immune from the effects of falling energy prices  the damage has been pretty minimal  About 85  of its cash flows are fee based  meaning they have virtually no exposure to falling energy prices  and most of the remaining 15  of cash flows are hedged 

I expect that the slowdown in domestic production will slow the rate of growth in the amount of energy that Kinder Morgan transports  But I also expect the effects to be temporary  and in fact  Kinder Morgan is using the slowdown to its advantage  As I wrote earlier in March  Kinder Morgan has been buying quality pipeline assets from motivated sellers 

If you re considering a purchase of Kinder Morgan or Duke Energy  the dividend of each is a major selling point  So with that  let s dig into Kinder Morgan s dividend  Since initiating its dividend in 2011  Kinder Morgan has more than tripled its quarterly dividend  And in the last year  its dividend is up a cool 9  

Expect a lot more of the same going forward  When Kinder Morgan announced its business reorganization last year  management wrote that it expected to see dividend growth of  

Buying Kinder Morgan today  you get to enjoy a 4 4  current dividend  But let s now assume that hold the stock through 2020 and that management s estimates are correct  Assuming five years of 10  dividend growth compounded annually  you d be looking at 61  cumulative dividend growth  That would give you a yield on cost of 7 0  five years from now  And that assumes the minimum 10  annual growth  if Kinder Morgan continues to pick up assets from distressed sellers  the real growth rate might be significantly higher 

One final thing to consider on Kinder Morgan stock  When we buy KMI  we re investing alongside the people running the company  They have serious skin in the game  Since last February  company insiders have bought a net 812 599 shares worth over  33 million at today s prices  And Richard Kinder himself earns no compensation other than the dividends he collects on his shares  So Mr  Kinder has every incentive to continue raising Kinder Morgan s dividend for the benefit of us all 

Now let s take a look at Duke Energy  There is nothing necessarily wrong with Duke Energy  Its stock has outperform most of its peers in the utilities sector over the past five years  and its total return including dividends last year was nearly 28  

But as a boring  regulated utility company  Duke cannot possible expect to keep pace with Kinder Morgan  Today  Duke offers a dividend yield that is competitive  at 4 2   But Duke s dividend growth rate over the past five years has been a very modest 2 2  per year  and I don t expect it to accelerate much over the next few years 

Furthermore  Duke and many of its peers in the utilities sector have been used as bond substitutes by yield starved investors for years  I expect bond yields to stay low for a while  but I also fully realize that the utilities sector will be the first to get slammed once bond yields really do meaningfully rise 

So in Duke  your upside is a 4 2  dividend with 2  3  growth  That s hard to get excited about  But in Kinder Morgan  you get one of the fastest dividend growers in America backed by a class act owner operator in Richard Kinder 

The choice is clear here  Kinder Morgan is a slam dunk

103002,324517,DUK,Dividend Smackdown  REITs Vs  Utilities,opinion,"This year has proven to be a rough one for dividend stocks  With the Fed s rate hike looming and with bond yields rocketing higher  traditionally high yielding sectors like REITs and utilities have taken an absolute pounding  The REIT sector  as represented by the Vanguard REIT  ARCA VNQ   is down more than 13  from its January highs and is well into negative territory for the year  Many REITs are down more than 20   putting them into outright bear market territory 
Utilities have actually fared a little worse  The Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  is down close to 14  from its January highs  And as with REITs  many individual utility stocks are down significantly more 
After a good correction  it s always worthwhile to look for bargains  So today  we re going to pit REITs against utilities to see which is the better dividend play for the remainder of 2015  We ll judge the winner of this smackdown on three criteria  Current dividend yield  dividend growth  and overall macro backdrop 
Dividend Yield
It can get a little messy when comparing yields across sectors because most investors do not simply buy the index  They cherry pick the individual stocks they like best  which can have yields that are markedly different from the average for the sector  So  we ll look at both the index averages and at some individual names that investors are likely to own 
At current prices  VNQ yields 3 8   beating out XLU s 3 5   But it s only fair to note that both sectors out yield Treasuries by a decent margin  As of this writing  the 10 year Treasury yielded a pitiful 3 3  
Let s take a look at the portfolios of each  VNQ s largest holding by a wide margin is Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   which makes up more than 8  of the portfolio  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  round out the top three at 4 1  and 3 8  of the portfolio  respectively  None of these three are particularly high yielders  with current dividend yields of 3 4   3 6  and 3 1   respectively 
In my view  Realty Income  NYSE O   LTC Properties  NYSE LTC  and Ventas  NYSE VTR  are better options as buy and hold dividend stocks  At current prices  they yield 5 0   4 9  and 4 9  respectively and all have long track records of raising their dividends 
Now let s dig into XLU s holdings  Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  and Dominion Resources  NYSE D  dominate the portfolio  Of these  Duke is the highest yielder with a 4 4  dividend  NextEra and Dominion yield a less impressive but still competitive 3 1  and 3 9   respectively  But for a higher yield  you might consider Southern Company  NYSE SO   with its 5 1  yield or Gas Natural  NYSE EGAS   with its 5 4  yield

Dividend Growth
Comparing dividend growth between ETFs can be a little messy  You have to remember what an ETF is  It s a collection of companies  each with its own dividend payment schedule  To smooth this out  I took an average of the dividends paid over the trailing four quarters and compared to the average from the prior year  And here s what I found 
Dividend growth in the utilities sector has been pretty modest  Over the trailing four quarters  XLU s payout grew by 3 5   And going back to 2011  year over year growth has ranged from a little less than 0  to a little less than 8   That s more than enough to keep pace with inflation  but not enough to really excite me 
Now  let s look at REITs  VNQ s dividend rose by nearly 10  over the trailing four quarters  and going back to 2011 its average growth has been about 11  
Utilities have seen decent enough dividend growth  and a utility stock is still a better option than a bond in my view  But REITs have clearly beaten the pants off of utilities in terms of dividend growth  and I expect that to continue going forward 


Dividend Growth  Advantage REITs


Macro Conditions
This brings me to the final criterion  the overall macro environment  With the deregulation of recent decades  utilities are not quite as hamstrung as they used to be and often have more flexibility to pass on rising energy costs to consumers  But this remains a regulated industry  and that ability is by no means absolute  Utilities  uniquely among industrial sectors  are still subject to political whims 
And making it worse is the growing popularity of self sufficiency via solar energy  The falling cost of solar panels is an absolute disaster for the utilities industry  Not only does it remove would be paying customers  but it also forces the utilities to buy relatively expensive excess productions from households with solar panels  all while guaranteeing capacity during peak hours or during periodic shortages of solar energy  All in all  utilities are operating in a difficult environment that only promises to get more difficult 
REITs have none of these issues  and the macro environment actually looks good for REITs  Rising bond yields raise borrowing costs  but a growing economy should translate to higher property prices and higher rents 


Macro Conditions  Advantage REITs


In this dividend stock smackdown  REITs are the hand down winner  They beat utilities in terms of both current yield and dividend growth  and they face none of the complicated macro issues that utilities face

103003,324518,DUK,Why Bigger Is No Longer Better In Energy,opinion,"A product  technology or energy source that is both cost effective and bankable will scale  and this is the key to victory  The good news for photovoltaics is that nothing scales like silicon  except maybe enthusiasm on Wall Street  which is highly correlated to the amount of money being printed  and it seems  for now  that there are no limits to that process   However  Silicon Valley is not called Germanium Valley for a reason  though it could have been 
On February 6  1959  Jack Kilby  a Texas Instrument s engineer  filed U S  Patent 3 138 743 for  Miniaturized Electronic Circuits   It was the first integrated circuit  the steam engine of the information age  He made it with Germanium  Robert Noyce  later to become Intel s founder and mentor to Steve Jobs  followed soon after with another IC  U S  Patent 2 981 877   this one was based upon silicon  which is not only easier to work with  especially at high temperatures   but is highly abundant since the earth s surface is covered with it 


Source  Solarbuzz
The earth s silicon supply is virtually infinite  The price of PV made from Silicon is virtually free  needing little more than tracks or brackets  labor and wires to feed power to your home or the grid and miles to your car  it is  quite literally  dirt cheap  It is also the premier technology when it comes to scaling down as well as up  although oil production also scales down  Many tight oil wells produce only a few barrels a day  the other end of the production spectrum from Saudi Arabia s majestic Ghawar which produces 5 million barrels every day 

Not all PV modules are created equal  First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  makes them from so called thin films and the basic materials are Cadmium and Tellurium  The problem for First Solar  other than Cadmium s toxicity  is that all the Tellurium produced every year worldwide is not sufficient to produce enough cells to make thin film PV more than a niche product  Other thin film manufacturers use Indium which suffers from the same limitation  Silicon is by far the market share leader and should continue to hold  if not build upon  its advantage   It has the added virtue of being more efficient  requiring less land or roof space for the same output  
More good news from the PV front reaffirms that financing is not a problem  On July 14  Deutsche Bank  XETRA DBKGn  put out a report stating   YieldCo vehicles  are  publicly traded companies created for the purpose of owning operating assets that will predictably produce cash flow  This predictable cash flow primarily comes from long term contracts  Not all income investors are aware of this asset class  but according to  analyst Vishal  Shah   The YieldCo phenomenon is global  growth rates are likely to be much faster than MLPs and size of the market is likely to be much larger than the oil and gas sector   
On July 20   the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing    Sunedison Semiconductor Ltd  NASDAQ SEMI  announced plans to acquire Vivint Solar Inc  NYSE VSLR   America s second biggest residential PV installer  for  2 2 billion in cash  stock and convertible notes  The acquisition will give SunEdison       a 523 megawatt portfolio of rooftop solar projects        Those solar projects will be dropped into SunEdison s YieldCo  TerraForm Power  adding  81 million in unlevered cash flow for investors   according to Stephen Lacey  senior editor at Greentech Media 
 With a roughly  9 billion market cap  SunEdison is a fraction of the size of the biggest oil companies  But the company s YieldCo structure is allowing it to expand at a record setting pace  It now has 53 gigawatts of projects under development or completed    nearly equaling the generation fleet of Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   the biggest electric utility in the U S  
Peter Varadi  the author of Sun Above the Horizon  was a co founder of Solarex in 1973  by coincidence the year that the world came to the end of  free  oil  i e  the year of the Arab Oil Embargo  He extols the virtues of YieldCos in a  on EnergyPost eu  whose editor proclaimed  The solar revolution meets Wall Street 

Mr  Varadi explains   We envisioned a  Solar Breeder   The idea was that we would manufacture solar cells and modules which would be mounted on the roof of our production facility to produce electricity which would then be used to produce solar cells and modules         In  those days to power the entire production of a solar cell and module production facility would have been prohibitively expensive  The idea went dormant   Amoco  later to become part of BP  LONDON BP   bought Solarex in 1983  
 The new  Solar Breeder  idea is to utilize the income generated by selling PV systems to finance the production of more solar cells and modules to build the next PV systems  The new  Solar Breeder  concept is called  YieldCo   It is transforming the solar power sector        YieldCo is basically the adaptation of the REIT program to Renewable Energy  RE   by forming an independent power producing  IPP  corporation to operate primarily RE  water  wind and solar  assets  The company is publicly traded   yields  a predictable cash flow  and distributes its income to the shareholders  

There s an incredible energy development we ve been keeping track of for you over the past year    It s the reason Saudi Arabia is acting in desperation    depressing oil prices    and even risking internal unrest  Their  and OPEC s  very survival is being threatened 
 The basis of the success of the YieldCos is manifold 
  Because they are on the stock market  the possibility of relatively small investment by mutual funds and by private citizens opens the pocket book of millions   Liquidity  one can get money out when needed   Relatively stable cash flow  for example the electric yield of PV systems is predictable for at least 20 years  and is not affected by political or financial crises  which puts YieldCos  in terms of risk limitation  ahead of REITs or MLPs 
  In  2014 2015 all of the three major U S  PV manufacturers  SunEdison  First Solar and SunPower  which is owned by the French oil giant Total  established their first YieldCo  The announcement by Neo Solar Power Corporation  NSP  of Taiwan that it is planning to establish a YieldCo in 2015 indicates that the YieldCo idea has spread to the Asian PV manufacturers  It is now only a matter of time before the many Chinese  Korean and Indian PV manufacturers will see the light and establish YieldCos as well  The money to be raised for PV systems by this approach will dwarf Warren Buffett s U S   2 5 billion which his company invested in the Antelope Valley Solar Projects in California  

Mr  Varadi believes that PV will come to dominate the YieldCo space because  PV systems       can be established in most parts of the Earth where people live   The same cannot be said for windmills  dams  geothermal plants  or large scale solar thermal concentrators  Furthermore   the YieldCo has a contract with the technology  sponsor   originator  to be able to obtain assets that the  sponsor  is developing  This ensures a pipeline for future assets and a  right to first offer   ROFO  for the assets The idea behind this is that the YieldCo should have an assured path to new assets PV applications are ubiquitous and can be installed quickly  
What s not to like  Given these factors  it is logical to assume that solar energy  PV in particular  is destined to drive Wall Street s next big inning  where  animal spirits  never run dry for long 

PV will also be at the heart of distributed energy  i e  putting the generation  where people live  
Conventional power plants are large because fixed costs are high   economy of scale  ironically means that bigger is better  Distributed energy is generally small in scale since it is closer to  and sometimes right at  the point of use  The electric power grid  like the old mainframe computer model  is built on brute force 
The New Energy grid will be made up of many small islands  interconnected but able to isolate themselves in the case of outages  much the same way that the world s computer networks are now widely distributed  It would be foolish to bet against distributed energy  It is more secure  more reliable  more scalable  cheaper and less risky since there is no fuel to fuss with  nor foreign supply lines to be cut 
According to the  renewables accounted for more than 59 percent of all new electricity generating capacity installed worldwide during 2014   By year s end  renewables comprised an estimated 27 7percent of the world s power generating capacity  enough to supply an estimated 22 8percent of global electricity  ",2015-07-27,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bigger-is-no-longer-better-in-energy-259537,259537
103004,324519,DUK,Headlines Drive Market Direction,opinion,"Headlines continue to dominate the trading landscape  perpetuating a news driven trader s market rather than allowing a healthier valuation driven investor s market to return to favor  After all  that s what stock market investing is supposed to be about  Narrow market breadth and daily stock price gyrations have been driven primarily by three headline generators    oil price  the Fed s monetary policy  and China growth  Sure  there were many other important news items  notably the sinister course of Islamic terrorism  But it was those three main subjects that have been the persistent drivers of the daily buffeting of investor sentiment  and by extension stock prices 
In particular  the fact that the Federal Reserve can t seem to remove itself from the headlines has been a disappointment  In December  it tried to fade to the backdrop by clearing up some uncertainty about its intentions by making an initial rate hike and then laying out a convincing timeline  albeit data dependent  for a path toward normalization  But alas market speculation continues given the stark divergence between the Fed monetary policy and all other central banks  Nevertheless  it is likely that all three headline grabbers  oil  Fed  China  may resolve much of their uncertainty over the course of the year  thus enticing investors to return to a  flight to quality  strategy 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Friday was a tough day due to renewed speculation about future Federal Reserve rate hikes  after the BLS reported that the U S  economy added 151 000 jobs in January  This was below the expected 180 000 jobs  but wage inflation continued to growth  rising by 0 5   and the workforce participation rate ticked a bit higher  although it is still near a 40 year low   For the week  the U S  dollar fell hard against a basket of currencies and was down 1 9   Then the selloff in equities continued on Monday  with stocks falling hard on high volume before recovering about half their losses by the close  The S P 500 finished down 1 4  while a flight to safety pushed the 10 year yield down to 1 76     a 12 month low  Two year yields closed near 0 67  
Last month was the worst January for stocks since 2009  and the start of February has led to more of the same  as bulls are getting an extreme test of conviction  with critical technical support lines trying to hold  Financials in particular seem to be inordinately bearing the brunt of the fear driven selling  The sector was already displaying the lowest forward P E as investors evidently doubt the accuracy of consensus earnings estimates  but it continues to take direct hits  Certainly rising credit spreads in Energy sector and Emerging Market debt instruments are a concern  as is the flattening yield curve  which makes lending less lucrative  Although we all recall that the V bottom in March 2009 launched a 6 year bull market  most investors and commentators are not expecting the same thing this time around  Equity prices have been tied to headlines generated primarily by oil prices  the Fed  and China 
Oil price declined last week and has been struggling to hold the  30 level  which has been putting pressure on Energy and Financial sectors  As a result  oil analysts and market commentators have become progressively gloomier about the near term outlook for prices  with some price targets to the downside ranging as low as  7 to  20  and some are seeing no end in sight to the supply glut    with predictions of a calamitous fallout in oil exporting countries and in our own domestic oil patch  and by extension  the high yield debt market  
I worked in the oil industry for the first 18 years of my career  and I must admit that I was a believer in the  peak oil  theory in which global demand would soon outstrip an ever dwindling supply of recoverable reserves  thus driving the U S  to ultimately import 100  of its crude oil and force us into alternative energy sources  including nuclear  The theory suggested that shale oil and other tight formations wouldn t be economically viable until prices reached at least  200 bbl 
But that was then and this is now  and the ingenuity and persistence of capitalists and entrepreneurs has made North America essentially energy independent  contributing to today s worldwide supply glut  Nevertheless  these imbalances should begin to moderate this year as demand continues to grow while output declines from exhausted wells here at home  without further costly stimulation  like fracking  and oil exporting countries  non OPEC  reduce their capital budgets  This may lead oil to drift back into the  40 50 range sometime over the course of the year  Keep in mind  oil is a  Goldilocks  commodity that can t be either too hot or too cold without disturbing oil producers on the low side or consumers on the high side 
As for the Fed s path toward normalizing the fed funds rate  it is notable that the fed funds futures are currently pricing the probability of a March rate hike at 0   a June hike at 13   and December at only 26   with only a 3  chance that we will see two rate hikes this year  This is a big difference from the four rate hikes telegraphed by the Fed after their first rate hike in December  The market seems to be speaking loud and clear about such a plan  In any case  investors will listen for clues in FOMC Chairwoman Yellen s congressional testimony on Wednesday and Thursday this week 
China of course remains a big question mark    not just because of its big and growing impact on the global economy  especially emerging markets  but also because of its veil of opacity and secrecy that confounds trading and investing models and commentators  But China is highly motivated to keep its  miracle  alive and kicking and is unlikely to permit a recession to take hold  so all tools are in play including devaluation of the yuan that has been so expensive to shore up and keep pegged to the rising dollar 
Yet despite all of this noise and paralyzing headlines  U S  equities still look attractive  with historically reasonable forward valuations  S P 500 forward P E around 15x   especially given the expected persistence of low 10 year yields  And in any case  if you believe that we are not on the precipice of a recession or bear market but are simply waiting for the clouds of uncertainty to pass  then you will likely miss much of the upside before you realize that bulls finally got it together  It is quite difficult to time a market entry that avoids any portfolio drawdown 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed the week at 26 0  which is well above the 20 long term average  However  we are likely entering a period of elevated volatility that may have pushed the  panic threshold  up closer to 30  so the fact that VIX has not closed above 30 this year  it has only spiked above that level intraday a couple of times  may be an indication that the market is not on the verge of a crash but rather simply searching for a bottom 
Notably  despite the harsh market conditions  ETFGI reported that global exchange traded products  ETFs and ETPs  gathered net inflows of  13 1 billion in January 2016  and the global ETF ETP industry ended the month with 6 180 products totaling assets of  2 85 trillion from 277 providers on 64 exchanges  During January  43 new ETFs ETPs were launched by 17 different providers 
Sabrient s eighth annual Baker s Dozen top 13 picks for 2016 launched on January 15  It is based on our unbiased quantitative GARP  growth at reasonable price  model with a fundamental final review and selection process  i e   a  quantamental  approach   The new portfolio comprises stocks from various sectors but with the common thread that they produce finished goods and services that can be directly consumed by individuals    including airline  cruise line  auto maker  drug maker  discount retailer  cell phone service  banking  software  and gaming    rather than producing components  like semiconductors  or B2B services  like industrial supplies or equipment rentals  
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  N SPY  closed on Friday at 187 95  right near important support around 187 50  but then Monday s selloff took it down to 182 80 intraday before a late recovery helped it close at 185 42  Price formed a bullish hammer pattern that will likely lead SPY to close the gap from Friday s close  but we ll have to see if bulls can take it back up inside the sideways channel between 187 50 and 200  SPY remains below all of its key moving averages  including the 20 day  at 190   50 day  at 198   100 day  near 201   and 200 day  near 204  simple moving averages  All are knifing downward ominously  The long term low from October 2014 near 182 has been tested three times this year now  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have all turned back downward after a brief rally attempt  but they are essentially in a neutral position that could turn back up at any time  If investors can shake off their fears and turn this back into a quality driven rather than headline driven market  the 200 level will be a challenge  but the bearish gap down from 204 at the beginning of the year should act as a magnet  long time technicians have observed that gaps generally get filled about 80  of the time   Jeff Saut  chief investment strategist at Raymond James  has commented that the cluster of high volume selling followed by higher than average buying volume indicates to him that a major bottom is trying to form 

Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  N IYF   Technology  N IYW   Industrial  N IYJ   Healthcare  N IYH   Consumer Goods  N IYK   Consumer Services  N IYC   Energy  N IYE   Basic Materials  N IYM   Telecommunications  N IYZ   and Utilities  N IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Healthcare has regained the top spot with an Outlook score of 91  primarily due to the best  relatively speaking  Wall Street analyst sentiment  as all sectors are again being hit with net reductions to forward earnings estimates during this earnings reporting season  Healthcare displays solid factor scores across the board  Technology comes in second with an Outlook score of 80  and the sector also displays solid factor scores  including the highest forward long term growth rate  Financial takes the third spot this week with an Outlook score of 67 as the sector displays the lowest aggregate forward P E  12 7x   Rounding out the top six are Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   Utilities  and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  
2  Energy remains mired at the bottom with an Outlook score of 5 as the sector scores among the worst in all factors of the GARP model  including an increasingly negative forward long term growth rate  as oil prices hit lower lows  and the highest forward P E  23 7x   Basic Materials takes the other spot in the bottom two with an Outlook score of 30 as commodity prices in general continue to languish along with oil prices 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy tops the list with a robust 68  as investors do some bottom fishing on strong market days  while Healthcare is suddenly the lowest at 50  likely due to the congressional hearings on drug repricing practices  Even though all sectors display Bull scores of 50 or above  the top bottom spread is 18 points  which reflects relatively low sector correlations on strong market days  which is good for stock picking  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than broad risk on behavior  
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  as usual  displays the top score of 64  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Energy scores the lowest at 41  followed closely by Financial  as investors flee during market weakness  The top bottom spread is 23 points  which reflects low sector correlations on weak market days  which is good for stock picking  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  rather than broad risk off behavior   so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is by far the worst  However  looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is by far the best  perhaps due to a renewed investor appetite for dividends   indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  is the worst  followed closely by Tech and Financial 
6  This week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look mostly neutral  but signs of growing bullishness continue to reveal themselves  Healthcare at the top is somewhat all weather  so it s not a strong indicator either way of bullish or defensive sentiment   but economically sensitive Technology and Financial at two and three is bullish  while defensive sectors Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and Utilities in the top five is typically less bullish  The rankings seem to be indicating some fundamental reasons for optimism in our future  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing  momentum  or relative strength factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   continues to reflect a defensive bias and suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be defensive from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  sectors include Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU   Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF  PPH   and PowerShares DWA Consumer Staples Momentum Portfolio  PSL  
Other notable ETFs that are highly ranked in our quant model include US Global Jets ETF  JETS   which mostly comprises airlines and has been consistently top ranked  The forward P E among airlines is extraordinarily low for solid expected growth  Other top ranked ETFs include PowerShares Dynamic Leisure   Entertainment Portfolio  PEJ   and Market Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF  MORT   as well as the Guggenheim Invest Insider Sentiment ETF  NFO   which tracks a Sabrient index based on insider buying activity and sell side analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates 
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  sectors include American Duke Energy  N DUK   American Water Works  AWK   Intuitive Surgical  O ISRG   AbbVie Inc  N ABBV   Tyson Foods  N TSN   and WD 40 Company  WDFC   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 
If you prefer to take a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Financial  in that order  On the other hand  if you prefer a bullish stance on the market  the model suggests holding Energy  Technology  and Financial  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

103005,324520,DUK,DUK  A Safe High Yield Dividend Stock For Retirement,opinion,"Duke Energy  NYSE DUK  is a favorite high yield dividend stock for income investors  and it s no wonder why  The company has paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends for 90 years and is set to increase its dividend for the ninth consecutive year in 2016 
Regulated utility companies such as Duke can provide safe retirement income with less risk than other types of businesses because of their predictable earnings  government supported competitive advantages  and relatively low stock price volatility 
For these reasons and more  we own several utility stocks in our Conservative Retirees and Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolios  However  just because a stock appears to have little fundamental risk does not mean it is a safe investment  The price paid for a stock is still very important  and that is especially true for low growth utility stocks 
While utility companies can be relatively attractive income investments compared to bonds due to their potential for capital appreciation and moderate income growth  it s still important to diversify a portfolio s income streams in other sectors  Unexpected shocks can still happen across entire sectors  and no one living off dividends desires to deal with unpleasant  avoidable surprises when it comes to their nest egg 
Let s take a closer look at Duke Energy s business to see if it s a stock we should consider for our utilities exposure Business OverviewDuke Energy s history dates back to the early 1900s  and the company is largest electric utility in the country today with over  23 billion in annual revenue and operations reaching across the Southeast and Midwest regions  Duke Energy is a regulated utility company that serves approximately 7 4 million electric customers and 1 5 million gas customers  including customers from its planned  4 9 billion acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas  more on this later  
Regulated utilities account for about 90  of Duke Energy s business mix  but the company also has a commercial portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure  5   and an international energy business in Central and South America  5    which it recently put up for sale 
The company s regulated utilities primarily rely on coal  29    nuclear  27    and natural gas  23   for its generation of electricity  Hydro and solar generate another 1  of the company s total energy  and Duke Energy also purchases about 20  of its power 
Source  Duke Energy Investor PresentationBusiness AnalysisRegulated utility companies are essentially monopolies in the regions they operate in  With the exception of Ohio  all of Duke s electric utilities operate as sole suppliers within their service territories 
Building and operating the power plants  transmission lines  and distribution networks to supply customers with power costs billions of dollars  and it would generally be unprofitable and inefficient to have more than one supplier for a region  State utility commissions also have varying degrees of power over the construction of generating facilities  which further restricts competition 
The downside to the  monopoly  enjoyed by regulated utilities is that their services are priced by state commissions  This is done to keep prices fair for consumers and allow utility companies to earn a reasonable  but not excessive  return on their investments to encourage them to provide safe and reliable service 
A utility company s attractiveness is largely driven by the states it operates in  Some have more favorable demographics  e g  population growth  and regulatory bodies  Duke Energy s mix is generally favorable  Over the past three years  base rate cases approved to Duke Energy have granted the company a return on equity ranging from 9 8  to 10 5  across the Carolinas  Ohio  and Florida 
We think these returns are very reasonable and suggest a generally favorable set of regulatory bodies in Duke s core operating states 
In addition to the industry s promotion of stability  Duke s business has undergone a rather significant transformation over the last five years to improve the reliability of its earnings and cash flows 
Duke Energy s biggest move was its acquisition of Progress Energy in mid 2012 for over  13 billion  significantly enhancing the company s scale and market share in regions such as the Carolinas  Duke Energy has realized over  500 million in cost synergies from the deal and become a more efficient energy provider 
The company next entered the regulated pipeline business in 2014 to help its efforts to replace coal power plants with cleaner and cheaper natural gas generation facilities  In October 2015  Duke Energy announced a deal to acquire Piedmont Natural Gas  NYSE PNY  for  4 9 billion to boost its push into gas 
Piedmont is a regulated gas distribution company that delivers natural gas to customers in the Carolinas and Tennessee  The company owns valuable gas infrastructure that currently supports Duke s gas fired generation in the Carolinas and will be further expanded to help with Duke s ongoing conversion from coal to gas 
Regulated gas companies also offer strong and predictable returns on capital  Piedmont s return on equity is about 10   and should continue to benefit as a result of the natural gas surplus in the U S 
Compared to electricity sales  which seem likely to slow as energy usage becomes increasingly efficient  gas has a stronger growth profile  Piedmont has investment pipeline growth of 9    This is because new pipelines coming on line will allow gas to replace dirtier power sources such as coal in regions where gas was previously inaccessible 
Piedmont will about triple Duke s number of natural gas customers to approximately 1 5 million and help establish a platform for future growth in gas infrastructure projects  After the deal closes  Duke Energy expects roughly 90  of its assets to earn regulated returns  which should provide very reliable earnings 
Duke Energy has also gotten rid of non strategic assets to lower its risk profile and improve the quality of its earnings  Management sold the company s merchant Midwest commercial generation business to Dynergy for  2 9 billion in early 2015 and placed its struggling Latin American generation business up for sale in February 2016  Each of these businesses had less predictable earnings and greater macro risk 
Duke Energy believes its current business mix is now 100  focused on its core operations  whereas 25  of the company s 2011 net income was derived from non core businesses  Management now expects to spend  8 billion on new generation investments   10 billion on gas   electric infrastructure  and  2 billion on commercial and regulated renewables to drive 4 6  annualized earnings growth over the next five years 
Overall  we believe Duke Energy has a strong moat  The company has excellent scale as the largest electric utility in the country and operates primarily in regions with generally favorable demographic trends and regulatory frameworks 
Management has simplified Duke s mix to focus on core regulated businesses that provide reliable earnings and new growth opportunities in natural gas and renewable generation resources  While the utility sector is gradually evolving  we believe Duke Energy is here to stay for a long time to come Duke Energy s Key RisksUncontrollable macro factors such as mild temperatures and industrial activity can impact Duke Energy s near term financial results  However  we believe these are transitory issues that have little bearing on the company s long term earnings potential 
The bigger risks worth monitoring are changes in state regulations  population growth trends in key states  increased environmental regulations  and execution of the company s business strategy  e g  large projects and acquisitions  
The rates Duke Energy can charge its customers are decided at the state level  Similar to what we observed when we analyzed Southern Company  NYSE SO   another regulated utility  most of the regions Duke Energy operates in have generally favorable regulatory environments and are characterized by positive population and economic growth 
However  the company is banking on these conditions remaining stable as it continues investing for growth and depending on states to approve rate increases to earn a fair return on its capital intensive investments 
The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  also creates risk for utility companies in the form of enhanced safety and emissions standards  Duke is still dealing with its notorious coal ash spill that took place in North Carolina in 2014  and the company is gradually shifting its mix of power away from coal in favor of cleaner sources such as natural gas 
Finally  over the very long term  electric utility companies will need to deal with the reality that demand is gradually decaying thanks to increasing energy efficiency and distributed generation  e g  rooftop solar  
Duke has earmarked about  2 billion for growth investments on commercial and regulated renewables over the next five years  but it s still a relatively small proportion of the overall business  The company s acquisition of Piedmont should also help the company with growth initiatives outside of regulated electric utility services Dividend Analysis  Duke EnergyWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Duke Energy s Dividend Safety Score of 80 indicates that the company has a very safe dividend payment  Duke s dividend has consumed 81  of its diluted earnings per share over the last 12 months  A payout ratio this high is usually cause for some concern because it provides less wiggle room in the event of an unexpected drop in profit 
However  regulated utility companies are able to safely maintain higher payout ratios because their earnings are  generally  extremely steady  making utilities one of the best stock sectors for dividend income 
Using management s  adjusted  earnings  Duke Energy s payout ratio is closer to the company s target range of 65 70   As seen below  Duke s payout ratio has been above 60  each of its last 10 fiscal years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  utility companies hold up relatively well during economic recessions  As seen below  Duke Energy s revenue edged down by just 4  in 2009  While customers use somewhat less electricity during periods of weak growth  they still need it to live  DUK s stock also fared well in 2008 and outperformed the S P 500 by 15  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we mentioned earlier  regulated utility companies earn very stable earnings  As a state regulated monopoly company selling non discretionary services  it s no surprise to see Duke Energy s consistent results below Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Duke Energy s earnings are steady  but regulators control the rates the company can charge customers to ensure pricing is fair  As a result  the returns Duke can earn on its capital projects are capped  and the company s return on invested capital has remained in the low  to mid single digits over the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The capital intensive nature of utility companies makes them heavily dependent on debt to run and grow their businesses  As seen below  Duke has less than  1 billion in cash on its balance sheet compared to nearly  40 billion of debt 
However  the company s excellent business stability has enabled Duke Energy to maintain an A  credit rating with Standard   Poor s  While the company s free cash flow will remain restricted the next few years to fund its major growth investments  forcing it to lean even more on debt markets  we still view Duke as a healthy business as well Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  the stability of Duke Energy s earnings and non discretionary nature of its services significantly boost the safety of its dividend payment despite its levered balance sheet and relatively high payout ratio Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
While regulations generally protect utility company s earnings and market share  they also limit growth opportunities  As a result  most utility businesses have below average dividend growth rates  and Duke Energy is no exception 
The company s Dividend Growth Score is 20  which suggests that its dividend growth potential is lower than 80  of all other dividend paying stocks in the market  However  its dividend has been reliable  Duke Energy has made quarterly dividend payments since the 1920s and will raise its dividend for its ninth consecutive year in 2016  keeping it a far distance from joining the dividend aristocrats list but rewarding shareholders nicely 
For most of the last 10 years  Duke Energy grew its dividend by an annualized rate of about 2   However  management expects to double the dividend s growth rate to 4  per year to better reflect an improvement in Duke s lower risk business mix and core earnings growth rate of 4 6  per year 
Source  Duke Energy Investor Presentation
Higher dividend growth will cause Duke Energy s earnings payout ratio to increase from its 65 70  target to closer to 75  in the near term as its growth investments continue  but the payout ratio is expected to turn down over time ValuationDUK s stock trades at 16 8x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 4 2   which is slightly below its five year average dividend yield of 4 4  
Since 2009  the company has met its long term annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth objective of 4 6   Assuming Duke Energy s growth projects continue helping its core businesses realize 5  annual earnings growth over the coming years  the stock s total return potential appears to be about 9  per year 
Considering the stability of Duke Energy s earnings  which are largely composed of regulated utility operations  we think the stock is reasonably valued today but not a bargain ConclusionFor investors seeking exposure to utility stocks and safe dividend income  Duke Energy appears to be a reasonably priced blue chip dividend stock to consider  Almost all of the company s business mix consists of regulated operations  which provide predictable earnings with low volatility  Most of the regions Duke Energy plays in are also characterized by favorable demographics and historically supportive regulatory bodies 
While there is some long term risk resulting from lower electricity usage trends  the rise of clean renewables  and the company s major growth investments  we think Duke Energy will remain an appealing income investment for many years to come ",2016-03-15,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duk:-a-safe-high-yield-dividend-stock-for-retirement-200121688,200121688

103052,324567,DUK,Why Progressives Should Love A Carbon Tax  Why Not All Of Them Do,opinion,Progressives should love a carbon tax  Most progressives love the environment and believe that carbon emissions cause environmental harm  Unlike conservatives  whose attitudes toward carbon taxes were the subject of my last post  progressives have no generalized aversion to taxes  Carbon taxes should be a natural for progressives  then  if they can accept the power of economic incentives to slow the destruction of the planet  To be sure  many progressives do express strong support for carbon taxes  Here are just three of many examples The Center for American Progress has put out a position paper titled It argues that climate change  economic growth  and fiscal responsibility are intimately linked  and that a price on carbon should be part of a policy to deal with each of these issues Gernot Wagner  an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund  argues that it makes eminent sense to tax what you want less of in his excellent book  But Will the Planet Notice  How Smart Economics Can Save the World In Green Illusions  The Limits of Alternative Energy Ozzie Zehner argues against the wishful thinking that solar  wind  or other technological fixes will bring a future of cheap  clean  and abundant energy  Insisting that a strong push for energy conservation has to be part of the mix  he advocates carbon taxes to counteract what he calls  the boomerang effect  the tendency for subsidies for clean energy to make energy in general cheaper  therefore discouraging conservation Yet  not all progressives are convinced  Many are skeptical on principle of our capitalist economic system and instinctively distrust market based environmental policy  Others fear that a carbon tax would disproportionately harm the poor  Still others have ethical objections to the whole idea of bribing people to do things they ought to choose voluntarily  out of love and respect for the planet  Let s look at each of these objections in turn  Doubt that people really respond to market incentives One reason that some progressives are skeptical of a carbon tax is a simple doubt that people really respond to prices  If you want to get people to stop doing something  they think  you need a government regulation that commands them not to do it in no uncertain terms  For example  here is how Earthjustice President Trip Van Noppen puts it in  published on the organization s website  The problem with a carbon tax  as a nice and tidy solution for climate change  is that some things we tax we still use  We ve got really  really high cigarette taxes  and people still smoke  It doesn t necessarily guarantee the reductions that you d need to have to prevent climate change  So in other words  we wouldn t know whether the tax would be at a sufficient level to change behavior at the pace we d need to change behavior       we don t really know how much the market would respond  The economic term for the responsiveness of demand to a change in price is elasticity  A large negative value for elasticity of demand means that people make a large reduction in the quantity they buy when the price rises  For example  an elasticity of  0 8 would mean that a 10 percent rise in the price of a product would lead to an 8 percent decrease in the quantity purchased  So what is the price elasticity of demand for carbon based energy  The fuel for which economists have most extensively studied elasticity is gasoline  One widely cited source is a   She concluded that the best estimate for the price elasticity of gasoline demand was  0 26 in the short run and  0 58 in the long run   by Todd Litman of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute provides a comprehensive review of the literature since Espey s paper  Litman finds long run fuel price elasticities in the range of  0 4 to  0 8  Those numbers suggest that a tax that added  1 per gallon to the cost of gasoline still leaving it well below European levels would cut use by 10 to 20 percent   For a more detailed discussion of the evidence on elasticity  see    If elasticity numbers are too abstract  here is a chart from the Litman study  which shows a convincingly tight relationship between fuel prices and fuel use across OECD countries  Can it really be just coincidence that the United States  with the lowest fuel prices  also has the highest fuel consumption   Prices are having an effect on fuel choice in other industries  as well  One of the strongest trends is increased replacement of coal by natural gas in the generation of electricity  Duke Energy is one of several big utilities that are rapidly moving from coal to natural gas  in large part because of lower gas prices  According to a report in  Duke Energy s chief executive  Jim Rogers  is calling for the government to put a price on carbon with either a tax or a cap and trade system  According to Rogers  who should know  doing so would accelerate a trend away from coal  not only toward gas but also toward solar and wind power  In short  the preponderance of evidence is that prices work  both to promote energy conservation in general and to motivate the choice of cleaner over dirtier sources of energy  A carbon tax would hurt the poor Critics of a carbon tax frequently object that any policy that raises the cost of energy would disproportionately hurt the poor  They base the claim on data that indicate that lower income families spend a higher percentage of their budget on transportation  home heating  and electric utilities than do the more affluent  However  even if we accept the truth of that claim  it does not constitute a valid objection to a carbon tax  The main reason is that policies to keep energy prices low are a poorly targeted way to help the poor  Just do the math  Start with  indicating that families in the bottom half of the income distribution spend an average of about 20 percent of their budgets on energy  compared with less than 10 percent for those in the top half  Combine that with the fact that households in the lower half of the income distribution receive only about 20 percent of all income  Comparing 10 percent of 80 percent to 20 percent of 20 percent makes it clear that lower income families  despite their greater relative expenditures  consume only about a third of all energy  The much smaller number of households that fall below the federal poverty line probably consume only about 15 percent of all energy  That would mean that for every dollar by which national consumer energy costs decrease  the poor gain only 15 cents  There are many proposals for combining a carbon tax with targeted mechanisms for offsetting its impact on the poor  One way to do so would be to refund part of the tax directly to low income households  either through a special rebate or by expanding some existing program like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  As long as the rebate came in a lump sum  rather than in proportion to energy use  it would offset the distributional effect of the tax without reducing its incentive to conserve  Another approach one that is consistent with revenue neutrality would be to use some of the money from a carbon tax to lower the marginal rate of the payroll tax  Because the payroll tax is inherently regressive  reducing it would disproportionately help lower income households  With either of these approaches  just a fraction of the revenue from a carbon tax would be enough to compensate low income households  The rest would be available for other purposes reducing the deficit  lowering the rates on other tax rates  or expanding other federal programs  There is also another way to think about the effect of a carbon tax on the poor  Keep in mind that the reason for such a tax in the first place is the belief that carbon dioxide emissions are harmful to the environment  If so  it is just as true for the CO2 emitted by the poor as by the rich  We do not  as a rule  exempt poor people from restrictions on socially harmful behavior  We do not suspend rules against littering in public parks on the basis of income  We do not allow poor people to shoplift their food from supermarkets  we give them food stamps  instead  By the same token  it is reasonable to require poor people to behave responsibly toward the environment  If we are concerned that a carbon tax pinches the budgets of poor households  we should provide relief through other channels  not give them a pass on the need to conserve energy and reduce pollution  We should protect the planet because we love it A third objection voiced by some progressives is that we should protect the planet because we love it  not for purely economic motives  Ethical objections to economic incentives are not limited to carbon taxes  they apply to all efforts to put a price on pollution  whether through taxes  marketable pollution permits  carbon offsets  or other mechanisms  Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel  author of   has expressed this view with particular force  All policies that rely on economic incentives  he says  pose the danger that those who pay a pollution tax  buy a carbon offset  or trade pollution permits are likely to consider themselves absolved of any further responsibility for climate change  Such incentives become  a painless mechanism to buy our way out of the more fundamental changes in habits  attitudes  and ways of life that may be required to address the climate problem   He applies his moral reasoning not just to individuals  but also to nations  Suppose that some wealthy county imposes a carbon tax or cap and trade mechanism   Letting rich countries buy their way out of meaningful changes in their own wasteful behavior   he says   reinforces a bad attitude that nature is a dumping ground for those who can afford it   Whatever the efficiency of market based mechanisms for combatting pollution  they  make it harder to cultivate the habits of self restraint and shared sacrifice that a responsible environmental ethic requires   The best response to this ethical argument  in my view  is one made by Gernot Wagner in his book But Will the Planet Notice  cited at the beginning of this post  Here is what he writes in response to Sandel  By all means  make the moral case  Teach it in philosophy classes and preach it from the pulpits  but let s not wait for it to have an impact while the planet burns  By all means  declutter your life      Downsize your apartment  Carry around a canvas bag  Bike      But everyone else won t catch up to your good deeds voluntarily not in time  and not with sufficiently strong action  That s where economics enters the room There s simply no way to go about tackling this problem other than taking seriously the incentives all of us face  Getting several billion of us to behave differently to behave morally means guiding market forces in the right direction  making it in our interest to do the right thing  It s the only way to make the planet notice  The bottom line The good news is that  despite initial skepticism  progressives are increasingly supportive of carbon taxes and other market based environmental policies  Ironically  it is now conservatives who are more likely to reject them  That is not to say that progressives have come around all the way  One sign of the sometimes half hearted acceptance of market based policies is an insistence on a belt and suspenders approach  Carbon taxes  marketable permits  or carbon offsets are acceptable as a supplement to existing command and control regulations  but not as a replacement for them  For example  a position statement from the  reads as follows  The Sierra Club advocates the establishment of pollution taxes which would make it less expensive for a polluter to adopt alternative processes or invest in additional equipment to curtail releases to the environment than it would be for him to continue as before  Such taxes would supplement  and not replace  standards on maximum permissible emissions  That attitude poses a significant barrier to the kind of coalition building that will be necessary if progressive and conservative advocates of carbon taxes are ever to agree on mutually acceptable legislation  Conservative advocates of market based environmental policy like it  in large part  because it would replace the mish mash of grossly inefficient taxes and regulations that they see as shackles to business  To many of them  adding a carbon tax on top of CAFE standards  clean energy mandates  ethanol subsidies  and the rest would make matters worse not only worse for the business environment  but worse for the physical environment  In a rational world  there would be room for a win win compromise  Conservatives could make concessions to progressives on the need to protect the poor  for example  by using part of the revenue from carbon taxes to lower payroll taxes  Progressives  in turn  could offer conservatives some relief from the red tape of overlapping mandates  subsidies  and performance standards  In exchange they would get market based policies that have lower compliance costs  but are equally or more effective in cutting pollution  Whether such a rational compromise is possible in today s politically

103053,324568,DUK,2014 s Top Performing Utility Dividend Stocks,opinion,"The market has had a bumpy ride so far in 2014  with February turning in the best performance  rising over 4   after January s  3 6  pullback  Cap this off with a less than 1  gain for the S P 500 in March  and you ve got an unimpressive 1 3  gain for the first quarter 
With this kind of up and down ride  you d want to find some dividend stocks which offer defense  in addition to income  With the pullback in many biotech stocks  the Healthcare sector no longer leads  although it s still up nearly 5    but has given way to the Utilities sector  which is up over 10  year to date 
Here s a look at the chart for the Utilities ETF  SPDR Select Sector   Utilities  XLU   We looked further into XLU s top holdings  and came up with these top 5 utility stocks  all of which are large cap dividend paying stocks  Another common feature is that they all have somewhat lower forward P E s  meaning that their earnings should improve in their next fiscal year  Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK  and Southern Company  NYSE SO  have the lowest P E s  relative to their 5 year P E ranges  This is how they ve performed year to date  and over the past month  and over the past 52 weeks  Nuclear based Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC  has outperformed the pack year to date and over the past month  but is still up only 3 62  over the past year  Contrasting with that performance is more steady NextEra Energy Inc   NYSE NEE   which has made over half of its 1 year 25 90  gains  by rising 13 61  in 2014  Dividends  With their 4  plus dividend yields  Southern CO  and DUK  are both listed in the Utilities section of our High Dividend Stocks By Sector Tables  Although their yields are lower  Dominion Resources Inc   NYSE D  and NextEra Energy Inc   NYSE NEE  have the best 5 year dividend growth rates  Options  If you want to add more downside protection to these stocks  selling covered calls offers you more immediate income  and a lower breakeven  NEE has the most attractive call options of the group  This June  97 50 call pays  2 60  over 3 times NEE s next quarterly dividend   Our free Covered Calls Table has more info on this and over 30 other trades   Here are the major income scenarios for this trade  The  97 50 strike price is  1 07 above NEE s price share  which amply rewards you if your shares get assigned prior to the ex dividend date for the   73 dividend  Selling cash secured put options is another way to profit from these defensive stocks  In fact  if you sell puts below the stock s share price  you ll get an even lower breakeven  and improve upon their defensive nature  This is another June trade  but this put has a  95 00 strike price  and a  92 05 breakeven  which is 4 5  below NEE s price share  You won t receive any dividends  but  just like selling calls  you ll be paid your option premium within 3 days of the trade  often sooner  You can find more info about this and over 30 other trades in our Cash Secured Puts Table  Financials  It s a mixed bag  Dominion and NextEra have an edge over the rest of the group for some of these metrics  but they do carry more debt Valuations  Excelon has the lowest valuations for these metrics Disclosure  Author was long shares of Southern  SO  at the time of this writing

103054,324569,DUK,Financial   Banking Sector Breaking Down,opinion,"I remember in early 2007 when the PitBull told me there was  rotten wood  floating around in the stock market leaders  the banks and brokerage stocks  I will never forget those words nor will I ever forget what unfolded over the next few years  While we all know the S P 500  CME  SPM14  is up 180  from its March 2009 low and up 30  last year we also know very few people are cheering 
Sustainability
One of the things that the big banks and brokerage companies are dealing with has been playing out in front of our eye for years  Sure  part of the  slowdown  came as the credit crisis played out and millions of people lost jobs in the US  Eventually  the economic party on Wall Street and the lack of regulation was going to catch up with the industry 

Over the last few year I have pointed out how there were over 500 clearing firms between the CME and the CBOT and that today there are only 40 clearing firms of which only 10 can do a small account  On a much smaller scale the exodus in the futures markets is just like what we see going on on Wall Street  an unsustainable power shift away from a broad range of investors and towards a few big  possibly too big to fail players  As the big banks and brokerage companies continue to seek new ways to make money they find themselves unable to keep up  With fewer people trading the commission base is disappearing  New regulation has shut down most of the in house trading desks and the giant drop in the overall customer base is making the big commissions base the banks used to enjoy only a fraction of what it was in 2007 
As we edit this article  HSBC  NYSE HSBC   Europe s biggest bank  reports that its 1st quarter profits dropped by 20  from a year ago and that last year s profits came largely from sales of assets and the layoff of 40 000 employees 

While the shrinkdown continues few in the industry are saying much about it publicly  every much like what is going on with the futures and options based trading accounts that many Chicago firms depend on to survive 
Conclusion  a great shrinking
One of the major effects of the 2007 Credit Crisis has been the overall shrinking of the trading business  It really doesn t matter if the markets go up or down  with the volumes as low as they are many of the big banks and brokerage firms that made up our industry are either closed due to new regulations or just not trading  We see it on the floor of the CME Group every day where the once mighty S P 500 futures have gone from a record 6 69 million contracts traded in one day to barely being above to do 1 5 million contracts a day  It s going to be impossible for Wall Street to replace what it has lost over the last several years or for the S P to get back to where it was in 2007  The Asian markets closed mostly lower and in Europe 6 out of 11 markets are modestly lower  Today s economic schedule starts MBA Purchase Applications  Gallup U S  Job Creation Index  Productivity and Cost  Janet Yellen speaks  EIA Petroleum Status Report  10 Yr Note Auction   Consumer Credit and earnings from Prudential Financial NYSE PRU   Twenty First Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA   Anheuser Busch Inbev NYSE BUD  and Duke Energy  NYSE DUK   Alibaba will officially file for an IPO  which may affect shares of Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO   a major shareholder

103055,324570,DUK,Alt Energy Shines On Emerging Market Demand,opinion,"Alternative energy is now an important component in the power generation mix in many developed and developing nations  Although some better established sources of alternative energy  like hydro  wind  biomass and waste  not to mention solar photovoltaics  PV   are supported extensively  niche renewable energy sources such as geothermal and concentrated solar power  CSP  are also on the rise  natural conditions permitting  Specifically  2013 was an excellent year for the U S  solar market  Other upcoming alternative sources include the prospect of harnessing sea power  Numerous new ocean power technologies are on the verge of commercial development  Although this form of renewable energy is one of the most notable  it involves technologies with high research and development and startup costs  This has inhibited its all out adoption so far 
Solar
A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  With the increasing need for developing renewable energy in response to stringent environmental regulations  countries worldwide are relying on solar energy for electricity generation  The solar industry rallied in 2013 following a tough spell since 2011  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that U S solar demand increased more than 32  in 2013  For 2014  the EIA projects that U S  solar energy consumption will boom by roughly 35   The expected increase in demand is likely to fuel top line growth at the solar manufacturers  President Obama s new environmental plan  unveiled in Jun 2013  putting further limits on existing coal fired plants  gave a shot in the arm to the U S  solar sector  The results were well reflected in the 2013 performance  The president issued directives asking environmental regulators to set up carbon pollution standards for active plants  Coal generates about 40  of U S  electricity and coal plants are the largest source of carbon emissions in the country  As a result  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency is issuing directives to lower carbon emission from newer coal based power plants while strengthening the existing policies on green house gas emissions  This development has emerged as a major headwind for coal fired utility stocks and has proved to be beneficial for renewable energy stocks like First Solar Inc   NASDAQ FSLR   That said  the U S  still has a lot of catching up to do  despite enormous potential  to get anywhere close to the global leaders  And the country is working towards that goal  Per the Solar Energy Industries Association  SEIA   the U S  trade association of approximately 1 000 companies in the solar energy industry  the U S  solar energy industry grew 41  year over year to reach 4 751 megawatt  MW  in 2013  the largest year on record  In 2013  29  of all new electricity generation came from solar energy  up from a trivial 10  in 2012  This made solar the second largest source of new electricity generating capacity after natural gas  2013 was one of the most happening years in the renewable space driven by a robust level of residential installations and a strong year in the utility segment with 2 847 MW of PV and 410 MW of CSP installed in 2013 
Looking at the cost side  the average cost of a completed PV system dropped by 15  during the fourth quarter 2013 on a year over year basis  Again  the average price of a solar panel has dropped by 60  since the beginning of 2011  These price drops will encourage more solar uptake by consumers  After over 40 years of government investment in renewable energy  the U S  alone spent  154 7 billion from 1973 to the end of 2013   it appears that solar energy is finally getting a strong foothold in the worldwide energy segment  Indeed the PV market is gradually becoming global  According to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association  EPIA   a worldwide industry association for the solar photovoltaic electricity market  the cumulative global installed PV capacity stood at almost 136 7 gigawatt  GW  at the end of 2013  up 35  from the prior year  Europe is gradually losing its leading position in the PV market with Asia taking the lead  As per media reports  China installed a record 12 GW of solar panels in 2013  making it the world s largest solar market in 2013  overtaking longtime leader Germany  Last September  China s Ministry of Finance announced that local solar manufacturers will receive immediate refunds of 50  of the value added tax  VAT  for sales taking place from Oct 2013 through Dec 2015  The Chinese government has set a solar installation target of 35 GW by 2015  While the U S  and China have been playing a big role in recent years in driving the industry  other nations are also pushing hard to have a home grown solar generation capacity as a remedial measure to solve their electricity crisis  The latest to join this list is Asia s third largest economy  India  The country recently planned for a  4 4 billion solar plant which could perhaps be the world s largest  Again  in Japan  companies like First Solar are investing substantially to install emission free renewable set ups  The country is expected to become the second largest market for solar products after China  First Solar    the largest U S  solar company    is thus teaming up with Japanese counterparts to develop  build and operate solar power plants 
Wind
The American Wind Energy Association  AWEA  reported that the wind industry grew radically during the first quarter 2014  The U S  industry installed 214 MW during the first quarter  up significantly from the year ago installed capacity of 1 6 MW  The reported figure was also more than what the industry installed in the first three quarters of 2013  This brought the total installed capacity to 61 327 MW  There were more than 8 000 MW of long term power purchase agreements announced in 2013  EIA expects wind capacity to expand 9 0  in 2014 and 15 5  at the end of 2015  Electricity generation from wind is expected to contribute 4 5  to the total electricity generation basket by the end of 2015 
Hydro
Hydropower is considered the leading renewable energy source in the U S  With the emergence of new technologies  like marine and hydrokinetics  this industry is likely to continue to generate vast amounts of sustainable energy throughout the country 
Hydropower is the cheapest source of electricity as it has the lowest cost per kilowatt hour compared to all other sources and is independent of the volatile movement in fuel costs  EIA projects that both hydropower and non hydropower renewables used for electricity and heat generation will grow by approximately 3 3  in 2014  In 2015  growth in renewables consumption for electric power and heat generation is projected to continue at a rate of 3 2   as a 0 3  decrease in hydropower is combined with a 5 1  increase in non hydropower renewables  On Aug 9  2013  President Obama signed into law two bills aimed at boosting the development of the nation s largest renewable electricity resource  hydropower  Enactment of laws is a prudent step to uphold hydropower development

Earnings Trends
As far as overall results of the alternative energy industry are concerned  first quarter 2014 was good on the whole  Most of the solar companies came up with first quarter earnings beats  High oil prices also aided solar stocks to reach new highs  Moreover  strong macroeconomic factors have helped this sector to rise above others in the energy space  For 2014  we expect the solar companies to witness an impressive year with most returning to profit  building on last year s strength 
Opportunities
Environmental advantage  Solar power is the most benign electricity resource  Solar cells generate electricity without air or water emissions  noise  vibration  habitat impact or waste generation  Over time  rapid population growth  depletion of non renewable conventional sources and escalating pollution levels will help shape a much more pronounced global focus on renewable projects Fuel risk advantage  Unlike fossil and nuclear fuels  alternative energy has no risk of fuel price volatility or delivery risk  Although there is variability in the amount and timing of sunlight in the day  season and year  a properly sized and configured system can be designed to ensure high reliability while providing a long term  fixed price electricity supply SunPower Corporation  NASDAQ SPWR  is one of the most forward integrated solar companies  focused on moving up the value chain  The company once again registered encouraging first quarter 2014 results  backed by brisk demand for its solar panels in utility  commercial and residential projects  It has also raised its outlook given the strength across regions and end markets JinkoSolar Holding Company Limited  NYSE JKS  also seems to be in a strong position with multiple contracts and agreements  The company signed an agreement with PROINSO India for distributing its solar PV modules across India  This agreement comes after the announcement of JinkoSolar signing a  39 million loan agreement with China Development Bank  The deal was to finance two PV solar projects in Xinjiang and Gansu Provinces in China Location advantage  Solar power is generally located at a customer s site due to the universal availability of sunlight  As a result  solar power limits the expense and losses associated with transmission and distribution from large scale electric plants to the end users  For most residential consumers seeking an environment friendly power alternative  solar power is currently the only viable choice  Among the renewable energy pack  we would advise investors to look for companies like rooftop solar energy systems provider SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY  with an innovative game plan  The downstream solar company plays on its strength providing renewable power lower than the grid price to residential and commercial markets in the U S 
The company is now set to grasp the largely untapped abundant solar power resources in one of the sunniest U S  states  Nevada  This pioneer in residential solar is making a big expansion in Las Vegas  In Apr 2014  San Jose  CA based solar manufacturer SunPower and Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL  have teamed up to form a  250 million fund to help homeowners across the U S  to install solar panels at home  This pact is essentially aimed at financing residential solar system installations that SunPower will then lease out to homeowners  Residential solar in the U S  is now a sizzling story  This market even outpaced the commercial and utility segments last year and has already started to attract more conventional electric power companies that produce power mostly from coal and natural gas Japan looks bright  We note that Japan has recently been a happy hunting ground for solar companies in search for new markets  The country is going to be a key energy market and the government has set a target to install 28 GW of solar energy power by 2020  With around 6 9 GW  Japan was the second biggest global market in 2013  Japan s need for electricity is on the rise  particularly after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident triggered a complete phase out of all nuclear reactors in the country  Presently  the Japanese government is looking for alternate resources to meet the growing need for power in this very industrialized nation  Recently  Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ  received a contract to supply 43 MW of PV modules for Japan s second largest solar project Environmental legislation  Alternative energy companies are increasingly benefiting from new legislation in the U S  stipulating installation of renewable sources of electricity generation as mandated by Renewable Energy Standards  RES   As of now there are 29 states  the District of Columbia in the U S  and 2 territories that have RES legislation in place  Another 8 states and 2 territories also have goals for adoption of renewable energy sources  At the federal level  investment tax credit  ITC  is currently at 30   which is set to expire in 2015  and then go to 10  in 2016  The industry will likely see many companies taking advantage of the 30  ITC  and build more panels  storage capacity  and other production items up to the end of 2015  Once the ITC drops to 10   these companies can also utilize a higher rate of depreciation to protect their profits   So the cut in ITC for 2016 will not likely dent these companies  profitability  Also  under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act  ARRA   the U S  Treasury Department had earlier implemented a program to issue cash grants in lieu of ITC for renewable energy projects  The wind sector also benefited significantly from the production tax credit  PTC  over the last few years  It was started in 1992 as a part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992  Subsequent to that it received life extension of half a dozen times  In the first decade of a renewable energy facility s lifespan  the PTC provided 2 3 cents kilowatt hour ITC benefit for wind turbines and 1 1 cents for some other renewable energy sources  In early 2013  the renewable electricity PTC was extended for one more year  However  it expired on January 1  2014 due to Congressional gridlock  Need for a pollution free environment  Globally  utilization of renewable energy is rising primarily due to its clean nature and a growing awareness among the masses regarding its benefits  This has influenced utility providers like NRG Energy Inc  NYSE NRG   Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE  and Duke Energy Corporation  NYSE DUK  to gradually shift their mode of power generation to solar  wind And water  NRG Energy  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  is diversifying its generation mix through the expansion of renewable assets  The company s recent acquisition of the assets of Edison Mission Energy  a subsidiary of Edison International  NYSE EIX   and Roof Diagnostics Solar will support its renewable asset expansion program  Duke Energy s business unit  Duke Energy Renewables  is a leader in developing innovative wind and solar energy solutions  Since 2007  Duke Energy has invested more than  3 billion to expand its portfolio of wind and solar power projects  Currently  the company owns and operates approximately 1 700 MW of renewable energy  which includes 1 600 MW of wind power and 100 MW of solar power  In order to expand the use of renewable energy  the company is also developing an expertise in advanced technologies like the groundbreaking Notrees Battery Storage Project  In Aug 2013  Duke Energy took over the largest solar generation facility in San Francisco    the Sunset Reservoir Solar Power Project    from Recurrent Energy  With a capacity of 4 5 megawatt alternating current  MWAC  this solar power system consists of almost 24 000 solar panels mounted on top of the Sunset Reservoir  Also  Florida based utility service provider NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE   the major U S  producer of electricity from wind and sunshine  now plans for an initial public offering of a unit    NextEra Energy Partners LP    that will own and operate renewable power plants  This unit will own interests in 10 wind and solar projects in North America with a total output of about 990 MW  The EIA projects that utility scale solar capacity will expand by about 56  between year end 2013 and year end 2015 in the U S   in tandem with considerable consumption growth in renewables for electricity and heat generation purpose  California is expected to grab most of the growth with approximately 70  of the new capacity being built in the state 
Weakness
Subsidy roll back  Budgetary constraints have caused prime global solar markets like Germany  U S   Italy  Australia  U K  and Taiwan to roll back a portion of their grants  Earlier  sales of solar players from the above countries witnessed a sharp rise mainly fueled by the rush to complete projects ahead of subsidy roll backs  The alternative energy players may receive another jolt from one of the prime solar markets  Germany is expected to cap subsidy payments after generation capacity reaches a certain target  Germany is consistently evaluating changes to the German Renewable Energy Law  or the EEG  In April 2012 an amendment of the EEG entered into force that introduced a monthly reduction in feed in tariffs  FiTs  by 1   which can rise or fall depending on solar growth  These FiT changes particularly affected the competitiveness of large scale free field PV systems and modules  Any further policy changes wrought by the German Environment and Economy Ministers and approved by the German Parliament will negatively affect the long term demand and price levels for PV products in Germany New emerging technologies  The alternative energy industry remains an emerging sector with a steady focus on the lowest cost technology and cost competitiveness from traditional means of electricity generation  This may prove disastrous for existing companies ruling the solar roost should a cheaper alternative emerge Thus  Globally  China leads the world in total electricity generation from renewable sources  helped by its increased allegiance in recent times to the alternative path  The dragon is followed closely by the U S   Brazil and Canada  On the other hand  European PV markets experienced a slowdown in 2013 due to the declining political support for PV  Notably  Italy witnessed a 70  market decline year over year  Germany also experienced a steep PV market decline of 57   So  the solar companies are increasingly focusing on the Chinese  Japanese  Indian and U S  markets to counter the tepid growth in mature markets  Indeed  the long term outlook seems bright  This is especially true as global warming and high fuel emission issues are leading to rising popularity of clean energy sources  The demand for renewable energy  in particular solar and wind  is rapidly growing for electricity generation in the U S  As per EIA  renewable electricity generation in the U S  would grow by an average of 1 9  per year until 2040 and 69  over 28 years  from 2012 2040   This boom in the alternative energy sector is also likely to outpace the mounting shale oil and gas business in the years to come  The depletion of fossil fuel reserves  higher oil and gas prices  new and advanced technologies  accompanied with more competent alternative energy applications have made green power more feasible  injecting optimism into the sector ",2014-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alt-energy-shines-on-emerging-market-demand-214220,214220
103056,324571,DUK,Cheap Dividend Growth Stocks For 2015,opinion,"In early December 2014  I unveiled my   a list of energy stocks and master limited partnerships  MLPs  with dividend sustainability issues 
Well  the axe has already fallen 
Last week  Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE  and BreitBurn Energy Partners LP  NASDAQ BBEP  each cut their distributions by over 50   and more cuts are sure to follow 
Hopefully  the unfolding energy bust will convince investors that chasing yield ends in tears 
As I ve said all along  we re looking for dividend growth  not high yields  And  
With that in mind  let s take a look at two companies that recently gave their dividend payouts huge boosts  even though few have noticed 
Natural Monopolies
Last year   were the best performing U S  sector  The strong showing by this regulated  low growth group surprised many 
However  the investing environment continues to favor these natural monopolies in early 2015  as interest rates fall further and the stock market enters a period of heightened volatility 
Some utility stocks have become expensive  though  For example  Duke Energy  NYSE DUK     trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio of 13 2x and a price to sales  P S  ratio of 2 4x  These are lofty valuation multiples  especially for a utility 
By comparison  the utility stocks in the S P 1500 SuperComposite have an average EV EBITDA ratio of 10 5x and an average P S ratio of 1 8x  Thus  we must be careful when looking for opportunities in this sector 
One of the cheapest utilities is the AES Corporation  NYSE AES   which operates coal  diesel  hydropower  gas  oil  wind  and biomass power plants 
With an EV EBITDA ratio of 8 0x and a P S ratio of 0 6x  AES is valued at a significant discount to the average utility 
Now  AES  stock is cheap primarily due to its international exposure  The firm operates in 19 countries around the world  and therefore is subject to foreign exchange and local political risks  However  this diversification should be viewed as beneficial  and the fact that the company recently doubled its dividend payout shows that management is very confident in the underlying businesses 
Like AES  my next dividend growth star doubled its dividend payout in 2014  And  though it s not a utility  it is a de facto monopoly 
A New Carrier Class
Huntington Ingalls  NYSE HII  is the sole builder of U S  Navy aircraft carriers and has built more ships in more classes than any U S  naval shipbuilder 
For the past couple of years  Huntington Ingalls has been building the Gerald R  Ford  the first in a brand new class of aircraft carriers  The second aircraft carrier in the Ford class  the John F  Kennedy  is already in early stages of construction 
Basically  Huntington s backlog is very healthy 
HII also happens to be one of the most attractively valued defense stocks  It trades at lower EV EBITDA and P S ratios than every one of its peers  Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   General Dynamics  NYSE GD   Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN   and Northrop Grumman NYSE NOC  

Not only have both of these companies doubled their dividend payout in the past year  they ve been repurchasing shares  as well  giving them respectable total yields  dividend yield plus the net share buyback percentage over the past year  
As you know  I m not as optimistic about U S  and global  as most economists  Therefore  I take comfort in the fact that the revenue from these two companies is relatively insensitive to the business cycle 
The combination of outsized dividend growth  cheap valuations  and reliable streams of revenue suggests these stocks are poised to outperform in 2015 
Safe  and high yield  investing ",2015-01-11,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cheap-dividend-growth-stocks-for-2015-238024,238024
103093,324608,DUK,20 High Yield  Safe Utilities ,opinion,Many people believe that utility stocks have a higher degree of safety because of the stability of the companies in the sector and their ongoing relationships with clients    However  utilities also have two big burdens  They don t grow quickly and if they grow they need greather amounts of money to keep the business growing  The second problem  that most utilities are very capital intensive  means they fulfill their capital needs with loans  That s normally not a problem because a utility has stable cash flows and can get access to the capital market very easily   Today I m focusing on the safest dividend stocks from the utility sector  123 equities are available within this sector  I screened all of them for companies

103094,324609,DUK,Profit from Domestic Energy Growth With Upstream MLPs,opinion,Sideways oil and gas markets don t mean that investors can t find good upside opportunities and get paid while they wait for more exciting times  Michael Peterson  managing director and senior equity analyst at MLV   Co   tells The Energy Report why upstream MLPs offer stability and continued growth and which names stand out from the crowd  The Energy Report  Oil prices have been stuck in a  10 trading range in recent months  What are you predicting in the foreseeable future  and how does that affect your outlook for the companies you cover  Michael Peterson  We expect range bound crude prices through 2014  We re forecasting a Brent price range of  100 120 barrel   100 120 bbl  and  85 105 bbl for West Texas Intermediate  WTI   Demand should see incremental growth over these two years of between 1 1 5 million barrels per day  1 1 5 MMb d  based on consensus gross domestic product  GDP  estimates  which approximate 3 5  growth per annum globally  In our view  supply will be the primary driver of crude prices near term  We expect continued growth from non OPEC producers  namely the U S   Canada and Brazil  will have a moderating effect on prices  OPEC intervention  primarily from the Saudis and other Gulf Cooperation Council  GCC  OPEC members  will limit downside price action by balancing the market with OPEC output adjustments  Geopolitical unrest and the corresponding risk of supply interruptions are likely to persist  That will support the bull case and sustain continued volatility within crude  What this means for energy equities is that absent top line commodity price driven revenue gains  near term performance in 2013 and 2014 will likely depend on execution  cost control and economies of scale  We believe that stock selection will be the key to performance over the next couple of years  Acquisitions are a key driver of growth within the stocks that I cover in the upstream MLP subsector  We believe that the subsector holds a competitive advantage in flat to bearish market environments simply because they are buyers of assets at a point when other market participants are often compelled sellers  TER  What s your view on the current status of the Keystone Pipeline situation and how that might ultimately turn out  given recent news on the Arkansas spill and Canada s position on the issue  MP  I don t really think it s a question of if Keystone and similar infrastructure projects will be commercialized  but rather when  Sanctioned oil sands projects underway in Canada are poised to add 1 1 5 MMb d within the decade  pushing total Canadian production above 5 MMb d  At the same time  U S  production continues to grow  Within the last five years  we ve erased decades of declines  Higher crude production volumes in North America will require incremental infrastructure  That build out will take time and there are a host of various constituencies involved  The recent incident in Arkansas is regrettable  especially if it could have been prevented through better infrastructure  procedures or oversight  It s important to note that it isn t possible to manage away all of the underlying risks in our business or in any business  for that matter  TER  If Keystone gets delayed for longer than people expect  will that affect the Upstream MLP companies you follow  MP  I think it will  It s a dynamic system  as you know  Delaying infrastructure buildout in one part of the system will redirect pressure to other parts of the system  Further delays of pipeline projects like Keystone could  for example  serve as a catalyst for additional investment in crude by rail terminals in Canada  even though transport by rail is not as cost effective as transport by pipeline  I think these dynamics will have a direct effect on various participants within the MLP subsector  Given the projected growth in North American energy output  we think MLPs are attractively positioned in this environment from an investor s perspective  Within the sector  however  we do expect each sub sector will present different near term growth profiles  For instance  Upstream MLPs are well positioned in our view  as are terminal and tank and natural gas liquids  NGL  processors  In the longer term  long haul pipelines will surely be in a position to grow but perhaps less so near term  TER  What other sorts of volatility factors could have significant impact on the Upstream MLPs you follow  MP  Offsetting the tax benefit of becoming a limited partner in an MLP is a relatively burdensome amount of tax work that scares off a number of otherwise interested institutional investors  As a result  retail holders dominate holdership of most MLPs  This tempers liquidity and contributes to a degree of fickleness in price action  For buy and hold investors  this volatility is a minor consideration  providing opportunistic windows for position entry and exit  TER  How do you feel that Upstream MLPs are going to perform relative to the other MLPs in the current market environment  MP  The outlook for the domestic economy is lukewarm at best  If we stay between risk averse contraction on the downside and inflationary growth on the upside  demand for yield focused securities is likely to remain strong and upstream MLPs should function very well in this environment  We believe there s a secular shift underway within energy  wherein integrated oil companies and large cap exploration and production  E P  companies sell mature E P assets to Upstream MLPs  These assets are ideally suited for upstream MLPs but fall below the returns thresholds of C corp producers  If our thesis is correct that strong demand for yield will continue  as will exponential growth in upstream MLP assets  we think this combination may result in a perfect storm for the performance of upstream MLPs  TER  How much of an advantage do upstreams have over the other MLPs that are involved in the other segments of the distribution business  MP  The growth opportunity for upstream MLPs significantly outpaces that of other MLPs  making the sub sector particularly attractive in our view  The sub sector delivers higher yields than other MLP subsectors  however  it is important to note higher yields are a requisite of higher operating risk and more limited cash flow visibility  We view the return risk proposition of upstream MLPs as compelling  Upstream MLPs have done well this year  posting 12  market appreciation year to date  YTD  and delivering an annualized yield of just over 8   Within the subsector  there has been quite a wide variance in terms of YTD performance  ranging from minus 7 36  and yields ranging from 5 9 11   This variance can be attributed to strategic merit  tactical execution  sentiment and  of course  a component of luck  This is still a stock picking environment  TER  You cover 14 upstream MLPs  As you said  some are doing better than others  What causes the variance in performance  MP  Positioning  probably more than anything  I think strategic clarity is the first filter that I would look to in terms of stock performance  After that  execution is a central driver of value creation  Lastly  sentiment matters  Many times companies are in a position where the fundamentals are delivering just fine  but it takes some time for the market to recognize that  TER  In looking at your coverage list  you have  Buy  ratings on six of those 14 companies  Tell us why you think they are Buys at this point  MP  I ll start with Legacy Reserves L P   LGCY NASDAQ   Legacy has a vast footprint within the Permian basin  the result of many years of highly economic acquisitions of small scale mom and pop acreage positions  Because the partnership has reached a scale where it would be challenging to screen  negotiate and execute a sufficient number of small deals to sustain growth  Legacy has shifted its focus to larger asset packages  Due to the breadth of the partnership s operations across the Permian basin  Legacy not only has numerous opportunities to aggregate its position  it also benefits from real time operating data with which to evaluate asset packages  We look for Legacy to prosecute its strategic advantage in the asset markets to optimize its position in the Permian basin  Atlas Resource Partners L P   ARP NYSE   which is the second youngest partnership within the subsector  just passed its first anniversary a few weeks ago  yet it is priced at the third lowest yield within the subsector  Atlas is run by the same management team that successfully built and then sold the first iteration of Atlas Energy L P   ATLS NYSE  for  4 3 billion   4 3B  to Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE  in 2010  Management has issued aggressive growth targets for 2013  and based on its current yield  the market is giving them a lot of credit for reaching these goals  likely due to its past success  If 2013 unfolds as we envision  Atlas is poised to deliver year over year  YOY  distribution growth approximating 43  with unit performance likely to follow  The third name I would like to mention is Mid Con Energy Partners L P   MCEP NASDAQ   which is perhaps the best positioned stock within the peer group  It is focused on secondary oil recovery  using water injection to extract additional oil from fields that have exhausted their ability to produce via conventional methods  Secondary recovery requires the specialized operating skills that Mid Con has and the company is well positioned to increase market share within this growing niche of oil production  Notably  because of its oil weighting  Mid Con has by far the widest per unit margins within the peer group  Next  I d like to mention QR Energy L P   QRE NYSE   QR trades at a current yield of 10 8   the second highest in the peer group  and more than 200 basis points above the subsector average  We believe the market is pricing in more risk than QR s fundamentals merit  We upgraded the stock in November based on four factors  First  we saw improved visibility for growth  Second  we saw revenue security via an enhanced hedge book that now extends coverage into 2018  Third  we saw margin expansion  as a function of effective cost controls combined with a more oil weighted portfolio resulting from merger and acquisition transactions  Finally  we saw valuation reflecting improved risk reward  We continue to believe these four factors will drive the de risking of this name during the coming quarters  with yield compression and corresponding unit appreciation to follow  BreitBurn Energy Partners L P   BBEP NASDAQ  is in the midst of a multiyear expansion  It entered 2013 with an improved balance sheet  larger portfolio and greater visibility for distribution growth  Building on its initial foray into the Permian basin with a non operated position  last year it added operating positions and we expect it will add future assets to its Permian footprint  BreitBurn is targeting  500 million   500M  of acquisitions in 2013  and with more than  1B in available liquidity  we feel that it will be able to comfortably pursue those objectives  Last but not least  I d like to mention Vanguard Natural Resources  LLC  VNR NYSE   2012 was a constructive year for Vanguard unit holders  The partnership expanded its operating base  increased the degree and tenor of revenue security  enhanced the portfolio s exposure to natural gas and  most importantly  increased distributions by 5  YOY  Our expectations for 2013 include distribution growth by way of operating efficiency gains  comprehensive hedging and accretive acquisitions supported by ample capitalization  TER  Are there any particular factors you d like to highlight for investors in this sector  MP  I would highlight three elements  First  investors should have views on the macro outlooks for energy commodities  namely oil  natural gas  NGLs and refined products  The second factor would be clear visibility on drivers of value creation  The third  and arguably most important  would be an understanding of risk on both an absolute and a relative basis  The combination of those three factors will enable investors to make prudent decisions  TER  Do you see any sort of merger or takeover activity among Upstream MLPs  MP  I don t expect there to be any mergers among upstream MLPs  Certainly  acquisitions are a core piece of the Upstream MLP business model  The business model is predicated on growth  and growth is driven largely by acquisitions  We expect the pace of acquisitions realized in 2012 to continue if not accelerate in 2013  TER  So basically they re all acquirers but not likely to be acquired by somebody else  MP  Because of the partnership structure  which is a little bit more constraining than a C corp structure is  it s unlikely that they would be acquired  It s more likely that they will be the acquirers  We saw Linn Energy LLC  LINE NASDAQ  acquire Barry Petroleum Company  BRY NYSE   marking the first acquisition of a C corp by an MLP  TER  What should investors be most concerned about at this point  MP  While no one has a crystal ball with which to view the future  it s my strong belief that the opportunity set within energy from the perspective of reward versus risk merits investors  time and attention  They ll be well rewarded in doing so  TER  Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with us today  Michael  MP  I appreciate your time and interest as well   is

103098,324613,DUK,Most Eastern Utility Stocks Are Overvalued  Part 4,opinion,This is our fourth and final installment on assessing the relative valuation of utility stocks today  Our first installment part 1 looked at utility stocks in general  In part 2 we covered utilities operating in the Western part of the United States  and in part 3 we looked at utilities operating in the Central states  This final installment  part 4  will review utility stocks located in the Eastern region of the United States  As we stated in previous installments  the utility sector is experiencing a lot of change  With growth long inhibited by regulators  utilities throughout the country have been looking for ways to diversify their businesses and or develop new markets  Another change that is sweeping the industry is mergers and acquisitions  A few examples in the Eastern utility sector include Duke Energy  DUK  and Progress Energy merging  and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation  CV  was acquired by Green Mountain Power  GMP   Although these actions may prove to be successful  they do make analysis more difficult because there is scant history of the combined entities to scrutinize  Eastern Utility Stocks Historical Overvaluation Is A Concern The following table looks at the 14 surviving premier publicly traded Eastern utility companies  A review of this table discloses that virtually every utility company in the Eastern portion of the United States is fundamentally overvalued today  There are a couple companies where you could argue for fair value or maybe full value instead of overvalued  However  as we pointed out in the previous installments of this series on utility stocks  due to their low growth histories  getting valuation correct before investing in a utility is more critical than it is for companies that typically grow faster  One quick valuation check is to compare the current PE ratio of each utility stock on the below table against their historical normal PE ratio  Virtually every company on the list has a current PE ratio that is at worst higher than its historical norm  and at best equal to historical norms  However  we have continuously cautioned throughout this series on the importance of evaluating utility stocks one at a time over drawing conclusions in general  Nevertheless  when reviewing the major utility companies in the Eastern portion of the United States  there are no bargains that we could find  There are only four companies with current PE ratios below historical norms  see green highlights on table below   Exelon Corp  EXC   Top of Form Public Service Enterprise Group  PEG   PPL Corp  PPL  and TECO Energy  Inc  TE  Four Examples With Current PEs Below Historical Normal PEs A quick review of the four examples of Eastern utility stocks  see green highlights on table  with current PE ratios below their historical norm shows that three of the four are currently experiencing declining earnings  And our fourth example  TECO Energy  is fully valued  although not overvalued  Exelon Corp  EXC    Directly   Exelon Corporation  EXC  is the nation s leading competitive energy provider  with approximately  33 billion in annual revenues  Headquartered in Chicago  Exelon has operations and business activities in 47 states  the District of Columbia and Canada  Exelon is the largest competitive U S  power generator  with approximately 35 000 megawatts of owned capacity comprising one of the nation s cleanest and lowest cost power generation fleets  The company s Constellation business unit provides energy products and services to approximately 100 000 business and public sector customers and approximately 1 million residential customers  Exelon s utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6 6 million customers in central Maryland  BGE   northern Illinois  ComEd  and southeastern Pennsylvania  PECO    PPL Corp  PPL    Directly   PPL Corporation  headquartered in Allentown  Pa   through its affiliated companies  owns or controls about 19 000 megawatts of generating capacity in the United States  sells energy in key U S  markets  and delivers electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers in the United States and the United Kingdom   Public Service Enterprise Group  Inc  PEG    Directly   Public Service Enterprise Group  PSEG  is a publicly traded  PEG   integrated generation and energy company headquartered in Newark  New Jersey  Its main subsidiaries are  Public Service Electric and Gas Company  PSE G   PSEG Power LLC  and PSEG Energy Holdings LLC  PSE G is a regulated New Jersey utility delivering gas and electric safely and reliably to about 70  of New Jersey s population  PSEG Power is a major wholesale energy supplier in the Northeast with three main subsidiaries  PSEG Fossil LLC  PSEG Nuclear LLC  and PSEG Energy Resources   Trade LLC  PSEG ER T   PSEG Energy Holdings is a company with domestic investments and has two main energy related businesses  PSEG Global and PSEG Resources   TECO Energy Inc  TE    Directly   TECO Energy  Inc   TE  is an energy related holding company  Its principal subsidiary  Tampa Electric Company  is a regulated utility in Florida with both electric and gas divisions  Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas System   Other subsidiaries include TECO Coal  which owns and operates coal production facilities in Kentucky and Virginia  and TECO Guatemala  which is engaged in electric power generation and energy related businesses in Guatemala   F A S T  Graphs    A Pictures Is Worth 1000 Words For the sake of economy of words  we present the following 15 year historical earnings and price correlated  on eight well known Eastern utility stocks  Calculated performance tables follow each of the historical graphs  There are a few key points that the reader should focus on as they review the historical graphs and the performance tables  First and foremost  the orange earnings justified valuation line represents fair value calculated utilizing widely accepted formulas for valuing a business  The black line is the monthly closing stock price line  The reader should focus on the correlation between earnings  the orange line  and stock price  black line  over time  The questions to be answered are simply whether or not the stock price is tracking the earnings line and what happens when it deviates from it  Focusing on answering these questions validates the undeniable earnings and price relationship  When evaluating the performance tables  notice how capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR  closely correlates to the company s earnings growth rate adjusted by valuation  Also  notice how the dividend growth rate and dividends in general are affected by earnings results  In other words  close examination will reveal how earnings growth drives and determines these two components of return  We suggest that a careful examination of the following graphs and tables will provide the reader with a clearer perspective of the long term realities of investing in utilities stocks  Investing in utilities stocks is quite different than investing in the typical dividend growth stock  Utility stocks have their own unique attributes and characteristics and therefore  need to be evaluated accordingly  We hope that this article  and the three that have preceded it  have provided the reader with greater insights into investing in the world of utility stocks  Dominion Resources Inc  D    Directly   Dominion is one of the nation s

total of 699 000 electric and natural gas utility customers in 66 communities across two states  with combined total assets of over  4 billion  Because earnings fell so precipitously in 2001  the earnings and price correlation on the long term graph above appears to be uncorrelated  Therefore  in order to expose the earnings and price relationship  a shorter time frame needs to be graphed  Furthermore  I chose a time frame where the company was fairly valued in the beginning and modestly overvalued at the end  Consequently  when you review the performance table  you will see that the capital appreciation of 5 3   Closing Annualized ROR  is enhanced above the earnings growth rate of 2  due to current overvaluation Summary and ConclusionsThis series of articles was inspired by anecdotal evidence indicating that after a strong run up in 2011  utility stocks had become overvalued  In general  after conducting research on utilities across the United States with this four part series of articles  we have concluded that utilities are  in fact  overvalued  However  this conclusion was drawn after examining each respective utility stock one company at a time through the lens of the earnings and price correlated research tool F A S T  Graphs  To clarify and elaborate on our view of the current valuation of utility stocks  the following qualifiers are necessary  First of all  throughout this series we did show a few utility stocks that appear to be reasonably priced  Furthermore  we found very few utilities that we would classify as highly or even dangerously overvalued  To put this in perspective  if we saw the same valuations on consumer staples that we see on utilities  we would consider them fully valued and not consider them excessively overvalued  But for the most part  our research has determined that utilities are fully valued with many moderately overvalued today On the other hand  we consistently pointed out that valuation regarding low growth entities  like utility stocks  is more critical  Therefore  when utility stocks are fully valued  as we find many to be today  prospective investors need to understand that the capital appreciation component might be minimal  and dividends will most likely represent the majority of potential returns  Additionally  when any actual overvaluation is present  capital appreciation could easily become negative if and when valuations revert to the mean Finally  utility stocks have historically attracted investors with their dividends  Although utility stock dividends do not have a history of fast growth  they do offer a legacy of above average yield  Furthermore  the safety associated with the necessary nature of their businesses and their often monopoly status  is a plus for conservative  safety conscious investors desirous of yield  However  the price for safety has been regulated growth  Therefore  given the low yield investment environment we are currently in  utility stocks may still offer viable alternatives to low rate fixed income  However  we believe that caution and due diligence on a company by company basis is in order Disclosure   Long NEE  SCG at the time

103099,324614,DUK,High Bond Yields Are Hitting These Sectors,opinion,As we all know  the bond yields on the 10  and 30 Year U S  Treasury Notes have spiked higher recently  That recent spike has affected many leading stocks and sectors that take advantage of the easy money policies by the Federal Reserve  Easy money means cheap money to many companies  Utilities One of the important sectors that is highly sensitive to interest rates is the utility stocks  Traders can easily see the recent action in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU   This sector is trading basically inverse to the 10 year U S  Treasury yield  The XLU topped out on April 30  2013 at  41 44 a share  the same day the U S  Treasury yield bottomed out  The XLU is now trading into some daily chart support  so a bounce is likely to occur soon  Traders can see the same type of pattern in leading utility stocks such as Duke Energy Corp   DUK   American Electric Power Co  Inc   AEP  and Southern Company  SO   Remember  all of the utility companies are very sensitive to higher interest rates Real Estate Another leading sector that is interest rate sensitive is the housing and real estate sectors  Just take a look at the leading home builder stocks and you will see the declines in stocks such as Lennar Corp   LEN  and Toll Brothers Inc   TOL   REITs  Real estate investment trusts  have also plunged lower on the back of higher bond yields  Leading mortgage REITS such as Annaly Capital Management Inc   NLY   ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc   ARR  and Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc   IVR  have dropped recently  Watch The Yields Where do yields go from here  Bond yields will certainly move higher if the Federal Reserve begins to tapper its current quantitative easing program  Currently  the Federal Reserve is buying  85 billion a month worth of mortgage backed securities and U S  Treasuries  So it is safe to say that yields have been held artificially low for quite a long time  Currently  yields are a bit extended on the charts  but if they begin to consolidate  it would indicate that they are going to move higher  Traders better watch the bond yields for clues to trade these important sectors ,2013-06-06,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/high-bond-yields-are-hitting-these-sectors-170222,170222

103147,324662,DUK,Thoughts On The Duke Mess And How To Fix It,opinion,Do you remember when you were a kid and got into trouble with your siblings  At my house  at least  my Dad would line us up and say  I don t know which one of you caused this mess  but if I use my belt on each of your backsides I ll know I got the guilty party and the other two will know not to do the same thing your brother did    This kind of rough justice swiftly applied worked in my house and there were no appeals from my Dad s decision  You messed up  your behind faced justice   The mess made by the new Duke Energy Board of directors in deciding at their first meeting after the merger of Duke  DUK  and Progress Energy was approved by the long line of regulatory agencies that they really didn t mean it cries out for rough justice  swiftly applied   We ve all heard of buyer s remorse but this was unlike anything we have ever seen   Now the spin is underway first with Jim Rogers  the once and future Duke Energy CEO testifying that he didn t really know anything about this until the last minute but the word on the street was that the Duke Board didn t like the new CEOs autocratic management style   Huh   This deal has been pending for more than a year and a half and that is a lot of dates before you decide you don t like the way the bride kisses   Then the fired CEO was grilled by the same regulators and no doubt he was reminded by his lawyers and Duke s that he had promised in exchange for a substantial severance not to disparage his former employers  He didn t have too they were stepping in it just fine on their own   Then the lead director testifies and makes vague references to worries about the candor of the fired CEO  his willingness to share information with the Board  his handling of a nuclear plant regulatory matter  It makes you wonder whether the lawyers had also warned her that most of these severance agreements have the same non disparagement clauses for the employer and she was treading very close to the line grasping for any straw to explain the Duke Board action in a way that did not provoke laughter by the Commissioners    It all looked  felt and was like three kids caught in a mess and trying to talk their way out of the woodshed they knew was coming  Explaining it in public should rightfully embarrass all sides  but it is not a sufficient remedy for the mess they caused   So what s the remedy    There are few good options for this kind of mess  The Regulatory Commissions could take back their approval of the merger but the deal is already closed and a lot of regulatory orders have been approved and signed  It s not easy putting the toothpaste back in the tube after it is splattered all over the floor The Commissioners could punish Duke by reducing its approved rate of return but that only hurts shareholders who are as nonplussed as the regulators Or the Commissions could decide that they have lost confidence in the Duke Board and CEO and the only way to have a fresh start is to ask for the resignations of every director who participated in firing the agreed CEO and the CEO they replaced him with and direct the outside directors remaining to elect new directors and together select a new CEO untainted by the scandal This is one sure way to put this issue behind everyone quickly and get back to business  It appeals to common sense  assures that you woodshed the guilty and do no more harm to the innocent bystanders  My Dad would approve of this rough justice  swiftly applied he d even loan the Commissioners his belt ,2012-07-22,Gary Hunt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-on-the-duke-mess-and-how-to-fix-it-130385,130385
103148,324663,DUK,Most Eastern Utility Stocks Are Overvalued ,opinion,As we stated in previous installments  the utility sector is experiencing a lot of change  With growth long inhibited by regulators  utilities throughout the country have been looking for ways to diversify their businesses and or develop new markets  Another change that is sweeping the industry is mergers and acquisitions  A few examples in the Eastern utility sector include Duke Energy  DUK  and Progress Energy merging  and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation  CV  was acquired by Green Mountain Power  GMP   Although these actions may prove to be successful  they do make analysis more difficult because there is scant history of the combined entities to scrutinize  Eastern Utility Stocks Historical Overvaluation Is A Concern The following table looks at the 14 surviving premier publicly traded Eastern utility companies  A review of this table discloses that virtually every utility company in the Eastern portion of the United States is fundamentally overvalued today  There are a couple companies where you could argue for fair value or maybe full value instead of overvalued  However  as we pointed out in the previous installments of this series on utility stocks  due to their low growth histories  getting valuation correct before investing in a utility is more critical than it is for companies that typically grow faster  One quick valuation check is to compare the current PE ratio of each utility stock on the below table against their historical normal PE ratio  Virtually every company on the list has a current PE ratio that is at worst higher than its historical norm  and at best equal to historical norms  However  we have continuously cautioned throughout this series on the importance of evaluating utility stocks one at a time over drawing conclusions in general  Nevertheless  when reviewing the major utility companies in the Eastern portion of the United States  there are no bargains that we could find  There are only four companies with current PE ratios below historical norms  see green highlights on table below   Exelon Corp  EXC   Public Service Enterprise Group  PEG   PPL Corp  PPL  and TECO Energy  Inc  TE  Four Examples With Current PEs Below Historical Normal PEs A quick review of the four examples of Eastern utility stocks  see green highlights on table  with current PE ratios below their historical norm shows that three of the four are currently experiencing declining earnings  And our fourth example  TECO Energy  is fully valued  although not overvalued  Exelon Corp  EXC    Directly  Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC  is the nation s leading competitive energy provider  with approximately  33 billion in annual revenues

000 megawatts of owned capacity comprising one of the nation s cleanest and lowest cost power generation fleets  The company s Constellation business unit provides energy products and services to approximately 100 000 business and public sector customers and approximately 1 million residential customers  Exelon s utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6 6 million customers in central Maryland  BGE   northern Illinois  ComEd  and southeastern Pennsylvania  PECO   PPL Corp  PPL    Directly   PPL Corporation  headquartered in Allentown  Pa   through its affiliated companies  owns or controls about 19 000 megawatts of generating capacity in the United States  sells energy in key U S  markets  and delivers electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers in the United States and the United Kingdom  Public Service Enterprise Group  Inc  PEG    Directly   Public Service Enterprise Group  PSEG  is a publicly traded  NYSE PEG   integrated generation and energy company headquartered in Newark  New Jersey  Its main subsidiaries are  Public Service Electric and Gas Company  PSE G   PSEG Power LLC  and PSEG Energy Holdings LLC  PSE G is a regulated New Jersey utility delivering gas and electric safely and reliably to about 70  of New Jersey s population  PSEG Power is a major wholesale energy supplier in the Northeast with three main subsidiaries  PSEG Fossil LLC  PSEG Nuclear LLC  and PSEG Energy Resources   Trade LLC  PSEG ER T   PSEG Energy Holdings is a company with domestic investments and has two main energy related businesses  PSEG

Virginia  and TECO Guatemala  which is engaged in electric power generation and energy related businesses in Guatemala  F A S T  Graphs    A Pictures Is Worth 1000 Words For the sake of economy of

103149,324664,DUK,Could Higher Rates End The Rally ,opinion,Wednesday afternoon  interest rates on the 10 and 30 year T notes surged higher again  The yield on the 10 year T note bottomed on July 24  2012 at 1 39 percent  Since that  low point yields have soared higher by 41 0 basis points to 1 805 percent  Anyway that you slice it or dice it this is a strong move higher in bond yields in such a short amount of time  This increase in bond yields will cause mortgage rates to rise and make for higher borrowing costs in the future Yields are rising despite the Federal Reserve Bank s Operation Twist program  This tells us that there is a seller in the bond market and it is likely to be a large holder of bonds  Many traders are now under the assumption that China could be selling U S  Treasurys to try and combat inflation that is already plaguing the nation  We shall see soon enough When interest rates go higher there are some stocks that will be adversely affected  Utility stocks are usually one of the first stock sectors to suffer if interest rates rise  Traders can easily see how the Utilities Select SPDR Fund  NYSEARCA XLU  has sold off since late July  Other leading utility stocks that have come under selling pressure recently include Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED   The Southern Company  NYSE SO   and Duke Energy Corp  NYSE DUK   All of the utility stocks have been market leaders throughout 2012  however  if interest rates continue to rise  that leadership role could be coming to an end  The housing stocks are also likely to suffer if yields rally higher  however  interest rates are still very low historically ,2012-08-16,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/could-higher-rates-end-the-rally-133140,133140

103184,324699,DUK,Greek Bailout Bullish For Precious Metals and Natural Resources ,opinion,The Chinese Ideographs for crisis is a two edged sword   One blade is pointed upward to forecast opportunity  the other symbol is pointed downward to signify danger   The short term deflationary crisis in 2011 provided a unique opportunity to buy undervalued miners at historic bargain basement prices In 2012 the market metrics have been directed upwards for gold  GDX   silver SIL   uranium URA  and rare earth miners REMX    There is an old truism that fighting the tape can be dangerous for your financial health   It is suspected that the Europeans will try to assuage fears on a Greek bailout to the tune of  172 billon to solidify a global market reversal for the time being This event will be coinciding with the general equity markets breaking through key resistance levels and previous 52 week highs   This powerful move in the S P 500 market makes a strong case that this recent 20  correction and our October 4th buy signal provided an excellent buying opportunity   It appears the equity markets have begun a new uptrend in response to Central Banks worldwide printing money and choosing some degree of inflation   Remember the Japanese  Chinese  English  Americans and Europeans have all instituted accommodative measures and are taking the inflationary path  In any difference of opinion concerning the marketplace there are always criteria to buttress the bearish sentiment   However  capitalism is not yet ready to head for the hills   Our readers have looked ahead to a surprisingly strong rally in our sectors in 2012   Especially so  the rare earths  uraniums and of course high quality junior gold  GDXJ  and silver stocks Specifically  subscriber attention should be directed in reviewing our articles on uranium written since the Fukushima disaster  Suffice it to say  for many months we have said it is only a matter of time before the world becomes aware of the strategic importance of uranium in the production of global electricity   Everyday brings additional items of interest that substantiates our position For example  we read  Duke Energy To Take  220 Million Charge    That was supposed to be a demonstration project on a marquis  Clean Coal Power Plant  in Indiana   Originally  it was intended to demonstrate how coal could be converted to make affordable electricity   Instead  its taking Duke to the cleaners as well as raising electricity costs to consumers in Indiana   The plant is costing in excess of  1 billion dollars more than first projected   Consumer groups accuse Duke of heading into cost prohibitive stormy seas On the other hand  as stated in our previous articles  the public has chosen to ignore the new day that is dawning for nuclear energy   Rarely do we read of the AP 1000 reactor  which is safer and more economical and being approved right here in the United States for the first time in three decades The rare earth sector has been pummeled to the mat to the point where they represent dynamic buys at these cheap levels   Not only are they essential for American national security but the Chinese might be interested in purchasing positions to control their already quasi monopoly  particularly in such  heavies  as dysprosium and terbium   It is noted with interest that the Chinese have halted production of these metals in order to fine tune prices in response to a weak global economy in 2011   Now that we have seen this revival in industrial metals  prices of these critical elements should continue on their secular long term upward path far outpacing 2011 declines Recently  Caterpillar  CAT  announced record earnings based on the need for them to supply equipment for what they state is rising demand for precious and industrial metals production   Caterpillar said   We expect producers will continue to struggle to meet this demand  and most commodity prices should average higher than in 2011    This may indicate that while all the attention has been diverted to the travails of the Eurozone  the rest of the world has been increasingly active in mining growth and development   The gold miners have experienced a volatile Jekyll and Hyde 2011   According to this pattern it was oversold and has been ready for this upward reversal in 2012 GST feels that it is only a matter of time before the precious metal miners themselves participate in reflecting this burgeoning mining bull market    Many miners such as Barrick  ABX  and Goldcorp  GG  are reporting earning surprises beating analyst estimates  while other companies such as Kinross  KGC  and Agnico Eagle  AEM  have taken write downs in a powerful gold bull market   The majors are desperate for resource growth at a time when new discoveries are at an all time low   They will be on the hunt for undervalued juniors sitting on developing mines may attract the hungry giants who may pay exciting premiums   Do not forget many of these majors are sitting on large holdings of U S  dollars  which is increasingly losing value   They must work speedily to transfer that capital into resource growth  when there are still opportunities in the sector Below You May Find The Video ,2012-02-22,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/greek-bailout-bullish-for-precious-metals-and-natural-resources-114633,114633
103185,324700,DUK,This Utility Stock Is Still A Great Buy,opinion,Last year  the Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  was on a tear  At least for a boring utility index  it was  The index returned 15  before dividends  its best annual performance in four years  Throw dividends in  and we re probably flirting with close to a 20  return    Some of the bigger utilities performed even better then the index  Atlanta based Southern Co   NYSE  SO   for instance  returned about 17  before dividends  while North Carolina power giant Duke Energy  NYSE  DUK  turned in 23  before dividends  That s was quite impressive  considering the S P 500 was dead flat for the entire year  returning only about 2     But things have changed  Well  sort of    The pundits and spinners would have you believe that utilities fell out of bed in the first quarter of 2012  But while these stocks are visibly lagging the broader market  with the DJU having returned  1 7  so far this year compared to a roughly 10  gain for the S P 500 in the same period  a lot of the more widely held utility stocks are what I consider fully valued  trading at price to earnings  P E   ratios of 14 or higher    As a money manager and an investor  I like to see forward P E ratios below 15 for larger utilities  with dividend yield of 5  or higher  I ve recently recommended  for instance  Exelon Corp   NYSE  EXC   which is a very attractive holding  It s still a timely idea that fits my P E and dividend criteria    Another utility stock I ve also followed closely is TECO Energy  NYSE  TE   Here s why this stock has attracted my interest lately      A diverse  progressive and undervalued business  Starting out as Florida s old Tampa Electric Co  TECO has evolved into a holding company with diverse energy operations  The different divisions encompass electric power generation and distribution  natural gas distribution  a coal mining operation and a Guatemalan electric utility subsidiary  The new Tampa Electric Co  now operates as TECO s main subsidiary    The bulk of TECO s business  about 60 5   comes from the electric utility operations in Florida  which provides the company with a steady cash flow  And although the state s economy and housing market are still trying to get off of the mat  the company is forecasting a slight customer growth in that business line for 2012  Positive customer growth for an electric utility is an impressive accomplishment  considering Florida has one of the worst housing markets in the nation   It s got gas    The coal business and the pipeline development business are what have really piqued my interest in this stock  In 2008  TECO formed SeaCoast Gas Transmission LLC  a subsidiary that plans to develop and own an intrastate natural gas pipeline in Florida    Not only would this help grow the distribution side of TECO s natural gas utility    People s Gas System    it would also position the company as a potential wholesale transporter of the fuel in the region  As the nation increasingly switches toward natural gas as a viable energy source  this is a great advantage to have    TECO s electric utility fuel breakdown is currently 62  coal and 38  natural gas  So if the company transitions toward more natural gas  then a cheap and efficient delivery system will already be in place  I like this kind of forward thinking    Recently  TECO shares have been under pressure for two main reasons  Investors are shifting away from richly valued utility stocks  and the coal business is seeing lower margins due to higher production costs    This year  TECO is expected to sell roughly 7 million tons of coal  Production costs are projected to increase to between  83 and  87 per ton  which is up from  80 per ton last year  The positive offset is that the 2012 average selling price is expected to come in at  96 per ton compared with last year s  88 per ton    To see how this stock still has a good chance to grow  let s do a simple math  Last year s margin was right at about 10   Let s get in the middle of TECO s expected production cost for coal this year  and call it  85 per ton  Based on a selling price of  96  that s about a 13  margin  and this could actually increase if the company is able to tighten production costs    Risks to consider  Although aggressively marketed as  clean   coal is truly the environmental whipping boy  More than two thirds of TECO s power generation is coal fired  so having a coal mining business that generates about 24  of the company s revenue causes some obvious concerns  That said  it appears the company is correctly and intelligently poised to take advantage of the natural gas boom  Also  while the broader investor coolness toward utility names is without merit  it takes a while for the herd to come back around  which is why you should buy and sell before they do      With a forward P E of roughly 13 and a dividend yield of about 5 0   TECO could earn  1 35 in earnings per share  EPS  this year  a 6  increase compared with 2011  Be prepared to wait for some upward movement in share price  The generous dividend is good compensation for that wait  by Adam
