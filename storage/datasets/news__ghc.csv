6405,227920,GHC,The Right Time For Publishing Stocks  Here s Why,opinion,Newspaper companies are transforming their business models to better position themselves in a multi platform media universe  According to industry experts  newspaper companies will focus more on mobile devices  online advertising based on user experience and personalized content to make them less dependable on traditional advertising revenues  They are also streamlining their cost structures  strengthening their balance sheets and restructuring their portfolios  Let s have a look at what is happening in the publishing industry and how newspaper companies are adapting to the changing face of the media Business Reviving Endeavors In an effort to offset declining revenues and shrinking market share  publishers are scrambling to slash costs  This has compelled many newspaper companies to undertake cost cutting measures such as headcount trimming  pay cuts  furloughs  voluntary retirement programs and closure of printing facilities  Gannett Co  NYSE GCI    Inc  s flagship newspaper USA Today had trimmed its workforce to rein in costs amid dwindling print advertising demand  Publishing companies have been offloading assets that bear no direct relation with the core operations  New York Times Company  NYSE NYT  in May 2012 divested its remaining stake  210 Class B units  in the Fenway Sports Group  the owner of the Boston Red Sox and the Liverpool Football Club  for  63 million  Another example of asset shedding by the company is the Dec 2011 sale of Regional Media Group  which was long grappling with shrinking advertising revenues  Waning print advertising revenues  in an uncertain economy  compelled The New York Times Company to take this tough decision of divesting Regional Media Group  part of The New York Times Media Group  This helped the company to renew its focus on its core newspapers and pay more attention to its online activities  The divestiture was also considered part of the cost containment efforts undertaken to stay afloat in this anemic environment  The New York Times Company on Sep 24  2012 completed the sale of About Group  which it acquired in 2005  to InterActiveCorp for a consideration of  300 million  In Oct 2012  the company sold its stake in Indeed com  a job portal  for approximately  167 million  The New York Times Company on Oct 24  2013 completed the sale of its New England Media Group  including The Boston Globe and its allied properties to an acquisition company spearheaded by John W  Henry  who owns Fenway Sports Group  Additionally  the company also offloaded its 49  stake in Metro Boston Diversifying Revenue Base  Focusing on Profitable Zones Publishing companies are also diversifying their revenue base  For quite some time now  Gannett  NYSE GCI  has been making endeavors to expand its presence in broadcasting and digital products with the aim of lowering its dependency on soft print media business and traditional advertising  therefore reducing susceptibility to economic conditions  The recent news of Gannett taking over Cars com underscores this  Cars com gives online visitors price checks  model comparisons and dealer reviews  Launched in 1998  Cars com was previously owned by Classified Ventures  a consortium of five companies  Apart from Gannett  other companies that formed the joint venture were Tribune Media Co  NYSE TRCO   McClatchy Company  NYSE MNI    AH Belo Corporation  NYSE AHC  and Graham Holdings Co  NYSE GHC   Prior to this  Gannett bought six television stations of the London Broadcasting Company and also acquired television station operator  Belo Corp  We believe this will transform Gannett s business model  which was largely focused on low margin newspapers to a high margin multi media business  Gannett also announced that it will split its business into two separate entities  one completely focusing on Broadcasting and Digital businesses and the other concentrating on Publishing  Other publishing companies such as Journal Communications Inc  NYSE JRN and The EW Scripps Company  NYSE SSP  had entered into a deal merging their broadcasting operations and spin off the newspaper business into a separate entity  Journal Media Group  The merged broadcast and digital media company  headquartered in Cincinnati  will retain the name The E W  Scripps Company  The deal will be concluded today  Journal Media Group will commence trading under the symbol  JMG  in NYSE Pay As You Access  To read further please subscribe  is the new mantra that newspaper companies are fast adopting  To curb shrinking advertising revenues and improve market share battered by the recent economic downturn  some of the publishing companies are now considering charging readers for online content  We believe that this would end the free usage of online content  Despite hiccups in the economy  the online subscription based model still promises guaranteed revenue generation  The New York Times Company fixed monthly charges of  15 for access to more than the restricted number of articles on its website and on a smartphone application   20 for unlimited access online and on Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   s       iPad tablet computer application  and  35 for online  smartphone and iPad application  Moreover  in order to woo subscribers  the company introduced a plan of 99 cents under which one will be able to enjoy all digital offerings for one month  The New York Times Company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 910 000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014  rising 35 000 sequentially and over 20  year over year  The launch of new subscription based digital products such as NYT Now  Times Premier and Cooking product also contributed to the improvement  The New York Times Company is steadily taking strides to bring in more readers under the ambit of the subscription based model  Gannett also initiated a subscription based model Bottom Line With a strategic and steady newspaper budget  we could see fewer layoffs  increased focus on web and local content  improved subscription and concentration on profitable circulation  We observe that newspapers are turning more subscriber oriented  offering reports in line with readers  choice  We expect paywall strategies  new pricing techniques and product innovation to generate more revenues for the newspaper companies  As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic on the newspaper publishing industry over the long term  But what about investing in the space right now ,2015-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-right-time-for-publishing-stocks----here's-why-247535,247535
6408,227923,GHC,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 FT says gains market share  visibility low,news,"  FT CEO says winning market share  but little visibility
   Online subscription revenue up 20 percent in February
   Does not rule out further price increases
 
 By Georgina Prodhan
 LONDON  March 27  Reuters    The Financial Times is winning
market share as the global economic crisis plays to its
strengths but has little visibility on the future development of
advertising spending  its chief executive told Reuters 
 The publication  part of Pearson  is expanding its FT com
offering through video and new mobile outlets and plans an
online version of its luxury goods magazine   How To Spend It  
but will likely do so without increasing its staff this year 
John Ridding said 
  This story  it s our story  I ve been here 22 years and all
that time we ve been building up our global operation   he told
Reuters in an interview    What s going on out there is
absolutely in our zone  
 Ridding said the FT was winning market share in advertising
and readership  and online subscription revenue rose about 20
percent in February  but editorial staff numbers    which have
been increasing    were unlikely to rise again this year 
  We ve got to be pretty careful this year  as everyone has
to be  because it s tough and there s not much visibility  so I
wouldn t expect them to   he said 
 The FT s advertising revenues rose for the first nine months
of 2008 but dropped 13 percent in the fourth quarter  Parent
company Pearson said early this month the decline had continued
into this year 
 Ridding declined to comment further on headcount plans  The
FT is cutting about 5 percent of its staff and has offered
shorter working weeks and extended leave 
 The FT has got off relatively lightly as some other
newspaper groups have already filed for bankruptcy or closed
titles 
 And the Washington Post Co and the New York Times Co  said
on Thursday they were embarking on new cost cuts in the face of
dramatic declines in advertising revenue 
 The FT had a global circulation of about 435 000 in 2008 
Readership in the UK was about 418 000  It also has editions
published in continental Europe  Asia  the United States and the
Middle East 
 
 PRICE INCREASES
 Newspapers  hit in recent years by increasing free
competition on the Web and the resulting fall in circulations of
their paper editions  have been agonising about how much of
their content they should give away online 
 The FT so far has struck a balance  allowing readers to
access 10 articles per month for free before being invited to
subscribe  News Corp s Wall Street Journal has a more closed
approach 
 FT com attracted an average of 7 2 million unique users per
month in 2008  up 27 percent year on year  and had 110 000
paying subscribers 
 Digital revenues currently account for about 19 percent of
total sales at the FT  which includes the newspaper  FT com 
Financial Times Business  Exec Appointments  FTChinese com and
Money Media 
 The FT has recently raised prices for online subscriptions
and Ridding did not rule out further increases  either for
online or for the newspaper  which now costs 1 80 pounds   2 58 
on weekdays and 2 30 pounds on weekends 
  People should be confident about charging for quality
journalism  and we are   he said   We re always looking at our
pricing   he added  pointing out that the paper still cost less
than a double espresso from Starbucks 
 Ridding said an online version of  How To Spend It  should
be launched this year  driven by a desire by luxury brands such
as Rolex to move to digital advertising  where the direct
success of campaigns can be far more easily monitored 
  We ve been struck by how fast that s happening   he said 
 Online has been the one surprise in terms of how strongly it s
performing   he added 
 He said FT s online video offerings  which focus on
interviews with top level executives and decision makers  were
also attracting healthy levels of advertising and were paying
for themselves many times over 
 The FT also delivers its content to mobile phones and has a
customised version for users of Research in Motion s BlackBerry 
It plans an application for Apple s iPhone  very soon   Ridding
said 
 The FT is now the only unit exposed to advertising at
Pearson  which also owns the world s biggest educational
publishing business and Penguin Books  leading to frequent
speculation the business could be sold 
 Asked whether he had received any takeover approaches 
Ridding said   No  We just get on with what we re doing   He
said Pearson was a supportive owner  backing the FT s global and
digital expansion 
 Ridding said he did not worry unduly about what competitors
including the Wall Street Journal were doing  The Journal has
broadened its target audience since being acquired by News Corp
just over a year ago  for example by offering more sports 
  You just have to be very focused on what you re the best
at  and we re the best at international business journalism  and
that s where our resources go   he said 
  We re not going to depart from that  we re not going to be
distracted from that

Results included  1 96 billion of investment gains  partially from a swap of a 40 year investment in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co  N GHC  for a Miami television station and other assets 
Accounting rules require Omaha  Nebraska based Berkshire to report these sums with earnings  but Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter to be often meaningless  Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses in sectors including insurance  railroads  energy  chemicals  food and clothing  Analysts have said the company s increasing diversification over the years have made its fortunes more closely tied to the overall economy  which the Commerce Department said grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the quarter 
Such diversification helped in the quarter  While profit fell 8 percent in insurance  Berkshire s best known business sector  earnings from other businesses grew 20 percent 
The latter included gains of 29 percent from manufacturing  service and retail operations  including a doubling of pre tax profit from apparel  and 34 percent from energy and utilities 
Profit at the BNSF Railway grew 4 percent  though Berkshire expressed disappointment  saying  service levels continued to be well below our internal standards  as well as those expected by our customers  

Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965  and according to Forbes magazine is the world s third richest person  He turns 84 on Aug  30  In Friday trading  Berkshire Class A shares closed up  1 155 at  189 279  Its Class B shares rose 40 cents to  125 83
