192647,414163,CY,Minnesota chip maker gets up to  170 million from U S  Defense Dept,news,"By Stephen Nellis
 Reuters    Semiconductor maker SkyWater Technology said on Monday it will receive up to  170 million from the U S  Department of Defense to make chips that can work in outer space  and create smaller  faster ones with new materials 
The Bloomington  Minnesota based company was spun off from Cypress Semiconductor Corp  O CY  in 2017 to a group of U S  based investors  That year  SkyWater became part of a Defense Department program to ensure U S  military access to the domestic chip supply chain 
SkyWater executives said the Defense Department investment will allow it to add about 60 000 square feet of production space and 30 50 mostly high end engineers to its staff of 500 
The  80 million first phase of the project will help SkyWater make chips that work when exposed to high levels of radiation in spacecraft and medical devices  The U S  military also uses such chips to ensure electronics will remain functional in a nuclear conflict 
SkyWater said the funds also will enable it to use copper instead of aluminum to connect circuits on its chips  a change that eventually would lead to smaller chips than even its current 90 nanometer manufacturing technology allows 
Smaller  faster chips will help SkyWater become more competitive in commercial markets such as battery monitoring systems and wireless chargers for consumer gadgets  SkyWater President Thomas Sonderman said in an interview 
 The goal of the government really is to stand up capabilities that can be used commercially   Sonderman said   They want to have commercially viable entities that ultimately can provide the technologies they use for their applications  ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/minnesota-chip-maker-gets-up-to-170-million-from-us-defense-dept-2000542,2000542

192698,414214,CY,Exclusive  China backed fund in third bid for U S  to approve chip deal   sources,news,By Liana B  Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC  the China backed buyout fund that agreed to acquire Lattice Semiconductor Corp  O LSCC  in November for  1 3 billion  will submit the deal for U S  review for the third time  people familiar with the matter said on Sunday  The move comes as Canyon Bridge seeks to get the deal approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   a government panel which reviews corporate acquisitions for potential national security risks  The standard CFIUS review lasts for up to 75 days  Canyon Bridge submitted the deal for CFIUS review in January and refiled it in March  Refiling with CFIUS resets the clock and provides up to another 75 days for review   Canyon Bridge has been seeking to convince CFIUS that it will run Lattice without influence from the Chinese state  the sources said  Several U S  lawmakers expressed concerns about the deal after Reuters reported last year that Canyon Bridge is funded by cash originating from China s central government  and also has indirect links to its space program   Few deals have ever filed for CFIUS review three times  However  vacancies left in senior positions at several government agencies  almost five months after the inauguration of U S  President Donald Trump  have reduced CFIUS  capacity to review cases expeditiously  and are weighing on its decision making ability  the sources said  Canyon Bridge and Lattice are hoping that some key government appointments in the coming weeks  such as that of Heath Tarbert  who has been nominated as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development  will help resolve the impasse with CFIUS  one of the sources added   The sources asked not to be identified because the CFIUS review process is confidential  Portland  Oregon based Lattice declined to comment  while Canyon Bridge and a CFIUS spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Lattice shares closed at  6 86 on Friday  about 17 percent below the  8 30 per share in cash that Lattice shareholders stand to receive if the company s sale goes through  underscoring the uncertainty over the deal s prospects  Time is running out to complete the deal  Canyon Bridge s and Lattice s agreement has an Aug  1 deadline for the deal to close  and the acquisition cannot be completed without CFIUS clearance  The two companies would have to negotiate an extension to the deal deadline if the CFIUS review has not been completed by then  CFIUS DELAYS In a further sign of strains in the CFIUS system  U S  electronics maker Inseego Corp  O INSG  said earlier this month it had scrapped a  50 million deal  clinched last September  to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings  citing  delays and uncertainty in securing  CFIUS  approval   Like Canyon Bridge is about to do  TCL had refiled for CFIUS review twice  Proponents of U S  openness to foreign investment fret that CFIUS may become a tool of economic protectionism as a result of Trump s  America first  policy agenda  However  it is not yet clear what broader stance CFIUS will take towards Chinese acquirers under Trump  who has criticized Chinese trade practices but is also looking for Chinese cooperation in tackling North Korea s nuclear ambitions   There are some technical issues and some technical changes that we are working on legislative fixes for CFIUS  but I would say fundamentally we want to keep CFIUS as a national security review  and we want to deal with economic issues separately   U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at forum on China in Washington  D C  earlier this month   The semiconductor industry has long been seen as one of the most sensitive sectors from a U S  national security perspective  because it provides chips for a plethora of applications and devices  from smartphones and satellites to missiles and power grids   Lattice  whose chips are used in smartphones  laptops and televisions  has said it does not design or manufacture military grade products  and that its small sales to the military pertain to general purpose parts without advanced applications  It has also stressed that it does not have any factories that can be compromised  because all of its manufacturing is outsourced  To help launch Canyon Bridge as a U S  based fund  its founder Benjamin Chow last year tapped Cypress Semiconductor Corp  O CY  executive chairman Ray Bingham as his partner  Bingham now faces a shareholder campaign to remove him from the board of Cypress over potential conflicts of interest associated with his participation in Canyon Bridge  which he has denied  Another important test case for China s ability to acquire U S  semiconductor companies will be Xcerra Corp  O XCRA   China based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management agreed to acquire Xcerra Corp for  580 million in cash in April  Norwood  Massachusetts based Xcerra does not make chips like Lattice  but designs and manufactures equipment to test semiconductors and circuit boards  Were CFIUS to block the deal  it would illustrate how high the U S  regulatory bar is for Chinese acquirers ,2017-06-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-china-backed-fund-in-third-bid-for-u.s.-to-approve-chip-deal---sources-494217,494217
192699,414215,CY,Former Oracle board member dogged by links to China backed chip deal,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Michael Flaherty SAN FRANCISCO NEW YORK  Reuters    As the ultimate corporate insiders  board members are presented with plenty of opportunities to cash in on their sector knowledge and connections  The case of Ray Bingham  until recently Oracle Corp s  N ORCL  second highest paid board member and executive chairman at U S  chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp  O CY   shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire  The 71 year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China s central government last fall  In November  the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp  O LSCC   another U S  chip manufacturer  for  1 3 billion   a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham  But the chip deal is in doubt over U S  national security concerns  On Monday  Lattice and the buyout fund  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners  said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   The deal has also cost Bingham personally  His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham  recipient of a 2009 Financial Times  Outstanding Director  accolade  to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles  On Sunday  Bingham resigned from Cypress  board of directors after the company s founder and sixth largest shareholder   T J  Rodgers   sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board  Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge   Bingham  in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down  cited this contest as a distraction  It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle s board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge   Throughout the process  of joining Canyon Bridge   Ray conducted himself with transparency  He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress  board and outside legal counsel  who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join   a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters  Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment   Bingham s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge  regulatory filings show  Bingham was offered a  1 2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge  a  2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself  That is in addition to the  890 902 in 2016 he received from Oracle  making him the second highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison  and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth  900 000  as well as equity grants worth  4 5 million  The income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge  Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies  Flex Ltd  O FLEX  and TriNet Group Inc  N TNET   A COMPROMISING RELATIONSHIP  U S  board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds  This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships  This was the case with Bingham  who had done business with China born U S  citizen  Benjamin Chow  when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago  Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management  a Chinese state owned investment firm  which became Canyon Bridge s sole investor  according to Lattice s regulatory filings  For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal  click Chow approached Bingham last August  He believed that a U S  based buyout fund with a U S  partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer  Reuters reported in March   Canyon Bridge s Chinese state links  first revealed by Reuters in November  were a bone of contention at Oracle  Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge  according to Bingham s deposition in Rodgers  lawsuit  In response  Bingham decided to step down   Oracle expressed concern that Bingham s affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle s relationship with the United States government   Andre Bouchard  the judge presiding over Rodgers  lawsuit  said at Delaware s Court of Chancery earlier this month  citing Bingham s deposition   Oracle declined to comment  Chow  approached through Canyon Bridge  declined to comment  A MATTER OF INTEREST FOR THE BOARD Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016  taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham s name  a quote from him  and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3  according to regulatory and court filings  Bingham was even given signatory authority on a  30 million Canyon Bridge bank account   Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge  and had not let Cypress  board know  On Oct  20  Bingham contacted Cypress  outside counsel  Wilson Sonsini Goodrich   Rosati  to ask if he should tell Cypress  board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge  according to a regulatory filing from Cypress  Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time  according to Cypress  Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment   Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members  and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd   said Alan Seem  a corporate partner at law firm Shearman   Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case  On Nov  4  at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release  Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner  according to Cypress   At the same meeting   Morgan Stanley   N MS  gave a presentation to Cypress  board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names   Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer  most recently last September  but it turned both opportunities down  according to Cypress  Nonetheless  Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge   But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems  On Nov  7  Eric Benhamou  Cypress  lead independent director at the time  told another director that Bingham s role with Canyon Bridge was  ripe for conflicts  of  interest   according to a Cypress regulatory filing  In December  Cypress  board amended the company s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target  then any conflicted director would recuse themselves

193396,414912,CY,Facebook   4 Other Stocks With Solid Relative Price Strength,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of one to three months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price

193430,414946,CY,This Semiconductor Looks Technically Interesting,opinion,"My bullish scan of stocks has been dominated by technology names for more than a month and with Wednesday s market pullback  that list has dwindled to just 7 names  Six of which are in the technology space and Cypress Semiconductor  NASDAQ CY  looks particularly interesting 
The chart below shows how Cypress Semiconductor fell from a high in March of 2015 to a low this past February  Since then  it s had an uphill run  crossing its 50 day SMA in March followed by its 200 day SMA in May  At the start of June  CY made a peak near a 50  retracement of the move lower  And that happened just as the chart printed a Golden Cross  the 50 day SMA crossing up through the 200 day SMA   The pullback found support at the 200 day SMA  then reversed higher 

It made another new high as it continued the reversal off of the bottom  July 29 saw a shooting star candle mark a top and a reversal back to the rising 50 day SMA    then after some consolidation  a push back to that top  Through Wednesday  it has continued to push higher  The Measured Move out of the recent consolidation suggests a target to 13 50  Momentum supports continued upside with the RSI in the bull zone and rising while the MACD is crossing up  As it pushes higher  there have been aggressive call buyers at the September 13 strike as well 
It may be time to take a closer look at this semiconductor play ",2016-08-31,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-semiconductor-looks-technically-interesting-200151166,200151166
