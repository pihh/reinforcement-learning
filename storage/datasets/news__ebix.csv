11455,232970,EBIX,3 Stocks Set To Soar On New Analyst Coverage,opinion,Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might result in misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued   Thus  initiation of coverage by analysts offers critical information on a stock which is of great value to investors Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it However  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Analyst Coverage   Price MovementInterestingly  the price movement is generally a function of the recommendations from the new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here

11470,232985,EBIX,4 Stocks To Watch  AA  ACIA  LCI  WB,opinion,"It was an interesting day for the market on Monday  It was a nice morning  a pullback late in the day  but still  it was a good  positive day  A lot of stocks that we follow did well  so let s take a look at some of them 
Alcoa Inc   NYSE AA  had an earnings report that was pretty good after hours  50  above estimates  More importantly  the line of resistance goes back a year  AA was up 32 cents to 10 14  or 3 26   on 37 million shares 
For me  the next target has to be at 11 1 2  then 12 3 4 13  but ultimately I think it could be a 14 15 dollar stock  Watch on Tuesday to see if there is a follow through on this swing trade 
Acacia Communications Inc  NASDAQ ACIA  was up 4 92 to 48 87  or 1   on 1 9 million shares  Since the low on June 27  around Brexit  it got down to 32 92  and on Monday  the high was at 49 39  Ten dollars  or more than 50  since Brexit 
More importantly  the prior high and current resistance low was taken out on Monday  The current consolidation could lead to even higher levels  My next target is 54 
Lannett Com  NYSE LCI  had a big day on Monday  It broke through the declining topsline and out of a consolidation  jumping 3 13 to 27 72  or 12 7   on 2 million shares  It ran up to resistance near the 27 3 4 range  reaching 28 10  If it extends  the next level of resistance comes in around the gap at 32 which is the next target  It has 13 5 days to cover 
Weibo Corp  NASDAQ WB  is doing great  It continues to extend  but it s up near resistance  After the pullback on Friday  it had an inside day  but a positive one  The target is 38 00  WB was up 96 cents to 13 90  or 3   on 1 1 million shares and has 1 68 days to cover

11471,232986,EBIX,4 Stocks To Watch  EBIX  EXEL  FIVN  MBLY,opinion,"It looked like a turn around Tuesday as the markets spiked to the upside  and then they came down all afternoon  but still finished positive  taking back a huge chunk of their gains  Let s take a look at chart patterns and see how some of these stocks are doing 
Ebix Inc  NASDAQ EBIX  broke out of a wedge on Tuesday to new  all time highs  up 2 43 to 58 21  or 4 4   on 209 559 shares traded  It has 29 days to cover  You may see a squeeze to mid channel to the mid 60 range on this one 
Exelixis Inc  NASDAQ EXEL  ran back up to retest the highs on Tuesday  making a nominal new high by a couple cents  up 17 cents to 11 51  or 1 5   on 5 million shares traded  The next targets are nearly 13  15 and 17  It has 8 2 days to cover in a sharply rising channel 
Five9 Inc  NASDAQ FIVN   also in a sharply rising channel long term on the daily chart  also broke through an ascending wedge  It broke out two days ago  and followed through Monday and Tuesday  up 62 cents to 14 82  or 4 4   on 909 468 shares traded  The targets are 15 1 2 3 4  and then 18  It has 2 82 days to cover

11483,232998,EBIX,CACI Strengthens DoD Ties With  37 Million Contract ,opinion,"CACI International Inc    NYSE CACI    a defense and intelligence information technology company based in Arlington  VA  recently announced that it was awarded a prime contract worth  37 million  The company will continue to provide its support to the Defense Agencies Initiative  DAI  Global Model federal financial management and accounting solution  for the next three years 
The Department of Defense s  DoD  DAI is a system which provides budget  finance  and accounting processes of most DoD agencies  CACI s Business System offers in depth expertise and solutions in support of the DAI  Under this contract  CACI will provide solutions to more than 25 000 users across multiple defense agencies 
The Deal
Per this contract  CACI will assist the DoD in financial management and accounting systems and processes across various agencies  This will help customers get real time visibility into transactions  improve services and processes  and save time and cost 
The company continues to focus on developing industry leading experience and expertise to help customers modernize and improve their financial systems  The company s Business System will help DoD decision makers to serve and equip the country s military men and women 
Within the purview of the current contract  financial services provided by the company will enable the DoD to ensure a high level of accuracy and overcome challenges that come its way  In recent years  CACI has clinched a number of government contracts that have widened its footprint in the industry  These contracts have cemented its position as one of the most reliable security services firms in the world CACI INTL A Price
   CACI s Achievements
CACI International has a large pipeline of new projects and continues to win deals at regular intervals  These back to back contract wins are the key catalysts driving the company  Furthermore  having the government as a big client lends stability to the business and moderates fluctuations in revenue  Although the government generally has a lengthy approval process  the project earns money for a number of years after it is approved 
Moreover  government contracts improve the visibility of future revenue streams  The company has been doing very well with a record level of awards  which reflect its disciplined business development actions  consistent operational excellence and high customer satisfaction 
Going forward  the company continues to execute its strategy of winning high value contracts  delivering excellence to its customers and deploying its capital for growth  The company s robust business model is expected to help it grow and achieve newer heights 
However  CACI International generates revenue from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process  These contracts contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate the contract for convenience  A decision to terminate contracts on an ongoing basis for convenience is likely to result in significant revenue shortfalls for the company

11525,233040,EBIX,EBIX  Exiting A Goldman Sachs Acquisition,opinion,Ebix Inc has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Goldman Sachs for  20 share  After the news broke  May 1  2013   I recommended members to sell all EBIX stock and sold my position at  20 50 share We were able to sell the shares at prices ABOVE the acquisition price for two reasons The market believes a new suitor will emerge  and 44  of EBIX outstanding shares were shorted  so there is going to be a lot of churn above the acquisition price  as the scramble to buy increasingly small float to cover ensuesOpportunistic InvestmentEbix as a company has been a fast grower in the recent years through acquisitions and has generated tremendous amounts of cash flow  However  it has had no shortage of skeptics  I recommended EBIX on Mar 15 and purchased the stock on Mar 18  2013 at an average cost of  15 14 share  which was a very good value  As recently as February  the stock was selling for  19  share  On Feb 21  there was an article in Seeking Alpha claiming accounting irregularities at the company causing the stock to plunge to the  13 share level  It took me some time to go through the accusations and the financial statements of the company at the end of which I concluded that the article made false and misleading claims to support their short positions  and the author has actually offered us an incredible short term opportunity on a platter So we bought and profited In the end  due diligence by Goldman Sachs  for this acquisition  should command more credibility than that by anonymous poster on Seeking Alpha going by the moniker  Gotham Research  with no known track record What is Next for the Company  and EBIX Stock The company has 45 days to solicit other bids and it is entirely possible that a better offer will come along  This deal does not do justice to the real value of the company although I will accept that the complexity of the business structure may be a drag on the stock price anyway  Many value investors wait to lock in the last drop of return from a position  but normally I prefer to take the big gains upfront and exit  even if I leave a little bit on the table  I operate from a very simple truth The risk in a stock is more when the price is high and less when the price is low Besides  a 34  return in 44 days is better than 45  return in 90 days as long as capital can be redeployed At this time I expect the stock to settle down below  20 share in the next few days  after which it is anybody s guess   in this stock today is pure speculation for new bids to materialize and I do not wish to speculate  PS  I waited for the buyout price to improve in case of American Greetings  but the particulars of the deal were different ,2013-05-02,Shailesh Kumar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebix:-exiting-a-goldman-sachs-acquisition-165300,165300

Ebix  NASDAQ EBIX  has a very attractive pattern  I like the way this looks  It was up 81 cents to 30 72  or 2 7   on 569 200 shares traded  on Wednesday  After the stock based out and broke out with a breakaway gap on big volume  it formed a flag  and then a falling wedge  It had four waves up  and the fifth one is underway  The extension is as high as 33 33 1 2 
California Resources  NYSE CRC  is a fairly new  junior oil issue  and on Wednesday it was up 58 cents to 7 08  or 8 9   on 6 million shares  After it came down with all the other oil stocks from late November through February  it had gone from a low of 3 3 4 to over 7 00 at 7 70  After the little pullback  it snapped back from 6 38 to 7 13  and closed at 7 08  A nickel off the high  but a nice close  The next target is 9 1 4 
Microvision  NASDAQ MVIS  continues to thrust  and has very nice movement technically  It s taken this stock out of a wedging pattern  consolidated  and then exploded  It reached as high as 4 23 before pulling back and closing at 3 99  up 46 cents  or 13   on 8 5 million shares on Wednesday  The next target is around 5 00  if it can get there  It may pull back at any point  having spiked up for 9 of the last 10 days  It s a little long in the tooth short term  We ll have to see if there s any extension on it  Be careful 
Retrophin  NASDAQ RTRX  had a big pop on Wednesday  up 5 41 to 20 17  or 37   on 5 4 million shares  It had a nice reversal on Tuesday off of the low down around 13 00  closing at 15 00  On Wednesday  it gapped and opened sharply higher at 19 86  got down to 18 40  but closed at resistance going away  If it gets through there  the next target is at 24 1 2

Esperion  NASDAQ ESPR  had a nice day on Tuesday  up 1 30 to 105 60  or 1 25   on nearly a half million shares traded  It has a very long  beautiful coil  but now it s time to see a break out  A swing was issued  which may be a little participatory  If it takes out that coil  look for it to get to 115 ish  and then make a potential move mid range to around 135 00 
Exelixis Inc   NASDAQ EXEL  had a really nice session  up 28 cents  or 8 24   on 5 4 million shares  It went from 3 35 to 3 76  pulled back to 3 26  and closed at 3 68  It did break out after popping and pulling back  This should be a swing trade  The target is going to be close to 5 00 
Opko Health Inc   NYSE OPK  surged on Tuesday  If it does what I think it can  look at the long  sharp up move  then a 3 month  coiling consolidation  and on Tuesday it spike 51 cents to 14 81  or 3 6   on 3 5 million shares  That s the biggest volume on an up day in about a month and a half  This stock could get going  Watch the 15 15 1 4 range  If it gets through that it will fly to 17 1 2 midrange  and then all the way up to 21 22

5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength to Buy

An investor always seeks a win win strategy  but in the current highly volatile market  it is difficult for even an ardent investor to come up with a foolproof approach  When it comes to stock investing  people generally look for beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this also bears the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall prey to value trap if fails to identify the hidden weakness in the selected stock 

So  how about looking for the current winners that have the potential to gain further
