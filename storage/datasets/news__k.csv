143349,364864,K,Is Kellogg a Buy ,news,"Shares of Kellogg  NYSE K  fell 20  between the beginning of 2017 and the end of 2018 as consumers transitioned away from cereal products  During 2019  Kellogg s share price increased 18 8  with new CEO Steven Cahillane at the helm  driving efficiency and expanding profitable segments 
What does 2020 look like for this consumer staples product manufacturer  Three factors should renew investors  outlook on Kellogg  creating a compelling opportunity for establishing a long term position 

An increased focus on snack products
During the first  second  and third quarters of 2019  cereal sales in North America    Kellogg s largest geographic segment    decreased 4   3   and 5   respectively  The decline in cereal sales has forced Kellogg to increase its concentration around snacks  divesting underperforming brands 
Kellogg decided to pull away from sweets and cookies in July 2019  selling the Keebler brand for  1 3 billion to Italian food manufacturer Ferrero SpA  Offloading the Keebler brand for cash allows Kellogg to pay down its total debt of  8 37 billion and shift the portfolio of products toward stronger growth prospects  
Kellogg s five power brands    Pop Tarts  RXBAR  Pringles  Rice Krispies Treats  and Cheez It    account for 75  of Kellogg s snack sales  according to Cahillane  He said the Cheez It brand is driving growth for the U S  crackers segment with a  1 billion value  Kellogg states that the new Cheez It Snap d crisps are selling at peak capacity  as boxes are flying off the shelves just as fast as retailers can stock them  Mordor Intelligence expects growth in snacking products to continue globally  with a projected 5 3  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  between 2019 and 2024   
In combination with an increased focus on snacking  Kellogg s frozen foods segment is growing as the expansion of the meatless product portfolio is under way from the Morningstar Farms brand 
A meatless opportunity
Kellogg s Morningstar Farms brand sells the No  1 veggie burger in the United States  Selling meatless products such as bacon and chicken nuggets has been fueling growth for Kroger  as third quarter earnings showed an 11  year over year increase 
Competing against large meatless companies such as Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  and Impossible Foods  Kellogg has announced plans to release a meatless burger line of products called  Incogmeato   which will be made from soy  similar to the Impossible Burger  Kellogg announced that the product line will hit refrigerated shelves in 2020  
During a Natural Products Expo in March 2019  Morningstar Farms announced a plan for the brand s entire portfolio to be 100  vegan by 2021  By making this conversion  Kellogg will expand its plant based portfolio into nuggets  burger patties  and tenders  
Growth in emerging markets
Emerging markets have delivered growth for Kellogg  specifically in the Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Africa  AMEA  geographic segment  which reported sales growth of 8  during the recent third quarter on a currency neutral basis  The AMEA segment made up  1 35 billion year to date organic net sales for fiscal 2019  accounting for 15  of net sales for Kellogg  Growth in emerging markets is led by noodles  snacks  and cereal products  Year over year currency neutral growth for the geographic segment was 32 4  
A joint venture in May 2015 between Kellogg and Tolaram Africa Foods to acquire Multipro  a leading distributor of a variety of food products in Nigeria and Ghana  gave Kellogg controlling ownership of 51   Additionally  Kellogg invested  420 million in Tolaram Africa Foods in May 2018 to expand the product offerings  fueling growth in the region  This acquisition is clearly becoming a success for Kellogg  as the Multipro ownership brought in  271 million organic net sales year to date in fiscal 2019 to the AMEA segment   
A Foolish conclusion
Kellogg s earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  margin is expected to continue to improve as long as Kellogg can meet the fiscal 2019 expectation of  1 81 billion EBIT  giving Kellogg an EBIT margin of 13 6     3 4 percentage points higher than it was in fiscal 2016  The net income margin is expected to close fiscal 2019 at 8 2   and MarketScreener estimates Kellogg at a net income margin of 10 6  in 2021    showing higher profitability going forward  
The forward price to earnings ratio of 17 8 leaves shares of Kellogg at a decent value in addition to paying a forward dividend yield of 3 2   As Cahillane continues to pull away from underperforming brands and invest in power brands such as Cheez It and Pringles  Kellogg has the potential for continued growth in the snack and meatless segments  in addition to an increased focus on emerging markets    making Kellogg a buy for long term investors ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxl7,2069443

143351,364866,K,Earnings Preview  Kellogg  K  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Kellogg  K  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 20 billion  down 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 5  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kellogg 
For Kellogg  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kellogg will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kellogg would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  13 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kellogg doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-kellogg-k-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200503317,200503317

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kellogg shares have added about 0 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 2  
What s Next for Kellogg 
While Kellogg has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kellogg was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

143353,364868,K,Why Kellogg Shares Declined 8  Despite Beating Estimates,news,"What happened
Shares of Kellogg Company  NYSE K   primarily a producer of snacks and convenience food with a long list of well known brands  dropped nearly 9  early Thursday morning despite beating analysts  fourth quarter estimates 
So what
Sales declined 2 8  during the fourth quarter compared to the prior year  to  3 22 billion  but that result managed to top analysts  estimates calling for  3 18 billion  Adjusted earnings per share checked in at  0 91  again beating analysts  estimates calling for  0 86 per share  One factor for investors to note was the negative impact on net sales from Kellogg s divested businesses  On an organic basis  net sales increased by 2 7  during the fourth quarter  

A likely reason that the stock is down today is the company s forward guidance  Management expects full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to decline 3  to 4  as the business divestitures won t immediately be offset by its core business growth  Analysts  full year 2020 estimates would have pegged Kellogg s adjusted earnings per share to grow roughly 3 6     a fairly large disconnect  
Now what
The basic idea behind divesting non core businesses was so that Kellogg could focus on its core brands  marketing  and innovation  While fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share declined because core brands couldn t offset the divestitures in the near term  management will need to prove that its focus on core brands can more than offset that loss  Kellogg has not only taken steps to improve its focus on core brands    a key part in succeeding in the a competitive consumer discretionary industry    but it has started to optimize its supply chain distribution and prioritize debt reduction  However  those strategic moves will take time and patience to bear fruit ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps1gj,2078166

Kellogg  A bird s eye view of the numbers

Data source  Kellogg  N A Not applicable 
Highlights from the quarter


The reported sales decline of 3  stemmed from a negative impact of 6 percentage points related to Kellogg s divestiture of several noncore businesses last year in the categories of fruit snacks  ice cream cones  cookies  and pie crusts  But organic revenue  i e   reported revenue adjusted for acquisitions  divestitures  and foreign currency translation  improved by 3  against the prior year quarter 
Kellogg North America  the company s largest segment  posted an organic sales increase of 1 3  to  1 9 billion  led by snacks and double digit growth in plant based meat alternative MorningStar Farms  The company reported that a trend of declining cereal sales in this segment moderated during the quarter 
The European segment enjoyed an advance of 3  in organic revenue to  527 million  Results were also driven by snack consumption  and in particular  momentum in the Pringles brand 
Organic revenue expansion in the Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Africa region jumped by 8 3  to  569 million  largely on the strength of Pringles and noodles sales in Africa  Kellogg s smallest segment  Latin America  realized a slight 0 4  improvement in organic growth  to  235 million 
Operating margin improved by 240 basis points to 11 2   
The difference between net earnings seen in the table above is due to one time charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2018  which produced a net loss that quarter  On an adjusted basis  Q4 2019 earnings per share of  0 91 were flat against Q4 2018  as a loss of earnings from the divested business lines offset other positive earnings factors in the current quarter 

The 2020 forecast  A problematic outlook
Alongside earnings  Kellogg presented its 2020 guidance  forecasting an organic revenue increase of 1  to 2  for the full year against 2019  But the consumer staples multinational advised investors to expect a currency neutral decline in adjusted operating profit of 4  in the current year  and a decline in diluted EPS between 3  and 4  
The projected profit bleed is due to the impact of Kellogg s noncore brand dispositions  That the departed businesses would leave such a significant dent in earnings seems to have caught investors by surprise  The decision to exit products in categories like ice cream cones and cookies will help the company reap faster growth in its core lines of snacks and cereals over the long term  But for the present  selling off significant assets has dampened earnings prospects for the next several quarters 
Where will Kellogg s stock go from here  The opportunities for material earnings surprises are limited due to the company s expectation of extremely mild top line growth in 2020  Of course  cost cutting or a strategic acquisition or two could act as share price catalysts during the year  Overall  however  shareholders may do well to keep near term expectations for Kellogg s financial and market performance in check ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps3x9,2078371

businesses  net sales and profit And now  I ll turn it over to Steve Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John and good morning  everyone  2019 is now in the books and we re pleased with the progress we made  We stayed on strategy and on plan all year long and we did what we said we would do right through Q4  And this was in spite of significant changes in investments made throughout the year  all aimed at building a solid foundation for steady  dependable financial delivery  The primary goal of 2019 was to return to organic net sales growth and we did that In fact  Slide number 5 shows that we sustained our accelerated growth right through the fourth quarter  For the quarter and for the full year  this was our best organic net sales growth in several years  and this return to organic net sales growth is the strongest evidence that our Deploy for Growth strategy is working  We grew in all four quarters with full year growth in all four regions  We utilized revenue growth management to restore positive price realization in all regions  and we improved our end market performance in key countries and categories Even as we were delivering on our 2019 plans  we were busy driving important changes  intended to build a foundation for the future  Some of these changes and investments are shown on Slide number 6  We significantly restructured our organization in 2019  starting with North America at the beginning of the year  followed by corporate and then the international regions  With reduced layers and fewer business unit silos  we can now assess resource allocation more holistically and make faster decisions  From a portfolio standpoint  we divested four businesses in a single transaction  This divestiture improves our portfolio s underlying growth rate and its profit margins  while enabling our organization to sharpen its focus on our core businesses  We also enhanced our financial flexibility by using the divestiture proceeds to pay down  1 billion of debt And from an investment standpoint  we continue to expand and build scale in emerging markets  In addition to growing our existing businesses  we rapidly built up distribution of Kellogg noodles in Africa  We established local production of Pringles for the first time in Africa and Latin America  as well as noodles in Egypt and South Africa  and we shifted production of cereal in Brazil to a new  more efficient facility  There was some upfront capital and cost related to these moves  but they will facilitate profitable growth well into the future All of these business and portfolio realignment actions were large and important  and they contribute greatly to the foundation we are building  It s also important that we delivered the results that we had guided to  Amit will go into more detail in a moment  but I want to emphasize that our return to dependability starts with doing what we said we do and this includes delivering on our financial guidance We plan to sustain this dependable performance in 2020  including a more balanced financial delivery  Again  Amit will walk you through the specifics in just a moment  but the key elements of this balanced plan are depicted on Slide number 7  First  we plan to continue to grow our net sales organically in 2020 in the 1  to 2  range that we think is sustainable  It should feature a little more balance between volume and price mix  and again  it should be broad based and it should be led by our biggest  most differentiated brands Second  we plan to improve our underlying profitability  swinging to operating profit growth excluding the divestiture impact  We ll continue to gradually improve our gross profit margin as we continue to reutilize revenue growth management  generate productivity savings in our supply chain  and complete the restoration of on the go margins  We ll also continue to manage our overhead tightly Third  we will increase our investment behind our brands  Some of this increase is related to specific pullbacks we had to do in the first half of 2019  such as when we paused RX advertising during its supplier related recall and paused investment in US cereal as we harmonized pack sizes  And most of the increase is around new opportunities  For example  our launch of Incogmeato ready to cook meat alternatives  and our Pringles and Pop Tarts commercials during the Super Bowl In US cereal  we re not just lapping the harmonization related pullbacks  we are going all in on a comprehensive plan  And internationally  there are other promising product launches and expansions  These are all unique opportunities and we are reinvesting the profit of a 53rd week this year to help offset this increase in investment  And finally  we ll continue to enhance our financial flexibility  not only by improving our cash flow  but also by using that cash flow after dividends for paying down debt  In short  we re planning for a more balanced delivery with prudent forecasts  as we build a foundation for sustainable growth So with that  let me turn it over to Amit  who will take you through our financial results and outlook in more detail  Amit Amit Banati    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Steve and good morning  everyone  Our quarter four and full year 2019 results are summarized on Slide number 9  We finished 2019 with a quarter four that again featured sequential acceleration in organic net sales growth and sequential improvement in gross profit margin  It also featured increased investment in A P and effective overhead management Excluding the year on year impacts of the divestiture  we delivered another quarter of operating profit growth and we delivered good cash flow  All in  it was a solid finish to the year  The results were obviously affected by the divestiture which closed at the end of July  The absence of these businesses results in quarter four had a negative impact on reported net sales and it more than offset our base business growth in operating profit and earnings per share  We ll go into more detail on net sales and operating profit in a moment Our earnings per share finished in line with the year ago fourth quarter  as the negative impact of the divestiture was offset by base business profit growth and favorability in some items below operating profit  Interest expense decreased in quarter four as expected  owing to using divestiture proceeds to pay down debt  Other income in quarter four was similar to recent quarters in absolute dollars  but year on year  it was very favorable because of lapping the impact of the quarter four 2018 soon in financial markets  which impacted our insurance investments Our effective tax rate benefited from a modest tax benefit  Our cash flow was also affected by the divestiture  specifically by almost  500 million  As discussed previously  this was not just the absence of the divested businesses profits  this impact also included upfront costs and working capital timing differences  as well as most significantly taxes on the divestiture proceeds  Remember  the proceeds are not in the cash flow  but the taxes  some  255 million are included in the cash flow  Excluding this divestiture impact  our base business cash flow was quite stable It s important to note that we finished 2019 on our guidance for each of the four guided metrics  whose only changed during the year had been to incorporate the divestiture  As Steve mentioned  we are aiming for improved predictability and dependability  and we demonstrated that in 2019 even despite reorganizations  investment shifts and some near term macroeconomic challenges  particularly in the second half Let s now go into more detail  We ll start at the top of the P L with net sales growth on Slide number 10  We continue to post strong organic net sales growth coming in at 2 7  in the quarter and bringing our full year growth to 1 9   the high end of our guidance range  Once again  all four regions grew net sales organically in quarter four  Importantly  we continued to realize price reflecting revenue growth management actions and we saw in quarter four  a much better balance between price mix and volume  both of which grew more than 1  year on year Among our categories globally  snacks again led the organic net sales growth in quarter four  increasing in all four regions  Frozen foods had its best quarter of growth of the year and noodles and other products continued to post solid growth  Cereal sales were flat in the quarter on continued international growth and a meaningful moderation in North America s decline  In its first full quarter out of our results  the divestiture negatively impacted net sales growth by about 5 5   For the full year  its impact was directly offset by the positive acquisition impact of consolidating Multipro  our West Africa distributor  which anniversaried back in quarter two  Lastly  after running negative all year  currency translation was neutral in the fourth quarter  It finished the year as a negative 1 7  impact Now  let s turn to our gross profit margin on Slide number 11  Our goal this year was to sequentially improve gross profit margin performance every quarter  and that is exactly how it played out  Looking at the buckets we have been using to explain this improvement  let s start with the mechanical impact of acquisitions and divestitures  The consolidation of Multipro created a headwind until it anniversaried during quarter two  and then the divestiture created a small tailwind beginning in quarter three  No surprises here  and we ll have this divestiture tailwind for two more full quarters as well as a month in quarter three Next  the ongoing bucket remained modestly negative  This is our input costs net of any productivity and savings  There was no major changes in our underlying cost inflation rate  though we had expected to see at least a little moderation which didn t materialize  And while cost inflation should moderate in the aggregate during 2020  there are some inputs that has sugar  potatoes and various types of packaging that have done more inflationary And lastly  there is the growth related bucket  which continued to moderate during quarter four as we had anticipated  We still had some negative country and category mix shifts and we did have start up costs on new plants  However  we were able to offset much of this with price realization and sequential restoration of margins on our on the go pack formats  We expect this bucket to continue to get less negative over the course of 2020  as we get past plant  Phonetic  start ups and other costs  and as productivity programs gain traction On SG A expense  we continue to realize benefits related to organizational restructurings getting back to early in the year  Partially offsetting this overhead favorability in quarter four was an increase in A P investment  Not only was some of this increase related to shifts from prior quarters  but we also elected to add investment during the quarter  The result of our good organic net sales growth  moderating gross margin decline and year on year decrease in overhead was another quarter of growth in operating profit before the impact of the divestiture So to wrap up 2019 s financial results  let s turn to Slide number 12  We returned to organic net sales growth  which was our top financial priority  and it s important to see that we grew in all regions and across most of our important brands and categories  We made steady sequential improvement in gross profit margin performance each quarter as planned  and we ll continue to make progress in this important area  We invested in the future  We invested in capacity  primarily in fast growing emerging markets  but also for certain foods and pack formats in developed markets We invested in innovation  and while our brand building levels were lower in the quarters that lapped 2018 s large infusion of incremental investment  we supported our key brands all year  increasing A P year on year in the fourth quarter  We delivered on our guidance for net sales  operating profit  earnings per share and cash flow  and we strengthened our balance sheet using the proceeds of the divestiture to pay down debt  This gives us added financial flexibility Now  let s turn to 2020 with our initial guidance shown on Slide number 13  As Steve mentioned  we believe we have a prudent outlook that delivers balanced financial results  while providing the flexibility we need to step up investment behind some specific opportunities and to contend with some less favorable macro environments  We expect organic net sales growth to continue to run in the 1  to 2  range Some businesses will do better than they did in 2019  while some will lap unusually strong performances of 2019 and others like Brazil and Nigeria will continue to face challenging macro conditions in the near term  On the whole  this growth rate represents solid sustainable performance  Excluded from the organic growth of course is the impact of the divestiture  The absence of those divested businesses negatively impacts net sales by about 4 percentage points in 2020  The organic growth also excludes the benefit of a 53rd week at the end of 2020  which based on prior experience  typically amounts to about 1 5 percentage points Currency neutral adjusted operating profit is expected to decline by about 4  as the absence of the divested businesses has a mechanical impact of approximately negative 6   more than offsetting a return to operating profit growth for our base business  This base business growth includes a sizable increase in investment in brands and initiatives  which is only partially covered by the benefit of a 53rd week  This projected underlying growth in operating profit  even with the increased investment  is a big positive swing from 2019 and right in line with our plan for steady  gradual improvement  Currency neutral adjusted EPS is expected to decline by 3  to 4   Again  growth in the base business is more than offset by the roughly 5  negative impact of the divestiture  after considering the divestiture s full year benefit on interest expense from using the proceeds to pay down debt last year Below the operating profit line  the various items are fairly mixed  Interest expense will be lower because of a full year of debt reduced by the divestiture proceeds  And other income will be higher because of the positive impact on pension assets of last year s strong financial markets  though partially offset by our recent decision to reduce risk in our pension portfolio and decrease our expected return on assets On the other hand  our effective tax rate will be higher  mainly due to lapping 2019 s discrete benefit  and our average shares outstanding will likely drift higher as we prioritize debt reduction over share repurchases  And finally  cash flow should increase strongly to roughly  900 million to  1 billion  This is close to our base business    base businesses normal run rate  even less  even after the absence of our divested businesses cash flow There are a couple of factors that definitely alter the shape of our quarters this year  The first is the year on year impact of the divestiture  in other words  the impact of the absence of the divested businesses net sales and operating profit  This is shown on Slide number 14  Remember  the divestiture had seven months of impact in 2020 as opposed to only five months in 2019  And it also includes the highly seasonal Girl Scouts business which happens almost entirely in the first quarter of the year  That s why you ll see a much larger year on year impact in quarter one Then the second quarter should be similar to what we saw in quarter four  and quarter three only has four weeks of impact as the divestiture lapse at the end of July  The second factor to consider is timing of investment  As mentioned  we are increasing investment meaningfully in 2020  even reinvesting the extra profit from our 53rd week to help fund it  There are some good reasons why the bulk of this year on year impact is heavily weighted to the first two quarters First  there are some businesses that are lapping deliberate pullbacks  For example  US cereal had its pullback last year in quarter one and quarter two  during the pack size harmonization  RX had to pull back during the first half following its supplier related recall  Second  there is simple calendar timing  for instance  Pringles and Pop Tarts Super Bowl ads obviously had to be in quarter one  And our initial launch of Incogmeato meat alternatives is scheduled for late quarter one and early quarter two  So the divestiture impact and the investment increases are first half weighted  And then there is the 53rd week  which only benefits quarter four So to wrap up our financial section  we feel good about our improved financial results in 2019 and we enter 2020 in solid financial condition and with plans for continued gradual improvement in 2020  Our goal is steady dependable financial delivery and we are clearly on the right track And with that  let me turn it back to Steve for a review of each of our major businesses Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Amit  Let s begin with North America in Slide number 16  North America continued to show improvement in Q4  completing a year of progress amid tremendous change  both to our portfolio and to our organizational structure  On the face of the P L  the results get a little drowned out by the absence of our recently divested business  The impact of the divestiture was about 9 percentage points on net sales  We grew sales organically in North America by more than 1  in the fourth quarter and slightly for the full year  Both time periods represented North America s best organic net sales growth performance since 2012 It all starts with consumption  and you can see on the slide that we improved consumption growth significantly in 2019 right through the fourth quarter  This growth was across most of our categories  It was led by our biggest most differentiated brands and it reflected gains in our core product lines  as well as incremental innovation  We also grew net sales organically in our away from home channels in both the quarter and full year aided by good consumption growth across most of our key categories in the food service and convenience channels From a profit standpoint  results are better than they look  as the mechanical impact of the absence of our divested businesses more than offset operating profit growth in our base business in quarter four  And this underlying profit growth included a strong year on year increase in A P  So even as we worked to restore top line growth in North America  we continue to make progress in improving our underlying profitability and investing for the future Now let s discuss each major category in a little more detail  We will start with snacks  our largest category in North America on Slide number 17  As you can see  we recorded another quarter of solid organic net sales growth in this business  And just as it has been all year  it was driven by consumption in each of our three categories  This was led by the power brands that we revitalized in 2018  but was also driven by our most successful class of innovation launches in many years  and other brands that we began to revitalize in 2019 In crackers  we continued to outpace the category on the strength of Cheez It  whose double digit growth this year came equally from the core line up and from this year s sensational innovation platform  Snap d  Importantly  we also returned the Club cracker brand to growth as well  We expect to continue to grow in crackers in 2020  Yes  comparisons will be tougher  but we have strong commercial plans and we ll also have added capacity for supply constrained Snap d Pringles continued to grow consumption in the fourth quarter despite lapping a notably strong year ago performance  Our new Wavy line has been incremental and we also continue to grow our on the go pack formats  including immediate consumption and multi packs  We have strong plans for this brand in 2020 and we got them kicked off last weekend with our new ad during the Super Bowl  So even with a recent price increase to cover sharply rising potato and packaging costs  we are confident we can continue to grow Pringles Finally  in portable wholesome snacks  we had another good year and quarter  Rice Krispies Treats is a powerhouse brand whose growth accelerated in 2019 from    both from core growth and innovation  Pop Tarts bounced back to growth in 2019 and we extended our brand revitalization efforts to include Nutri Grain  which also grew consumption  So North America snacks is in good position to sustain its growth Let s now turn to cereal in Slide number 18  As you can see  our net sales declines moderated meaningfully in the fourth quarter as we returned to full commercial activity  We ve talked previously about our decision to take a big bang approach to our pack size harmonization last year as opposed to a more gradual less disruptive approach  We do not regret it  Our shelf is immensely more shoppable and we can cross promote brands that we couldn t previously While it meant not being able to fire on all cylinders for a couple of quarters  it s behind us  In the fourth quarter  we made our best progress yet toward stabilizing this business  In the quarter  our consumption declined by less than 1   compared to our full year consumption being down almost 3   That s a significant moderation  We again grew share in the taste fun segment with consumption and share growth accelerating behind Frosted Flakes and its Mission Tiger campaign  as well as growth in brands like Froot Loops  Corn Pops  and Krave  where we ramped up our commercial activity In health and wellness  our new Special K campaign and positioning went on air late in the third quarter and we saw the brand s declines moderate further in the fourth quarter  helping slower declines in this segment overall  Our all family segment is the one where we haven t yet made progress  This is principally due to Mini Wheats  which not only lapped good growth in the year ago third and fourth quarters  but we didn t fully return to advertising inactivity behind that brand in quarter four choosing instead to ensure our recent production shifts were on solid footing We expect that brand s performance to improve in 2020  as we return to full support  I recognize we talk a lot about our snacks  frozen foods  and emerging markets businesses  and for good reason  but we never lose sight of the fact that cereal is incredibly important to us and it is our legacy In 2020  we ll be executing a full year of commercial activity  investing behind a plan that we feel very good about  It s a plan that includes more innovation  more brand building  and more exciting in store activity  I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to perform much better in 2020  Make no mistake  with respect to cereal  we are in it to win it Let s complete our North America discussion with frozen foods on Slide number 19  It was another quarter of good performance  MorningStar Farms  our leading brand of frozen plant based meat alternatives  built on its accelerated growth  Consumption in the fourth quarter increased again at a double digit rate  again  gaining share  Impressively  this accelerated consumption and share growth has been driven across product segments as you can see on the slide Clearly  the breadth of our product line  along with strong brand communication is working and we re expanding distribution  And as we discussed  we ll enter the ready to cook category late in first quarter 2020 with the MorningStar Incogmeato line  We should also note the growth we ve generated in food service in K 12 schools  So obviously  we re excited about our MorningStar Farms business In frozen breakfast  our core Eggo from the griddle business  which encompasses frozen waffles  pancakes and French toast  grew consumption slightly year on year in the quarter and by almost 2  for the full year  That growth has been led by innovation in the French toast and pancake segments  as well as sustained momentum for Eggo s premium Thick   Fluffy Waffles sub line  which grew by nearly 30  Kashi has also accelerated its growth in this category  as we pursue a natural and organic occasion  Overall  including all subcategories  our frozen breakfast consumption declined as expected  but this reflected our continued phasing out of certain non core products  As we invest behind the momentum and expansion of MorningStar Farms and sustained steady growth in Eggo  we expect continued growth in North America frozen foods in 2020 Now let s discuss our international businesses  starting with Europe on Slide number 20  We had another very good year in Europe  and the fourth quarter was our ninth straight quarter of organic net sales growth in this region  a region with some very mature markets and challenging retailer environments  Leading our growth has been Pringles  which finished with high single digit consumption growth in the quarter and full year  It grew throughout the region led by double digit gains in markets like the UK and Spain Driving this growth has been a promotional program targeted toward gaming  a new innovation platform featuring Asia inspired rice infused crisps and continuing to expand our on the go pack formats  We have big growth to lap for Pringles in 2020  but our commercial plans are strong  and we re executing well  We also had a good year and a good fourth quarter in cereal  Regionwide  our cereal consumption returned to growth in the second half of 2019  led by good growth in taste brands like Crunchy Nut  Coco Pops and Tresor New packaging and positioning has returned Special K to growth in the UK  giving us confidence in executing similar programs elsewhere in 2020  We re especially pleased with our performance in the UK overall  In that market  we grew consumption by almost 2  for the year and more than 5  in the fourth quarter  So we ve got good reasons to believe we can be at least stable on cereal in Europe in 2020  We made some progress on transforming wholesome snacks in 2019 with good performance by Rice Krispies Squares in the UK  innovation on our Extra brand in France  and the expansion of the Kellogg s master brand in Italy  There is still more work to do and we have good plans for continuing to stabilize this business in 2020 Within Europe  we do have an emerging market and that is Russia and Central Europe  In Russia  in 2019  we generated strong double digit consumption growth in cereal  gaining share behind Krave and our local brand  as well as the launch of Extra brand Granola  We also continued to expand Pringles in Russia  growing consumption at a double digit rate and gaining share  Meanwhile  we continue to expand into Central Europe  So we have good reasons to be confident in top line growth again in Europe in 2020  and with enhanced revenue growth management and a reorganization that we executed in 2019  we have room to increase investment in 2020 and still deliver margin expansion Let s turn to Latin America in Slide number 21  We continue to grow organic net sales in 2019  though reported net sales were affected by the divestiture  For our Latin America business  2019 was a year of momentum  transition and economic challenges  Though momentum was principally in Mexico  in this key market  we continued to drive consumption and share growth in 2019 and we did it in all three major categories as shown on the slide We have strong commercial plans again in 2020 giving us confidence that we can sustain momentum in this important market  The transition was in Central America  where we are changing distributors  and in Brazil  where we are transforming our supply chain  Specifically  we started up our first local production for Pringles in Brazil and we moved our cereal production out of Sao Paulo into a new modern plant on Parati site in Sao Lourenco All of these actions have strong long term benefits  but they did result in incremental costs and temporary supply chain    supply constraints during quarter three and especially quarter four  These issues move behind us during 2020  And then there were the economic challenges  In Puerto Rico our biggest market in our Caribbean and Central America sub region  economic softness continues to affect all categories  Meantime  Brazil is seeing softness across categories as well While our growth in Brazil has been slowed by these conditions  we have been able to sustain consumption growth in our key categories  including cereal  cookies  salty snacks and powdered drinks  So while the economic challenges may persist into 2020  we like how we are positioned in these markets  2019 was not a typical year for Kellogg in Latin America  and we expect to be back in growth in both top line and bottom line in 2020 We ll finish our business update with our fastest growing region AMEA shown on Slide number 22  We finished 2019 with very strong organic net sales growth in AMEA right through the fourth quarter  Our Africa strategy continued to play out with a first full year of Multipro in our results  as well as the realignment of our Middle East  North Africa and Turkey businesses into AMEA and the rapid expansion of a new Kellogg s branded noodles business  This paid off in strong growth We saw good results in Pringles  particularly in the Middle East and we started up local production of that key brand in South Africa  Though slowed during the year by challenging macro economic conditions  Multipro continued to generate strong growth almost  Indecipherable  competitive note of this business and the multi decade experience of our partners in managing through often volatile conditions in West Africa We also generated good growth in Asia  driven by both cereal and Pringles  Consumption growth for Pringles was broad based in 2019  including the fourth quarter  In cereal  growth was aided by share gains in several markets  And in Australia  our developed market in this region  we returned to consumption growth in cereal in 2019  even accelerating growth during the fourth quarter  We also saw a good consumption and share gains in Pringles So even with some economic related slowdown in West Africa  our fundamentals are in place for continued growth in AMEA in 2020  We did incur incremental costs during the fourth quarter  some of which was related to production start up for Pringles  but we would view these costs as temporary and AMEA should be back in profit growth in 2020 Let s wrap up with a brief summary on Slide number 24  As discussed many times  our primary objective for 2018 and 2019 was to return to top line growth as this is the hardest and most essential element of returning to sustainable  consistent profit and cash flow growth  and we achieved this  We stabilized our organic net sales in 2018 and we accelerated it to solid growth in 2019 Now in 2020  our goal is to grow both net sales and operating profit  leaving aside the negative mechanical impact of our divestiture  There are good reasons to be confident we can do this  First of all  our portfolio is more geared toward growth today than it was even a couple of years ago  Second  we re not only seeing multi quarter momentum in organic net sales growth  but it s been broad based in all regions and improving across major product groupings Third  we ve improved our execution with a realigned organization  enhanced capabilities and improved service  Fourth  we re gradually improving our profitability  And finally  we re investing in promising opportunities leaning into incremental investment in a year that has a 53rd week Returning to balanced growth isn t just words on paper  We re moving to the next phase of our Deploy for Growth strategy and financial operating model  focusing the organization more on profit and cash flow metrics  and we ve made changes to our incentive compensation programs as well  We are building a foundation for growing sales  profit and cash flow dependably for a long time  2019 was an excellent start and 2020 will improve on it As always  I d really like to thank our organization  We couldn t do any of this without the skill and dedication of our associates And with that  we ll open it up for your questions Questions and Answers OperatorWe will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  Hey  Thanks  guys  Good morning  So   Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystLook  you ve been investing a lot in the business over the past 12 months plus  as you discussed and momentum has definitely improved  I guess despite that  and despite the reinvestment of the extra week this year  you re guiding underlying performance only low single digit profit growth without any further top line acceleration  And I guess  the question of the day really is  is that    how do we think about that  Is that conservatism on your part  Is the cost of doing business really just that high  And either way  what do you think it will take to inflect that profit growth a bit higher ahead of top line growth as you go forward through 2020 and beyond  I m not sure what underlying productivity is expected to run at  Maybe that s part of the solution  But just how do we think about the rate of further improvement  20   21 plus  Thank you Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGreat and thanks for the question  Steve  I think  we would consider the guidance that we re giving prudent  but I d also underline that our swing back to profit is really a 4 point swing ex to divestiture  So from a base business perspective  from a minus 2 to a plus 2  we think is meaningful improvement  And as we mentioned during the prepared remarks  from a top line perspective  it s the best performance we had in 2019 at plus 1 9  since 2012  So that s quite a long period of time  and we re guiding toward continuing that with 1  to 2  top line growth based on substantial reinvestment in the business against terrific opportunities that we see And so we feel that s prudent  but we ll be very pleased with continuing that top line momentum which is broad based and across many categories  And so we think  it s on strategy  it s on plan  We continue to show good progress against our portfolio  The reorganizations are behind us  Our service levels are improving  we re lapping some very good innovation from this year  we ve got very good revenue growth management  productivity plan is in place  our emerging markets continue to perform very well  And so we re pleased with where we are as we end 2019  We think 2020 will be a continued year of good positive momentum and again a 4 point swing in operating profit  as well as continued positive momentum in the top line is what we re shooting for OperatorThe next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  Good morning  folks Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jason Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you for slotting me in  Two questions  if I may  First  you made reference to a comprehensive program to rejuvenate your North America cereal business  Can you give us some more context around that Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I will  Jason  Thanks for the question  I m not going to give a lot of detail  obviously  because for competitive reasons  but the whole price package transformation that we underwent last year  as I said  was a big bang that s behind us now  And so we enter the year in good shape  And if you look at it from a segment perspective  the taste fun segment  we did well on in 2019 and we ve got good momentum  You d look at things like our Mission Tiger program complete with a college football bowl game continues to show good momentum  Froot Loops as well  Krave  Corn Pops showing good momentum  And so that s been good Our new Special K program is actually mitigating the big declines we ve seen in Special K  in fact cutting that in half against a more simple program focused on the food and focused on the wellness  It s really in our all family segment with Frosted Mini Wheats and Rice Krispies  where we have the big    we just haven t fixed yet and we own that and we have to get to it  Now with Frosted Mini Wheats  we see good promise in front of us  We know that we held back on a lot of promotional activity last year based on some supply constraints we had as we were realigning our network  We know that brand responds when we ve got good ideas against it  So as we look at the three segments that we compete in  as I said  we re in it to win it  and we see 2020 as a much better year for us in cereal Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you  My second question  more holistically  just looking at the shape of your P L  You re already the lowest margin  large cap packaged foods company out there by a fairly substantial delta  and your guidance suggests that that delta is going to widen even further next year with the overall margin compression at EBIT  You said  you thought  1  to 2  was a durable growth rate for this business  Can you give us your prospect on what you think a durable margin is for this business  Because I still    I m a bit confounded  I look at your portfolio and it seems like you re operating categories that generally offer good profit margins and you re operating with brands at price points that should also afford good profit margins  It s not coming to the surface of your P L Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jason  I think it s an excellent question  I ll start and happy to let Amit chime in as well  What we ve said all through the course of this year is we re aiming for margin expansion  as we reinvest in the business and return to top line growth  and you saw that  You saw a sequential improvement in margins across the course of the year  including into the fourth quarter  and our aim is to continue that margin expansion as we go through 2020  And we re constructively dissatisfied as to where we are  So we do believe we ve got ongoing opportunities to improve on that  We re coming off of a lot of transformation work that address many of the costs in not only our North America business  our European business as well  And as we continue in 2020  we ll continue to look for opportunities to expand margin and always relentlessly look at our cost base  Amit do you want to   Amit Banati    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think just to build on what Steve said  I think from a    if you start kind of with the gross margin  our goal for 2020 would be to stabilize gross margin  I think  we see the input costs moderating in 2020 and would expect to offset that through a combination of pricing  as well as our savings program  So from a gross margin standpoint that the goal would be to stabilize our gross margin going forward  I think  as we mentioned in our prepared remarks  we are planning to increase investment meaningfully next year behind opportunities that we see in 2020 from a brand building standpoint  And those are opportunities that we d like to invest in to continue to drive the momentum in the top line From an SG A standpoint  that s something that we re always working on  We ve initiated a number of initiatives to realign the business post the divestiture  and you re seeing the benefits of that come through on the P L  And then from an emerging market standpoint  I think  we re making good progress on the gross margins  Scale in emerging markets    as the scale in emerging markets improves  the significant margin come through on those businesses  or I d say  we d expect to improve our margins in every region over time OperatorThe next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies  Please go ahead Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Thank you  It s question number three on the margin side  So you just said  it seem    it sounds like your expectation is to stabilize gross margin in 2020 where ex Keebler  you re calling organic sales growth 1  2  of profit around 2  So maybe there is some hopeful sequential improvement in operating margin  It sounds like  as you get through the year  just given first half investment  etc  So when you say weeks   Technical Issues  growth in the top line  Does that mean that you actually plan to increase your overall investment in advertising and brand support or is it more of a reallocation  I just ask because as Jason alluded to kind of your operating margin structure relative to other peers  so to speak  is a little bit lower  obviously that s given mix  what have you  But on an advertising basis and brand support  it s not as if Kellogg historically was one that was like massively underinvesting  So yeah  short question is basically  will you increase your actual dollars in that investment to get to a point to hopefully improve your margin over time  I guess  driven by volume leverage  Thanks Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  Thanks for the question  Rob  The simple answer to that is  yes  We plan on increasing our brand building investment to continue to drive our growth  We said we re going to reinvest the 53rd week  we re going to do more than that  And so you could see the incremental investment above the 53rd week being a 53rd week plus  that and a little bit more  And we re committed to doing that  because you see  when you look at the brands that were    we ve revitalized and we ve invested in  have really responded and done very well  And so Cheez It and Cheez It Snap d  Rice Krispies Treats  Pop Tarts  all showing terrific momentum in the marketplace I mentioned cereal  we ve got a job to do there  it doesn t come for free  And we re pleased with early indications that we re seeing around our taste fun brands as I ve said  Europe  when we look at Europe and the opportunities we have there  we see good momentum despite a challenging macroeconomic environment in many of those countries  So we see the ability to get very good ROIs on our investment And the final thing  I ll tell you is  our MorningStar Farms business continues to do very well as I mentioned in the prepared remarks  But with the launching of new sub brand called Incogmeato  now I m not going to get into exactly  but we re spending against that obviously for competitive reasons  but we re not going on buying something  we re investing in a brand new launch  which we re going to be in it to win it and we re going to spend against it  and we see that as a very big opportunity  We ve got terrific food  we re excited to    have you tried at CAGNY when we re all there So we re very excited  enthusiastic and committed to that launch  and we think that the investment plan that we have  the incrementality behind it will pay off and pay off well into the future  because again  what we re looking for is long term  sustainable growth that s balanced  that continues our top line  continues margin expansion and gets us again this 4 point swing in 2020  which is the beginning of what we see as long term dependable performance Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Great  And then just a quick follow up on free cash flow  I think you said  you now have a little bit more financial flexibility  but at the same time pulling back a bit on repurchase activity and focusing on deleverage  Is there is a rationale just you d like to have a bit more or    little bit clean every balance sheet  a little bit more firepower and flexibility going forward on the acquisition front and there is really not a lot of net near term benefit  let s say  vis a vis acquisitions to be buying back stock  That s it  Thank you Amit Banati    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  that s right  I think  we are using the free cash flow to pay down our debt next year and create flexibility for us going forward Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystThank you OperatorThe next question is from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim  Please go ahead Laurent Grandet    Guggenheim    AnalystYes  Good morning  Steve and Amit  I d like to dig more a bit on the top line guidance  Organic top line guidance is disappointing  I mean  where you re finishing  Phonetic  the year at plus 1 9   almost 2  I mean this year  So    I mean  in 2019  sorry  On the divestiture  you did  I mean  of less performing business  I mean  we were expecting more than the 2   I mean  growth in 2020  So what is surprising also is that in all your businesses  when you highlight what you    what to watch in 2020  it seems everything is going in the right direction  So what makes you so pessimistic in a way and is there anything we missed there  So that s my first question  Thank you Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Laurent  I wouldn t call it pessimistic guidance  I d characterize it as prudent guidance  And again  I d just remind everybody that it s been since 2012 since we performed the way that we performed in 2019 with plus 1 9   And so  obviously we ve got some big hurdles that we ll be lapping all the successful innovations that we had in place this year that drove that performance  we ll have to anniversary  Now we re confident we ll be able to do that  but we want to be prudent in how we think about that  We also have challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain markets like Brazil and potentially West Africa and so forth  So do not get us wrong  we plan on continuing our momentum and invest in the earlier momentum and we hope to continue that momentum and do better  but we ve seen based on long term history and  Indecipherable  anniversary a potential macroeconomic condition of 92  is prudent Laurent Grandet    Guggenheim    AnalystYeah  And actually my second question is exactly about Brazil and Nigeria  You mentioned in your pre remark and some softness are coming from those two regions  Could you please elaborate and give us a bit more color there and in term of magnitude and what to expect Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So if I start with West Africa  we definitely saw a slowdown  a macroeconomic slowdown and you saw it in some of our peers results and so forth  We re still performing very well  So high single digits performance    coming out of the fourth quarter and we plan on continuing that  That s not the same as double digits  but high single digits in a market where there is some turbulence  we think is quite good  Brazil  obviously same type of macroeconomic conditions  consumer sentiment and so forth that s affecting consumer goods in general Now we continue to perform well  Our cookies  crackers are biggest    our biggest categories continue to perform well and we continue to gain share  So we don t see a reason for worry  but we see a reason for prudence  We re also very pleased about the supply chain changes that we made in Brazil  We moved  as I said on a very old Cereal plant in Sao Paulo to a brand new production facility in lines in Parati  We opened our first Pringles production line in Latin America also in Parati  a wonderful world class facility  So there is a lot of reasons to be positive about those two markets  but again emerging markets are volatile by nature  And we just want to ensure that we re prudent in our approach Laurent Grandet    Guggenheim    AnalystThank you very much  I pass it on  Thank you OperatorThe next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America  Please go ahead Bryan Spillane    Bank of America    AnalystHey  Good morning  everyone Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd good morning to you  Bryan Bryan Spillane    Bank of America    AnalystJust two    I guess two items that I just wanted to get a better understanding of    that are flowing through for 2020  One is  the incremental investments  are those one time in nature or is it sort of rebasing higher your A C investments  And then the second related  just thinking about the operating income is stranded overhead  I think my recollection of the key below divestiture was that the stranded overheads would not really be mitigated much in fiscal  20 because you ve got the  Indecipherable  the TSA agreement and maybe that becomes more of a fiscal  21  So if you can give us an idea of    on the stranded overhead  just again remind us the size and then the pacing of mitigating that Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  Bryan  I ll start and let Amit take the second one  So you can think of some of this in terms of the marketing investment being one time in nature  right  So Incogmeato will launch and it will only launch once  the RX recall that we re lapping  So there is a bit of one time in the 53rd week you can think is particularly a one time event in nature and obviously we ll continue as we go throughout the year to be agile and how we think about investments required  But I would look toward 2020 as not being a rebase necessarily as being opportunistic investments against really interesting categories that we re competing in You want to take the second one  Amit Amit Banati    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Just on the stranded costs  so obviously  we ve already initiated actions in terms of realigning the organization and we ve seen some of the benefits come through in  19 and we d expect to continue to see some of that come in 2020  However  we are a TSA as well and that TSA  we expect to run through the course of 2020  So some of that once we come off the TSA would be    addressing that would fall more in 2021  So it s a mixed bag Bryan Spillane    Bank of America    AnalystIs an order of magnitude with more of the recapture of stranded overhead fall in the  21 versus  20 in terms of what s remaining Amit Banati    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI d say it s balanced  but there would definitely be some impact in 2021 once we come off the TSA and deal with those stranded costs  That will definitely be 2021  but we are also addressing stranded costs in 2020 and some in  19 already  So it s mixed  right Bryan Spillane    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Great  Thanks for that color  We ll see you see in Florida John Renwick    Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate PlanningOperator  we only have the time for one more question and it has to be short OperatorAnd that question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan  Please go ahead Ken Goldman    JPMorgan    AnalystI ll make it very short  Can you give us a quick update    Hi  everybody  I know you talked a little bit about RXBAR  But Steve  can you give us a quick update on whether its distribution has recovered to the extent you would hoped a few months ago  and if not  what s going on there  Thank you Steven Cahillane    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  Ken  A simple answer is  yes  So its recovered to its previous highs and in fact expanding beyond that  And there s a lot of really exciting innovations coming  that will expand distribution RXBAR mini s  for example  you can find in the Club channel right now  RX oats continues to expand its distribution  Now we re focusing on advertising and velocities and getting that brand back to its momentum  And if you look at the latest Nielsen data  you can see that it s bouncing back  it s bouncing back nicely  We re really proud of the team there and really encouraged by the momentum that we see in the business and the potential that we see in the business Ken Goldman    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks so much OperatorThis concludes our question and answer session  I would like to turn the conference back over to John Renwick for any closing remarks John Renwick    Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate PlanningThanks everyone for

143364,364879,K,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   February 07  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
Also  retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned  since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses  Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living  pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
Years ago  investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent  solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6 50   but unfortunately  those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren t producing income  You can only cut your expenses so far  and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
We feel that these dividend paying equities   as long as they are from high quality  low risk issuers   can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low yielding Treasury bonds  or other bonds  
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Cedar Realty Trust  CDR  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 05 per share  with a dividend yield of 7 25   This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield of 4 06  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 2 is flat compared to last year 
Kellogg  K  is paying out a dividend of 0 57 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 59  compared to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 26  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 28 is up 1 79  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 3 per share  NRG Energy  NYSE NRG  has a dividend yield of 3 17   This is compared to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 69  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 2 is flat compared to last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
The fact is that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  To counterbalance this  invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly  can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market

143365,364880,K,This Is Why Kellogg  K  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Kellogg in Focus
Headquartered in Battle Creek  Kellogg  K  is a Consumer Staples stock that has seen a price change of  8 24  so far this year  The maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 57 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 59   This compares to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 26  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 28 is up 0 9  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Kellogg has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 52   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Kellogg s current payout ratio is 58   This means it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
K is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  4 02 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 2 03  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that K is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-kellogg-k-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200505772,200505772

143385,364900,K,Why Kellogg and Mondelez Could Soar in 2020 but Kraft Still Looks Confused,news,"When it comes to investing  many investors have different reasons to own different sectors of the stock market  Some investors prefer the aggressive return possibilities for technology  but other investors want stock market exposure in the slow and steady companies with decades of performance from a variety of brands or units  Food is one area that investors have flocked to over time for predictable cash flows and dividends 
A new Credit Suisse report calls for a selective approach in the packaged foods group  Its 2020 preview indicated that big food companies look to be fresh for the year ahead  


The brokerage firm announced that it is shifting its view on food to a more neutral stance for 2020 because two of the main drivers of the negative thesis for the past three years have eased off  First  profit margins and sales growth are now in positive territory  and second  big grocery chain customers like Kroger and Walmart are becoming less aggressive on pricing and taking a more constructive stance toward their food vendors  spending 
This is a much better situation than a couple of years ago when the retailers were demanding bigger price discounts  threatening vendors with private labels and charging new fees for inventory handling and late deliveries  As a result  Credit Suisse thinks investors can take a selective approach to food names in 2020 without worrying too much about a thematic pullback across the group 
The firm believes that Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ  MDLZ  and Kellogg Co   NYSE  K  are well positioned for margin expansion  On the other hand  Kraft Heinz Co   NASDAQ  KHC  and others need to reset lower 

Kellogg was raised to an Outperform rating from Neutral and the target price was raised to  78 from  60  Credit Suisse sees Kellogg as poised to see a positive inflection in 2020 because it believes that the company s portfolio changes and reinvestment spending over the past two years have set the stage for sustainable revenue growth  margin expansion and high single digit earnings growth 
Mondelez has an Outperform rating with a  60 price target  Positives included a  local first  strategy being on track to deliver results  an improved margin structure to be sustainable close to 17  and financial flexibility coming from joint ventures 
While the report is selectively positive  Credit Suisse said that volatile conditions in emerging markets pose the largest risk to the firm s estimates and target prices 
In the report  Credit Suisse went on to say 
Food companies have reacted to the dynamic operating environment by investing in e commerce and digital marketing  reshaping the mix of their portfolios  and adjusting their supply chain footprints 
From our perspective  Smucker  Kraft Heinz  and B G Foods still need another year of investment to return to a path of sustainable organic growth  In contrast  Kellogg and Mondelez appear to have invested sufficiently and are now growing at a strong enough pace to generate operating leverage in the year ahead 
Still cautious on General Mills  Conagra  and Campbell  All three of these companies are in a better position than they were a couple of years ago  but we do not find their risk reward compelling  Conagra s distribution trends are better than we expected  but we harbor doubts about the quality of the portfolio  General Mills has stabilized its U S  Retail business  but the risk of a consumer backlash against grain free pet food formulations keeps us on the sidelines  Campbell is reinvesting in the soup category  but we question whether it will be sufficient to generate sustainable topline growth for the portfolio ",2020-01-07,247wallst,https://invst.ly/pez1d,2054193

143387,364902,K,Why Kellogg  K  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Kellogg  K   This company  which is in the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 99  
For the last reported quarter  Kellogg came out with earnings of  1 03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 91 per share  representing a surprise of 13 19   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 99 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Kellogg lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kellogg currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 33   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 6  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-kellogg-k-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200501512,200501512

143417,364932,K,Should Value Investors Pick Kellogg Company  K  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Kellogg Company   NYSE K   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kellogg Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 43  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 08  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Kellogg Company  current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 16 98  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 60  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kellogg Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 75  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kellogg Company has a P S ratio of about 1 72  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kellogg Company currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes K a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 70  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12 98  Clearly  K is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Kellogg Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives K a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate witnessed four upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 10 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Kellogg Company Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKellogg Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of

143418,364933,K,GIS Vs  K  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Food   Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either General Mills  NYSE GIS  or Kellogg  K   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
General Mills and Kellogg are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that GIS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
GIS currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 39  while K has a forward P E of 17 09  We also note that GIS has a PEG ratio of 2 20  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  K currently has a PEG ratio of 2 85 
Another notable valuation metric for GIS is its P B ratio of 3 94  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  K has a P B of 7 14 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GIS s Value grade of A and K s Value grade of C 
GIS is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that GIS is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gis-vs-k-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200497260,200497260
143419,364934,K,Kroger Expands Simple Truth  Launches Plant Based Fresh Meat ,opinion,"The Kroger  NYSE KR  Co    NYSE K   unveiled the launch of its version of vegan meat namely Simple Truth Emerge  which is an expansion of its in house Simple Truth brand  The new product line will offer fresh burger patties and grinds at better prices and will be available exclusively at Kroger Family of Stores  Keeping in mind consumers  growing preference for meatless substitutes  these products come with 20 grams of pea based protein per serving and are free of GMOs  dairy  gluten and soy  
This move comes after Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   and Impossible Foods came up with plant based burgers and sausages  which hiked demand for imitation meat  according to sources  In response to this  major retailers like Kroger and Walmart   NYSE WMT   as well as food companies like Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  and Kellogg   NYSE K   have jumped on the bandwagon by following the trend 
Coming back to the news  Kroger started testing plant based meats in December  at 60 stores across two markets to evaluate the impact on customers and sales  The 16 week test includes products such as jackfruit  seitan and deli slices 
Simple Truth Emerge forms part of Simple Truth plant based collection  which was launched in September 2019 and included vegan chocolate chip cookie dough  oat milk  sour cream  deli slices  sausage and other products  Further  Kroger intends to add 50 plant based products to the Simple Truth brand  which recorded sales of more than  2 3 billion last year 
Going forward  management is optimistic about plant based products growth in 2020  as it is touted to be one of the key drivers of natural and organic sales  Per media reports  grocery retailers across the United States are anticipated to sell  7 2 billion of meat alternatives by 2025  which suggests a significant jump from  750 million in 2018 
All said  we hope that Kroger s efforts to expand its grocery offerings are likely to drive sales in the near term  In fact  management envisions identical sales growth of 2 2 25  and more than 2 25  for fiscal 2019 and 2020  respectively  Also  such efforts have helped shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to gain 19 2  in the past three months  against the  s decline of 1 3   You can see

efficient pricing structures and innovation to cater to consumers  changing preferences  Speaking of savings initiatives  the companies have been streamlining operational structures as well as optimizing manufacturing capacity and supply networks  Such upsides are likely to have contributed to aggregate revenues in this space However  food industry players are anticipated to have faced headwinds like rising input costs  In this context  inflationary trends for supplies like grains  edible oils  vegetables  dairy items  eggs as well as animal feed among others have been a drag  Moreover  increased logistics  warehouse and packaging expenses are expected to have increased cost burden Moreover  as these firms operate in a highly competitive arena  they are required to invest

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13 19   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 99  delivering a surprise of 8 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Kellogg  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  3 37 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 47 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kellogg shares have added about 7 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Kellogg 
While Kellogg has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kellogg was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 95 on  3 18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 87 on  13 52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

143464,364979,K,Nestle streamlines R D to speed up product innovation,news,"By Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters    Food giant Nestle  S NESN  plans to combine its scientific research operations into a single unit in an attempt to speed up development of new products at a time when competition from smaller rivals is intensifying  The world s biggest packaged food maker  with brands including Nescafe coffee and Perrier water  has been struggling with slowing sales growth for years  Now it is also under pressure from activist shareholder Daniel Loeb to increase investor returns  To better compete  the Swiss company told Reuters it would merge its Nestle Research Center and Nestle Institute of Health Sciences  NIHS  into one organization called Nestle Research  The new entity  to be announced later on Thursday  will continue to be based in Lausanne  Switzerland and will employ around 800 people  The reorganization  effective July 1  will not involve job cuts or the closure of facilities  a spokesman said  By linking the  blue sky  research done at NIHS with the more commercially focused Research Center  it hopes to accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into marketable products  It also hopes this will help it compete with smaller  nimbler rivals who have been eating away at the market share of Nestle and other big firms like  Danone   PA DANO    Unilever   L ULVR   Kraft Heinz  O KHC  and Kellogg  N K   Nestle Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer acknowledged earlier this month that his company had to keep pace with rising demand for goods that are organic  gluten free or vegan   Big trends are embraced by smaller companies a bit more actively than the big companies   Palzer told Reuters before Nestle s streamlining plans had been finalised   We are adjusting our portfolio  doing many innovations and renovations to make the portfolio more relevant and to address those trends  but smaller companies are more agile   In the United States   the world s biggest packaged food market   small challenger brands could account for 15 percent of a  464 billion sector in a decade s time  up from about 5 percent last year  Bernstein Research predicted last year  SPEEDING THINGS UP The combination of research units is the latest move by Palzer aimed at speeding up development and ensuring research efforts are commercially viable  Palzer  who took over Nestle s innovation and research and development operations in January  is also supplementing long term research projects with incremental product launches made faster by experimenting with new ideas more quickly  Last month  for example  Palzer and colleagues got the idea for a vegetarian or vegan food product while on a business trip   Thursday we had an idea  Friday we returned to Switzerland and Monday evening I was able to taste the first prototype   Palzer said   Wednesday  this prototype was shown to the executive board  and Friday it was in the global pipeline   He declined to give more details of the product  except to say it is currently being assessed by the operations team to see how long it will take to produce and on what machinery   Other steps include efforts to apply specific developments to more products  such as Nestle s recent designer sugar crystals launched in low sugar Milkybars in March  which will go into other products in the future  The importance of agility was underlined by Nestle s recent struggle to capitalize on resurgent demand for frozen foods  The company says it reformulates one third of its product portfolio every year  LACK OF IDEAS CAN BE COSTLY Nestle spent 1 72 billion Swiss francs   1 73 billion  on R D last year  down slightly from 2016 but up 22 percent from 2012  The company s sales fell 2 6 percent over the same period  As a percentage of sales  its expenditure has fluctuated only a little  but demands on the unit have increased   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst John Baumgartner said that across 10 large publicly traded U S  food companies  median expenses for R D and advertising have declined 20 percent over the past five years   As voids of ideas and marketing have emerged  start ups have been more responsive to consumer needs  won the culture and created the emotional connections that drive sales   he said in a recent note  Palzer said some industry peers had been outsourcing innovation to cut costs  relying on acquisitions of small brands or partnerships with suppliers  But he said it was critical for Nestle to maintain scientific expertise in house to keep its own portfolio fresh and to be an attractive partner for collaboration with others  Nestle does R D around the world  involving around 5 000 people  Fundamental scientific research will remain key at Nestle  Palzer said  but he also highlighted the value of external partnerships and acquisitions that can bring in new research or capabilities more easily   Scientific research and innovation itself is not necessarily the reason why big breakthroughs tend to be rare for multinational companies  said Shaun Browne  investment banker at Houlihan Lokey  who advises food companies on deals    They often don t have the patience or passion that is really required   Browne said   Often these things are one individual who is just totally determined and passionate about their product and sees it through

Tyson has also significantly outperformed the broader food market  which has gained 13 8  YTD  The market includes other food producers such as General Mills   NYSE GIS    Kellogg   NYSE K    Kraft Heinz   NYSE K    and Hormel Foods   NYSE HRL   
Q3 Overview
Tyson reported adjusted EPS of  1 47  which was what our Zacks Consensus Estimate called for  Revenue of  10 885 billion was 2  below our estimate of  11 11 billion  Although revenue did come in below expectations  it was still 8 3  higher than Q2 2018  This continues a long term trend of revenue growth that Tyson has seen over the past decade  Tyson maintained its full year adjusted EPS guidance of  5 75  6 10  with the high end well above our  5 97 Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Tyson s beef and chicken segments were less successful this quarter than expected  Beef revenue of  4 157 billion was 4  below expectations of our Key Company Metrics  Meanwhile  chicken revenue for the quarter was  3 331 billion  8  below expectations  Pork and prepared foods sales helped to make up for the other segments  Prepared foods and pork segments both saw year over year growth of 3 52  and 6 79   respectively 
There were not any significant surprises  so the TSN price jump seems fairly unusual  But  Tyson s solid guidance for the rest of fiscal 2019 could be fueling the stock price boost 
Q4   Fiscal 2020 Outlook
In Q4  revenues are expected to be  11 16 billion  an 11 61  increase year over year  The revenue is expected to be fueled by growth across all sectors  as each of the company s major revenue streams are expected to climb 
In its earnings report  Tyson reported that an outbreak of African Swine Fever is significantly impacting China  so the export environment is expected to be strong for Tyson over the next several quarters and possibly for a few years  The optimistic export outlook should help boost revenue and ultimately help Tyson s bottom line grow 
Tyson also has its Raised   Rooted brand launching this year  The alternative meat brand is likely to help boost Tyson s revenue as companies such as Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   and Impossible Foods have received a lot of attention and continue to grow in popularity  The Raised   Rooted brand will initially be selling plant based nuggets and  blended burgers   a mix of meat and plant protein 
Bottom Line
Even without its alternative meat products  Tyson has continued to grow and successfully record profits  If the company can continue this way  it may be a cash cow for investors for years to come  Tyson  in addition to selling its meat  has multiple brands that are more consumer focused  These brands  such as Jimmy Dean  Sara Lee  Ball Park  and Hillshire Farm  help Tyson to diversify its products and offer more to consumers than simply meat  These brands may help the company to continue to grow and outperform its rivals  especially those that do not have the same product diversification

143481,364996,K,Can Kellogg  K  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Kellogg  K   This company  which is in the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 86  
For the most recent quarter  Kellogg was expected to post earnings of  0 95 per share  but it reported  1 01 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 32   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 88 per share  while it actually produced  0 91 per share  a surprise of 3 41  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Kellogg lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of  1 64  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 1  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-kellogg-k-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200438893,200438893

143532,365047,K,Analysts Estimate Kellogg  K  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Kellogg  K  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Frosted Flakes  Pop Tarts and Eggo waffles is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 33 billion  up 3 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 55  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kellogg 
For Kellogg  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kellogg will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kellogg would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering a surprise of  0 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kellogg doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-kellogg-k-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200381934,200381934

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kellogg shares have added about 3 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for Kellogg 
While Kellogg has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kellogg was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 10 on  3 48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 28 on  13 69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Food   Miscellaneous is currently in the bottom 32  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kellogg-k-tops-q4-earnings-estimates-200385002,200385002

sales increased on the back of acquisitions  Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while sales missed the same  Notably  this marked the company s first sales miss in a long time Shares of the

143560,365075,K,Kellogg  Steady Dividend Stock For 10  Annual Returns,opinion,"Growth stocks tend to get most of the attention in bull markets  such as the nearly uninterrupted stock market rally over the past 10 years  But with the stock market showing signs of weakening  steady dividend stocks become all the more attractive  The S P 500 Index is up just 1  so far in 2018  and volatility has returned to the market in recent months 
Kellogg Company  NYSE K  stock has underperformed the market for an extended period  going back to the years of the Great Recession  Food stocks are not usually associated with high growth  but Kellogg is a pillar of value and income  The stock has a modest valuation  and an attractive dividend yield of 3 6   Over the next five years  Kellogg stock could return 10  per year 
Food and beverage stocks tend to be overlooked when stock markets are rallying higher  But investors should consider buying blue chip dividend stocks like Kellogg if the market rally loses steam 
Strong Brands  Steady Profits
Kellogg is a large food company  The company has its roots in breakfast  with several cereal brands  But in recent years  the company has broadened its product portfolio to include snacks like Cheez It  Keebler  Pringles  Carr s  and Famous Amos  Kellogg generates annual revenue of  13 billion  with a market capitalization of  22 billion 
Kellogg shares have performed poorly in fact  the stock is lower today than it was five years ago  This comes as the company invests heavily in new products and acquisitions  At the same time  Kellogg is dealing with higher raw materials costs that have weighed on profit margins  These headwinds were on display when Kellogg reported its third quarter earnings report  Total sales rose 6 8  thanks largely to the acquisitions of RX and Multipro  Organic net sales increased a more modest 0 4  
However  operating profit declined on a currency neutral adjusted basis by 2 6  despite the sharp rise in revenue  reflecting higher packaging and marketing expenses  Despite these pressures  Kellogg still managed earnings growth last quarter  Modest revenue growth  combined with share repurchases and a lower tax rate  fueled 3 9  earnings growth 
The threat of cost inflation is a potential risk for Kellogg s bottom line performance moving forward  Fortunately  Kellogg s top tier brands give the company pricing power  meaning it has the ability to pass on those costs to consumers through higher prices  The company is also boosting efficiency by cutting costs  which is another positive for the bottom line  And  an aggressive acquisition strategy is providing a major lift to Kellogg s sales growth 
Acquisitions Provide A Growth Boost
Kellogg is in the process of shifting its business model away from breakfast  due to sagging demand for cereal  Instead  it has invested heavily in snacks  There is good reason for this shoppers are buying less cereal in recent years  but demand for snacks is still strong 

Growth of the global snacks category continues to outpace the broader packaged foods industry  Kellogg has built a large snacks portfolio  largely through acquisitions  Since 2000  Kellogg has acquired Keebler  Pringles  Kashi  and more recently RX and Multipro 
Acquisitions have also given the company additional exposure to the emerging markets  which are another compelling growth catalyst for Kellogg in the years ahead  Since 2000  Kellogg s international investments include a joint venture in China  a joint venture in Africa  the acquisition of United Bakers Group in Russia  Bisco Misr in Egypt  and Parati in Brazil  The result of these investments is that the emerging markets now represent 20  of Kellogg s total sales  This is a major positive development for Kellogg  as emerging markets like China  India  Russia  and Brazil represent high growth opportunities  Through the first three quarters of 2018  Kellogg s organic sales increased 7 8  in Latin America and 4 9  in its Asia Pacific segment 
Investors continue to be disappointed with Kellogg s financial performance  which explains the sluggish share price over the past five years  However  Kellogg is still generating growth  For 2018  Kellogg still expects 5  net sales growth  and 7  8  earnings per share growth  These growth rates indicate the company is performing relatively well  but the stock price has not yet reflected this  As a result  value investors have the opportunity to buy Kellogg at a measurable discount to fair value 
Kellogg  An Undervalued Dividend Stock
Kellogg is expected to generate earnings per share of  4 30 in 2018  Based on this  the stock trades for a price to earnings ratio of 14 5  This is a fairly low stock valuation for a profitable  growing company  Kellogg s stock valuation is nearly at its 10 year low  Fair value for Kellogg should be a price to earnings ratio of 16 17  which is more in line with its industry peers  Therefore  a rising price to earnings ratio could generate annual returns of 3  
In addition  Kellogg s earnings growth and dividends will contribute to shareholder returns  Kellogg should be able to achieve an annual growth rate of at least 5  over the next five years  Lastly  Kellogg pays a dividend of  2 24 per share  This represents an attractive yield of 3 6   which is significantly higher than the market average  The S P 500 Index has an average dividend yield less than 2  right now 
The combination of a rising price to earnings ratio  earnings growth  and dividends could provide total returns of more than 11  per year over the next five years  This is an attractive expected rate of return for a relatively low risk stock  Kellogg has a defensive quality  which is that the company should be able to maintain profits during a recession  People will always need to eat  regardless of how the global economy is performing  As a result  Kellogg will likely continue to pay its divide din good economies and bad 
Final Thoughts
Kellogg stock has been a disappointment going back several years  But past performance is no guarantee of future results  and in this case  Kellogg s long turnaround has given way to a bright future  The company has repositioned itself in multiple growth categories  mainly snacks  It also has a leading presence in the high growth emerging markets  With a secure 3 6  dividend yield and double digit expected returns  Kellogg is an attractive stock for value and income investors  particularly if the market enters a downturn ",2018-11-16,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kellogg-steady-dividend-stock-for-10-annual-returns-200359863,200359863

Estimate by a penny  Nevertheless  the bottom line increased 2 9  year over year  supported by tax gains from the U S  tax reforms  somewhat negated by increased interest costs associated with buyout related debt  On a currency neutral basis  adjusted earnings increased 3 9  to  1 07 per share Kellogg reported revenues of  3 469 billion  up 6 8  year over year  The upside can be primarily attributed to the takeover of RXBAR and consolidation of Multipro  The top line also outpaced the consensus mark of  3 417 million  On a constant currency  cc  basis  sales during the quarter improved 9 3  Further  organic revenues climbed 0 4  on the back of impressive underlying growth even amid tough year over year comparisons in various businesses  Also  results were somewhat negatively impacted by unfavorable list price adjustments and SKU rationalization in the company s U S  Snacks unit  associated with its conversion from Direct Store Delivery or DSD  The company s currency neutral adjusted gross profit rose 1 2  to  1 257 million  while the respective margin contracted 290 basis points  bps  to 35 4  Kellogg s adjusted operating profit fell 4  to  471 million  owing to planned increases in advertising and promotion investments along with elevated higher distribution expenses  Notably  the company is on track with its Project K restructuring program  Further  adjusted operating margin contracted 150 bps to 13 6  Segment DiscussionNorth America  Kellogg s North America sales of  2 188 million rose 1 1  from the prior year quarter s level  mainly due to gains from RX s buyout  Organic sales declined due to list price adjustments and SKU rationalization in the company s U S  Snacks unit  stemming from last year s conversion out of DSD  During the quarter  sales declined across the U S  Snacks  U S  Morning Foods and U S  Specialty Channels categories  Also  adjusted operating profit declined on account of advertising and promotional investments  and other incremental costs Europe  The segment s revenues of  596 million slipped 0 5  year on year  owing to unfavorable currency movements  On a currency neutral basis  sales grew on the back of high snacks sales  Adjusted operating profit improved on a year over year basis Latin America  Revenues of  239 million in the segment improved 1 4  year on year  aided by growth witnessed across Mexico and Mercosur  partially offset by currency headwinds  Higher net sales also fueled adjusted operating profit growth Asia Pacific  The segment s revenues of  446 million improved substantially year over year on the back of strong growth in cereals and snacks as well as growth in the developed and emerging markets  The region also gained from the consolidation of Multipro  Adjusted operating profit witnessed a sharp improvement Other FinancialsKellogg ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  309 million  long term debt of  8 715 million and total equity of  3 615 million On a year to date basis  the company generated cash from operating activities of  926 million OutlookKellogg s third quarter performance was driven by both acquisition gains and organic sales growth  Further  the company witnessed enhanced consumption trends across core markets  brands and categories  The company is also on track to generate productivity savings  which are enabling it to counter cost pressures  mainly stemming from higher transport costs  Further  Kellogg continues to witness increased costs related to brand building investments and logistics  and co packing expenses associated with new pack format expansions Though these factors weighed on the company s operating profit  Kellogg plans to continue with these investments as they bode well for future growth  This may entail escalated costs in the near term  while the company s planned installation of an in house packing facility may help it enhance margins over the medium term Kellogg now expects revenues to grow about 5   at cc  compared with the previously guidance of 4 5   The raised guidance reflects better net sales and consumption trends  while it continues to incorporate adverse impacts from the DSD transition at U S  Snacks division However  adjusted operating profit growth  at cc  is now anticipated to remain roughly flat year over year compared with 5 7  growth forecasted earlier  Management expects higher investments  mix shifts and costs related to expansion of co packed pack formats to dent fourth quarter operating profit Consequently  the company trimmed its adjusted earnings growth view to 7 8   at cc  from 11 13  projected earlier  This can be attributed to a decline in adjusted operating profit  somewhat made up by lower effective tax rate

MKS Instruments  NASDAQ MKSI   a provider of technical instruments that measure  control  power  deliver  monitor  and analyze manufacturing processes  is the featured stock from July s Most Attractive Stocks Model Portfolio 
Since 2013  MKSI has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 59  compounded annually  from  53 million in 2013 to  340 million in 2017  MKSI has continued to grow profits in 2018  and it s NOPAT is  377 million over the trailing twelve months  TTM   The company s NOPAT margin has risen from 8  in 2013 to 19  TTM while its return on invested capital  ROIC  has improved from 6  to 16

MKSI Valuation Provides Upside
MKSI has significantly outperformed the S P 500 over the past five years   250  vs   66    but the stock remains undervalued  At its current price of  97 share  MKSI has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 1  This ratio implies that the market expects MKSI s NOPAT to grow by no more than 10  over the remaining life of the corporation  This expectation seems rather pessimistic for a company that has grown NOPAT by 18  compounded annually since 1999 
If MKSI can maintain current margins  19   and grow NOPAT by just 7  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  116 share today   a 20  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

IQV Provides Poor Risk Reward
At IQV s current price of  102 share  the market s expectations for profit growth look overly optimistic  To justify its current price  IQV must immediately raise its NOPAT margin to 11   compared to 7  TTM  and grow NOPAT by 14  compounded annually for the next seven years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

primarily due to lower demand  In order to improve its sales performance  the company is investing in brand building such as digital media  consumer promotions and traditional advertising  It is also investing in in store capabilities like increasing sales forces of its struggling businesses   cereals and snacks Meanwhile  Kellogg s transition from a Direct Store Delivery system to warehouse distribution in its U S  Snacking business  started in July 2017  was executed well  Now  investors can pay more attention toward investing behind its brands  Although the transition remains a headwind to sales in the recent times  as the company rationalizes SKUs and resets pricing to customers  it should improve efficiency in the long term Kellogg boasts a legacy of more than 100 years  built on solid product portfolio and brand identity  in both cereals and snacks  Popular Kellogg s brands include Kellogg s  Keebler  Pop Tarts  Eggo  Cheez It  Nutri Grain  Murray  Austin  Morningstar Farms  Famous Amos  Ready Crust and Kashi  In June 2012  the company acquired Procter   Gamble s snack unit  Pringles  which is now its second largest brand Kellogg is reaping the benefits of these aforementioned sales building efforts that can be seen from its last reported quarter s results  The company reported revenues of  3 21 billion  increasing 3 6  year over year  The upside can be primarily attributed to the December 2016 s acquisition of Parati in Brazil and October 2017 s takeover of RXBAR  along with favorable currency translation  The top line outpaced the consensus mark of  3 11 billion by 3 2  Cost Saving Initiatives are Driving Earnings  Cost saving initiatives like Project K and zero based budgeting program are also somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales  Although the top line has been weak  Kellogg s margin growth has been impressive  Pricing and mix improvement are anticipated to give support to its bottom line growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s 2018 earnings to increase 10 4  year over year  In 2019  Kellogg is expected to come up with a decent performance as well  wherein its bottom line is expected to grow 6 6  Expansion Into Emerging Markets  Kellogg is slowly building its business in the emerging markets of Asia  Central and Eastern Europe  the Middle East and the African regions  The Pringles acquisition has also opened up growth opportunities in these fast growing nations Kellogg has tripled its emerging market business over the last decade  In particular  management targets well performing countries like India  South Africa and Brazil for growth Emerging markets provide huge growth opportunity for Kellogg  In 2017  the company integrated and anticipated growth in Parati  tripling its scale in Brazil and providing further growth and cost synergies  Through its joint ventures  Kellogg is rapidly expanding in West Africa and China  where it is building distribution and brand awareness in big

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 79  last quarter  The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 4 43  Mondelez has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014  primarily due to soft consumer demand  In fact  the food industry  including legacy brands like General Mills Inc    NYSE GIS    The Kraft Heinz Company   NYSE K   and The Kellogg Company   NYSE K    has been displaying a dismal performance for quite some time to boost sales Let s Have a Look at Mondelez s Past PerformanceMondelez witnessed a decline in revenues in nine out of the last 11 quarters  primarily due to lower demand  Mondelez s sales were down 0 1  and its volumes decreased 0 6 percentage points  pp  in 2017 Resultantly  the company s share price has declined more than 9  in the past year  compared with its decline of 15 3  In the last reported quarter  Mondelez s net revenues increased 2 9   courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets  Emerging markets  net revenues rose 6 3  and the Power Brands witnessed a 3 7  increase in revenues Regionally  Latin America  Asia  Middle East   Africa  AMEA  and Europe registered an increase of 4 2   2 6  and 5  in revenues  respectively  However  North America s revenues declined 0 6  Organic revenues increased 2 4   softer than 2 8  in the third quarter of 2017  The improvement was primarily driven by the Power Brands as well as strong performance in Latin America and Asia  Middle East   Africa Pricing increased 2 1 pp  more than 1 5 pp in the preceding quarter  Volume Mix had a positive impact of 0 3 pp on the revenues  In the third quarter  it was 1 3 pp Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1In order to counter the tepid sales trend  Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building  The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins  cash flow and return on invested capital Mondelez s advertisement spend is biased toward the high margin Power Brands  Mondelez is increasing investments in in store execution and advertising to support the Power Brands and innovation  funded by cost savings from its restructuring plans  The company is thereby reaping benefits from the Power Brands that include Oreo  Cadbury Diary Milk  Halls and Tang  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter as well  with improved volumes in its Power Brands  Higher sales from its wellness product portfolio are also anticipated to support its revenue growth  Further  improvements in China  Europe  Russia and India  along with strong pricing in the emerging markets are added positives  Notably  the company has been experiencing improvements in the emerging markets However  softness in North America due to a tough retail environment will mar the growth rate to some extent Segment Wise  Mondelez s Europe revenues  comprising about 37 8  of the total revenues  are likely to witness 8 5  decrease sequentially but 6  year over year improvement to  2 6 billion  per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  North America segment  comprising about 26 2  of the total revenues  is expected to witness  1 64 billion of revenues in the first quarter  compared with  1 8 billion in the last reported quarter and  1 65 billion in the year ago period Latin America revenues of  921 million indicate an increase from  900 million in the preceding quarter and  910 million in the prior year quarter Coming to the company s bottom line  the snacks giant surpassed analysts  expectations for earnings in nine of the past 11 quarters  Despite lower sales growth  the company has managed to boost its profit level  banking on effective promotional strategies  introduction of nutritious products  cost saving and restructuring initiatives that benefited it at large However  higher commodity prices  primarily on dairy products  and increased trade spending are likely to adversely impact its gross margins  Then again  the company s zero based budgeting program  productivity savings and lower overhead costs are expected to boost its operating margin Overall  first quarter bottom line is expected to witness solid growth from higher pricing  higher volumes  as well as lower overhead and increased productivity savings  partly offset by higher input costs For the first quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents  reflecting a 15 1  year over year increase  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at  6

143647,365162,K,Carson s boardroom support for gay rights could test his base,news,"By Ross Kerber BOSTON  Reuters    Ben Carson  frontrunner in the struggle to become Republican presidential candidate  said on Wednesday that his support for gay rights initiatives when he was a director at major companies does not clash with his opposition to gay marriage   But some leaders in the social conservative movement that has backed Carson say his more than 15 year record on the boards of retailer Costco Wholesale  O COST  and food manufacturer Kellogg  N K  could pose a challenge for him as he seeks the nomination   Carson supported various initiatives at both companies  such as barring discrimination based on gender identity  providing health insurance for employees  domestic partners  and offering more diversity training  Because of such changes the companies now are ranked as some of the best in the United States by lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender advocates   I think he has to explain this   said Tony Perkins  president of the Christian conservative lobbying group Family Research Council   As he is pursuing the presidency  what he has to make clear is that the board positions should not be reflective of his public policy   Perkins and other conservative leaders say they fear that some of the changes at American corporations could be used to punish employees with unpopular political views  They worry  for instance  that workers who do not support same sex marriage could be found in violation of anti discrimination policies  David King  a senior lecturer of public policy at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government  said Carson s stance could cost him backing  especially in the early battleground state of Iowa  Those voters  King said  will  be the toughest group for him to try to convince that he can divorce boardroom politics from presidential politics   FIERY RHETORIC One of those voters is Lynn Proudfoot  a Republican activist and self described social conservative in Des Moines  Iowa  who said he has not decided who to support in a party caucus to be held in February  Told of Carson s stance in the boardrooms  Proudfoot said he was surprised and displeased   I would look disfavorably on that   he said  To be sure  Proudfoot said other conservative may be more focused on backing Carson because of his fierce opposition to abortion and give him a pass on the boardroom matters   Carson s boardroom record appears to clash with his fiery rhetoric on homosexuality in televised interviews  he compared same sex marriage to bestiality in 2013  and implied in March that sex acts among prison inmates show homosexuality is a choice  He has apologized for both statements   But Carson has said his choices as a director are consistent with his broader claims that he is not anti gay  only opposed to same sex marriage   My general attitude would have been  of course we protect the rights of everybody   he told Reuters in an interview earlier this month   He echoed those remarks during the debate between Republican candidates in Boulder  Colorado  on Wednesday when asked about his time on the board of Costco   There is no reason that you can t be perfectly fair to the gay community   he said  Gregory Angelo  president of the Log Cabin Republicans  which represents gay conservatives  said the corporate initiatives may reflect new social attitudes and may not hold Carson back in primaries   I certainly don t see him as some fire breathing homophobe   Angelo said  MOCKED BY CLINTON Fellow directors said they do not recall Carson opposing any of the initiatives presented to the board    Ben Carson never came into the boardroom with any kind of social policy commentary   said Jeffrey Brotman  who chairs Costco s board  Kellogg director Donald Knauss said he also remembers Carson went along with the policy changes   Gay rights questions have drawn attention in the 2016 presidential campaign after this year s U S  Supreme Court ruling legalizing same sex marriage  Many large U S  businesses supported the ruling or have taken other policy steps favored by gay activists in recent years  tracking public attitudes   Leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton mocked Carson for his views on same sex marriage this month during a meeting sponsored by New York gay activist group Human Rights Campaign  saying Carson  says that marriage equality is what caused the fall of the Roman empire   Last year Costco was named  best perceived brand among LGBT Americans  by YouGov BrandIndex  an online measure of consumer perception  Kellogg and Costco also both ranked highly in recent surveys by Human Rights Campaign  with Kellogg getting a perfect score of  100  and Costco posting a  90   HRC also gave top scores to technology giant Hewlett Packard Co  N HPQ  during the years it was led by another Republican candidate  Carly Fiorina   In the interview  Carson acknowledged the stances he took as a director could be an issue for some conservative voters  But he said he has never strayed from his message   As far as conservatives are concerned  I ve made my position clear to them as well  I believe in traditional marriage  But I don t have anything against the gay community

143672,365187,K,Kellogg To Suppliers  Cut The Carbon,news,"By    The Keebler Elves and their cereal siblings are lowering their carbon footprints  Kellogg Co  NYSE K announced Wednesday  The cereal giant joins a wave of major U S  businesses that are pledging to tackle climate change   not only by reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions but also by requiring the farmers and suppliers they work with to follow suit 
 We recognize that upstream agriculture emissions are the single largest source of emissions in our value chain and will focus our efforts on achieving agricultural emissions reductions   Kellogg said in its climate policy update  Across the United States  agriculture accounts for about one tenth of total greenhouse gas emissions 
Kellogg s main competitor  General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS  made a similar announcement two weeks ago  Both initiatives are largely the result of Oxfam International s Behind the Brands campaign  which gathers information about how food and beverage companies deal with supply chain challenges such as climate change  water scarcity and women s rights  The idea is to empower customers to call for changes in areas where companies might be lagging 
In Oxfam s recent assessment of the top 10 companies  Kellogg was ranked eighth while General Mills landed in last place  Other firms on the list include Nestl  SA VTX NESN  PepsiCo Inc  NYSE PEP and Unilever N V  NYSE UN 
 Climate change is putting hundreds of millions of people at risk of hunger and threatening everything from coffee and cereal to wine and chocolate   Oxfam spokeswoman Monique van Zijl told the Associated Press   Kellogg is joining a growing list of companies that are putting the weight of their brands behind climate action  
As part of its new climate policy  Kellogg  based in Battle Creek  Michigan  said it will set a target for reducing emissions across its entire supply chain sometime next year  It will also require its suppliers to measure and publicly disclose their progress on reaching those emission reduction goals   This is significant  because at the end of the day  companies will only be able to reduce emissions in their supply chains with engagement and innovation from their suppliers   Irit Tamir  the policy lead for the Behind the Brands campaign  wrote on Wednesday   Kellogg has committed to holding its suppliers accountable  
The company has also agreed to create a climate change adaptation policy that includes the needs of its smallest agricultural suppliers  Small time operators are particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures  drought and flooding  which scientists say are getting more frequent and more intense because of man made climate change  A recent study found that climate change poses a greater risk to global food production than previously thought  Rising temperatures not only damage heat sensitive crops but also increase toxic air pollution  which harms crops even more 

Some skeptics of highly publicized initiatives like Kellogg s worry they could just amount to  greenwashing    enabling companies to claim progress while sticking to the status quo  But private sector firms say they have become increasingly engaged on climate and environmental issues because they re worried about how their supply chains will fare in a warming future 
Sixty percent of Fortune 100 and Global 100 companies  for instance  have set renewable energy goals  emissions reduction targets or both  according to a 2012 study by Ceres  Calvert Investments and the World Wildlife Fund  the Washington Examiner noted  In June  a group of nearly 130 companies and 50 investors sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of the agency s proposed power plant regulations 
 The new standards will reinforce what leading companies already know  Climate change poses real financial risks and substantial economic opportunities and we must act now   the group wrote ",2014-08-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kellogg-to-suppliers:-cut-the-carbon-303197,303197

143699,365214,K,Chart Of The Day  Has Kellogg Lost Its Snap  Crackle And Pop ,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Kellogg Company  NYSE K  is scheduled to release its earnings report tomorrow  before market open  for the fiscal quarter which ended September 2017  According to Zacks Investment Research  EPS forecast is  0 93 versus  0 96 YoY  The company has set its forward guidance for the year at  3 97 4 03 EPS 
The company is losing on two fronts  in that it not only underperforms the benchmark  but it s experiencing almost a fifth of its value this year  While the S P 500 has gained 17 6 percent this year and 19 5 percent since the US election and the awakening of animal spirits  Kellogg has lost 18 15 percent this year and  after an initial  first day 2 65 percent surge  it lost 19 45 percent since the frenzied Trump trade 
Can Kellogg Keep Up With A Rising Dollar 
The packaged food industry is struggling with weak consumer demand  On top of that  the stronger dollar makes its products less competitive than the ever increasing competition  A strong dollar means higher relative prices for Kellogg s dollar denominated cereal compared to other currencies  Considering the dollar is expected to strengthen after its short term reversal  this  in tandem with continued competition  means that sales are expected to decline 
The company disclosed a quarterly dividend to be paid on Friday  December 15  Shareholders of record on Friday  December 1st will be issued a dividend of  0 54 per share  The ex dividend date is Thursday  November 30th  This represents a  2 16 annualized dividend and a yield of 3 51   Kellogg s payout ratio is presently 97 74  
Research firms believe the stock will rise  Piper Jaffray gave the stock a  buy  rating  with a  78 00 target price  Zacks Investment Research  on the other hand  downgraded its rating from a  buy  to a  hold   JPMorgan Chase actually upgraded its rating from  neutral  to  overweight   raising its price objective to  78 from  76 
Charts Signal Further Declines Ahead

The fact that the stock has been trading in a downtrend since June 19 of last year and the high price of  87 16 is something that anyone can tell by looking at this chart  However  what may be missed by the casual observer is the fact that on October 19 the stock decisively crossed below a major uptrend line since March 2009  red line  
If you don t understand the significance of the date  it s the beginning of the current and second longest bull market in the history of the US  The black line below is the macro uptrend line since the dotcom crash  That is still intact 
The failure of demand to keep the price over that long term uptrend line is a signal for further  more drastic declines 

The initial breakout penetrated 2 percent below the long term uptrend line  satisfying a moderate filter  There was also a successful return move  which proved the integrity of the now resistance of the prior support of the long term 
Friday s trading however  formed a bullish hammer  suggesting an upward correction to at least  61  the expected resistance of the October congestion and possibly even a second return move  which is apt considering the significance of this long term reversal 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait on a short for either a full return move and confirmation of the resistance of the old uptrend line  with at least a down day that covers the previous up day after returning to the uptrend line  or to a close beneath Friday s hammer s  59 82 low 
Moderate traders may wait on a short for a return move but not necessarily for a confirmation of the resistance of the old uptrend line 
Aggressive traders may be content with a return move to the  61 congestion resistance and a close beneath it ",2017-10-30,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-why-kellogg-will-continue-to-fall-200256943,200256943

143722,365237,K,Bad News For Consumer Staples Companies    ,opinion,"Last night  while returning to my apartment  I shared an elevator with a neighbor who was carrying a large paper bag of groceries  Printed on the front was Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  unmistakable  smile  logo and the word  NOW  
 I haven t heard of Amazon Now   I commented   What s that  
 Oh  it s like Prime   she said   But for orders of  35 or more  you get free delivery within two hours  
That s right  Amazon Prime Now won t just do your grocery shopping for you  It ll do it faster than you can  
Over the last year  we ve written quite a bit about the  like Kroger  NYSE KR   These brick and mortar retailers simply can t keep up with Amazon   especially now that it owns multiple grocery franchises 
As you can see from this week s chart  that s bad news for many consumer staples firms like Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC   Kellogg Company  NYSE K  and General Mills  NYSE GIS   These companies draw substantial revenues from distribution agreements with big grocers 
You might argue that this is only a temporary setback for producers of foodstuffs   that they ll eventually work out new deals with Amazon and replace their ailing grocery partners 
Unfortunately  it s not that simple  Amazon is only one threat to these brands  Our changing taste buds are an even bigger problem for them 
The End of a Sugary Era
You may notice that two of the companies shown in this week s chart are principally cereal makers  That s not a coincidence  America s love affair with sugary breakfast foods has cooled since its postwar heyday 
Earlier this month  Bloomberg reported that Post Holdings Inc  NYSE POST  was acquiring Bob Evans  frozen breakfast foods business for  1 5 billion  The Honey Bunches of Oats maker has noticed that Americans are ditching cereal in favor of hot  savory alternatives   think egg sandwiches and sausage scrambles 
This trend is part of a larger shift away from refined sugars in the American diet  As Matthew Carr   we re abandoning cola as well  Sales of ketchup  aka tomato puree with corn syrup  have also been declining in recent years   a bad omen for Kraft Heinz 
In sum  many consumer staples companies are facing a double whammy right now  Their distribution partners are collapsing under competitive pressure from Amazon  And their products are falling out of favor as our nation loses the sweet tooth it s had since the 1950s 
One of our own strategists has already told investors to short one of the companies in this chart  And his subscribers are well on their way to making big profits from this recommendation ",2017-10-01,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bad-news-for-consumer-staples-companies-200216276,200216276

143739,365254,K,Key Predictions For Q3 Earnings Reports Of ADM And K,opinion,We are almost halfway through the third quarter earnings season  which portrays a pretty favorable picture  Of the notable factors influencing this season are rising momentum on the revenue front is noteworthy Further  the above average proportion of positive earnings surprises has been maintained in the quarter and the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is also favorable  Additionally  the overall third quarter earnings for the S P 500 index remains on track to reach a new all time quarterly record by beating the previous earnings season s record Per the  dated Oct 27  nearly 272 S P 500 members have already reported their results  Of these  approximately 75 7  delivered positive earnings surprises  while 66 2  beat top line expectations  Notably  earnings for these companies have advanced 8 7  from the same period last year  with revenues up 6 7  For the third quarter as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are projected to improve 5 4  year over year on 5 5  growth in revenues A Look at Consumer Staples SectorAgriculture and food stocks form part of the  sector  Markedly  the sector is on growth trajectory since the start of the current year  supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil In fact  we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors  out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter  However  the Consumer Staples sector is likely to witness 2 6  and 1 9  growth in earnings and revenues  respectively  Also  a  of  6  out of 16   places the sector at the top 38  of the Zacks classified sectors  Evidently  the sector has gained 7 9  year to date  lower than the S P 500 s growth of 15 4    Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  stock is combined with a positive   the chance of beating earnings estimates is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   That said  let s see what awaits the couple of stocks that are slated to report third quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 31 Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   expects exports from Argentine to continue to affect margins at the Oilseeds segment in the third quarter  when the global environment is anticipated to remain highly competitive  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the Oilseeds Processing segment is pegged at  210 million Also  the overall Agricultural Services results are anticipated to be down in the quarter in comparison to the last year  Further  the fluctuating commodity prices  oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins have also been denting its overall results Archer Daniels Midland Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as the company has an Earnings ESP of  3 39   Though the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of earnings  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a beat You can see  Further  revenues are expected to be  15 6 billion for the quarter  down 1 3  from the year ago period  This means that the company s more than three year long dismal revenue surprise is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Nevertheless  the company is ahead of track with its 2017 run rate savings goal of  225 million  Therefore  management remains confident of achieving strong year over year earnings growth in 2017   Read   Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is the leading manufacturer and marketer of ready to eat cereals and convenience foods  and savory snacks  It has been witnessing decline in revenues for the last two years primarily due to lower demand  In particular  weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U S  snacks business have been negatively impacting the company s performances  Additionally  the company has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food Nevertheless  given the tepid sales growth  Kellogg is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings  In sync with this  the company is investing in brand building  in store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation  In the second half of 2017  its sales are expected to somewhat benefit from innovation and Pringles  improved performance in Europe   Read   Kellogg Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Further  Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of  0 50  with a Zacks Rank  3  which makes us confident of an earnings beat  Also  total revenue for the quarter is pegged at  3 2 billion  down 1 2  year over year While  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s total North America segment s revenues is projected to move down 0 04   Europe revenues are likely to decrease 0 01  in the third quarter   However  the same for Latin America and Asia Pacific revenues are likely to increase 0 2  and 0 03

143784,365299,K,SUPERVALU  SVU  Earnings Miss  Sales Top Estimates In Q1,opinion,"SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   posted better than expected sales in first quarter fiscal 2018  which came ahead of the consensus  after missing in seven out of the past eight straight quarters  excluding the current one  Consequently  its shares have rallied more than 15  in after market trading hours  However  earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Quarter in Detail
SUPERVALU posted adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents that marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents by 10 0   However  earnings grew 12 5  from the prior year quarter  backed by higher sales in the wholesale business  offset by higher tax rate 
We note that the company has reported negative surprises in three of the past five quarters  including the current one  In fact  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have underperformed for the last three months  The stock has lost 10 3  over the last three months  wider than the  s decline of 2 7  

SUPERVALU s net sales rose 6 3  year over year to  4 004 million  Also  the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 978 million  This upside was backed by increased sales witnessed at the Wholesale segment but were hurt by the decline in Retail net sales  The company also lost some volumes as Marsh Supermarkets  one of the company s large affiliations from fiscal 2017  filed for bankruptcy protection in May 
Gross profit was almost flat from the prior year quarter at  551 million  However  margin contracted 80 basis points to 13 8   due to the change in business segment mix  with Wholesale representing a larger portion of total sales and gross profit  Adjusted operating earnings also plummeted 24 7  due to higher selling and administrative costs 
Segment Details
Wholesale  Net sales at Wholesale business grew 12 4  year over year to  2 6 billion  mainly driven by sales to new customers  coupled with greater sales from new outlets operated by existing customers  These were partly compensated by stores from the previous year that are no longer supplied by the company  Lower military sales also dented sales growth  Also  the segment s operating income came in at  71 million  up from  64 million recorded in the year ago quarter  Operating margin however remained flat at 2 8  
Retail  Net sales at Retail slipped 2 7  to  1 4 billion  This decrease represents store closures and unfavorable identical store sales of 4 9   partly mitigated by sales from acquired and new outlets  Moreover  customer counts decreased 5 0   while average basket size slightly increased in the quarter  Also  deflation remained flat in the quarter 
In fact  we note that this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to tough competitive pressure  lower store traffic and deflationary environment in the food industry  This is the ninth consecutive quarter of comp sales decline of the retail segment 
Further  the segment reposted operating loss of  4 million  down from  8 million of operating earnings in the year ago quarter  due to lower sales and higher employee costs  partially due to acquired and new stores

143785,365300,K,Altria  MO  Earnings Miss Estimates  Revenues Beat In Q2,opinion,"Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   reported mixed results in the second quarter of 2017  wherein while earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues beat the same  The company however kept earnings guidance intact for 2017 
Quarter in detail
Adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  earnings increased 4 9  year over year driven by higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares  This was offset by lower equity earnings from Altria s beer investment 
Net revenue increased 2 2  to  6 7 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by higher net revenues in the smokeable and smokeless products segments  offsetting the decline in Wine segment  Revenues net of excise taxes increased 3 8  year over year to  5 1 billion and also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 9 billion by 1 6

We believe declining demand for cigarettes due tothe ongoing anti tobacco campaigns  government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock  Strict Food and Drug Administration  FDA  regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking  Additionally  consumers  preference for e cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume  Evidently  Altria s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last eight quarters  including this quarter

Smokeable Products Segment  Despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California  which negatively impacted volume and retail share in the second quarter  revenues net of excise taxes increased 1 6  year over year to  5 9 billion  The increase was primarily driven by strong pricing  partially offset by lower volume and higher promotional investments  Total shipment volume decreased 2 9  year over year to 30 6 billion units  Cigarettes retail market share declined 0 4 share point to 50 8  in the quarter 
Adjusted operating companies income  OCI  increased 6 4   while adjusted OCI margins expanded 1 6 percentage points to 51 7  
Smokeless Products  Revenues net of excise taxes increased 7 8  to  564 million in the second quarter  as it rebounded from the preceding quarter s decline of 2 5  which was impacted by the recall of some of its smokeless tobacco products  The second quarter was driven by higher pricing and volume  partially offset by unfavorable mix  Volumes grew 1 4  to 221 million units  where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes grew 1 3  and others increased 2 3  in the quarter  Total smokeless products retail share decreased 0 8 share points to 54 1  in the second quarter 
Adjusted OCI surged 9 8  and margins increased 0 7 percentage points to 70 0  
Wine  The segment s revenues went down 12 3  year over year to  150 million due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity  Wine shipment volume declined 14 5  to 1 8 million units

143796,365311,K,Is Tyson Foods  TSN  Poised For A Beat In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   is slated to report third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 7  before the opening bell  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this meat processor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 2 75   In fact  it has posted positive earnings surprise in seven out of 13 straight quarters 
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 15   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 31 per share  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 27  This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Tyson Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Tyson Foods  Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  3 15  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter and fiscal year 2017 have improved significantly in the last seven days  While estimates for the third quarter moved up 4 1   it increased 2 6  for fiscal year  In fact  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 27 and  5 19 for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 reflects year over year growth of 5 4  and 18 2   respectively 
Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  9 48 billion for the said quarter  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter  Also  revenues for fiscal 2017 are projected to grow 1 2  to  37 3 billion Tyson Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors at Play
Tyson Foods remains on track to shape its robust portfolio of food products  The company has been making efforts to expand its protein packed brands through solid innovation and brand building efforts  The acquisition of AdvancePierre  completed on Jun 8   divestment of non protein businesses  Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s   and focus on growth categories and channels are in line with the company s strategy to expand its protein packed brands 
However  we believe sluggishness in beef segment due to higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies and lower livestock costs have been hurting the stock  Higher investments in the prepared foods category as well as higher wages are also increasing the expense burden of the company and thereby pressurizing margins 
Nevertheless  Tyson Foods is streamlining its organizational structure across its Chicken  Pork  Beef and Prepared Foods segments in order to boost their efficiency and maximize growth  The company s strong position in chicken segment and its efforts to innovate and offer nutritious products to health conscious consumers  also remain encouraging  We note that currently  Tyson consumer brand products offer chicken with No Antibiotics Ever  NAE   keeping in view consumers preference for healthy products  Thus  it seems that Tyson Foods remains well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains  Further  the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food service channel  We expect these efforts to reflect in the quarter to be reported 
While shares of Tyson Foods have underperformed the  in the last one month  with stock rising 2 7  in comparison to the industry s growth of 4 1   we believe the company s efforts to expand protein packed products and offer nutritious products to health conscious consumers have the potential to drive the stock higher in the near term 

Stocks with Favorable Combination 
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Avon Products  Inc    NYSE AVP   has an Earnings ESP of  22 22  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
Kellogg Company   NYSE K   has an Earnings ESP of  3 19  and a Zacks Rank  3

Adjusted earnings per share of  1 14 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 23 by 7 3  in the second quarter  It also dipped 0 9  from the year ago quarter  While the company benefited from strong pricing  lower cigarette volumes led to the decline

Revenues from combustible products declined 3 4   down 0 5  excluding negative currency  to  6 3 billion  On the contrary  Reduced Risk Products  RRPs  reported a whooping increase from last year quarter  stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products  However  revenues were way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 058 billion by 2 0

The company witnessed organic sales growth and improved pricing in the categories of Personal Care  Refreshment  Home Care and Foods  Except Foods and Personal Care  volumes improved in the rest of the categories  Foods volume declined 1 3  in the quarter  and excluding spreads business  foods segment declined 0 4   Volumes in Personal Care also declined 0 3  in the second quarter 
Performance in Emerging and Developed Markets
Organic sales in emerging markets grew 4 8   lower than the preceding quarter s growth of 6 1   We note that emerging markets account for about two thirds of the company s total revenue  Though being volatile  these markets offer long term growth prospects  Sales in the emerging markets grew owing to pricing growth offset by 0 1  decline in volumes  The economic crisis in Brazil continued to remain a headwind  In India  trade stock levels were reduced ahead of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax while markets in Indonesia were affected by fewer trading days due to public holidays 
Nevertheless  organic sales at developed markets grew 0 7  in the second quarter  driven by rise in both pricing and volumes  The growth was favorable in comparison with a decline of 1 5  in the preceding quarter  While performance of both Latin America and North America improved in the second quarter  consumer demand continued to remain weak amid challenging retail environment in Europe   Excluding spreads business  developed markets increased 1 2  in the quarter 
First Half Results
Underlying earnings grew 14   while underlying sales growth were 3  in the first half of 2017  Excluding spreads  underlying sales growth was 3 4  
Underlying operating margins was up by 180 basis points to 17 8   driven by faster savings delivery and phasing of investment Unilever NV Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Stock Price Movement
A glimpse of Unilever s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying since the past six months  Shares have increased 37 7  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks categorized   which gained 12 7   Notably  the industry is part of the top 3  of the Zacks Classified industries  7 out of the 265  

Growth Drivers
The strong results came on the back of its recent strategic business reviews  focus to deliver profits and boost shareholder value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry  The strategic review was conducted to gain investor support following the unsolicited  143 billion takeover offer by Kraft Heinz Co   KHC  in Feb 2017 
Consequently  the consumer products giant   including brands like Flora and Stork butter  The business has been witnessing a slowdown for the past few quarters  The divestiture process is progressing well and the company s board expects to decide the outcome before the end of the year 
Unilever also plans to integrate its food and refreshment businesses into a Netherlands based unit  Since the company is listed both in Amsterdam and London  it is looking to simplify its corporate structure to ease the process of buying or disposing of businesses 
Furthermore  the maker of Dove products and Ben   Jerry announced that it would buy back shares  hike dividends and generate cost savings through its Connected 4 Growth  C4G  program announced last year  The program was undertaken to reduce costs  under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over  This has generated savings of more than  1 billion in the first half of year 2017  which is a step closer towards its target of  6 billion and a targeted underlying operating margin of 20  by 2020 
Moreover  it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA  which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders 
Outlook
The company expects these actions to deliver another year of underlying sales growth in the 3 5  range  The company anticipates accelerating growth in the second half of the year driven by the phasing of the innovation plans and a step up in brand and marketing investment  For 2017  the company also expects an improvement in underlying operating margin of at least 100 basis points and strong cash flow 
Zacks Rank   Other Stocks to Consider
Unilever currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   We believe there is still much value left in the stock  which is quite evident from its  of  A  
Investors interested in the consumer staple space can also consider Post Holdings  Inc    NYSE POST    Kellogg Company   NYSE K   and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc    NYSE LW    While Post Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   both Kellogg and Lamb Weston hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

the year ago earnings of  0 49 Revenues MissKellogg reported revenues of  3 25 billion  reflecting a decrease of 4 1  year over year  marking the ninth straight quarter of a revenue decline  The weakness can be traced back to soft consumer demand across most parts of North America and Europe  Revenues fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 33 billion by 2 2  Currency hurt sales by 1

Morning Foods  Revenues slipped 6 3  to  719 million  Organic sales also declined 6 3   comparing unfavorably with the 1 1  decline in the previous quarter  The downside was mainly due to category

For tomorrow s BLS survey  analysts are looking for 188K  although this read fell precipitously in March  when the BLS only registered 98K new jobs  Aside from the disparity in such a wide range between results  if we see another heavily disappointing number from the BLS tomorrow morning  expect some downward pressure in stocks with questions about the health of U S  employment further spreading The March Trade Balance fell 0 1  month over month  but remains a significant deficit at  43 7 billion  Again  we ve yet to see any progress regarding trade deals manifest in the country s new federal agenda   which some market participants might have already thought would have happened by now   so until changes are made  we can expect our trade balance month over month to remain within a certain range Q1 Earnings  ContinuedEntertainment conglomerate Viacom   NASDAQ VIAB   beat expectations on both top and bottom lines before today s opening bell  beating earnings estimates by 20 cents per share to  0 79  Revenues easily topped the Zacks consensus of  3 056 billion to  3 256 billion  The stronger than expected numbers may reflect the recent managerial change at Viacom  although the company stated its future goals will take some time to be reached  Consumer staples major Kellogg Co    NYSE K   topped estimates on its earnings results  but missed on sales projections   1 06 per share beat our Zacks consensus by 5 cents  but the company s  3 25 billion in Q1 revenues missed our  3 33 billion expected  Organic revenues were down 4 4  year over year and  1 1  quarter over quarter  Hyatt Hotels   NYSE H   posted a huge beat on its bottom line this morning  putting up 73 cents per share in its Q1  more than triple the 24 cents in the Zacks consenus  Revenues also topped expectations with  1 19 billion beating the  1 14 billion we had been looking for  Mark VickerySenior Editor",2017-05-03,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/litany-of-morning-data:-productivity,-jobless-claims,-q1-earnings,-etc.-200187148",200187148

143867,365382,K,Kellogg s  K  Sales A Drag  Cost Saving Plans Bode Well,opinion,On Nov 29  we issued an updated research report on Kellogg Company   NYSE K    The company s shares have been lagging the broader Zacks categorized Food Miscellaneous Diversified Market since the beginning of the year  The stock has gained only 1 9  year to date  compared with the 5 4  gain of the broader food market KELLOGG CO Price    HiccupsKellogg s organic sales  excluding the extraordinary inflationary gains in Venezuela  declined 1 6  in the third quarter  2  in the second quarter and 1  in first quarter 2016 due to persistent weakness in North America and Europe  North America core sales declined 2 3  in the first nine months of 2016 due to soft U S  cereals and snack sales  This  in turn  compelled Kellogg to lower its 2016 sales guidance thrice this year  Kellogg has been struggling to boost sales over the past two years mainly due to weak performance in its developed market cereals and U S  snacks businesses  thanks to lower demand Again  Kellogg s mainstay U S  cereal business  which accounts for 40 45  of the sales  has been weak since 2012 due to sluggish category growth  Moreover  changing consumer views on health and wellness and shift in consumer attitude from dieting to health and wellness has hurt sales of Kellogg s weight management cereal brands like Special K and Kashi Meanwhile  the U S  snacks business has been struggling since 2013 due to weak volumes  Though Pringles has been doing well  the deterioration in U S  snacks is resulting from weakness in weight management products like Special K bars  Special K cracker chips and Right Bites  100 calorie cookie packs due to the same issues that hurt sales of weight management cereal brands Initiatives Driving MarginsKellogg boasts a legacy of over 100 years built on solid product portfolio and brand identity in both cereals and snacks  Popular Kellogg s brands include Kellogg s  Keebler  Pop Tarts  Eggo  Cheez It  Nutri Grain  Murray  Austin  Morningstar Farms  Famous Amos  Ready Crust and Kashi  In Jun 2012  the company acquired Procter   Gamble s snack unit  Pringles  which is now its second largest brand Meanwhile  in order to improve its sales performance  Kellogg is investing in brand building such as digital media  consumer promotions and traditional advertising  It is also investing in in store capabilities like increasing the sales forces of its struggling businesses   cereals and snacks Importantly  the company is following aggressive cost saving initiatives  In Nov 2013  Kellogg announced a four year restructuring program  Project K  to spur growth and profits  The program aims to optimize the supply chain through consolidation of facilities and elimination of excess capacity  improvement of productivity through consolidation of common processes or business services across multiple regions and functions along with bringing in a new global focus on categories Project K generated savings of around  180 million in 2015 and is likely to garner approximately  100 million of incremental savings in 2016  Annual cost savings from Project K are expected to be approximately  425  475 million by 2018 Apart from Project K  the company started an aggressive zero based budgeting  ZBB  program in 2015 in its North American business to generate savings  During 2016  the ZBB program was expanded to include the international segments of the business  The ZBB program is expected to generate an additional  150   180 million in savings in 2016 and  450   500 million over the 2016  2018 period During the third quarter  operating margin was up 260 basis points due to the favorable impact to brand building investment from ZBB efficiencies  savings realized from Project K and ZBB  and lower restructuring costs  integration costs and Venezuela remeasurement  Currency neutral comparable operating margin rose 110 basis points after excluding the year over year impact of restructuring  integration costs  Venezuela remeasurement  and foreign currency  During 2016  2018  adjusted profit margin is expected to increase by approximately 350 basis points from 2015 levels to

143885,365400,K,Mondelez To Buy License To Make  Sell Cadbury Biscuits,opinion,"Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the license to manufacture and sell Cadbury biscuits globally from Burton s Biscuit Company 
The companies have though agreed that under a co manufacturing agreement  the biscuits will continue to be manufactured in Burton s factories  The financial terms of the transaction remain undisclosed 
Cadbury was acquired by Mondelez  then Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC   Inc   in 2010 for about  19 billion to expand its presence in emerging markets
In the last reported quarter  second quarter of 2016   Mondelez saw strong biscuit sales in the U S   Germany and the UK which mitigated weakness in China and Brazil  Biscuits market share was challenged in some key markets like U S  and Brazil in the quarter 
Mondelez is a worldwide leader in biscuits  chocolate and candy and also holds a dominant position in gum  Its billion dollar    which generate revenues in excess of  1 billion    biscuit brands include Nabisco  Oreo and LU MONDELEZ INTL Price
   Last month  Mondelez announced mixed second quarter results  Mondelez beat second quarter estimates for earnings  but missed the same for sales  Adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share grew 4 5  as cost savings and higher non operating gains offset dilution from the coffee divesture and soft sales  Organic revenues rose 1 5  
While emerging markets growth remained weak  sales trends somewhat slowed down in North America due to aggressive trade spending by some competitors  Mondelez modestly reduced its 2016 organic revenue growth guidance due to increasing global category challenges 
Mondelez s key category   snacks   has slowed down due to soft global retail and consumer demand  Mondelez  like many other U S  food producers like Kellogg Company   NYSE K    General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    The Kraft Heinz Company   NYSE K    has struggled due to shifting consumer s preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food ",2016-08-16,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mondelez-to-buy-license-to-make,-sell-cadbury-biscuits-200148301",200148301
143886,365401,K,World Bond Fund Offers Surprising High Yield Opportunity,opinion,"Retirees seeking yield these days are having a rough time of it
You are having to accept lower rates or greater risk
Many are turning to equities at absurd valuations because they are in  safe  sectors
Absurd valuations render any sector  or any company  unsafe at any speed

Buying utilities at 25 times earnings or consumer staples at 30 times earnings or more is a fool s game  These are not growth stocks  Whenever prices are bid up and yields therefore reduced  the seeds of that sector s decline are planted  It takes only one untoward event and the weakness is exposed  and the stocks return to their historic channels 
There is a case to be made for bonds  but it certainly isn t the sovereign bonds of developed nations  Earlier this week  Jim Grant of Grant s Interest Rate Observer wrote 

 Sovereign debt is my nomination for the number one overvalued market around the world  You are earning nothing or less than nothing for the privilege of lending your money to a government that has pledged to depreciate the currency that you re investing in  

He s right  of course  It is lunacy to entrust your future well being to invest at a negative interest rate in an instrument underwritten by a country that has sworn to increase your cost of living  via an  acceptable and desirable  2  inflation rate   You get zero or less than zero from the same issuer that is dedicated to making you lose an additional 2  of purchasing power in order for the value of their debt to be decreased by 2  every year 

I know that many readers want at least some fixed income in their portfolios  If the issuer pays a fair return and remains solvent you know you will beat inflation and receive your capital back at maturity  It s that  fair return  part of the equation that has become so difficult to find  At maturity for the above negative rate sovereign bonds above  the issuing government may well have succeeded in their desire to pay back 50 cents on the dollar in real buying power  You should at least have been paid that much and more in order to stay ahead in purchasing power 
This leads me to look at some issuers that don t have the luxury of hoodwinking investors into exchanging illusory safety for certain reduction in purchasing power  One such find is the Matthews Asia Credit Opportunities Fund  MCRDX   It is not without risk  While Morningstar calls it a world bond fund  it is invested in a number of Asian companies  bonds  While 82  of its holdings are rated BBB   investment grade   or higher  it still is comprised of names less familiar to American investors  So our choice is to pay 47 times earnings for Kelloggs  NYSE K  because it is a name we know  and receive a 2 5  yield or to range a little further afield and buy a diversified fund with mostly A and BBB rated bonds and receive 4 5   all with less beta and the likelihood of some capital gain as well 
Nobody does Asia better than Matthews and I believe the yields will increase on its holdings over the next few months  That s because so many investors confuse the comfort they derive from the names they know with safety 
I would rather trust the decades of experience Matthews managers have as old Asia hands  They are going where the growth still exists  seeking the bonds of companies that are growing and filling the needs of expanding populations and significantly expanding middle classes 
Their theater of operations consists of all countries and markets in Asia  including developed  emerging  and frontier countries and markets from Pakistan to Japan and Indonesia to China 
When discussing the risks inherent in their investments in this area  Matthews says 

 Investments in Asian securities may involve risks such as social and political instability  market illiquidity  exchange rate fluctuations  a high level of volatility and limited regulation   Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks  as these countries are substantially smaller  less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets  

To which I would respond     Investments in developedmarket  Europe  North America  etc  securities may involve risks such as social and political instability  market illiquidity  exchange rate fluctuations  a high level of volatility and over regulation   and  Investing in developed markets involves different and potentially greater risks  as these countries are substantially larger  with the possibility that their failed central bank strategies may implode while freer open markets in the rest of the developing and emerging world allow the markets to contract and expand without the heavy hand of know it all bankers attempting to guide them  
 Ya pays your money and ya takes your chances   I would rather depend upon market forces to determine the success or failure of a company or nation  We ve given the developed market central bankers a decade and the best they can do is negative interest rates 
I applaud Matthews  decision to limit this fund s participation in even these more free markets  government bonds  Only 12 9  of MCRDX s holdings are in sovereign government bonds  the rest are invested in the bonds and convertible bonds  for a possible capital gain  of firms that  while they may be highly rated  are simply not well enough known outside the region or  sometimes  their home country to attract attention from US investors 
Investors the world over are seeking good returns and  with experienced fund managers  the risk that an individual issue will default as they occasionally will   is subsumed by the increased yield paid by all the other holdings  And history tells us that  at least over the past 15 years  such investments  in Asian high yield bonds  mind you  have returned 3 times what US stocks have returned with about one half the volatility  Indeed  in starting from the levels we see today  over this previous 15 year period  such investments earned 8  or more in the following 3 year period 
I began researching this investment approach back in April 2016  when I read a paper by Teresa Kong  portfolio manager of Matthews Asia Strategic Income Fund  MAINX  and the person selected to lead MCRDX as well 
She wrote then 

  it may seem counterintuitive  but in some respects  investing in high yield at this point in the cycle may potentially have less downside than buying U S  Treasuries because current spreads capture much of the credit risk   To be sure  it takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to buy when the majority is selling  But at today s downtrodden prices  there is margin for error even if we are wrong about the bottom  

She then provided the chart below 

I see MCRDX as a way to get higher yield from a dozen countries and scores of companies  big and small  across the Asian region  that I could never hope to uncover and research myself in this kind of depth  We are buying MCRDX

The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 59 on  2 89 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  15 million more on top  However our Select Consensus  which heavily weights our most accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting weaker revenue of  2 86 billion  Ahead of its earnings report  ConAgra has seen unfavorable revisions activity with revenue falling 7   Given the company s track record of poor revenue results  it comes as no surprise that sales are predicted to decline 25  on a year over year basis

That said  ConAgra continues to fall short on revenue quarter after quarter  The company s continued use of GMO s and other unhealthy byproducts has turned off a new wave of health fanatics  Furthermore  a strong U S  dollar  weak commodity conditions and intense competition have adversely hampered operations  Do you think CAG can beat estimates ",2016-04-06,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-has-conagra-found-its-sweet-spot-200124219,200124219

143937,365452,K,Will Q1 Earnings Hold a Surprise for Mondelez  MDLZ  Stock ,opinion,"Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 27  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6 12  
The global snacks company surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 8 22  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Mondelez s volume trends have been soft since 2014 due to category weakness as a result of lower demand  In 2015  divestiture of the coffee business as well as certain low margin businesses further hurt volumes  Moreover  the company generates around 80  of its sales from international markets  which exposes it to significant currency related headwinds 
Nonetheless  the company witnessed better than expected organic sales trends in 2015  The improvement came on the back of marketing support funded by cost savings from the  3 5 billion restructuring plan  The savings are being used to fund marketing investments and capacity expansion to accelerate top line and gain market share  We expect to see continued improvement in sales trends in the first quarter of 2016
Moreover  cost savings and productivity gains have helped the company maintain strong margins  We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Mondelez is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 39 cents 
Zacks Rank  Mondelez s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the food sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
The Kraft Heinz Co    NYSE K   with an Earnings ESP of  4 92  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Kellogg Co    NYSE K   with an Earnings ESP of  1 08  and a Zacks Rank  3

143938,365453,K,Will Q1 Earnings Hold A Surprise For Kellogg  K  Stock ,opinion,"Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 33  
The cereal and snacks company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 3 84  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Kellogg has been struggling to grow sales over the past two years mainly due to weak performance by its cereals in developed markets as well as a soft U S  snacks businesses owing to lower demand  To this end  the company has invested in brand building  in store capabilities and product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation of many existing products 
Moreover  cost savings from its re structuring program  Project K  are being deployed for renovation  innovation and brand support  which led to better than expected sales trends in 2015  especially in the U S  cereal businesses  We expect the positive trend to continue in the soon to be reported quarter as well 
Given the improved cereal trends witnessed in 2015  management expects the U S  Cereal business to grow a couple of percent in 2016  The overall Morning Foods business is expected to see moderate growth in 2016 
The Pringles snacks business also did well last year  We expect these trends to continue in the first quarter as well 
Moreover  improved organic sales growth and strong Project K cost savings have boosted margins despite higher investments in food and brand building  We expect further improvement in margins in the first quarter 
However  the U S  snacks business remains a drag  Also  with almost all the foreign currencies deteriorating in comparison with the U S  dollar  currency translations have proved to be a significant headwind of late  This is likely to limit revenue growth to some extent 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is  2 15  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 91 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 93 cents 
Zacks Rank  Kellogg has a Zacks Rank  2  However  a negative ESP complicates surprise prediction 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include

5 Sturdy Stocks to Play the Weakest Growth in 2 Years

As businesses and consumers turned cautious with their spending  the U S  economy posted its weakest quarterly growth in two years between January and March  Investors  confidence about the health of the economy also dwindled  with one of the key indicators touching a record low last week 

Stocks in defensive groups offer a good way to earn some decent returns in this slow growth environment  These stocks remain unperturbed by economic hurly burlies 

Weak Spending Cloud Q1 Growth

The U S  economy expanded at an annualized rate of 0 5  in the first quarter  its slowest pace in two years  according to the Commerce Department  This growth was way below last quarter s growth rate of 1 4   In response to weak global financial conditions and slump in oil prices  companies tightened their belts  resulting in lackluster economic growth in the opening months of the year 

Business investment tumbled the most in almost seven years  Nonresidential fixed investment or spending on equipment  structures and intellectual properties plummeted 5 9  at an annualized rate in the first quarter  Thanks to the significant decline in oil prices  capital spending on wells and shafts nosedived 86  in the quarter  the most since 1958 

As for consumer spending  which accounts for about two thirds of the U S  economy  the picture was also discouraging  Household purchases increased at an annual pace of 1 9   which is much less than the 2 4  increase in the final quarter of last year  In fact  purchases went up the least since early 2015  Spending failed to gain traction despite having consumer friendly fundamentals like low gasoline prices  lower borrowing costs  a steady rise in hiring and mostly warmer than expected winter weather  implying lower utility bills 

Retail Sales Weak  Orders Remain Flat

Retail sales a key barometer of consumer spending also dropped in March  Sales at retail stores and restaurants in the U S  declined 0 3  from last year as people trimmed their spending on car purchases  according to the Commerce Department  Auto sales plummeted 2 1  last month  the steepest decline in more than a year 

Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft remained unchanged in March after a downwardly revised 2 7  decline in February  according to the Commerce Department  This flat reading suggests that this important gauge of business spending has little or almost no momentum heading into the second quarter 

American s Confidence Shrinking

Lukewarm business and consumer spending together weighed on the U S  economy in the first quarter  American s confidence in the U S  economy also ebbed  The Gallup U S  Economic Confidence Index averaged a negative 16 for the week ending Apr 24 

This figure showed a four point drop from the previous week s average  The figure also touched its lowest point this year  The index not only rates how citizens feel about current economic conditions but also whether the economy is improving or getting worse 

5 Stocks to Buy for a Slow Economic Growth 

Given the pessimism about the state of the economy and weak spending levels resulting in soft growth  it will be wise to invest in stocks associated with the so called defensive sectors like the utilities  consumer staples and healthcare  Stocks from such sectors tend to be immune to the vagaries of the economy and in the process provide promising returns 

Demand for items such as electricity  gas and water tends to remain stable all through the year irrespective of the broader economic outlook  This makes investing in companies from the utilities sector a lucrative option  Utility companies boast predictable cash flows and generally give dividends to their investors  Steady dividend payments provide income to investors  which eventually make the stocks less volatile 

Food  beverages and personal care products are also essential  which makes investing in consumer staples companies a good option  Similarly  healthcare products and services are indispensable  This makes healthcare companies less susceptible to economic cyclicality  A slew of mergers and acquisitions  and an increase in innovative product pipelines and approvals will also collectively act as growth facilitators for healthcare firms 

We have selected five stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   However  it is important to remember that picking winning stocks may not be easy  Hence  we have narrowed down our search with a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners 

MYR Group  Inc     NASDAQ MYRG    through its subsidiaries provides electrical construction services in the United States and Canada  MYRG is headquartered in Rolling Meadows  IL  MYRG has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  B  

Coty Inc     NYSE COTY     with its subsidiaries  manufactures  markets  and distributes beauty products worldwide  COTY is headquartered in New York  COTY has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  B  

Kellogg Company    NYSE K    manufactures and markets ready to eat cereal and convenience foods  Kellogg is headquartered in Battle Creek  MI  The company has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  B  

HCA Holdings  Inc     NYSE HCA    through its subsidiaries provides healthcare services in the U S  HCA is headquartered in Nashville  TN  HCA has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of  A  

Emergent BioSolutions  Inc     NYSE EBS    is a specialty biopharmaceutical company that manufactures and sells specialized products to healthcare providers and governments in the U S  EBS is headquartered in Gaithersburg  MD  EBS has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Score of  B

143962,365477,K,Are Kellogg s Growth Days Really Gone Forever ,opinion,"Kellogg  NYSE K  owns many  food brands including Pringles  Eggo waffles  Pop Tarts  Cheez It  Keebler  and Austin  The company is best known for its iconic cereal brands  Kellogg s cereal brands include  Special K  Mini Wheats  Rice Krispies  Frosted Flakes  Froot Loops  and Corn Flakes 
Despite the company s portfolio of well known brands  Kellogg has grown revenue at just 4  a year over the last decade  The company s growth has slowed as consumers have begun to switch away from breakfast cereals 
It wasn t always this way  Kellogg has a long history of success 
The company was founded in Michigan in 1906  Kellogg has paid steady or increasing dividends for 50 consecutive years  It is one of the largest publicly traded packaged good food companies thanks to its market cap of  22 billion  The company s longevity is a result of it success in a  
Will Kellogg continue its legacy of success  or is the company falling victim to changing consumer tastes 
Recent Results Show Sluggish Growth
Kellogg managed to grow constant currency earnings per share 3  in its   Constant currency earnings per share growth of 3  is well below what investors in Kellogg are looking for 
The company s tepid growth is a result of its struggles in the United States  North American sales declined 8  versus the same quarter a year ago 
The company is seeing weakness across its North American brand portfolio  Each of the company s 4 North American segment s sales declines in its most recent quarter are shown below 
Morning Foods sales down 2 9 
Snacks sales down 1 1 
Specialty Channels sales down 2 5 
Other sales down 6 1 
The Morning Foods segment is the company s largest  responsible for 27  of operating profits  Continued sales declines in the segment come from weakness in cereal  It isn t just Kellogg that is seeing cereal sales decline  Rival General Mills  NYSE GIS  is experiencing similar problems as the cereal industry in the United States continues to lose ground 
Kellogg s  Other  segment is comprised of its Canadian business  frozen foods  and Kashi brand  Other sales declined precipitously  The decline was due in part to a  from certain Morning Star Farms products 
Kellogg is expecting flat or slightly declining constant currency earnings per share for fiscal 2015 as a result of weakness in the company s United States operations 
Despite all of the declines in North America  Kellogg did post positive constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth in its most recent quarter  The company managed earnings per share growth thanks to strength in its international operations 
International Operations Continue to Grow
Kellogg s international operations saw constant currency growth across the board  Kellogg s international operations are broken down into 3 segments  Each is shown below along with constant currency sales growth in the company s most recent quarter 
Europe sales up 1 0 
Latin America sales up 15 7 
Asia Pacific sales up 4 0 
International growth was led by Latin America  Kellogg has focused on growing Latin American sales in recent years  and the results are impressive 
Kellogg has 55  market share in the Latin American cereal market  The company s growth in the region is being fueled by strong cereal sales  the reverse of the trend in North America 
Kellogg has significant room for growth in international markets  The company already controls much of the Latin American cereal market  The company is seeing excellent growth in its Pringles brand as well  Pringles sales grew 10  in Europe in the company s most recent quarter 
Simply put  the international market is much larger than the North American market  Kellogg s future growth will come disproportionately from international growth 
The company was founded in Michigan  but its future is brightest outside the United States 
The Cereal Growth Plan
Kellogg s cereal sales have struggled over the last few years  The company has plans to return cereal to growth 
Kellogg owns two of the best known health focused cereal brands   and   The company will likely see continued growth in the health focused cereal market 
Kellogg fell behind in cereal by not focusing on what consumers are demanding  healthy cereal made with natural ingredients at a reasonable price that tastes good 
Kellogg s management has changed course  The company is now focusing on the health aspects of its cereals  The company is highlighting when products are  gluten free  and how they provide health benefits  Over time  this new approach to breakfast cereal should return the category to growth  Kellogg s still owns many of the most well known cereal brands and has the potential to capitalize on this brand equity 
Kellogg s Total Return Potential
Kellogg s management is expecting a long term earnings per share growth rate of 7  to 9  a year  From 2004 through 2010  Kellogg compounded earnings per share at 7 3  a year  Keep in mind  much of this growth occurred through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 
The company is certainly capable of delivering earnings per share growth in line with management s long term expectations 
Earnings per share have grown at just 4  a year from 2010 through 2014  Earnings per share growth has slowed to about 2 percentage points ahead of inflation as Kellogg s cereal sales have struggled 
The best case scenario for Kellogg is to return to  normal  growth of 6  to 8  a year  If the company continues to struggle in cereal  earnings per share will likely grow at around 3  to 5  a year  in line with more recent growth  As a result  the company has a long term earnings per share growth rate of between 3  and 8  a year 
I believe that a return to  normal  growth is significantly more likely than continued slow growth  Kellogg s brands are too well known  and the company has too much money to put into advertising to not return to its historical growth numbers 
Kellogg currently has a dividend yield of 3 1   The company s dividend yield combined with its  normal  growth rate of 6  to 8  a year gives investors total expected returns of 9  to 11  a year 
Valuation and Final Thoughts
Kellogg is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of just 16 6  using adjusted earnings   The company appears cheap relative to its growth potential and strong brands in slow changing industries 
If Kellogg returns its cereal category to growth  the company will likely trade for a price to earnings ratio closer to 20   a 25  premium over current prices 
Kellogg s current valuation combined with its high 3   dividend yield and potential for solid earnings per share growth makes the company a Top 20 stock using   The company is a buy for dividend growth investors willing to look beyond recent weakness in the company s cereal division ",2015-07-08,Sure Dividend,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-kellogg’s-growth-days-really-gone-forever-257654,257654

143975,365490,K,5 Things Every New Trader Should Do ,opinion,By Neda Jafarzadeh  a financial analyst with NerdWallet Investing  NerdWallet Investing helps investors select better mutual funds for their 401 k  plans  find the   and make smarter investment decisions overall  By its nature  investing is an exercise in uncertainty and risk and when your hard earned dollars are at stake  the pressure gets higher  That doesn t mean you should avoid online investing   on the contrary  a measured and responsible approach can greatly enhance your earnings and help you reach your financial goals  As you dip your toes into the investing waters  be sure that you keep in mind the following five steps  1  Decide what kind of investment you want to make First  you have to decide exactly how much money you re going to use for investing purposes   settle on a set dollar amount to begin with and don t let yourself exceed that limit  It is important  too  that you know exactly where that money is coming from  be it a savings account or a sum you ve received as a gift   and don t invest more than you can afford to lose  Apart from this being a responsible approach  settling on an amount will help you choose a broker  as many have minimum balance requirements  2  Have a safety net in place Before investing  make sure that you really can afford to do so   even beyond making sure that you only invest what you can afford to lose  you should ensure that you have an emergency account or fund set up that is readily available should an unforeseen expense arise  Many experts recommend that your savings be able to sustain you for at least six months  Consider stashing this money in a regular savings account  or perhaps in a money market account  which will have a higher interest rate  generally   3  Choose a broker There are wide ranges of brokers from which to choose and picking the right one for you will depend on the amount that you re investing and how active a  you plan to be  Planning to make frequent trades   say  at least ten a month  Consider a lesser known broker that offers discounted trade execution fees   even as low as  1  Looking for tons of resources and high quality customer service  Then an account with a household name such as Schwab might be the right fit  Keep in mind that the SEC and FINRA hold all brokerage firms to the same standards   so you should be able to fully trust any certified broker  4  Do the research Whether you re hands on or more laissez faire  you need to be making informed decisions with your money   and that means doing your own research  Peruse any research reports and don t be afraid to choose index funds over active funds  many studies have shown that active managers don t perform better than that the market index  In addition  always look at a fund s expense ratio for a better idea of after fee returns  Not only will you find better stock picks this way  you ll feel more confident and less hesitant about your choices  5  Stick to your principles  Now that you re invested  don t lose sight of your goals  or of the strategies you ve chosen to help you reach them  Purchase a range of securities  from stocks and commodities to obscure funds  to ensure that your portfolio is fully diversified  Identify markets that you find interesting  as that will make them easier to understand and more enjoyable to research  Most importantly  pick a reasonable goal   such as a 10  profit after one year   and then choose and invest decisively  confident in your ability to make informed selections  There is no room for hesitancy or second guessing in online investing ,2013-05-14,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-every-new-trader-should-do-166856,166856
143977,365492,K,Economic Storm Clouds Ahead,opinion,Economic forecasters exist to make astrologers look good  But the recent jubilance is enough to make even weather forecasters blush   Just look at the bull market  Look at home prices  Look at consumer confidence  Please I can understand the jubilation in the narrow sense that we ve been down so long everything looks up  Plus  professional economists tend to cheerlead because they believe that if consumers and businesses think the future will be great  they ll buy and invest more   leading to a self fulfilling prophesy But prophesies can t be self fulfilling if they re based on wishful thinking The reality is we re still in the doldrums  and the most recent data gives cause for serious worry Almost all the forward movement in the economy is now coming from consumers   whose spending is 70 percent of economic activity  But wages are still going nowhere  which means consumer spending will slow because consumers just don t have the money to spend On Thursday the Commerce Department  that consumer spending rose 3 4 percent in the first quarter of this year  But the personal savings rate dropped to 2 3 percent   from 5 3 percent in the last quarter of 2012  That s the lowest level of savings since before the Great Recession  You don t have to be an economic forecaster  or an astrologer  to see this can t go on Yes  home prices are rising  The problem is  they re beginning to rise above their long run historical average   Before the housing crash they were were way  way above the long run average   So watch your wallets  We ve been here before  The Fed is keeping interest rates artificially low  allowing consumers to get low home equity loans and to borrow against the rising values of their homes  Needless to say  this trend  too  is unsustainable What about the stock market  It s time we stopped assuming that a rising stock market leads to widespread prosperity  Over 90 percent of the value of the stock market   including 401 k s and IRAs   is held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population Moreover  the main reason stock prices have risen is corporate profits have soared  But that s largely because corporations have slashed their payrolls and keep them low  Which brings us full circle  back to the fundamental fact that wages that are going nowhere for most people Not even fat corporate profits are sustainable if American consumers don t have enough money in their pockets  Exports can t make up for the shortfall  given the rotten shape Europe is in and the slowdown in Asia So don t expect those profits to continue  In fact  the new Commerce Department report shows that corporate profits shrank in the first quarter  reversing some of the gains in the second half of 2012 And  by the way  the full effect of the cuts in government spending hasn t even been felt yet  The sequester is going to be a large fiscal drag starting next month  Look  I don t want to rain on the parade  But any self respecting weather forecaster would warn you to zipper up and take an umbrella  Don t be swayed by all the sunny talk  There are too many storm clouds ahead ,2013-06-02,Robert B.

143994,365509,K,Italy Faces Ugly Future Without Reforms  Eurozone Exit,opinion,If Italy s  EWI  economic situation seems dire right now  it should be said that it has capacity to become significantly worse in the next decade  Italy faces a demographic timebomb that is likely to further exacerbate its lack of competitiveness  high corruption  and other major economic issues  For many developed nations  entitlement programs have become a major source of economic strain  These programs are often designed on a  pay as you go  basis  so that current retirees are largely funded by taxes from the current working age populace  This contrasts with a 401 k    compulsory savings type system  where one s contributions go directly to fund their own retirement  The difference between the two types of systems is expounded upon by the Washington Post s Robert Samuelson  In his article      he explains how American President Franklin D  Roosevelt initially conceived Social Security more as a compulsory savings system  rather than a pay as you go welfare system  While Samuelson is discussing the issue in the context of the US Social Security system  Italy and most of Europe rely on similar  pay as you go  entitlement programs  Unfortunately  this type of system creates a nightmare scenario for nations with aging populaces  Things are bad enough in the United States  where we re worried about having only 2 working age taxpayers to support 1 retiree in the upcoming years  as opposed to 3 or 4   Italy would love to have  our problem   as it has one of the ugliest demographic scenarios moving forward  Population Pyramids To get a sense of how bad things can become  take a look at the population pyramid for the United States versus Italy  Below  you can see the projected demographic progression in the US over the next 32 years The US may see a lower percentage of younger workers in the total pyramid  but at least the base is consistently larger than the top of the pyramid  the retirees   In 2025  the number of Americans projected between the ages of 65   69 appears to be in the ballpark of 21 million  Whereas  the number of Americans between the ages of 30   34 is projected to be around 24 million  It s not an ideal ratio to maintain entitlement programs like Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid  but it s not completely overwhelming either Compare that to Italy s demographic projections for the same timeframe  In 2025  Italy is projected to have about 4 0 million people between the ages of 65   69  but only 3 6 million between the ages of 30   34  It gets worse  By 2035  the 65 69 age range is projected to have about 4 6 million people  while the 30 34 age grouping will still have only 3 3 million  Those aren t good numbers when your entire system depends on working age adults paying the way for retirees  What this means is that either younger Italians are going to have to pay significantly higher taxes to sustain this system  retirement benefits are going to have to be greatly curtailed  or a combination of the two  which is most likely   Italy already has some of the highest taxes in the world  with tax revenues as a percentage of GDP   so further tax increases are going to be difficult to swallow  It s difficult to imagine that new taxes wouldn t constrain Italy s already horrendous economic growth  and put even more pressure on the system internally  What About Economic Growth  Speaking of economic growth  Italy may very well have the worst record of growth in the entire developed world over the past three decades  In my view  per capita income growth is the most important measure of economic progress  It does have a few flaws  as it does not account for income disparities  nor does it account for rapid migration  particularly from lower income nations   All the same  it s generally the best measure available for wealth creation  so long as you account for its weaknesses  The chart below examines thirty  Tier 1 Economies   i e  highly developed economies  over the past three decades  examining GDP per capita growth  real GDP growth  and population growth  As you can see Italy s GDP per capita growth is near the bottom of the chart  in spite of having low increases in population  Of the five nations ranked below Italy in per capita income growth  three have significantly higher population growth rates  U A E   Saudi Arabia  and New Zealand  which skew their figures downward  This suggests that in reality  those three nations are doing significantly better  Even at 0 7  population growth  it can be argued that Switzerland fared much better than Italy  particularly considering the high level of per capita income it began with in 1980  I d argue that Italy has the absolute worst stats of the entire group and Greece is the only nation that could conceivably compete for that title  1 2  per capita income growth over the past 31 years is particularly dismal  especially considering the extremely low population growth rate of 0 2  in that timeframe  In terms of real GDP growth  Italy ranked 29th out of 30th  with only Greece performing worse  Things Getting Worse With Time Italy fares very poorly on the stats in the chart above  but the chart below also showcases how their performance has gotten worse over time  The chart shows annualized GDP and GDP per capita growth rates for similar nations  European nations  US  Canada  Japan  etc   The column headings correspond with the timeframe  For instance   21 Yr  means  21 Year Annualized Growth Rate   As you can see  Italy s GDP and GDP per capita growth rates fall over time  with the 51 year growth rate being the highest  for GDP  at 2 7   while the 11 year growth rate is a paltry 0 4   None of this is explained by population growth which is relatively similar for both periods at 0 6  for 11 years and 0 4  for the entire 51 year period  We see the same trend in GDP per capita growth  with the 31 year growth rate at 1 2  and the 11 year growth rate being  0 2   In fact  with one exception  Italy is the only  Tier 1 Economy  to have negative GDP per capita growth over the past 11 years  That exception  I mentioned earlier  is the U A E   where the per capita growth is skewed downward by rapid migration in from lower income nations  From this data  we can see that many developed nations that have done a poor job at creating wealth for their citizens over the past few decades  e g  France  Denmark  Belgium   but Italy appears to be the only one that is actively destroying wealth  The Euro If all that weren t bad enough  the Euro is an even bigger problem  The Euro has  of many of the Southern European economies  including Spain  Portugal  and Italy  It s estimated that  with Germany as a result of the Euro  Spain  Portugal  and Italy have all run  over much of the past few years  For 2011  Italy s current account deficit was around 3 1  of GDP  though  it has   Even if that sounds like good news    falling 2 7  YOY in the October report  possibly a result of   These tax increases were a major issue in the Italian elections  with voters increasingly angry over them  However  it s basically a choice between higher taxes and cutting Italy s massive welfare state  The only hope to offset this would be via growth in exports  which isn t likely to happen unless Italy exits the eurozone  Conclusions While many economists and market analysts expect the Eurozone to hold up under all pressures  I ve been a bit contrarian in expecting that at least a few  if not more  nations would eventually exit  I see Italy as a prime candidate  Unless Germany wants to create a perma bailout fund for Italy over the next two decades  or alternatively  creates some sort of mechanism to redistribute wealth to Italy  I find it difficult to imagine that Italy can stay solvent without absurdly high rates of unemployment and wealth destruction  It makes vastly more sense for Italy to exit the euro  make structural reforms  and take steps to regain its competitiveness  Indeed  the  in Italy may very well signal this is the direction the populace is beginning to clamor for  Italy likely has a rocky road ahead  no matter which direction it goes  But given its structural and demographic problems  it s only real hope to regain competitiveness and improve its dismal economic situation  is a eurozone exit  Investment Implications You might think given my negative outlook for Italy  I would recommend a short on Italian bonds or equities  but much to the contrary  my stance on the eurozone has consistently been to stay away entirely  In spite of the terrible headwinds that Italy will have to deal with over the next decade  everything comes down to the decisions of politicians  which are often arbitrary and haphazard  I plan on keeping a close eye on nations like Spain  Italy  France  and Portugal over the next few years  but will probably not make any moves long or short until one nation makes a eurozone exit  Then it will be time to reassess things ,2013-03-05,Jake

144000,365515,K,How Growth In The Entitlement   Protectionist State Has Increased,opinion,Yahoo published an interesting article about   It was based on a comment by Senator Elizabeth Warren  stating that if minimum wage growth has increased with productivity  the current minimum wage should be  22  The interesting trend that Elizabeth Warren fails to note is that the growth in wealth disparity in the US largely coincides with the growth of the welfare   entitlement   protectionist state  This isn t a coincidence  Programs like Social Security  Medicaid  and Medicare have resulted in a massive burden to middle income employees  which have reduced their upward mobility  We re frequently told these programs aid the middle class  but they require us to pay a tax of 15 3  every year  and we receive little in return  Social Security is the most egregious offender in many ways  since over 12 5  of our wealth is taken away from us  and in return  we get the money back only with inflation  or in other words  we make a 0  real return  Technically  even this is optimistic since the real return you receive on Social Security is based on a complicated formula that is only somewhat related to how much you contribute  In reality  it s possible that the average real return on Social Security is negative  Even in a worst case scenario  most Americans would make significantly higher returns with a 401 k  account than they do with Social Security  Meanwhile  Medicaid and Medicare have created massive economic distortions in the healthcare system  which has led to a cost spiral  In the late 1960 s  US healthcare costs were on par with the rest of the developed world  By 2013  our costs are significantly higher than everywhere else  and it s almost perfectly correlated with the rise of Medicare and Medicaid  The fact that our tax system encourages employers to maximize insurance coverage also helps create misaligned incentives that encourage over consumption  driving up costs further  It s also somewhat misleading to say that American incomes haven t increased over the past several decades  Rather  what s more true to say is that our incomes are being increasingly eaten up by healthcare expenses  Expect this trend to continue with the latest Federal abomination  the Affordable Care Act  i e   Obamacare    It s worthwhile to note that the two sectors of the economy where expenses have increased the greatest are in healthcare and education  These just happen to be the two sectors where the most Federal government intervention has occurred over the past five decades  in order to supposedly promote  affordability   In essence  while Elizabeth Warren bemoans rising income inequality in America  it s the policies that she supports that have fueled this disparity  It s true that the rich are getting richer  while the middle class stagnates  but that s largely because the rich aren t as vulnerable to the ill affects of the growing entitlement state  whereas the middle class is buried by it  This is why individuals are best equipped to make their own economic decisions  When technocrats try to intervene to improve things  they inevitably make them worse by applying one size fits all solutions to all middle income Americans  The past fifty years is proof of this ,2013-03-20,Jake Huneycutt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-growth-in-the-entitlement---protectionist-state-has-increased-159702,159702
144001,365516,K,Classic  Get to Know The Holders  Hands  Part 1,opinion,Note  this was published at RealMoney on 7 1 2004  This was part three of a four part series  Part One is lost but was given the lousy title  Managing Liability Affects Stocks  Pt  1  If you have a copy  send it to me Fortunately  these were the best three of the four articles Investing StrategiesDifferent investor groups in the market have different patterns of funding and disbursement Understand those patterns to read market action more clearly and see what trends might emerge Recently  the firm I work for held a large amount of the common stock of Phoenix  PNX NYSE   As the stock rallied  I kept moving out my sell target  because the technicals on the stock were so compelling  There were no analysts saying buy  there were a few saying sell and the short interest was high  The company was doing all the right things and the stock had great price momentum  but the valuation was just too high  I wanted to sell  but I couldn t figure out when Finally  on Feb  21  the stock price began to rally on no news  Going to the message boards  I discovered that there was a momentum investor with a radio show who was making one of his occasional television appearances  and was touting Phoenix  I went to our trader and said that we had our chance  There was a group of valuation insensitive buyers buying the stock with abandon  I said   Ride the ask  offer stock at the asking price   and if you get any thick bids near the ask  hit them    Read  If there are aggressive large bidders  sell to them at their level   We sold our position in two weeks  without disturbing the market  we were able to get an average price of about  14 25   Our trader is top notch   Today the price of Phoenix is about 15  lower  The momentum investors choked on the stock that we  and others  fed them Why did this work for us  We understood two aspects of how Phoenix traded very well  the fundamentals and technicals  The fundamentals taught us what fair value should be  but the technicals taught us how investors would react to movements in the stock price Every investor has a mode of funding and a mode of disbursement  The funding and disbursement modes affect how long and under what conditions an investor wants to  or is able to  hold his position  Some examples will illustrate general principles of these modes  I will describe the ways that various classes of investors fund their investments  how their investments are held  how they are liquidated and how all of this affects what kinds of investments they can use from both an asset class and liquidity standpoint  I also will attempt to explain how the behavior of some classes of investors can become temporarily self reinforcing  leading to booms and busts  Finally  I will try to give some practical advice along the way as to how you can benefit from the behaviors of different classes of investors 1  Banks and Other Depositary InstitutionsBanks make promises to depositors  Some of these promises are absolute  some are contingent on external events  Bank regulations exist to make the keeping of the promises more certain  or  in modern times  keep the guarantee funds solvent   Banks have to keep adequate capital on hand to provide a margin of safety against insolvency  The amount of capital varies on the immediacy with which deposits may be withdrawn  the degree of equity credit risk of the assets and how well the asset cash flows are matched to the liability cash flows Liquid assets must be set aside to meet the amount of funds that may be withdrawn immediately with little or no penalty  The more that is set aside  the lower the risk and the lower the profit  If the assets are materially longer or contain more equity risk than a money market like investment  there may be a loss when the assets are liquidated to pay off depositors  In general  the cash flows of assets must be matched to the liabilities that fund them  at least in aggregate This biases banks to hold primarily short  to intermediate term  high quality fixed income assets  bonds  loans  mortgages and mortgage backed securities  These are generally safe investments  but banks are fairly leveraged institutions  If the market moves against their investments and their capital cushion gets eroded to the point where their ability to operate becomes questionable to regulators  or customers   the banks might be forced to sell investments into a falling market in order to preserve solvency The first motive of a financial institution is to survive  the second is to profit  When the first motive is threatened  even if there is a good possibility that the institution will survive and make more money if it retains the assets that now are perceived as risky  in general  the risky assets will get sold to assure survival at the cost of current profitability To return to a concept I discussed in the first column I wrote for RealMoney  Valuing Financial Slack in the Steel Sector  banks with a high degree of leverage relative to the overall riskiness of their assets and liabilities possess little in the way of financial slack  Volatility in the markets that cuts against their position harms such companies  They end up becoming forced sellers and buyers Banks with financial slack can enjoy volatility  When the markets are dislocated  they can make room on their balance sheets to wave in securities that are distressed and temporarily trading below intrinsic value  During times of volatility  the strong benefit at the expense of the weak  whereas weak firms outperform during periods of stability  As an example  after the real estate crisis in 1989 1992  the banks that did the best over the whole cycle were those that did not become overleveraged  did not over lend to marginal credits and had diversified operations  During the crisis  they had the flexibility to lend in situations of their choosing at favorable yields 2  Insurance CompaniesInsurance companies are like banks but generally have longer funding bases and typically run at a higher ratio of surplus to assets  Insurance companies typically have more ways to lose money than banks  and potential cash flow mismatches in the longer liability structure require more capital to fund potential losses  In principle  the higher surplus levels and the longer liabilities should allow for investment in longer duration assets like equities  but the regulations make that difficult  Surplus is limited  what gets used for equities can t be used for underwriting As a counterexample  consider what happened to the European insurance industry in 2002  European insurers are allowed to invest much more in equities than their U S  counterparts can   Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A NYSE  is an interesting exception here   As the bull market of the 1990s came to an end  European insurers found themselves flush with surplus from years of excellent stock market returns  and adequate  if declining  underwriting performance  The fat years had led to sloppiness in underwriting from 1997 to 2001 During the bull market  many of the European insurers let their bets ride and did not significantly rebalance away from equities  Running asset policies that were  in hindsight  very aggressive  they came into a period from 2000 to 2002 that would qualify as the perfect storm  large underwriting losses  losses in the equity and corporate bond markets and rating agencies on the warpath  downgrading newly weak companies at a time when higher ratings would have helped cash flow  In mid 2002  their regulators delivered the coup de grace  ordering the European insurers to sell their now depressed stocks and bonds into a falling market  Sell they did  buying safer bonds with the proceeds  Their forced selling put in the bottom of the stock and corporate bond markets in September and October of 2002  Investors with sufficient financial slack  like Warren Buffett  were able to wave in assets at bargain prices This principle may be articulated more broadly as   The tightest constraint dominates investment policy   As an example  an insurer that already was at a full allocation on junk bonds could not take advantage of the depressed levels in the junk bond markets  such investors were biting their nails  wondering if they would make it through alive  Another example occurred in 1994  when the most volatile residential mortgage bonds were blowing up  Insurance companies that had a full allocation to that class could not buy more when prices were at their most attractive  Companies and investors that rarely bought the  toxic waste  of the residential mortgage bond market began scooping up bonds at discounts unimaginable previously  A number of flexible investors  including St  Paul  now St  Paul Travelers  and Marty Whitman both ventured outside their ordinary investment habitats to benefit from the crisis 3  Defined Benefit Pension PlanDefined benefit plans need cash to fund payments to beneficiaries  The amount and timing of the benefit payments vary with plan demographics  sex  age and income   physical roughness of the industry and the specific plan provisions  e g   late retirement  early retirement  etc    Inflows to DB plans depend on funding levels and the financial health of the company sponsoring the plan  For an individual DB plan  the cash inflow and outflow characteristics will help determine the plan s asset allocation  together with the risk tolerance of the plan sponsor  The more risk averse a plan is  the less capable it is of funding inflows  and the older the plan s participant population  the larger the proportion of assets that will go into bonds and other safer investments For all DB plans in aggregate  though  the cash flow and demographic characteristics mirror those of the Old Economy  DB plans were created back in the days when the relationships between employer and employed were more fixed than they are now  In the current era of more short lived employment relationships and with the average age of participants in DB plans rising  these plans face several challenges Net cash outflows are getting closer There are fewer cash inflows Plans are being terminated  or converted to cash balance plans  due to cost  economic weakness and inflexibility DB plans are major holders of equity and debt in the U S   but they are not as great a force as they once were  Defined contribution plans  i e  401 k s  403 b s  etc   are bigger now  The relative decline and aging of DB plans has had  and will continue to have  two effects in the market  First  because of aging  there will be a greater relative demand for bonds  Second  DB plans have always had a long investment time horizon  That is shrinking now  DB plans tend to resist trends in the market  they tend to rebalance to a fixed asset allocation  which leads them to buy low and sell high  DB plans were the ones selling equities in March 2000 and buying in October 2002  their rebalancing strategies insured that  As DB plans become a smaller fraction of the investor base  markets will become more volatile due to the reduction in long horizon capital in the market 4  EndowmentsEndowments plan to survive forever  Forever is a tough mandate Inflows to endowments are uncertain  and outflows are fairly constant  They have spending formulas  the most common of which has the charity spending a constant percentage each year  usually 4  to 6  of the endowment   In the old days  say 10 years ago  most formulas allowed charities to spend income  which was defined as dividends plus net capital gains   Within these constraints  endowments behave like defined benefit plans 5  Mutual FundsMutual funds do not face any fixed funding or disbursement  Their flows come from retail money chasing past performance  Managers that do well face the blessing of attracting more funds  which they hope will not dilute their returns  Managers that do poorly have funds withdrawn from them  forcing them to liquidate investments that they otherwise think are promising  If a manager is a big enough investor in a given company s stock  think of Janus  concentrated portfolios   this can have the effect of worsening performance as liquidation goes on  or boosting the already good performance of managers that are receiving cash inflows to a concentrated fund These tendencies become more pronounced the better or worse that performance gets  When performance is near the median level  say  within the second and third quartiles  performance driven fund flows are small  For many mutual fund managers  this gives them the incentive to never drift too far away from the benchmark  whether that is an equity index or an average portfolio of peers  There is safety in the pack  even if there might be more grass to eat further from the herd  It is rare for a mutual fund manager to be fired for being mediocre 6  Index FundsWhat is true of regular mutual funds is also true of index funds  but the difference between the two helps illuminate a basic idea on demographics  Aside from taking market share away from active managers  when do index funds receive and disburse funds  The answer lies mainly in the demographics of investors When investors are younger  they invest surplus cash  When they are older  particularly after retirement  they liquidate investments to generate cash  Given the demographics in the U S   the excess return for merely belonging to the S P 500 has been roughly 4  per year over the past 15 years  index funds have received disproportionate large inflows relative to the market as a whole  Aside from that  in aggregate  active equity managers benchmark to something that approximates the S P 500  Belonging to the S P 500 ensures a continuing flow of capital Or does it  What will happen near 2020  when aggregate investment behavior changes from saving to liquidation  Belonging to major indices may not have the same cachet as investors liquidate their holdings to fund present needs  What was 4  positive in the 1990s could become 4  negative in the 2020s  absent a continuing move toward passive investing I don t have a firm answer here  but I do have suspicions  I would be cautious of too much index exposure 15 years from now  to the extent it can be avoided   And of course  this will be anticipated several years before the flows turn negative  7  Unleveraged Private InvestorsSometimes private investors feel disadvantaged vs  larger institutional players  but there are advantages that unleveraged private investors have that institutional players often don t  the abilities to invest for the long term  concentrate and do nothing Institutional investors are subject to the tyranny of constant measurement because they manage money for others  As I have noted before  measurement affects how a manager invests  particularly when it might affect the amount of assets under management  or the receipt of incentive fees  This encourages managers to be both short term in their orientation and more like an index  It also encourages hyperactivity  clients often expect a manager to make changes to the portfolio even when doing nothing could be the most prudent policy Unleveraged private investors can make aggressive investment decisions  They can concentrate their portfolios or consider more esoteric areas of the market  They also can back away from the market if they feel that opportunities are absent  Finally  they can buy and hold  which is not always an option for institutions  They can t always ride out long but temporary dips in the price of an asset That an unleveraged private investor can do these things doesn t mean he should  Using these advantages presumes a level of expertise in the market well in excess of the average investor  Most investors are average and should index  Those with skill should use it to their maximum advantage  realizing that they are taking their own financial life in their hands  the risks to such an approach are significant  but the same is true of the rewards Unleveraged private investors have needs for cash  Some will need it for college  retirement  a second home  etc  The sooner that an investor will need to liquidate a significant portion of his portfolio  the more conservative the portfolio must be to achieve those spending goals  Looking at private investors in aggregate  this would mean that as the baby boomers approach and enter retirement  there might be a tendency for the overall willingness to take risk in the markets to decline  Also  once the baby boomers are in retirement  assets will have to be liquidated to support them  which will be a drag on the markets at that time ,2013-04-24,David Merkel,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/classic:-get-to-know-the-holders’-hands,-part-1-164226",164226
144002,365517,K,May Day In Turkey  The Problems Turkish Workers Face,opinion,As an avid fan of   I am used to regularly getting teargassed by the police  Therefore  I did not make a big deal of it when my friend told me he and his wife had been introduced to pepper spray on May Day  After all  as our interior minister noted some time ago  it is organic and therefore perfectly healthy  In fact  I did not make my friend s ordeal a big deal because Turkish workers have much bigger problems than getting peppersprayed once a year  I got the inspiration for the column from a Business Insider piece showing that corporate profits are record high  while wages as share of GDP are at an all time low in the U S   and hence the title for this post  There was actually some sharp response to a recent Thomas Friedman NYT article that was basically arguing that today s world is  tailored  for anyone who is self motivated and that a 401 k  plan puts your destiny in your own hands  Felix Salmon  for one    and he has a couple of links to good articles by Yves Smith and Matt Yglesias on 401 k   Speaking on Yglesias  he has  that I hyperlinked to in the column  Shifting gears  I mentioned in the column that there are sharp swings in Turkish wage share numbers  hinting at data problems  but there is a logical explanation as well  Note that wage share bottoms out during the 1994 1995 crisis and then starts rising  However  interestingly enough  the fall after the Turkish recovery program  remember that there was a sharp fiscal contraction in 2003 2005  continues  but then data ends   This is just begging for further research  Why did the wage share continue falling  What happened to wage share after 2006  Etc etc  Shifting gears  Taylan Bilgic  ex econ and news editor of HDN  now at Bloomberg   makes more or less the same point as me that work accidents happen more in booming sectors  He uses the construction sector as example  but he also refers to the Tuzla shipyard deaths as well  But I wish someone would provide more analytical proof on my  and his  argument  On my point about the skills match  I saw a lot of that in   We had very colorful stories  some of which we carried over the report  on how companies were not able to find students with the skills they requested  As in last week s post  I got pretty good reader feedback as well  some of which I d like to carry over here  A reader was not very happy that I said there is no data on corporate profits in Turkey  she even sent me a Bloomberg terminal page with corporate profits  Can t argue with that  right  Well  the problem is that these are public companies  and since the Turkish stock market cap is less than half of GDP  it is not a good reflection of the Turkish corporate sector  The reader argued it may give an idea  but there are several issues I am not sure how to handle  all related to how representative a sample of the Turkish corporate sector is Borsa Istannbul  BIST   The Central Bank has a survey  and the firms there are supposed to represent the corporate sector well  so maybe we could use that  or even a combination of BIST and that  But it is definitely not 5 minutes of work  Moving on  another reader had the following comment over at Twitter   Currently  those who play by the rules get punished   Great remark  the Fuhrer could not have said it better himself    As an SME owner who plays by the rules  I wanted to make this point in the column  as I feel like an idiot because my competitors don t and can lower prices this way  So I am grateful to him for bringing this up  A couple of readers were not very happy about my points that severance pay is too high in Turkey and labor regulations are too strict  As an alternative  I would propose the solution offered by Istanbul think tank BETAM  They propose a severance pay fund  whereby employers would transfer a small premium over to employees  accounts each month  As they explain in detail in the report  this system would increase coverage  providing unconditional access to all workers  It would also encourage formal employment by lowering the cost of firing  and hiring  workers  Finally  it would bring  real  mobility to the labor market and decrease mismatches  There would also a small but non negligible impact on the household savings rate  alleviating one of the Turkish economy s main problems  And if these personal accounts are managed by the private sector  as BETAM is recommending  it would also increase financial deepening and literacy  My general view on severance is this  Right now  there is a lot of incentive on not to pay it because  1  it is too high so you make a lot of money by not paying it  2  there isn t enough inspection  and so the probability of getting caught doing this is low  What is the solution  Lessen the incentives for not paying by making it less costly and increasing the probability of getting caught  Another reader had a specific request   please tell us how to alleviate this and why the government is not doing much about it neither and why the workers put up with all the shenanigans about employment   Well  there is no magic formula  but Turkey has to give up protecting jobs instead of workers  Specific policy recommendations are beyond the scope of this post  which has already become too long  but I could refer anyone interested to actual Turkish labor economists  other than knockoff ones like me who pretend to me one once or twice a year  who have thought about these issues much more than I have  Finally   linking  erroneously I should add  May Day to communism  I saw a similar piece in the WSJ of late  I guess the right wing still continues to associate a worker s holiday that began in the U S   but is not celebrated on May 1 there anymore  with communism  As Brad DeLong noted   the Wall Street Journal editorial page works day and night 365 days a year to make Marx s prediction come true   The prediction he s referring to is  in his words  that even though the ruling class could appease the working class by using the state to redistribute and share the fruits of economic growth it would never do so  They would be trapped by their own ideological legitimations they really do believe that it is in some sense  unjust  for a factor of production to earn more than its marginal product  Hence social democracy would

144032,365547,K,Let s Revisit  Will Uncle Sam Take Over Your IRA   Part II ,opinion,With so much attention on the fiscal cliff and how Congress might address the issues surrounding our deficit  this commentary from this past April is going absolutely viral throughout the blogosphere today  I welcome reposting it  LD   Those engaged in massive strategic maneuvers know all too well that progress is typically made not in one fell swoop but painstakingly inch by inch  With deficits beyond the scope of imagination but oh so very real  I cautioned people to keep a watchful eye on Uncle Sam  Where might the old man go to beg  borrow  or steal money to fill that enormous fiscal hole  Your retirement accounts  I first broached this topic in early 2010 in writing   and   Fast forward and we now witness rumblings around Washington that the drunken sailors disguised as our political leaders are discussing how to make a move on your retirement savings  This tactical assault deserves to be front page news on every credible financial periodical  Regrettably  but not surprisingly  the only outlet which I could find carrying this story is The New York Post which wrote    Uncle Sam  in a desperate attempt to fix its  16 trillion plus deficit  is leering over Americans  retirement nest egg as its new bailout fund  Capitol Hill politicians are assessing tax changes that could let the Internal Revenue Service lay claim to a portion of the  18 trillion sitting in 401 k  accounts and other tax breaks used by middle class workers  including cutting the mortgage tax deduction  A commission looking for ways to close the deficit  and  noting the extent of 401 k  tax breaks  recommends an examination of the system as one way to prevent government bankruptcy  Under current 401 k  rules  total employee employer contributions can t exceed  50 000  In the proposed rule change  employer employee contributions would be limited to 20 percent of the employee s compensation  with a maximum of  20 000  the so called 20 20 proposal  This component strikes me as merely a tax on savings  When will the nitwits in Washington realize that our nation needs to increase its savings rate  not decrease it  But  please  now break out your vomit bag and then rally the neighbors  Another proposal being discussed in Congress says all tax deductions on 401 k s and IRAs to be replaced with an 18 percent credit  The credit  according to a proposal that has been endorsed by economist William Gale  would be placed directly in a person s retirement account  What does this mean  You will pay a tax NOW on your retirement savings and be granted a government credit which kicks in LATER  This tactical assault is little more than another government scam  Do you want a government credit which can be massively devalued over time by inflationary policies implemented by the Federal Reserve   Unlike the current system   Gale told Congress   workers  and firms  contributions to employer based 401 k  accounts would no longer be excluded from income and would be subject to taxation  contributions to IRAs would no longer be tax deductible and any contributions to a 401 k  plan would be treated as taxable income   In other words  the employee and employer would no longer get a deduction under the Gale plan  they would qualify for a credit  And the credit would  increase  government  revenues by about  458 billion   Gale says  My immediate reactions to learning about these discussions last evening are two fold  1  Taxation without representation is tyranny   2  Get the pitchforks ready and clean out the back of the trucks so we can haul the charlatans behind these assaults out of our nation s capitol   stated figuratively of course    How many people out there who have played by the rules  saved  paid in  and supported our government have had enough  Do not think for a second that these maneuvers by Uncle Sam are the end of his assault on our savings  We are supposed to blindly and willingly accept a change in the rules of the retirement savings operation while the dysfunctional elitists in Washington squander OUR money on prostitutes  boondoggles  gallivanting  and largesse to THEIR political supporters  I DON T THINK SO   If you agree with my sentiments  I hope you will share this story so we can draw the line and make our stand ,2012-11-30,Larry Doyle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/let’s-revisit:-will-uncle-sam-take-over-your-ira-(part-ii)-145615,145615
144033,365548,K,How To Find The Best Style ETFs,opinion,Finding the best ETFs is an increasingly difficult task in a world with so many ETFs to choose from  You Cannot Trust ETF Labels There are at least 38 different large cap value ETFs and at least 216 ETFs across all styles  Do investors need that many choices  How different can the ETFs be  Those 38 large cap value ETFs are very different  With anywhere from 30 to 1 351 holdings  many of these ETFs have drastically different portfolios  which creates drastically different investment implications  I am sure that large cap value ETFs hold many of the same big stocks such as International Business Machines  IBM   Chevron  CVX  and 3M  MMM   However  investors need to know what else those ETFs hold before they can say they have done their due diligence  The same is true for the ETFs in any style as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks  Some styles have lots of good stocks and offer lots of good ETFs  The opposite is true for others while some styles lie in between with a fair mix of good and bad stocks  For example  large cap value  per my 4Q Style Rankings report  ranks fourth out of 12 styles when it comes to providing investors with quality ETFs  Large cap blend ranks first  Small cap value ranks last  The bottom line is that investors cannot trust ETF labels or names  They do not tell you what you are getting when you buy an ETF  Paralysis By Analysis I firmly believe ETFs for a given style should not all be that different  I think the large number of large cap value  or any other  style of ETFs hurts investors more than it helps because too many options can be paralyzing  It is simply not possible for the majority of investors to properly assess the quality of so many ETFs  Analyzing ETFs  done with the proper diligence  is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF  As stated above  that can be as many as 1 351 stocks for one ETF  Any investor worth his salt knows that knowing the holdings of an ETF is critical to finding the best ETF  The Danger Within Why do investors need to know the holdings of ETFs before they buy  They need to know to be sure they do not buy an ETF that might blow up  Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the   No matter how cheap  if it holds bad stocks  the ETF s performance will be bad  PERFORMANCE OF ETF s HOLDINGs   PERFORMANCE OF ETF Finding the Style ETFs with the Best Holdings Figure 1 shows my top rated ETF for each style  Importantly  my ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence we do for each stock we cover  Accordingly  our coverage of ETFs leverages the diligence we do on each stock by rating ETFs based on the aggregated ratings of the stocks each ETF holds  PowerShares QQQ  QQQ  is not only the top rated large cap growth ETF  it is the overall top rated ETF of the 216 style ETFs I cover  Only the large cap blend  large cap value and all cap blend styles contain any Attractive  i e  4 star  rated ETFs while the best every other style can offer is a Neutral or 3 star ETF  Sometimes  you get what you pay for It is troubling to see one of the best style ETFs  PowerShares Buyback Achievers  PKW  have just  206 million in assets  The largest ETF in all cap blend  Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF  VTI   has nearly  24 billion in assets thought it only gets a Neutral  3 star  rating  VTI s expense ratio at 0 07  is much lower than PKW s at 0 66   but as I state above  no matter how cheap an ETF  if it does not hold good stocks it will not perform well  Sometimes  you get what you pay for  Another example of how to be sure you get what you pay for  PowerShares S P 500 High Quality Portfolio  SPHQ  with a 4 star rating is the best large cap blend ETF but it only has  178 million in assets  iShares Core S P 500 ETF  IVV  and SPDR S P 500  SPY  soak up the majority of the assets in that style even though they earn only 3 star ratings  I cannot help to wonder if more investors would buy SPHQ is they knew it has a superior portfolio of stocks  It is more expensive than IVV and SPY  but as I have stated  low fees cannot growth wealth  only good stocks can  Sometimes  you DON T get what you pay forThe smallest ETF in Figure 1 is Vanguard S P Small Cap 600 Growth ETF  VIOG  with just  14 million in assets  Sadly  other small cap growth ETFs with more assets and similar portfolios  virtually identical top 5 holdings  charge more than VIOG  In other words  small cap growth ETF investors are paying extra fees for no reason  Specifically  at 0 28   both SPDR S P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF  SLYG  with  161 million in assets and iShares S P SmallCap 600 Growth Index Fund  IJT  with  1 579 million in assets charge more than VIOG  which charges 0 22   Sometimes  you do not get what you pay for  The worst ETF in Figure 1 is small cap blend s iShares Core S P Small Cap ETF  IJR   which gets a Dangerous  2 star  rating  One would think ETF providers could do better for this style  I recommend investors only buy ETFs with more than  100 million in assets  Figure 1  Best Style ETFs  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Covering All The Bases  Including Costs My ETF rating also takes into account the total annual costs  which represents the all in cost of being in the ETF  This analysis is simpler for ETFs than funds because they do not charge front  or back end loads and transaction costs are incurred directly  There is only the expense ratio  which is normally quite low  However  my ratings penalize those ETFs with abnormally high expense ratios or any other hidden costs  Top Stocks Make Up Top ETFs One of my favorite holdings in SPHQ is Kellogg  K   which gets my Attractive  4 star  rating  This company earns the rare distinction of generating positive economic earnings every year since my model begins in 1998  Moreover  since 1998  Kellogg s economic earnings have grown over 260  or 8  compounded annually  That is a very steady cash generating machine  However  the stock s valuation seems to overlook the company s profitable history  At   60 share  the current market valuation implies the company s cash flows  NOPAT  will permanently decline by 6   A valuation that implies permanent profit decline and a history of strong profit generation make a nice risk reward combination  One of my favorite holdings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF  DIA   one of four ETFs in Figure 1 to get my 4 star rating  is Exxon Mobil  XOM   In     I explain how XOM has created enormous value for shareholders over the last quarter century  Buying Exxon Mobil  XOM  now is one of the easiest calls in the market these days  With superior cash flows  a cheap valuation and one of the strongest competitive positions in the business world  it is hard to make a straight faced argument against owning this stock anywhere below  100  My model shows the stock is worth  140 if one assumes profits never grow from 2011 levels  i e  the  no growth  value of the stock  This stock offers nice risk reward too  Disclosure  I own XOM  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  style or theme ,2012-12-14,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-find-the-best-style-etfs-147595,147595

144035,365550,K,Tax Incentives For Retirement Saving Are Not Working,opinion,In a previous post in this series  I criticized proposals to raise the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare  It is already getting harder to save enough for a comfortable retirement  raising the eligibility age would just make it still more difficult  In this installment  I turn to policies to encourage retirement saving  explaining why our current system is not working well and suggesting some alternatives  Why should we make it easier to retire  Grasshoppers vs  Ants We can start by asking why making it easy to retire should be an objective of public policy in the first place  The fable of the grasshopper and the ant is the lens through which many people view the issue  The ant works hard and saves carefully all summer  while the grasshopper sings and dances  When winter comes  the grasshopper begs for a handout  The fable portrays the ant as justified in shutting her door to him  Why should the government  as agent of the ant like taxpayers that pay its bills  behave any differently toward grasshoppers who don t have the self discipline to save during their working years  The most common response is to justify government support for retirement as a form of social insurance  Life is full of risks  For retirement saving  the relevant risks include spells of unemployment  health problems  the risk of losses or low returns on retirement savings  the risk of inflation  and last but not least  the risk of outliving one s savings  When we take those risks into account  we understand that some people will reach retirement age without adequate savings not because they are grasshoppers  but because they are unlucky ants  Many of the risks that can thwart the best laid plans for retirement savings are neither under the control of individuals nor privately insurable  Only the government is in a position to pool the risks broadly enough to guarantee a minimum level of retirement income for everyone  At the same time  skeptics have a valid point when they warn against incentivizing grasshopper like behavior  It is reasonable to want public policy to encourage people to save for their own retirement even while providing a safety net for those whose efforts fall short  In the United States  the tension between providing a reasonable degree of social insurance and encouraging thrift has given us a two part retirement policy that combines Social Security with tax sheltered private retirement savings  Unfortunately  neither part is working well  The future of social security Social Security is one of the most popular government programs ever created  but it faces an uncertain future  As it stands now  Social Security is neither a real retirement savings program nor a pure social safety net  It is not a savings program in the sense that participants  payroll taxes are not invested to fund their own retirement  Its trust fund  which consists entirely of special government bonds  is only an accounting device  What we really have is a system under which those currently working pay for those who have already retired  That worked reasonably well as long as the elderly dependency ratio was low  but it has come under strain now that the ratio is rising  as shown in the following chart At the same time  Social Security is not a pure social safety net  People with fewer than 10 years of work usually receive no benefits  For those who have worked long enough  benefits increase with contributions  There is some progressivity built into the system since the relationship of benefits to contributions is not linear  but even so  the highest benefits tend to go to the least needy  Furthermore  the progressivity of the benefit schedule is offset to a substantial degree by the regressivity of the payroll tax that pays for the benefits  As the next chart shows  the payroll tax has been taking a steadily increasing share of the income of households in the lowest quintile of the income distribution  in contrast to the income tax  which has been taking a decreasing share  Raising payroll taxes to meet increasing Social Security outlays no longer seems feasible  Most recent reform proposals have  instead  concentrated on reducing benefits  Raising the age of eligibility for full benefits  for reasons explained in the preceding post  would make the system more regressive  Changing the formula for calculating cost of living increases would gradually reduce benefits for all participants  Means testing of benefits for high income participants would make the system more progressive  If the minimum benefit were raised by enough to bring recipients up to the poverty level at the same time that payments to higher income beneficiaries were reduced  Social Security would start to look more like a real social safety net  Whatever reforms are adopted  one thing is virtually certain  The trend toward increasing dependence on individual retirement savings will continue for most middle class families  Why tax incentives for retirement saving have failed Today  the principal policy for encouraging retirement savings is to shelter them from taxes  Employer contributions to pension plans are subject neither to corporate nor individual income taxes  Individual contributions to 401 k  plans  Individual Retirement Accounts  and similar plans are tax deductible as they are made  and earnings on invested funds accumulate free of taxes  Pension benefits are subject to income tax when they are eventually paid out  but recipients are often in lower tax brackets by that time  Taken together  preferences for retirement savings are one of the largest tax expenditures in the Federal Budget  The Urban Institute Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center  that the immediate  direct revenue loss associated with contributions to IRAs and 401 k  plans will exceed  1 trillion over the decade beginning in 2011  That figure is the product of contributions multiplied by the applicable marginal tax rate  A more  of the cost by the American Society of Pension Professionals   Actuaries suggests that the direct revenue loss  as calculated by the Tax Policy Center and others  overstates the true costs by as much as a third to a half  but even half a trillion dollars still makes a very large dent in the budget  Unfortunately  tax preferences do little to increase retirement saving  Three factors undermine their effectiveness As  by William G  Gale of the Tax Policy Center  about three quarters of taxpayers are subject to income tax rates of 15 percent or less  As a result  the very households who are most likely to have inadequate savings at the time of retirement gain little or nothing from the deductibility of retirement saving Taxpayers in higher brackets have a larger incentive to contribute to 401 k  and similar plans  However  studies cited by Gale have found that the contributions of those higher income households are much more likely to represent a reallocation into tax preferred plans of funds they would have saved in any event As inflation has slowed  the benefit of tax deferral of earnings on retirement plan contributions has decreased  For example  suppose the nominal interest rate is 8 percent and the inflation rate is 6 percent  For a household subject to a 25 percent income tax rate  the after tax nominal interest rate would be 6 percent  just equal to inflation  That would make the after tax real interest rate zero  compared with a tax free nominal rate of 8 percent and a tax free real rate of 2 percent  If the inflation rate falls to 2 percent and the nominal interest rate to 4 percent  the after  tax nominal rate is 3 percent  for an after tax real rate of 1 percent  Meanwhile the tax free real interest rate would remain at 2 percent  These are only illustrative numbers  but whatever the specifics  if we assume the before tax real interest rate remains unchanged  slowing inflation reduces the relative attractiveness of tax sheltered retirement plans In short  the present policy of encouraging private retirement savings by sheltering them from taxes is expensive but ineffective Two better ways to encourage retirement savingsThere should be better ways to encourage retirement savings  and there are One idea  discussed by Thomas Gale in the paper cited above  would be to replace the current tax deductibility of contributions with a flat rate credit  He describes the proposal as follows  First  unlike the current system  workers  and firms  contributions to employer based 401 k  accounts would no longer be excluded from income subject to taxation  contributions to IRAs would no longer be tax deductible  and any employer contributions to a 401 k  plan would be treated as taxable income to the employee  just as current wages are   Second  all qualified employer and employee contributions would be eligible for a flat rate refundable tax credit  given to the employee  Third  the credit would be deposited directly into the retirement saving account  as opposed to the current deduction  which simply results in a lower tax payment than otherwise        Contribution limits would not change  Earnings in 401 k  plans and IRAs would continue to accrue tax free  and withdrawals from the accounts would continue to be taxed as income  Gale proposes a 30 percent rate for the tax credit  A 30 percent credit would give the same incentive as a tax deduction for someone in a 23 percent tax bracket  For such a person  the after tax cost of adding  100 to a retirement account would  under either the credit or the deduction plan  be  77  The tax credit would give a greater incentive than a deduction to people in tax brackets below 23 percent  That is just what we want  since those are the people now most likely to have inadequate savings when they reach retirement  For people in tax brackets above 23 percent  the incentive from the tax credit would be less than from a deduction  That is fine  because their contributions to tax favored retirement accounts are more likely to be reallocations of existing saving than new saving According to Gale s calculations  a 30 percent tax credit would be revenue neutral compared to the current system of deductions  A credit at a lower rate would still provide some incentive to increased saving by lower bracket households while increasing budget revenues compared to existing policy Alternatively  a second way to make it easier to save for retirement would be to reduce the risk and raise the return on funds invested in 401 k  and similar plans  A brief from the Center for Retirement Research cited in the preceding post lists falling real interest rates as one of the important barriers to successful retirement saving  The brief uses the chart reproduced below to illustrate the problem  The nominal interest rate on which it is based is that on bonds held in Social Security trust funds  Inflation is measured by the rate of change of the CPI for years up to 1991 and by 10 year inflation forecasts for later years  The real interest rate shown is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate How could the government reduce the risk and increase the return on retirement savings  One way would be for the Treasury to issue a special series of retirement securities call them R bonds  for short  The R bonds would have the following properties They would be nonmarketable Like all Treasury bonds  they would be free of default risk Like Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS   their principal value would be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index Unlike TIPS  R bonds would pay a guaranteed real interest rate  that is  an interest rate in excess of inflation  of  say  2 or 3 percent R bonds could be held only in retirement accounts  with a limit on the maximum amount per individual Either a tax credit or R bonds could increase the number of people who succeed in accumulating adequate retirement savings  but they would do so in different ways  A tax credit would work by increasing contributions to retirement accounts  but the accounts would remain risky  Depending on the market risks  default risks  and inflation risks to which a person s retirement portfolio is exposed  the accumulated value at retirement age can turn out to be inadequate despite a lifetime of diligent saving  By reducing those risks  R bonds  could increase the number of retirees who achieved minimally adequate savings even if they did not increase total saving Of course  if R bonds ended up paying a higher rate of interest than ordinary Treasury bonds  as would likely be the case   they would increase the government s interest expense  The increase could be offset by eliminating tax deductions for retirement contributions and taxing interest on retirement accounts  By adjusting the guaranteed real interest rate and the maximum amount of bonds per person  R bonds  like tax credits  could be introduced in a way that was either revenue neutral or revenue enhancing Like tax credits  an R bond program could be designed to increase retirement saving incentives for lower income households while reducing the incentive of higher income households to divert existing saving into tax privileged accounts  The incentives and budget impacts could be fine tuned further by using tax credits and R bonds in combination Toward a secure  equitable  and affordable retirement policyThe bottom line is that the U S  retirement system  as it exists  is neither secure nor equitable even as the stress it places on the federal budget increases  We can do better  and we should We should do better because there is an important public purpose in protecting citizens against unavoidable and privately uninsurable risks that can thwart the best laid plans for retirement savings the risk of losses or low returns  the risk of inflation  and the risk of longevity We can do better than the current combination of Social Security and private tax sheltered savings plans  Social Security can be allowed to evolve toward a pure social safety net that provides poverty level retirement protection for the neediest  Mechanisms such as tax credits directly deposited to retirement accounts or R bonds with a guaranteed real return could substantially improve saving incentives  compared with the present system of tax deductions  without increasing the burden on the budget  or even decreasing it With a little imagination and the political will to act on it  we could end up with a retirement policy that is genuinely secure  equitable  and affordable ,2013-01-27,Ed

144037,365552,K,Bruno del Ama  Junior MLPs Are Undervalued And Ready For Growth,opinion,Master limited partnerships  MLPs  aren t just pipeline builders  nor are they all large caps  Bruno del Ama  CEO and co founder of Global X Funds  sees significant value in junior MLPs anchored to exploration  production and storage as well as transportation  In this interview with The Energy Report  del Ama talks about a rare bottom floor opportunity to profit while avoiding the tax and bookkeeping pitfalls of MLP investing   The Energy Report  You and your firm have aggressively embraced the exchange traded fund  ETF  structure  How do ETFs differ from closed end mutual funds   Bruno del Ama  Closed end funds  as the name indicates  are closed  meaning they issue a fixed number of shares and they trade on an exchange  ETFs also trade on an exchange  but they are open ended  meaning that they issue new shares or redeem shares according to investor interest in the fund  Specifically in the MLP realm  closed end funds tend to be actively managed  whereas the MLP ETFs currently are all passive  In addition  a lot of the MLP closed end funds use some amount of leverage  whereas the MLP ETFs do not use leverage  However  the regulatory structure for ETFs and closed end mutual funds is very similar   TER  Why don t ETFs trade at substantial premiums or discounts to their net asset value  NAV   the way closed end funds can   BdA  If there is too much demand for the closed end fund  it will be bid up to trade at a premium to the NAV because new shares cannot be issued  but if there is not much demand  that closed end fund could trade at a discount to the NAV  Because the ETF is open ended  more shares are issued when there is greater demand  or redeemed when investors exit   TER  Why do investors want access to energy MLPs   BdA  MLPs have become an important asset class  particularly in this low interest rate environment  where investors are seeking sources of income  MLPs tend to have lower correlation with the general market benchmarks because some of the specific structures and economics of those businesses  particularly the midstream or pipeline side of the business  operate very much like a toll road  So regardless of how the economy is doing  as long as there is natural gas or oil flowing through those pipelines  the operator and the owner of that pipeline will charge a toll  That offers a significant degree of stability   TER  Why do you believe the ETF structure fits energy MLPs   BdA  There are a number of vehicles to get access to MLPs  There is of course the direct investment route to individual MLPs  There are also closed end funds  exchange traded notes  ETNs   ETFs and the non exchange traded mutual funds  They all have advantages and disadvantages  For some investors  the ETF structure makes sense for a number of reasons  One is that it allows investors in tax efficient plans such as the 401 k  or individual retirement accounts  IRAs  to invest in MLPs  which is generally not recommended when investing directly in individual MLPs through those plans  Also  the ETF structure simplifies some of the tax reporting from MLPs  With the ETF  you receive a simple 1099 like any other stock  We take care of filing all of the K 1 reports for the MLPs the ETF invests in  It is important  however  that investors access the MLP asset class cost effectively through these funds   TER  So to summarize  there are no K 1s issued to the MLP ETF shareholder  Second  the MLP ETF can be used in qualified plans and third  I m assuming from what you just said that there is no unrelated business taxable income  UBTI    BdA  Correct  MLP direct investment is generally not recommended for qualified  tax efficient plans because investors may need to pay taxes on UBTI  However  investors can buy an MLP ETF within a qualified plan and not be subject to UBTI   TER  Why should energy investors be exposed to the small cap MLP space   BdA  First  the yield of junior MLP companies is around 8  versus around 6  for large cap MLP companies  Second  there has been much less investor focus on this small cap or junior MLP space  All of the MLP ETFs and ETNs that exist target the same large cap space  which has received a lot of interest and fund flows  As a result  the valuations and the price earning multiples for the junior MLPs are significantly lower than for the large cap MLPs  Thus  this is perhaps an opportunity from a value perspective  Because values are lower  the yields paid by the junior MLP ETFs are higher   Lastly  beyond the valuation and the higher dividend yields  there s the growth perspective in the junior MLP space  where you get more exposure to exploration and production  E P  companies  whereas the large cap MLPs are more focused on the infrastructure or midstream space   TER  Bruno  isn t it hard to achieve growth in an index containing 25 30 different names  Isn t that overdiversification   BdA  We think it s the right level  When it comes to growth and specifically the junior MLP space  small cap companies are generally more volatile  so that diversification helps with that volatility  avoiding too much exposure to any individual name  So you have a well balanced  well diversified portfolio  not only at the individual company level but also within the subsectors of the MLP space   TER  From your perspective  what is attractive about the Solactive Junior MLP Index versus other junior MLP indices   BdA  Solactive is one of the leading firms when it comes to structuring indices for the commodity and energy space  It developed the first and only index that tracked what we consider to be a very attractive segment of the junior MLP space  the Solactive Junior MLP Composite Index   TER  It s rare to be first in anything  Where is the growth in E P and the midstream coming from   BdA  There is no question that we are witnessing a massive transformation in the energy space  This has been recognized by the media  but the attention it s gotten doesn t fully represent the extent of what is taking place  According to a 2012 report from the International Energy Association  the U S  will be the largest producer of oil in the world by 2017  and we are a massive producer of natural gas  which makes U S  natural gas much cheaper than other areas of the world  In Asia and Europe  the same unit of gas is selling for roughly triple the U S  price  So there is a tremendous opportunity where you have massive differences in price  not only relative to places as far as Asia but even looking at different parts of the U S   so we are just at the beginning of building the required energy infrastructure  which will benefit MLPs tremendously  Exploration and production MLPs will be one of the biggest growth segments of MLPs  in our opinion  and these are barely represented in existing MLP funds  The Junior MLP ETF is well balanced with about 40  exposure to infrastructure MLPs and 40  exposure to exploration and production MLPs   TER  Don t these infrastructure assets require much greater capital and resources than most small cap companies can fund or afford   BdA  The fact is that everybody across the value chain  from the very large players to the small players  will benefit  Building pipelines and infrastructure for energy transportation within the U S  is really contributing to a manufacturing renaissance in the U S  What we will see over time is consolidation with some of the larger players buying out some of the smaller ones  and some will be bought out at premiums  When you have those massive discrepancies  you are also seeing massive arbitrage opportunities and massive investments in infrastructure across the board   TER  Bruno  could you talk about some of the companies in the Global X Junior MLP ETF  MLPJ  portfolio   Atlas Pipeline Partners L P   APL  is an example of a company focused on processing and pipelines  Atlas is active in Oklahoma and Texas and operates 18 gas treatment facilities and over 10 000 miles of active pipeline  Atlas is also expected to benefit from the recent acquisition of Cardinal Midstream in December  which helped boost its pipeline assets  Atlas has a 12 month yield of 6 92    Atlas Resource Partners  ARP  and BreitBurn Energy Partners L P   BBEP  are examples of companies that are much more active on the exploration and production side  Atlas Resource Partners owns an interest in over 8 000 natural gas and oil producing wells  which means the company will be more linked to the prices of the commodities themselves  but will also be poised to benefit from the energy renaissance taking place as the U S  becomes a significant producer and potentially a net exporter in the future  BreitBurn has a similar focus but operates a wider range of properties  with natural gas and oil interests in California  Wyoming  Texas  Michigan  Florida  Indiana and Kentucky  Both companies manage their properties with the purpose of generating cash distributions for unitholders Atlas Resources has a 12 month yield of 6 33  and BreitBurn has a 12 month yield of 8 67    Bruno

144054,365569,K,Frontier Markets Harbor High Reward Investment Opportunities,opinion,Select frontier markets  once eyed skeptically as fraught with danger  are now some of the most robust economies in the world  But the shares of companies exploring and producing in these markets often continue to lag based on long held fears that are no longer valid  How does an investor decipher that fine line between real and perceived  Carlos Andres  the chief analyst and managing editor of the Frontier Research Report and the Global Resource Investor  makes his living informing retail investors about risks in the junior resource space  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Andres discusses how to capitalize on the narrowing gap between real and perceived risks in South America and beyond  The Gold Report  Carlos  you note in the January edition of Frontier Research Report  entitled  2011 In Review  A World in Turmoil   that only three countries with major stock exchanges finished 2011 in the black  Indonesia  the Philippines and Malaysia  Is the face of global risk changing  Carlos Andres  In a word  Yes  Some emerging and frontier markets with significant natural resource endowments continue to emerge as robust places to invest and weather economic storms for savvy investors  Paradoxically  the world s developed economies have become the more risky markets  TGR  What factors are contributing to that  CA  On the one hand  robust natural resource demand has asserted itself over the last decade  led by Asia in general and China in particular  Latin America deserves favorable mention as well  This is reflected in the rise in global commodity prices over the same period  It s being fueled by factors such as population growth  industrialization  urbanization and infrastructure development driving income growth and middle class expansion  As a result  when you are operating in these markets  there is a strong sense of economic activity  optimism and wealth creation  It s tangible  You can see it and feel it  On the other hand  as has been covered ad nauseam by media of all kinds  developed world markets are mired in myriad types of interlinking crises  financial  political  budgetary  debt  employment  military  etc  This fuels a high degree of uncertainty for investors in these markets  To a certain extent this is masking the economic growth on other markets  TGR  Can you rank what you consider the top risks in the junior resource space  CA  There are a lot of risks competing to be on that list  Consulting firm Ernst   Young recently released its annual metals and mining Top 10 report  At the top of the list  and I don t disagree  is resource nationalism  There s a resurgence of resource nationalism and it does seem to be taking on a rather virulent strain as of late  Second on the list is a significant shortage of skilled geoscientists  An all time record of  18 billion was spent on non ferrous metals exploration in 2011  As mining activities have picked up  so has the demand for skilled and experienced workers  There are not enough of them to go around  Another rising risk factor  stemming from the success of the sector  is cost inflation  There is competition for the factors of production  including capital equipment  This is a significant factor underpinning the viability of mining projects  Ernst   Young also lists capital project execution  or the ability to raise enough capital to execute projects successfully  That s obviously a problem given current weakness in capital markets  Despite record production levels and profitability  investors have fled the sector  There s a large disconnect that should spell opportunity for discerning investors TGR  Does that particular risk speak to a lack of skilled management  too  CA  Yes  Management has to shepherd capital very carefully and conservatively when cash is tight  It does come down to experienced management teams who are shrewd and very nimble on their feet  They must be creative about where and how to obtain financing as well as how they allocate it  Also  their accomplishments and reputations often have a lot to do with being able to bid away financing from management teams who are weak in this area  Ernst   Young also talks about maintaining a social license to operate  which is a sophisticated way of saying it s a good idea to get along with the locals near the mine  As we are learning  management teams ignore this issue at their peril  TGR  The industry has done a poor job of that  by and large  CA  It has  It s becoming an increasing area of concern and focus for management teams as problems have flared in various locales  The shrewd companies are beefing up in that area to respond to social needs and concerns  It requires an added dimension of expertise  These issues have added to the costs for many companies  It has become a problem for both mines that have been operating for a very long time as well as new projects  TGR  Investing in small cap resource plays can be a high risk game  What are some things that investors routinely do that expose them to more risk than is necessary  CA  It s obviously important for investors to pick the right management with the right projects in the right jurisdictions with financial firepower  The average retail investor often falls down on the job in this area despite the fact that there are lots of good news and research resources out there to help separate the wheat from the chaff  There are maybe 3 000 publicly traded junior resource stocks and a lot of them are not worth their listing  The first step is to eliminate the worthless  which means the list of 3 000 quickly becomes 300 or less that are worth considering  However  many investors who are committed to this sector tend to engage in very poor trading strategies  This is not covered nearly as much as it should be  I ll try to reduce it to some simple ideas  When trading  investors often feel as if they have to get in on this before it s too late and  therefore  they will chase price as it moves up  Although it is certainly possible to make money this way in some cases  it is a bad habit that will work against you in the long run  Investors also tend to allocate far too much capital to individual companies while at the same time not maintaining sufficient cash reserves  When price moves against them  their investment capital is fully deployed  Given the inherent volatility in junior resource stocks in particular  the prices of shares can move dramatically against them  These folks end up selling with large losses  They become demoralized and never return to these markets  Whereas if they had pursued a different trading strategy  they might find themselves not only being able to endure the storm  but able to generate wealth and become successful long term investors in the sector  TGR  What would you suggest  CA  Something along these lines  Investors first find a company they like  It s at a certain price  It s a good price  but good strategy says you shouldn t allocate all your money at once  Given that many investors will allocate far too much of their capital to one stock  once decided on an amount  an investor should probably reduce it  It s a good risk management practice in volatile markets  If you decide to allocate  10 000  K   maybe you just spend  1K at the current price and wait and watch  If the price falls significantly  say 20   and you still think it s a great company in a great jurisdiction  you spend another  2 5K  You are buying on the way down because you believe in the fundamentals  rather than chasing the price up because you are relying on the herd as proof for the value of the stock  You want to be selling to the herd and not buying from them  The only way to do this consistently over the long term is to make a habit of buying value at distressed prices  like now  Therefore  the lower the price goes  in 20  increments  for example  you would spend larger and larger chunks of your allocation of  10K  Thus you are lowering your basis as you go  When the price finally does turn around  you will have made a significant purchase right near the bottom  It allows investors to manage emotions and risk while accumulating value  If the company s stock takes off just after the initial investment of  1K  you may have missed out on putting  9K in  but you still get to participate in the upside and you will sleep well at night  There are  of course  more nuances to this type of approach to trading  These are the basics just to give some idea of how investors should be thinking  TGR  Resource nationalization is a big part of jurisdiction risk  My sense is that there s greater jurisdiction risk now than there was even five years ago  What s your view  CA  It was always there  but more countries are jumping on the bandwagon and asking for a bigger slice of the pie by raising taxes  royalties and the ownership interest a country takes in a mine  In some cases  such as in Africa  there is free carried interest where the state is entitled to 10 20  of the mine without having to bear any of the development costs  It is creating uncertainty so the analyst has to wade through this  Some countries  like Indonesia  are adding a new twist  In order to capture a bigger piece of the pie  the government wants to require companies that extract natural resources to build refineries and smelters to refine products in country before they are exported  Going from ridiculous to sublime  Indonesia is also requiring that after 10 years of owning a mine  a company must divest itself of 50  by selling to Indonesian concerns  Where it starts to get really intense is outright nationalization  We ve seen some of that in Argentina and Bolivia lately  There were rumors in mining powerhouse South Africa as well  but cooler heads appear to have prevailed for now  TGR  When companies are investing the kind of capital it takes to develop a large mine  they don t want to lose half of it after just 10 years  That s quite extreme  Frontier Research Report has success identifying countries where there is more  perceived risk  than there is actual risk  What are some of those jurisdictions  CA  We like to profit on the difference between perceived risk and actual risk because we re able to buy things really cheap if perceived risk is higher than the reality  A company s true value is revealed when it meets significant milestones and investors take notice  However  there are times  like the present  when the margins between perceived and actual risk narrows a bit  TGR  Or a lot  CA  Indeed  Now is one of those times where perceived risk is moving close to actual risk  It s narrowed  even in some of my favorite jurisdictions  like Peru  which is a mining powerhouse and is No  2 in the world in copper  No  2 in silver and No  6 in gold  Nevertheless  it s experiencing some problems with local unrest to the point where it s receiving international attention  It s brought a cloud over Newmont Mining Corp  s  NEM NYSE  Minas Conga project  which has the green light from government but is moving very slowly in the face of local opposition  TGR  It s forced Peruvian President Ollanta Humala to change around his cabinet somewhat in order to try to appease both sides  CA  That s right  TGR  Humala is a former soldier  He s perceived as a leftist  but is he anti mining  CA  No  I don t believe he is  Prior to the election  we argued to our subscribers that if he won the presidency  given the nature of politics in Peru and the importance of mining to the economy  he would find it very difficult to enforce his platform overnight and would have to moderate it  In the lead up to the election we started to see him do exactly that  After he was elected  he proceeded to raise royalties and taxes  The mining companies went along with that  He said he would distribute funds and enact social programs in the rural regions of Peru  It seemed to work out fairly well at first  The local unrest that developed almost immediately after he was elected took many  including me  by surprise  There has always been local unrest but it flared unexpectedly  TGR  These communities feel that they ve been left out of the boom that the country has participated in over the last 10 to 15 years  CA  I think they felt that if they acted out their social displeasure  maybe they would have the backing of their leftist president  but he perhaps caught them by surprise as he proved unable or unwilling to offer that support  TGR  Ultimately  is Peru is a good place to be investing  CA  Will mining companies be able to execute projects in Peru and successfully move them from start to finish  Can that still happen logistically  politically  from a regulatory standpoint in Peru  Absolutely  Will investors get comfortable funding projects in a country where there is local unrest  That s the rub  Can companies raise financing in the capital markets in order to push projects through  That s the question mark  In environments like Peru  where mining will continue robustly even under a cloud  it will be more and more important that investors be able to differentiate well managed  well capitalized companies  with sound projects  TGR  Your model portfolio took somewhat of a beating in 2011  along with most portfolios with a focus on this particular sector  Your gold holdings included Lion One Metals Ltd   LIO TSX V  LOMLF OTCQX  LY1 FSE   Gran Colombia Gold Corp   GCM TSX V   Mariana Resources Ltd   MRY TSX  MARL LSE   Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX  MIRL LSE  MIRL BVL   Rio Novo Gold Inc   RN TSX   Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX  SDDDF OTCQX  SUE BVL  and Azumah Resources Ltd   AZM ASX   Auryx Gold was in there too  but it was taken over by B2Gold Corp   BTO TSX  BGLPF OTCQX   CA  All of these companies except one are still in the portfolio  TGR  A couple of those companies in there have projects in Peru  including Sulliden  which is suffering from the cloud hanging over Peru after Bear Creek Mining Corp  s  BCM TSX V  license to mine the Santa Ana silver deposit was pulled  Does Sulliden simply wait it out or can it lift its share price by continuing to derisk its Shahuindo project  CA  Sulliden has experienced management with a strong track record  is well capitalized with  44 million  M  in the bank and is far enough along to shepherd the project through to completion  The question is will the Peru cloud eventually lift and will markets begin to improve so that Sulliden can achieve its true value for shareholders  I believe so  As Shahuindo moves toward development over the next 18 months  its share price is likely to improve substantially  The company will release a definitive feasibility study in August  which will likely add ounces to what is already an impressive 3 4 million ounce  Moz  deposit  Sulliden is also ramping up for mine development  This company has done well for our subscribers and will likely  in our view  add more value in the near future  TGR  What are you expecting from the feasibility study due later in August  CA  I m relatively certain the results will be positive  It will contain a resource estimate update to the existing 3 4 Moz deposit  which includes 66 Moz silver  The deposit remains open in all directions  including at depth  so there is excellent exploration upside  The update will likely add ounces and upgrade existing ounces that are currently in the Indicated and Inferred category  The initial production profile of the open pit mine will be scaled down from 150 000 ounces year  150 Koz year to 100 Koz year  That will reduce the initially planned development cost of  200M by half  With a definitive feasibility study and a smaller  simpler mine plan  the approval process will be easier to navigate as well  The definitive feasibility study will feed the all important environmental impact assessment  which will be submitted in the fall  It should take 9 12 months to obtain approvals and Sulliden has recently hired a seasoned specialist to manage the process for them  The Sulliden story has all the hallmarks of a management team that is thinking soberly and strategically with the wherewithal to get across the finish line  TGR  Minera IRL also has significant assets in Peru  It has a mine in production  Corihuarmi  with about another three years of production left  Minera is counting on future production from its Ollachea project  Can Minera IRL bring it into production within that timeframe  CA  Chances are very good  Corihuarmi  which may be exhausted by mid 2015  is currently producing 30  Koz year  When Ollachea comes on line  it will have production of 117 Koz  It will be an underground mine and the access tunnel is currently under construction and progressing on schedule  The deposit itself currently contains 2 6 Moz Indicated and Inferred with solid grades between 2 8 and 4 grams per tonne  g t  with a higher grade core within the resource envelope of 5 3 g t  Ollachea also remains open in all directions  Minera is currently in the middle of preparing a definitive feasibility study that is due by the end of the year and the company is already working on mine financing options  Permitting and financing are scheduled for 2013 with mine development in 2014 and production scheduled for 2015  So  yes  I think the schedule is reasonable  In addition  Minera IRL is a very well managed company with the venerable Courtney Chamberlain at the helm and roughly  25M in the bank  Finally  exercising tremendous foresight  the company has an excellent relationship with the local community through numerous programs  including an agreement that provides for a 5  ownership interest  and a recently signed 30 year surface rights agreement  which enjoyed wide spread local support  The company should be able to weather the storm and continue advancing its projects in Peru  as well as its Don Nicolas project in Argentina  TGR  Some of Argentina s oil and gas resources have been nationalized in recent months  Is Don Nicolas at risk  CA  The country does not have a history of nationalization in the hard rock mining industry  although it does in the oil and gas industry  The nationalization of the oil company  YPF SA  YPF NYSE   has a lot to do with the fact that Argentina has gone from energy exporter to net energy importer in a massive way over the last few years  It used to provide all its own energy  but now it s suddenly importing large quantities of natural gas to keep the lights on and it s been draining the country s foreign exchange  As a result  the government has been reacting rather radically  However Argentina didn t try to nationalize the mining industry in the 2001 crisis and so far mining companies are soldiering on  TGR  What about the move by President Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner to restrict access to imported mining equipment  CA  The government of Argentina is not necessarily targeting mining specifically  It is making policy decisions related to keeping foreign exchange in the country  It is impacting mining companies  but it hasn t shut things down for them  Is there added risk  Yes  especially with imposing capital controls and rules on the way dividends are repatriated and capital equipment purchases are made  It is having an impact on mines  But it hasn t shut down operations or exploration  TGR  What are some other junior explorers that you believe have been unfairly punished by events beyond their control  or that are unusually undervalued due to perceived risk  CA  Gran Colombia stands out in this regard  It sits in the junior ranks in the sense that it is continuing exploration on two very promising mining areas in Colombia  In reality  it has several legacy operating gold mines with large underlying deposits that are currently under development and hence is masquerading as a junior  The company s Marmato deposit has over 12 Moz gold and 75 Moz silver and yet it s valuation on an enterprise value per ounce level is around US 20 or 1 3  of the gold price  That s unbelievably low  Marmato is in the heart of a historic mining district in the center of Colombia dating back to the centuries when the Spanish controlled it  The company is developing an open pit mine  scheduled to begin production in 2015  In the meantime  Gran Colombia is deriving cash flow from the existing underground mine  which produces about 30 Koz year  The company has another well known historic holding formerly known as the Frontino gold mine but recently renamed Segovia  Three or four underground mines are currently producing over 100 Koz year  Segovia has 1 4 Moz so far  but it s going to get a lot bigger  So the company has cash flow from legacy operations  a world class deposit at Marmato  lots of silver  a solid deposit at Segovia  with tremendous exploration upside  TGR  The deposits tend to be high grade underground vein deposits in Colombia  but they re difficult to exploit en masse  There are these smaller high grade operations  but nothing at scale  That s what Gran Colombia is trying to do with the pit at Marmato  Do you think that it will prove successful  CA  I do  Gran Colombia has a very experienced management team that has developed large gold deposits before  Although Marmato is operating a legacy underground mine  the massive deposit is being developed with a large open pit bulk mining design in mind  The drill results look good and I expect the company to be able to rationalize the pit dynamics and the grade  TGR  These older operations that Gran Colombia is running have been grandfathered into the new mining act there  However  there have been very promising  much larger deposits that have not been green lighted  What makes you think that this one will be  CA  Because the management team has already accomplished what no other mining company would even attempt  Both Frontino  now Segovia  and Marmato had some significant legacy issues that had previously caused miners to shun them like the plague  Frontino had a  200M legacy pension problem from a bankruptcy in the  70s  Marmato was previously fragmented into dozens of different ownership interests  In addition  the historic town of Marmato  which sat right in the middle of the deposit  had been partially destroyed by a landslide  creating a humanitarian dilemma  All of these issues have been completely resolved by Gran Colombia management  The company was able to raise the  200M in capital markets to resolve the pension issue in exchange for a 100  unfettered interest in Frontino  It consolidated all of the individual land holdings at Marmato so that it now has 100  ownership of the entire site  Gran Colombia has also aided the government in rebuilding the city of Marmato further down the hillside  which has been completed  All of this was considered impossible  Atypically  the management team hails from the region and is well connected  Executive Co Chairmen Serafino Iacono and Miguel de la Campa are from Venezuela and were responsible for finding and defining one of the larger deposits in South America  Their success with Bolivar Gold and later Pacific Rubiales established a tremendous reputation for them both and so they are able to open doors that few others can  In addition  the President and Chief Executive Maria Consuela Araujo is the former Minister of Foreign Relations and former Minister of Culture in Colombia  That gives you some idea of the pedigree of management  TGR  Lion One appears to be sitting on the tip of an iceberg with its high grade low tonnage Tuvatu gold project in Fiji  How is their story coming along  CA  Lion One is making good progress  It has become evident that the company is sitting at the periphery of a large volcanic system at one edge of a large caldera  In geologic and physical terms  it is very similar to the nearby historic and still operating Vatukoula mine  which also sits in a caldera  For reference  Vatukoula has historic production and remaining resources totaling 11 Moz  In this context  Tuvatu has an initial existing deposit of roughly 650 Koz established in the early 2000s  Over the last eight months  Lion One has established that consistent mineralization is extensive laterally and at depth from the existing deposit  In short  this deposit is going to grow  Another is that the company has a deep pool of local geo and mining talent to draw on from Vatukoula  who have lengthy first hand experience with the above  and below ground geology  Thus  on the exploration front Lion

of the ledger  it s important to pick the right management  projects and jurisdictions  On the other side of the ledger  it is equally important to look at trading strategies and how much money to allocate to a particular company  The tried and true approach is not to invest more than you can afford to lose  I know everyone knows that  but I suspect a lot of retail investors lack the discipline to stick to it  Wait for the prices to come to you  Buy light in the beginning and buy in ever increasing amounts as the price declines  The rule is accumulation rather than chasing prices as they run away from you  The downside is far too high to chase prices like that  TGR  Did we see the bottom for small cap resource stocks in May  CA  Indeed  they ve come off the bottom a little bit especially some of the more well known ones  I think they re still probably meandering along the bottom as a whole  but some of the more prominent names will bounce off the bottom  With any good fortune  the

144055,365570,K,Time For Investors To Take Back Wall Street  Here s How,opinion,There are two eminently reasonable ways to stop the off kilter spinning top that Wall Street has become 1  Starve the Beast2  Allow only human beings to trade OK  I realize the genie is out of the bottle  so the second option is simply not going to happen  The regulators are in bed with Wall Street s trading desks so this eminently reasonable solution is off the table  That leaves  1 Market volatility has increased due to institutional day trading  program trading  high frequency trading  and trading for the sake of trading  Partly as a result of this hijacking of  investing   individual investors have increasingly eschewed the equity markets in favor of bonds  CDs  gold coins and other non equity investments But before we rush to blame bank and Wall Street trading desks for our woes  though they are due their fair share of shame and blame  let s take a look at what we ourselves have done  often with the best of intentions  that has changed this dynamic  Not that long ago  markets were dominated by individual investors  Those markets were considerably less volatile  and instead were characterized by positions held for long term future growth  Today  the bulk of transactions are institutional  trading desks  pension funds  hedge funds  mutual funds  ETFs  and the like  which are explosive in nature and  for the most part  incredibly short term    close of business today is a good time to flatten all positionsLooking back just to the late 1960s  only 23  of total buy and sell transactions were conducted by institutions  There were two primary reasons for this  First  almost everyone working for a big company had a pension  so the big institutions of the day were the pension funds  They invested the bulk of their funds in debt instruments  rather than equity  It wasn t as exciting but in that more restrictive regulatory time  they had to follow the Prudent Man rules  so they never forgot that the return of capital was the first order of business  not the return on capital The other reality then was that individuals took responsibility for their own investments  With no control over the pension monies  they invested their discretionary income in equities and the relative handful of mutual funds The situation today is completely reversed  Institutions account for somewhere between 75 and 80  of all trading in any given year  call it 77   That would mean a complete and total reversal of the markets known to previous generations of investors  Individuals now contribute just 23  of total transactions  As if that isn t bad enough  it gets worse Since dark pools and off exchange trading are murky at best  we must rely on estimates for the percent of total volume conducted by algorithmic trading without human intervention after the parameters for the trade have been established  Many analysts believe they account for as much as 70  of each day s total volume  If that s so  it means that institutional traders acting on their experience and reason account for 7   individuals for 23  and the rest is done based upon models designed some time between last year and this morning Is it any wonder that we have flash crashes  If up to 70  of the average daily volume is done without human intervention  that s a billion shares or more of potential volatility  Not all these algorithms are designed for scalping  of course  some are hedges against real portfolios  triggered when a mutual fund needs to raise cash for redemptions  sold versus trailing stops as a result of good price appreciation  etc  But let s be honest  Most of these algorithms are designed to scalp pennies in seconds  or mills in nano seconds   When enough of these automatic trades are triggered by the same event  we see extreme volatility   nearly 20 000 such events in the last 6 years alone  with the Flash Crash of May 2010 being the most public  if not the most egregious  example Earlier I said we have mostly ourselves to blame  How did we get in this predicament  There are many answers  but three that you  I and every other individual investor must accept responsibility for  include  1  The rise of corporate 401 k s without  in most cases  any Prudent Man restrictions  This is like setting a kid free in a candy store with no guidance whatsoever on what is healthy and what is not  2  The false promise of indexing  which demeans every investor s intellect by presuming all of us who don t work for a bankster are too dull witted to beat the market  if by no other means than taking some money off the table when it is appropriate to do so   Don t trade   Wall Street intones   You never know when you might miss something   My response  That cuts both ways  I d just as soon miss the occasional calamity  thank you  And if I miss something good  stocks are like streetcars   wait 10 minutes and another one will come along  3  The exponential growth of hedge funds To justify their ridiculous  20 and 2  pricing  2  management fee plus 20  of any profits they make  they don t invest in an index fund or even  in many cases   invest   as in buying and holding quality companies  at all  There are a few hedgies that carry on in the tradition of Ben Graham and Warren Buffett  both of whom ran hedge funds  but not at 20 and 2   But most hire 20 something hackers whom they expect to write brilliant quant algorithms for the black box The charts that follow are merely snapshots in time and cannot reflect every external factor that may have influenced volatility  Nor are they a complete picture of any one year or decade  Instead  I selected the first 7 months of this year  just past  and compared them to the same 7 months in each year ending in  2  since 1972  As you will see  1972 was a most appropriate starting point to study volatility in light of the three changes with 401 k s  indexing  and hedge funds  If you believe  as I do  that there is a certain seasonal  cyclical and secular rhythm to the markets  selecting 5  snapshots  may be quite telling 1972 was pre 401 k   pre index fund and pre proliferation of hedge funds  The S P traded between 102 and 108 during the first 7 months of 1972  Sounds boring  but that lack of volatility might be a welcome interregnum today  However   the next year  in 1973  Professor Burton Malkiel wrote A Random Walk Down Wall Street  propounding the efficient market hypothesis  positing that prices of publicly traded assets reflect all publicly available information  I think that s hogwash and apparently Warren Buffett  John Templeton  Peter Lynch and a whole host of non academics agree  but we must concede this book was a watershed event Among Malkiel s prescriptions  What we need is a no load  minimum management fee mutual fund that simply buys the hundreds of stocks making up the broad stock market averages and does no trading from security to security in an attempt to catch the winners  It seems John Bogle was all ears  The next year he founded The Vanguard Group to do just that and in 1975 started the fund that would become the biggest in the world  the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Another event was taking shape during this decade  as well  In 1978  Congress amended the a portion of the Internal Revenue Code  later called section 401 k   The law went into effect on January 1  1980 In the first 7 months of 1982  the market swung a little over 12   Index funds and 401 k s were still new ideas By 1984  however  17 303 companies were offering 401 k  plans in lieu of pensions and we    you and me    were not just letting fixed income and blue chips fulfill our pension needs  We wanted action which meant a proliferation of mutual funds offered with no loads or other fees  Suddenly we wanted to see a little volatility  because that meant more profits  right  By 1992 it was  let the good times roll  Unlike the two previous 7 month snapshots  one of which went slowly up  the other slowly down  this particular period of 1992 ended roughly where it began   but the volatility had increased markedly  Note  for instance  that the 1972 chart looks like a series of rolling foothills  Contrast that with 1992  where it more resembles a series of jagged peaks and troughs The result was that we had a bit of a comeuppance in 2002  We had given many of our investable dollars to mutual funds via 401 k s    and demanded that they outperform their peers  Here were the fruits of those decisions  in the bear period these 7 months covered in 2002  the S P had a swing of 44  peak to trough    in 7 months  This would have been the return in those index funds that Wall Street so wants you to buy and hold  Of course they do  If you take your money off the table  they don t have anything to play with  The  institutional  money isn t money they have laying around for a rainy day   it s your money  If you don t give it to them  the Beast starves Worse  those who selected the go go choices for their 401 k s  and other investable funds   lost even more  Double worse  we had deluded ourselves into believing during the dot com bomb that tech was the be all and end all to investing so we lined up around the block to give our money to hedge funds  Each touting their boy wonders as the ones who could turn a sow s ear into a silk purse Who invested in these hedge funds  Typically  other institutions  like your pension fund or university endowment  Hedge funds are far less regulated because they are sold only to accredited investors and institutions  Remember those pension funds that used to invest in bonds  Not no more  Having lost so much in the dot com bom  many of them were now giving chunks to hedge funds  trying desperately to make it all back to save their jobs This brings us to the current period  of which we are all personally and  for some people  painfully aware  The S P 500 shot from 1280 to 1420 in the first 120 days of the year  then plunged right back down to 1280 in the next 60  We ve now seen it roar back above 1400  so now    where Everyone will have their own opinion  but I have chosen to position our clients in such a way that they are hedged with an ever so slight downward bias  I do so with equities  highly liquid ETFs which I can sell any time  and even with a few specialty mutual funds like the best of the long short funds  My concern is that this market looks suspiciously like a triple top and  worse  is occurring at a time of maximum complacency among the investing public  Whistling past the graveyard is no way to protect yourself from the grave robbers at Wall and Broad Since we brought it on ourselves  we can  at least partially  fix it ourselves  Of course we could petition the regulators  for all the good that will do   I hear Jim Morrison in the background singing  Petition  Petition  Petition the Lord with prayer    And we could vote into national leadership office men and women who share our concerns and hope they have a real life to return to so they aren t easily co opted by all that free Wall Street money to get them re elected over and over again ad infinitum  ad nauseam Perhaps more realistically  and certainly within our immediate power to control  First  realize that your 401 k  is neither a particularly good investment vehicle nor a plaything  We have had clients come to us who still had money in the 401 k  of a company they left ten years ago and military members who still have the Thrift Savings Plan 10 years after they retired  instead of rolling it to a self directed IRA  Why would they consider letting some pension fund give money to a hedge fund to speculate with their money  That laziness translates to more money for the big institutions to wreck the markets with their short term trading  high frequency trading  quarterly window dressing  etc Starve the Beast  The  institutional money  isn t theirs    it s ours  Don t give it to them via 401 k s when you could roll it into your own IRA  Don t just toss it into an index fund that mirrors the biggest companies with the most liquidity that institutions view as their personal playground  Use them when diversification is more important than performance  And  finally  query your plan administrators    how much business are they giving to hedge funds without you having a say in the strategies employed  Or your mutual fund managers   does their charter allow them to play in the derivatives market or give money to sub advisors which are nothing more than hedge funds Take responsibility for your own investing  Among the many companies I believe have fallen  even in this  good  market  to prices that make them worthy of purchasing for greater gains in the coming months and years are  ABB  ABB   Total Petroleum  TOT   Pepsico  PEP   Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Statoil  STO   Joy Global  JOY   Natural Resource Partners  NRP   Bank of Montreal  BMO   Imperial Oil of Canada  IMO   Plum Creek Timber  PCL   Siemens AG  SI   Weyerhaeuser  WY   Penn Virginia  PVR   ScotiaBank  BNS   and Cenovus  CVE   I believe selecting great companies at a good price will provide far greater reward than playing Wall Street s silly in and out trading games or trusting our future to an index fund  These firms and others like them are a fine place to begin your own due diligence The markets are volatile because we outsourced our responsibility for our own future  Take it back  The decline in volatility will make the markets worthy of our research  attention and success once again Disclosure  We

144056,365571,K,Tempestuous Times,opinion,At last  we are in the home stretch of August  This month has been excruciating by any measure   even by the measure of normal Augusts  Heck  even by the standard of normal Decembers  right now  New York exchange volume is on pace to be 15  less in August than on the slowest December in the last decade plus  That s remarkable  but I remain unsure of the significance of this lull  We are plainly in the midst of a secular decline in trading volumes  and at least some of that is healthy since there was probably too much of the frenetic  momentum type trading that adds to swing amplitudes  The flip side  though  is that some of the decline in volumes reflects a decline in market making activities  which are typically  speculative  in that they are short term in nature but nonetheless add liquidity and decrease swing amplitudes  Again  I don t have a clear answer to this  It is tempting to say that it represents part of what Bill Gross means  Maybe it does  but I don t see a lot of evidence that the cult of equity is dying  The average pension fund today has maybe 50  stocks rather than 60  stocks  most 401 k  accounts don t offer commodity funds or inflation linked bond funds but instead 12 flavors of equity funds  and Jim Cramer is still on the air  Still  faith in  the system  is indeed at an ebb that hasn t been seen since my lifetime  anyway  Perhaps in the 1970s the counterculture lost faith in America  but the majority still believed that working hard resulted in a person getting ahead  and that one s children were likely to enjoy a higher standard of living than one s self  Most of us would still like to believe this  but at least one party believes strongly that these days you can t get ahead without a hand up  and members of both parties  and every sentient being  knows that the entitlements currently promised virtually assure that our young are being yoked to the Medicare plow  And yet  stocks trade above a 20 Shiller multiple and 30 year bonds sport a 2 80  yield  Tempestuous times tend to produce momentous change  We remain in tempestuous times  although we heard nary a peep from Europe this month  The global economic system is creaking again  On Friday  Durable Goods was much weaker than expected  with core durable orders  0 4  and revised downward by  1 1  to the prior month  from  1 1  to  2 2    That produces the lowest year year growth in core Durables since early 2010  As the Fed pointed out in their minutes  the U S  economy is not ready to take another punch  and another punch may well be coming from Europe in the next few months  It is therefore not surprising that presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney says that if he is elected   to be Fed Chairman when his term ends in a year and a half  January 31  2014   In good times  candidates want to bestow laurels on the Fed Chairman  such as when Arizona senator McCain  that if Chairman Greenspan were to die in office   I would do like they did in the movie Weekend at Bernie s  I d prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him and keep him as long as I could    whatever his merits  It is also not surprising  in times like this  that a political party  again  the Republicans  would consider a platform plank  as well as one calling for a commission to   These are momentous proposals  Change is a good thing  but in times like these we must always be careful of deploying change for change s sake  I don t think any of those proposals would threaten the republic  but going back to a gold standard would be too much in my opinion  I don t think a commodity or gold standard is necessary  if the central bank is run correctly  and in fact such a linkage could create rigidities that prevent some of the automatic stabilizers in the macroeconomy from working correctly  But it comes down to a question of whether central bankers can be trusted to do what they can  and to understand what they cannot do  and to eschew what they can  but should not do  Organizationally  I am not sure any groupthink body can manage something as complex as the U S  macroeconomy  to say nothing of the world economy  So what s the alternative   Ending the Fed  and returning to a gold standard is one solution  but it sort of throws the baby out with the bathwater  Paul Ryan s proposal in 2008 to limit the Fed s mandate to only inflation  rather than the impossible dual mandate  would be significant progress  and is unlikely to happen   Failing that tweak  I still think the Federal Reserve can be more effective than it has been through the last two Chairmanships  The middle road between a gold standard and a continuation of business as usual   which would have  incidentally  completely opposite implications for inflation   is to appoint a better Chairman  A person who has a steady hand  a healthy respect for the difference between data and facts  data are just estimates of facts  not the same thing   and a healthy respect for the difficulty of certainty  A person who  as I say in my book  recognizes that the person running the Fed is in a short options position  and therefore should focus on doing only the things which clearly must be done  A person who won t tinker  Now  we re unlikely to get such a thing  because the prevailing wisdom is that the central banks should do everything they can  They should be in continuous motion  balancing and re balancing  optimizing and re optimizing  Choosing between that on one hand  or a gold standard on the other  is a much harder choice  Speaking of commodities  the market seems to believe that we re more likely to keep our activist central banks than to get a gold standard  and hence more likely to get inflationary rather than disinflationary  deflationary outcomes  The chart below shows the current technical condition of the DJ UBS commodity index  As regular readers know  I don t spend a lot of time looking at technical analysis  I do  however  think it can be useful in testing hypotheses and in  taking the temperature  of the investing public The DJ UBS chart shows a break higher from a base on the last day of June  followed by a consolidation in early July that produced a second breakout and a longer consolidation band  This second plateau  covering late July through mid August  seems to be resolving higher as well although without the sharpness of the prior thrusts  But the crucial test is whether the index can remain above 145 here and extend higher  The evolution of Tropical Storm Isaac may help  While so far all the storm has done has been to cancel one day of the Republican convention  it is moving into the Gulf of Mexico and generating the possibility of disrupting gas and oil production there  It is not expected to strengthen above Category 2  so this isn t going to have the monstrous effect of Katrina  but it won t hurt the technical situation of the commodity indices any  So what do these tempestuous times and momentous changes mean for markets  At the moment  they mean little  because the momentous changes are unlikely to happen if the current Administration wins a second term  But for the first time in a very long time  the two parties are offering very different views of America and very different plans  and that means that for the first time in a while  it actually may matter to the markets which party actually rules once the votes are counted At present  polls have the Presidential race very tight  but with the Republicans favored to pick up some seats in the Senate and to retain control of the House  There is a chance  although still odds off  that the Republicans gain control of both houses of the legislature and the executive branch as well  The difference in the policy portfolio in that circumstance  compared to the status quo or one in which the Democrats seize control of the House of Representatives as part of a general electoral landslide  this is much less likely than the reverse  since the House is the body that is most skewed at the moment   towards Republicans   is huge  Is a Republican sweep good for bonds  since the fiscally conservative credentials  if taken at face value  would imply lower future debt issuance  or bad for bonds  because a President Romney would make QE3 less likely  This isn t entirely clear to me  but more volatility and consequently more volume seem likely  as more focus turns to these polls over the next month or two  This election will matter to markets ,2012-08-27,Michael

144057,365572,K,The Best Investment Advice Ever  Just Say  No ,opinion,Large parts of the financial industry spend lots of time  effort  and money to develop plans and programs all under the guise of offering investment advice  Much of the investment  witchcraft  comes with a slew of hidden fees and expenses  That fact and those figures more often than not are conveniently avoided  In the midst of many a discussion I have with young professionals launching their career  I work the conversation toward what I deem is the best investment advice ever  I firmly believe the specific insight I offer them is not only appropriate for a young professional but also for all investors  So what is  the best investment advice ever   Just say  no   These three little words were widely promoted in the 1980s as the slogan for those promoting wholesome  healthy lifestyle and truly an anti drug message  The same three little words resonate today  The Wall Street Journal puts a spin on this simple message today in writing    Many people would rather struggle to pay off a large credit card bill then utter the phrase  I can t afford it   Feelings of shame  embarrassment or a desire to avoid conflict are just some of the reasons folks just won t say no  But being honest about what you can and can t afford can reduce financial stress and boost your financial health  Indeed it can  Learning to do without even what may be viewed as just little things can have a profound impact on all aspects of one s life  Penny saved is a penny earned may sound trite but when did America forget that simple lesson  Minimizing expenses and redirecting those funds   even if deemed small   toward a savings or investment account can have a profound impact over the course of one s life  How so  The power of compounding  To further make the case that I so believe in this approach of living below one s means and minimizing expenses  young professionals should consider this  There is an important reason you want to start early  even though it hurts  Say you withhold  375 a month for your 401 k   In 40 years  you ll have  750 000  But those who waited a decade to get started would have only  377 000  That is powerful  Obviously this advice runs fully counter to much of what is directed at us everyday  We are told and  sold  that we can gain real happiness and so much more via the acquisition of a whole host of material items  I am not here to preach but I feel compelled to write that real happiness and true success in investing and in life is derived from relationships not products  Just saying  no  provides the necessary discipline to achieving that prized possession known as happiness  Doing without is not only a great start but also sage advice as we navigate the economic landscape each and everyday ,2012-09-24,Larry Doyle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-best-investment-advice-ever:-just-say-'no'-137479,137479

144076,365591,K,Recent Acquisition Amounts To Another Great Deal For Linn Energy LLC,opinion,Oil and gas producer Linn Ener gy LLC  NSDQ  LINE  announced the acquisition of oil and gas produc ing properties in the Jonah Field of Wyoming from BP  NYSE  BP  for  1 billion This is yet another phenomenal deal for Linn that s immediately accretive to distributable cash flow and will result in significant growth in distribu tions later this year  About three quar ters of the output from the Jonah field properties is natural gas with the re mainder primarily consisting of natural gas liquids  NGLs   At first blush  that heavy gas focus might appear to be a problem since natural gas continues to trade well under  3 per million British thermal units  However  as I said in   Linn isn t betting on a rise in near term gas prices  Instead  the company was able to buy these properties at dirt cheap prices and hedge 100 percent of its expect ed oil and natural gas output over the next six years  That means that Linn has effectively locked in a fixed profit margin on the output from this acqui sition over a period of six years  with no exposure to near term commodity price volatility  Linn also announced that it has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list a new company called LinnCo later this year  LinnCo has elected to be taxed as a corpo ration rather than a partnership like Linn Energy  NSDQ  LINE   LinnCo won t be an operating company or own any assets  but all proceeds from the offering of this stock will be used to buy units of Linn Energy  which means the deal won t be dilutive to current unithold ers  Please note that this deal is not a spin off and current Linn sharehold ers will not receive units of LinnCo when it comes public  Because LinnCo is taxed as a cor poration  it will pay ordinary quali fied dividends and send out a standard form 1099 to investors at tax time rather than the K 1 partnership form that Linn Energy sends out to share holders  That feature will make LinnCo at tractive to certain classes of investors  For example  some foreign and institutional investors face tax complica tions from receiving distributions rath er than qualified dividends  LinnCo will allow these investors to buy Linn while avoiding K 1 tax filings  Individual investors who purchase partnerships such as Linn inside an Individual Retirement Account or 401 k  can face additional complica tions at tax time because some of the distributions paid constitute unrelated business taxable income  LinnCo will be subject to US corporate tax but could be an attractive alternative for those wishing to buy Linn in tax ad vantaged accounts  The deal will help Linn Energy unitholders because it offers yet an other avenue for Linn to raise capital to take advantage of acquisition op portunities  LinnCo represents an innovative transaction that s likely to be copied by other master limited partnerships  MLPs  and limited liability compa nies  LLCs  as a means of raising capi tal from investors unwilling or un able to invest in partnerships ,2012-07-22,Elliott Gue,https://www.investing.com/analysis/recent-acquisition-amounts-to-another-great-deal-for-linn-energy-llc-130360,130360
144077,365592,K,Catalysts Give Energy Stocks A Jolt  Jocelyn August,opinion,Small  and mid cap energy stocks respond to big news in big ways  Senior Analyst Jocelyn August of Sagient Research keeps track of events and related share price movements that can shed light on how stocks will perform when new triggers are pulled  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report August discusses some of her favorite and not so favorite names that could make profits  or losses  for attentive investors  The Energy Report  In the current environment  do catalysts matter  Jocelyn August  They do matter  At first glance  last quarter was negative for a lot of stocks  I recently got my 401 k   and it didn t look so good  But we did see a lot of stock movement in Q2 12 in the natural resources realm  We actually recorded 14 double digit stock price moves  including eight in the energy sector  Some are positive and some of them are negative  obviously  TER  What trends are you seeing in catalysts versus share price movement  JA  For the most part  the catalysts that move energy stocks the most are those that can show how well a prospect is going to perform for a company  Drilling announcements  especially if they are for test or exploratory wells  have an effect  A start or a completion of drilling is also important  TER  What are some examples  JA  The largest one day move we saw recently was a 22  negative move for Samson Oil   Gas Ltd   ASX SSN  following its announcement of the start of production at its Gretel II 12 KA 3 well at its Roosevelt oil project in Montana  You would think that a production start announcement would yield a positive stock price  but if you actually look at the announcement  we noted that the well yielded much lower oil production than expected  That s why the move was downward  But we did also see some very large  positive  one day moves  GMX Resources Inc   NYSE GMXR  announced the completion of fracture stimulation at one of its wells in the Williston Basin of North Dakota  With this announcement  we saw a one day upward move of 18   TER  GMX is up 6  over the past four weeks  but down 39  over the past 12 weeks  What is your take on this  Are you positive on this company  JA  I am pretty positive on GMX  It has had some very large  event driven moves recently  It has a really small market cap of  62 million  M   and it has a lot of projects that it s working on right now  The Williston Basin is really hot right now  I think that in terms of volatility and market movement  GMX is a good stock to go with  TER  What s the next catalyst for GMX  JA  The company has several coming up in the next quarter  It has multiple wells in the Williston Basin  It has Joliet 1 18H  It has Wilson 31 6H  It has fracture stimulation at Fairfield State  TER  Is it your investment theory here that GMX is a small cap company for which really good news would yield a good lift in share prices  Is that it  JA  Yes  absolutely  I think when you re looking at small cap companies that have a smaller list of projects that they are working on  announcements from the company with regard to the success or failure of certain projects are obviously going to have a much bigger effect on their stock prices than  say  a larger company that has a lot of projects going on  TER  Another one you wanted to talk about  JA  Last time we spoke  we talked a little bit about ATP Oil and Gas Corp   NASDAQ ATPG  and the Shimshon project it s working on in Israel  Recently  it announced that it had started drilling there  and it gave some preliminary results  After this announcement  its stock jumped 25  but if you look at it now  it has pretty much come back to the level it was at before I think investors realized this company has a lot of other problems  like a pretty high debt load  While Shimshon may be a really great thing for it  even if it can be shown to be as successful as the Noble Energy Inc   NYSE NBL  project that s in Israel  it s still not going to be a complete solution to all of ATP s problems  After the stock jumped 25   everybody said  wait  let s really look at what s going on with this company  ATP is expecting to announce further results on the Shimshon well in this quarter  This announcement could have a pretty good effect on the stock if it announces positive results  or it could be negative if it were to announce that it actually didn t yield as much as the company expected  TER  The market has really punished ATP  It is down 84  over the past 12 months  down 62  over the past three months and down 35  over the past four weeks  The Shimshon project is a gas well  but margins on natural gas can be very good in Southwest Asia  JA  I think in that part of the world  the margins would actually be pretty good  so the prospect for that well and for the exploration in general in that area is very good  I think that the punishment of ATP s stock is probably more related to the high debt load  The fear is that it has  1 5 billion  B  of debt coming due in a couple of years with the potential that its cash flows aren t going to be able to cover that  TER  Does this low stock price represent value  Is your opinion favorable on ATP  JA  I would say I m neutral  If ATP can get something going at Shimshon and if it can achieve more success in the Gulf of Mexico  it could turn out to be a very undervalued company  But I think we need to wait for more results from Shimshon  TER  Go ahead with your next one  JA  Uranium Energy Corp   NYSE A UEC   is a U S  based producer  I have seen a lot of downward moves over the past year despite the fact that it has had a lot of good announcements  It is moving its projects along  It started producing more from its Palangana project in Texas  and again  that was met with more downward moves  I think that the political environment for uranium has been pretty negative since March 2011 with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan I also think the political environment in the U S  has something to do with it  Given that Japan has made some announcements that it will be starting up some more reactors  I m hopeful the environment for uranium is going to become a little bit more positive  Also  given that  the stock price of Uranium Energy is fairly low  if the political environment becomes more positive  and if it keeps making positive announcements about exploration and about what it s working on in Texas  I think that those announcements and the company are going to get noticed  TER  What catalysts should investors know about  JA  The biggest one that it has upcoming is for Goliad  Goliad s measured and indicated resource estimate is 5 4 million pounds  Mlb  uranium  which is four times larger than that of Palangana  We are projecting that Palangana is currently producing around  10M worth of annual revenues with approximately 175 000 200 000 pounds annually  Uranium Energy is expecting Goliad to be on line and producing by March 2013  At that point  that s going to mean a much larger revenue stream for the company  TER  It is my understanding that total U S  uranium production is only 4 Mlb year and that we import more than 90  of our needs  Next year or the year after Uranium Energy could be producing 2 Mlb by itself  Are there a lot of catalysts coming up  JA  There are  TER  Would Japan starting up reactors lift all boats  JA  I think that would definitely lift all boats but  again  I think Goliad is going to be something that will be very positive  It also is waiting for an exploration permit for its new project  the Channen project  which is near Goliad  TER  Are you positive on Uranium Energy  JA  Yes  TER  Another one  JA  We had previously talked about McMoRan Exploration Co   NYSE MMR   and we re still waiting on Davy Jones  I wanted to highlight it again because it consistently has news coming out for this project  It has experienced significant delays  but I think it s on the road to near term production  We re probably looking at August  but again  we re waiting for an announcement from McMoRan on the flow rates  TER  Why has McMoRan been such a fantastic performer  Over the past 12 weeks  it s up 62   That looks like an inverse image of others in the industry  Over the past four weeks  it s up 18   JA  Despite the fact that it continues to have these delays  which at face value would seem not to be a good thing for the company  McMoRan is revolutionizing the industry and it is working on several other ultra deep wells as well as Davy Jones  The reason it has experienced so many delays is because it has had to innovate all of this on its own  It has had to come up with the equipment  It has had to figure out how to engineer these wells for this very deepwater drilling  That s something that nobody has done before So if it is successful with Davy Jones and some of its other ultra deep wells  then it will become a leader  It will be the company that everyone else looks to for this type of drilling  and it will be able to capitalize on the fact that it has the experience to be able to get to this gas  which previously has been unavailable  TER  This is such a tough project considering the depth  the necessary engineering and the associated risk  Could the performance here portend good performance for other gas well drillers  JA  I would think so  The political environment for gas right now is pretty good  it s seen as a more environmentally friendly form of energy  If companies are able to get more of it from places where it was previously unavailable  then obviously that s going to be a positive for a lot of other gas companies  Speaking of gas in other areas besides the U S   we are also looking at FX Energy Inc   NASDAQ FXEN   It is doing a lot of gas drilling in Poland  TER  FX Energy is up 19  over the past four weeks and up 23  over the past six months  JA  It s definitely interesting  and it s one that we highlighted in our Outlook report  Poland is an attractive market because it has significant hydrocarbon potential  which is very largely unexplored  and right now current domestic production in Poland is not enough to meet demand in that area  So  if these projects are economically viable  FX Energy would be in a very favorable position  It is drilling multiple wells in that area that are targeting the Rotliegend formation  We are looking at a lot of different catalysts that are approaching this quarter  particularly in the Fences area where FX has been drilling multiple wells  It has made several announcements recently regarding these wells  including the conclusion of casing at the Kutno well in July when it also announced results from one of its Komorze wells  It is expecting results from multiple wells this quarter  These could mean some very positive moves for the company  TER  Which would be the major catalyst  JA  Kutno is a new area that it is working on and it has not been proven yet  so positive results from this area could be very favorable  TER  Jocelyn  you follow Liberty Star Uranium   Metals Corp   OTCBB LBSR   It has an  18 75M market cap  What s going on there  JA  It is working on some projects in Alaska  Mexico and Arizona  It has a couple of catalysts that we re looking at for this quarter for Tombstone  including a permit approval and potentially a surveying start  We saw some other catalysts from this project in May when it had an announcement of some sample test results  It actually moved the stock price up by 11   Yes  it has a very small market cap share price  Again  I think the small market cap and low price may have to do with the uranium situation overall  TER  Are you positive on Liberty Star  JA  I d say neutral  TER  Are its best prospects in uranium or in metals  JA  It seems like it has mostly metals  It does have a uranium property in Arizona  but it doesn t look like it has a lot of catalysts for that right now  TER  We talked about Ivanhoe Energy Inc   TSX IE  NASDAQ IVAN  the last time we spoke  Can you update me on it  JA  We re looking at some drilling results that are expected this quarter for the Hollin IP 17 well in the Pungarayacu field in Ecuador  It is in the business of heavy oil and uses heavy to light technology to improve and convert heavy oil to lighter oil  which is more valuable and can be more easily transported via pipeline  So we re expecting that it is going to continue drilling through Q3 12 and announce results before the quarter ends for this Hollin field  It actually announced on July 12 that it had drilled Hollin to approximately 10 500 feet and it had some evidence of hydrocarbon  So we re looking at some more detailed results as this drilling continues this quarter  TER  And you still bullish on Ivanhoe  JA  Yes  TER  What about Apco Oil   Gas International Inc   NASDAQ APAGF   Do you follow that one  JA  Yes  we do follow Apco  We had a big catalyst for it last quarter  It was a negative catalyst  It is doing a lot of drilling in Colombia where it s hard to figure out what is going to happen because of the political environment  It seems to be doing pretty well  but it can be hard when you have natural resources in Colombia  TER  What about catalysts affecting Gran Tierra Energy Inc   NYSE GTE  TSX GTE   JA  That is another one that we expect will have a lot of drilling catalysts in Brazil and Argentina this quarter  We have one for Azar  which is actually expected to reach total depth in early August  and then we ll have some results  TER  You follow Endeavour International  NYSE A END   Tell us about that company  JA  That one actually saw a large move last quarter as well  It is interesting because it has a lot of projects in the United Kingdom s North Sea  It has been in that area for a long time  but its large mover catalyst last quarter was actually in the Heath shale in Montana  It had a 19  upward move with well results for that one  Endeavour seems to be diversifying and getting into other areas besides the North Sea  TER  What s the next catalyst for Endeavour  JA  We have several catalysts this quarter  We have catalysts for Bacchus  where we will see a second well begin production this quarter  We re also waiting on a project sanctioning for Columbus  TER  What about Noble Energy  JA  It also has a large project in the North Sea called the Bream project  We re waiting on the project sanction for that by year end  TER  Are you positive on Noble  JA  Yes  we are  It has a much larger market cap  TER  Thank you  Jocelyn   is currently the senior analyst and product manager for CatalystTracker  a proprietary research product focused on identifying and analyzing the
