8893,230408,BXP,U S  landlords copy hotel model to cut risk as coworking surges,news,"By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    Leading owners of prime U S  office space are taking a page from the hotel industry to boost profits from coworking s rapid growth and to mitigate some of the risk they assume when signing long term leases with these flexible workspace providers  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s EQ Office  private equity firm Rubenstein Partners LP and others have turned to  management agreements   a new format in the office market that avoids fixed lease payments that critics say can be disastrous for coworking in a downturn  Landlords stand to make more money in these profit sharing partnerships with coworking firms  which industry goliath WeWork well understands as it rapidly gobbles up office space with leases in Manhattan  San Francisco  Boston and elsewhere  The partnerships unite interests  unlike with leasing  and they cut exposure to the same liability critics say pushed serviced office giant IWG s Regus into bankruptcy in 2003  Regus couldn t make lease payments when some customers declined to renew short term rental contracts during the dot com recession   There s some real validity to that criticism   said Jamie Hodari  co founder and chief executive of Industrious  a leading coworking firm with more than 50 locations in three dozen U S  cities  Only in the past six months have property owners embraced management agreements  looking to a mainstay for hotel operators as a way to meet growing tenant demands for shorter and less rigid contracts that the workplace industry provides  Hodari said   Rubenstein announced an agreement with Industrious last week to operate tenant amenities and a coworking space in Alexandria  Virginia  the first time the Philadelphia based real estate investor will provide coworking in one of its properties  Terms of the agreement at Carlyle Tower  a 49 year old building that was gutted and rebranded  were not disclosed   In a typical hotel agreement the management fee is set at 3 percent  But Hodari envisions coworking firms will receive fees of 5 percent to 10 percent from shorter term tenants while profits from a joint venture between landlord and manager for the same space may be split 30 percent to 70 percent after payment for the going market price of the space that would have been leased before  he said  Last year only 5 percent of the projects in Industrious  pipeline involved management agreements while the remainder were leases  Hodari said  The project pipeline has doubled since then with 75 percent management agreements and 25 percent leases this year  he said  Most owners now assume that between 15 percent to as much as 30 percent of their office building will move to a shorter duration financial arrangement with the tenant  said Ryan Simonetti  chief executive of Convene  an event space provider backed by Brookfield Asset Management  among others   Landlords have to respond to what customers want   said Simonetti  whose firm recently added flexible workspace to its offerings   This isn t a fad   COMFORT ZONE WeWork s surpassing JPMorgan  N JPM  last month as the largest office tenant in Manhattan is testament to coworking s appeal  That success  however  has yet to ease concerns about the asset liability mismatch among some landlords   You ve seen these models fall apart   said Richard Anderson  a REIT equity analyst at Mizuho Americas   That mismatch between assets and liabilities becomes very apparent when the model starts to break down   he said   For an interactive graphic on Manhattan s coworking surge  please click     Some real estate investment trusts will not do business with WeWork  Anderson said  citing  Paramount Group Inc   N PGRE   among others  and some limit their exposure  Boston Properties Inc  N BXP  obtains just 1 percent of its revenue and Columbia Property Trust Inc  N CXP  only 2 percent from WeWork  he said  Lenders tend to be more comfortable issuing debt on a property with a long term lease  a reason why management agreements haven t gotten much U S  traction  said Granit Gjonbalaj  chief real estate development officer at WeWork  The majority of U S  landlords would sign managed agreements with the right partner but banks are still trying to understand how to underwrite coworking s income stream  he said  While WeWork has recently offered management agreements  the firm has more to gain from a lease  he said  Demand in Manhattan is so strong WeWork has a hard time keeping up  he said

8894,230409,BXP,Wall Street increasingly weighs risk from climate change,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    In the wake of two years of devastating wildfires in California  Wall Street is incorporating a new risk metric when evaluating companies  climate resiliency   Investors  analysts  research firms and companies are putting more emphasis on how climate issues ranging from rising sea levels to record heatwaves will affect profits and revenues in the United States and what companies are doing to address those risks   Companies located in areas such as California  Florida and Louisiana that put them at a higher risk of being affected by more severe weather patterns are increasingly being asked how they will protect their businesses from climate change   Overall  more than 70 firms have discussed the potential impact of climate change on their business on their quarterly results calls since the start of the year  more than double that of last year or any other year since 2014  according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data   As a result  fund managers  who typically do not incorporate environmental attributes in their analysis of a company  are taking a closer look at whether the physical locations of their property and equipment will put them at a higher risk of being impacted by climate change    Without expecting a company to significantly change its strategy  we are increasingly having conversations with management teams to ask them about their plans for climate resilience   said Arthur Hurley  senior portfolio manager on the Columbia Real Estate Fund   So called ESG funds  which focus on a company s environmental  social  and governance attributes  have been at the forefront of focusing on the physical risks of climate change   But now fund managers like Hurley are finding that companies in their portfolio like  Equity Lifestyle Properties Inc   N ELS   are revealing to analysts on their earnings call that they are evaluating the potential for rising water levels when it purchases new marinas  Shares of the company are up 43  for the year to date   Hurley said he is actively going into companies  like Equity Lifestyle and Boston Properties Inc  N BXP   that are preemptively addressing potential climate impacts  whether by focusing more on the elevation of potential developments or incorporating construction design elements like putting critical equipment above floor grade   Fund managers say that the bankruptcy of San Francisco based power company Pacific Gas   Electric Co  A PCG pa   N PCG  in January prompted them to put more emphasis on climate risks   Wildfires that broke out Oct  23 could undermine California s largest utility s  14 billion plan to finance its turnaround after filing in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top  30 billion  ONCE AN UNCONTEMPLATED RISK At the same time  there have been 10 weather and climate disaster events that have caused more than  1 billion in damages since the start of the year  already nearly double the average of 6 3 events for each full year between 1980 and 2018  according to National Centers for Environmental Information   Insurance claims for what were once considered secondary perils   such as wildfires and hail   have accounted for  13 billion out of  15 billion in natural disaster claims through August  according to Swiss Re   The increase in wildfires has prompted underwriters  such as  Hiscox  Ltd  L HSX  to incorporate new risks models and stop insuring some clients in high risk areas such as California   Overall  10  of insurers refused to renew policies in wildfire prone areas in California in 2018  according to the California Department of Insurance   Research firms including S P Global s Trucost division are rolling out more climate risk analytics that are meant to help investors assess the specific climate risks that each company faces   The firm is publishing a report in the next few weeks that will focus on companies that face the highest physical risks of climate change  a spokeswoman said  In March  Silicon Valley start up Jupiter Inc announced that it had completed a  23 million Series B funding round to expand its analytics services that can provide investors and companies with detailed short and long term weather patterns for specific locations    This is something that s not going away soon   said Gregory Peters  managing director  multi sector and strategy head at PGIM Fixed Income   As a result  he has trimmed his positions in some California utilities  while analysts on his real estate team are increasingly focusing on climate risk    That risk attached to the utilities is kind of a new thing that we didn t necessarily contemplate a couple of years ago

8974,230489,BXP,Why Boston Properties  BXP  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  in Focus
Boston Properties  BXP  is headquartered in Boston  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 14 62  since the start of the year  The real estate investment trust is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 95 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 95   This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield of 4 19  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 91  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 8 6  from last year  In the past five year period  Boston Properties has increased its dividend 3 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 95   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Boston Properties s current payout ratio is 58   This means it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for BXP for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 99 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 10 95  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BXP is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-boston-properties-bxp-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200436123,200436123
8975,230490,BXP,What s In Store For AGNC Investment  AGNC  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,AGNC Investment Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 24  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year decline in its net spread and dollar roll income per common share In the last reported quarter  this Bethesda  MD based mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on leveraged investments in agency MBS  mortgage backed securities   posted net spread and dollar roll income  excluding estimated catch up premium amortization benefit  of 52 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  Further  net interest income  NII  of  164 million came in lower than the prior year quarter reported figure of  225 million Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion  missed in two and met in the other  It delivered an average negative surprise of 4 7  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history AGNC Investment Corp  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIssuance of agency MBS during the April June quarter surged 43  sequentially  Further  combined issuance by Fan nie Mae  Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae hit  330 65 billion Moreover  the 30 year mortgage rates declined from 4 08  at the beginning of the second quarter to 3 73  at the end of the quarter  according to figures released by Freddie Mac  This decline left the 30 year rate at its lowest level since late 2016  Following suit  the 15 year fixed rates and 5 year fixed rate declined to 3 16  and 3 39   respectively This  together with recent moderation in housing price and continued strength in the U S  labor market  indicates optimism in the U S housing market  Hence  AGNC Investment is expected to have enjoyed opportunities in securitized mortgage securities and mortgage lending market  In fact  with a strong MBS portfolio  the company will likely report decent returns on agency MBS Additionally  the company s efforts to improve hedge portfolio and reduce duration gap will support its second quarter performance  In addition  it enjoys solid access to attractive funding across a broad spectrum of counterparties and financing conditions However  a challenging environment  including higher than expected funding costs compared with LIBOR  higher premium amortization and low dollar roll specialness  might impact the company s performance in the quarter under review  Additionally  as AGNC Investment prioritizes risk management over incremental returns  this strategy hinders scope to realize robust returns on its portfolio in the second quarter as well Furthermore  an uptick in financing cost  specifically higher average cost of funds inclusive of interest rate swap costs  will likely have impacted the company s net spread and dollar roll income Lastly  there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the second quarter earnings release  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of net spread and dollar roll income per common share for the to be reported quarter remained unrevised at 50 cents  over the past month  It also suggests year over year decline of 20 6  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AGNC Investment is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold

8977,230492,BXP,What s In The Cards For Alexandria  ARE  This Earnings Season  ,opinion,Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc    NYSE ARE   is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 29  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this Pasadena  CA based urban office real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses  had posted quarterly FFO as adjusted of  1 71 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 68  Results reflected decent internal and external growth Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  missed in another two and met in the other  It came up with an average positive surprise of 0 15  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderAlexandria kick started the second quarter on a bright note by opening Phase 1 of Alexandria Center for AgTech   Research Triangle in April  marking its latest agricultural technology  agtech  business initiative The development is the only integrated  multi tenant greenhouse campus that offers amenity rich agtech R D in the United States  As the property goes operational  it is expected to contribute to the company s second quarter 2019 revenues and net operating income  NOI   Further  at this agtech cluster  Alexandria launched two proprietary platforms   Alexandria LaunchLabs   AgTech and agtech focused Alexandria Seed Capital platform that expands its Alexandria LaunchLabs initiative  Notably  Alexandria LaunchLabs provides seed stage financing to life science companies  and last January  the company launched Alexandria Seed Capital Platform  extending the funding model Under this platform  Alexandria made seed funding investment in Cambridge based Holobiome  Inc   in April 2019  Amid surge in global venture capital funding  such investments are appropriate and will likely be conducive to the company s earnings Additionally  high demand for Alexandria s Class A properties in AAA locations is expected to boost occupancy in the company s portfolio  In fact  solid demand from life science and tech tenants as well as strategic location of its clusters have likely enabled the company to enjoy healthy rent escalations and leasing activity at positive rent spreads  This will likely have improved Alexandria s second quarter revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  365 3 million and reflects a year over year jump of 12 4  Further  in June  Alexandria closed a public offering of 4 427 500 shares of common stock at  145 00 per share  Although this offering is in connection to forward sale agreements where the company will not receive any proceeds through forward sales in the initial phase  it enhances Alexandria s financial flexibility  The company s improved credit profile and strong liquidity position are also anticipated to have supported its growth pursuits during the quarter   However  prior to the first quarter earnings release  there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the April June quarter remained unchanged at  1 72  over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it suggests year over year growth of 4 9  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to

how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsThe U S  office market continued to witness methodical growth in the second quarter  This comes at a time when the U S economy is at its now record long  economic expansion cycle  In fact  employment growth remained sturdy  with the April June quarter adding 171 000 new jobs on an average  As the labor market maintains its hiring levels  it has likely supported healthy leasing activity In fact   from Newmark Knight Frank suggests that the U S  office market tightened during the second quarter of 2019  In fact  continued job creation in office using sectors spurred new demand  resulting in 3 2  year over year growth in asking rents  while vacancy rates shrunk 50 basis points as compared to second quarter 2018  Further  absorption for the June end quarter totaled 10 2 million square feet of space  increasing from 9 3 million square feet of space in the prior year quarter Also  amid healthy growth in demand for office spaces  office landlords can raise rents for properties In fact  the company s rental revenues are expected to improve 3 4  sequentially to  702 million during the June end quarter Significant leasing activity and growth in rental revenues will likely drive the company s performance  In fact  in April  the company signed a new lease with Bank of America  NYSE BAC  for 545 000 square feet of space at 100 Federal Street property in Boston  MA  With this 15 year lease  the bank has renewed its lease that was scheduled to expire in 2022 Amid this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s total revenues is pegged at  678 9 million and indicates 11  year over year growth While overall economic conditions suggest that this cyclical expansion will continue throughout the year  it has also attracted many developers to add more office space in the market  In fact  the construction pipeline reached its highest level of the cycle during second quarter 2019  with nearly 11 9 million square feet of new deliveries entering the market  This high level of supply of office space is a concern as it limits landlords  pricing power While the company anticipates

8996,230511,BXP,Fed Minutes Reiterate Dovish Stance  5 Excellent Picks ,opinion,Minutes of the Fed meeting held from Mar 19 20 bolstered the view that the central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged this year  Fed policymakers cited the risks posed by a global slowdown and trade tensions as the primary reasons for taking such a position  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the central bank will be  patient  while taking decisions related to rates Of course  the central bank did leave some room for flexibility in policymaking  The Fed indicated that the future path of rates would be data dependent and sensitive to forthcoming developments  This led several economists to speculate that a rate cut is likely in the near future    Rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a move  This is why it makes sense to park your funds in real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utility stocks which also offer attractive dividends  Global Slowdown  Trade Tensions Lead to Dovish StanceAccording to the minutes  most Fed policymakers believe that the federal funds target rate should remain unchanged for the rest of the year  given the challenges that the economy is facing at present  The threat of a global economic slump and unresolved trade disputes are the primary risks to the U S  economic outlook for 2019 Fed policymakers also expressed concerns about the sluggish pace of domestic growth witnessed early this year  The central bank also believes that the fallout of a likely inevitable Brexit could harm the economic outlook Sluggish inflation has provided some respite to the Fed  According to the minutes  a robust labor market  rising wages and the imposition of tariffs have failed to boost prices significantly   Several  policymakers believe that the metric may remain below the long term target of 2  this year Could a Rate Cut Happen this Year Despite comments to the effect that it would keep rates flat this year  the central bank provided itself with enough room for flexibility  The majority of policymakers believe that the rates  could shift in either direction based on incoming data   per the minutes  There was also an indication that rates could be hiked marginally if domestic economic momentum picks up While the Federal Reserve thinks the economy will  bounce back solidly  in the second quarter  there is little reason to believe that a rate cut will take place  Instead  market futures are currently pricing in no chance of a hike and a near 55  chance of a rate cut In fact  Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics thinks additional rate hikes are  increasingly unlikely   While the Fed minutes provide no basis to believe that rate cuts would indeed take place  Hunter thinks they will indeed occur going forward Our ChoicesMinutes of the Federal Reserve s latest minutes provide enough reason to believe that rates will likely remain flat this year  In fact  economists and market watchers think chances of a rate hike later this year are exceedingly high Rate sensitive investments like utilities and REITs  which offer attractive dividends  are useful additions to your portfolio under such circumstances

8998,230513,BXP,Vornado  VNO  Reports Items To Be Included In 1Q19 Results,opinion,"Vornado Realty Trust   NYSE VNO   recently announced that its first quarter 2019 financial results will include certain items that will contribute to the company s funds from operation  FFO  plus assumed conversions per share by 51 cents  However  this amount will be excluded in the FFO  as adjusted figure 
These items will have a positive impact of 82 cents per share on the company s net income for the quarter  Similar to FFO  the adjusted net income will exclude the impact 
The items include an after tax net gain of  130 9 million or 64 cents per share from the sale of 220 Central Park South condominium units 
The company will also record prepayment penalty of  22 5 million relating to the redemption of 5  senior unsecured notes worth  400 million due January 2022  This will impact the company s net income and FFO by 11 cents per share  
Lastly  Vornado s results will include a net loss of  4 1 million from other items  This will decrease the company s first quarter FFO by 2 cents per share 
Since 2019 results will reflect a new GAAP accounting standard under which internal leasing costs can no longer be capitalized  the company has provided adjustments in 2018  as adjusted  financial results  which capitalized internal leasing costs  This makes the previous year results comparable with the financial results in 2019  
Specifically  FFO as adjusted for first quarter 2018 and full year 2018 have been reduced by 1 cent and 3 cents per share  respectively 
Notably  Vornado is focused on improving its core business and in line with this  it is redeploying sale proceeds to fund strategic acquisitions and redevelopments  Although these dispositions are strategic for long term growth  the dilutive impact on earnings cannot be bypassed in the near term 
Also  shares of this Zacks  3  Hold  Ranked company have underperformed the  it belongs to  over the past three months  The company s shares have gained 4 2   while the industry recorded growth of 11 6   during this time period

9000,230515,BXP,Why Boston Properties  BXP  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  in Focus
Based in Boston  Boston Properties  BXP  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 21 97   Currently paying a dividend of  0 95 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 77   In comparison  the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield is 4 19   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 8 6  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Boston Properties has increased its dividend 3 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 95   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Boston Properties s current payout ratio is 60   This means it paid out 60  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BXP expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 93 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 10  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BXP is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-boston-properties-bxp-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200405499,200405499

9015,230530,BXP,Boston Properties  BXP  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Boston Properties  Inc    NYSE BXP   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues 
In the last reported quarter  this office real estate investment trust s  REIT  FFO of  1 59 per share improved 7  year over year  Results were supported by higher occupancy and strong leasing activity 
Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the FFO per share estimates on two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  the average negative surprise being 0 87   This is depicted in the graph below 
Boston Properties  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Influence Q1 Results
Per a  by the Newmark Knight Frank  the first quarter office vacancy rate shrunk 30 basis points  bps  year over year to 13   Further  job creation in office using sectors boosted new demand  resulting in 3 2  year over year growth in asking rents 
Specifically  San Francisco  where Boston Properties has significant presence  witnessed strongest net absorption in first quarter 2019  driven by office demand in the tech industry 
These encouraging figures suggest a decent economy and steady growth in the job market which is creating a favorable environment for office properties  In fact  as the economy revives  existing business grows and therefore  corporate sectors seek expansion  renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce 
Also  amid healthy growth in demand for office spaces  office landlords can raise rents for properties In fact  the company s base rent is expected to improve 5 4  year over year to  548 million in the March end quarter 
Significant leasing activity and growth in rental revenues will likely drive the company s performance  In fact  in January  Boston Properties signed two long term leases  aggregating 250 000 square feet at the company s 399 Park Avenue property  located in midtown New York City 
Amid this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total rental revenues for the quarter is pegged at  681 million and indicates a marginal sequential growth 
Although Boston Properties  office portfolio will likely report decent results  performance of the company s hotel property will be a spoilsport in the first quarter  Specifically  quarterly revenues for its hotel property are pegged at  9 29 million  down from the prior quarter reported figure of  11 7 million 
Additionally  escalating construction costs and a significant development pipeline might inflate the company s expenses  thereby hurting bottom line growth  
While the company anticipates first quarter 2019 FFO per share of  1 68  1 70  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at the lower end of the range  indicating 11 4  growth from the year ago quarter reported tally  However  given the lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  the estimate remained unchanged over the past month

9061,230576,BXP,What Makes Boston Properties  BXP  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Boston Properties  NYSE BXP   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Boston Properties currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if BXP is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this real estate investment trust holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For BXP  shares are up 0 93  over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry is up 1 59  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 96  compares favorably with the industry s 6 67  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Boston Properties have increased 6 36  over the past quarter  and have gained 13 82  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 2 29  and 3 64   respectively 
Investors should also take note of BXP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  BXP is averaging 710 254 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BXP 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BXP s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 86 to  6 89 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that BXP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Boston Properties on your short list ",2019-02-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-boston-properties-bxp-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200389294,200389294

9090,230605,BXP,What Makes Boston Properties  BXP  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Boston Properties is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Boston Properties imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Boston Properties
This real estate investment trust is expected to earn  6 89 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2019  which represents a year over year change of 9 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Boston Properties  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Boston Properties to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-boston-properties-bxp-a-new-buy-stock-200386765,200386765

9111,230626,BXP,American Tower  AMT  Rewards Investors With 7 1  Dividend Hike,opinion,"American Tower Corporation   NYSE AMT   recently rewarded its investors with 7 1  sequential hike in quarterly dividends on the company s common shares  Specifically  the company hiked its dividend to 90 cents from the 84 cents paid earlier  The raised dividend is scheduled to be paid on Apr 26  to shareholders on record as of Apr 11  2019 
Based on the new rate  the annualized dividend rate comes to  3 6 per share  up from the prior annual rate of  3 36 per share  This indicates an annualized yield of 2   considering American Tower s closing price of  181 75 on Mar 7 
Can American Tower Maintain its Payout 
American Tower has a disciplined capital allocation strategy and has consistently increased its dividend rate over the past four quarters  thereby raising dividends by around 20  in 2018  Looking at the company s funds from operations  FFO  growth and payout ratio  it will likely be able to sustain maintain the hiked dividend 
Its consolidated adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  per share witnessed a CAGR of 16  over the last 10 years  ended 2018   Moreover  its long term  next five years  estimated AFFO growth rate of 14  promises rewards for investors over the long run  Further  its current payout ratio is nearly 42 6  
Notably increased use of mobile data continues to fuel demand for space on the company s telecom towers  This enabled American Tower to witness splendid leasing activity and organic tenant billings growth in the fourth quarter  With higher investments in 4G and the upcoming 5G technology  wireless carriers will likely densify their network 
Hence  the company is strengthening its portfolio and focusing on innovation to capture underlying opportunities  This will deliver strong operational efficiency and complement its long term growth strategy     
Nevertheless  poor fundamentals of the company might lead to dividend cuts  The amount of debt assumed by a company influences dividend growth  Hence  American Tower s high level of debt raises concerns over sustainability of the current dividend level  It is a highly leveraged company with a debt equity ratio of 3 12 compared with the industry s average of 0 83 
Bottom Line
We believe such disbursements highlight the company s operational strength and commitment toward rewarding its shareholders handsomely  The hike reflects the company s ability to generate solid cash flow growth through its operating platform and high quality portfolio 
Lastly  as investors prefer an income generating stock  solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors  Needless to say  investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on

9112,230627,BXP,AGNC Investment  AGNC  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,AGNC Investment Corp    NASDAQ AGNC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year decline in its net spread and dollar roll income per common share In the last reported quarter  this Bethesda  MD based mortgage real estate investment trust  mREIT   which primarily focuses on leveraged investments in agency MBS  mortgage backed securities   posted net spread and dollar roll income  excluding estimated catch up premium amortization benefit  of 61 cents per share  meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Further  net interest income  NII  of  188 million came in higher than the prior quarter figure of  177 million Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  missed in another and met in the other two  It delivered average negative surprise of 0 01  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history AGNC Investment Corp  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIn the Dec end quarter  AGNC Investment is expected to have benefited from an impressive financial position  Notably  it enjoys solid access to attractive funding across a broad spectrum of counterparties and financing conditions Further  in November  the company injected fresh capital by issuing 46 million shares of common stock  for total gross proceeds of  794 4 million  These fresh funds were used to purchase agency securities  non agency securities  other mortgage related assets and hedging instruments  thereby  enhancing the company s portfolio quality However  the consecutive rate hikes are expected to have hindered its fourth quarter and 2018 performance  This  along with an uncertain global economic environment  has compelled AGNC Investment to adjust its investment portfolio Hence  as the company focuses on risk management  it is less likely to report incremental returns  Furthermore  higher interest rate might impede the company s bottom line performance and its book value as well  In fact  as of Nov 30  2018  its tangible net book value stood at  16 76 per common share  a decline of 18 cents from the previous quarter Additionally  a spike in fixed income volatility and escalating trade tensions are anticipated to have acted as dampeners in the fourth quarter  Moreover  increase in market volatility  higher interest rates and yield curve flattening will likely have resulted in MBS spread widening  thereby  impacting the company s quarterly performance  Hence  there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of net spread and dollar roll income per common sharefor the to be reported quarter remained unrevised at 61 cents  over the past month  Furthermore  it reflects a year over year decline of 1 6   In addition  its 2018 net spread and dollar roll income per common share estimate has been revised marginally downward to  2 44  over the past month  This also reflects a year over year decline of 0 8   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AGNC Investment is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both

9115,230630,BXP,Boston Properties  BXP  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  in Focus
Based in Boston  Boston Properties  BXP  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 12 3   The real estate investment trust is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 95 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 01   This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry s yield of 4 54  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 98  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 8 6  from last year  In the past five year period  Boston Properties has increased its dividend 3 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 7 87   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Boston Properties s current payout ratio is 61   This means it paid out 61  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for BXP for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 84 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 8 57  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  BXP is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boston-properties-bxp-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200381154,200381154

9124,230639,BXP,WashREIT  WRE  Inks Lease For Office Space At Watergate 600,opinion,"Washington Real Estate Investment Trust   NYSE WRE    also known as WashREIT  recently announced that it has executed a 51 000 square foot lease for its office property   Watergate 600   with a leading global energy and infrastructure provider 
With this  two top floors of the property will be occupied by the tenant in January 2020  for a time span of 17 years and eight months  WashREIT acquired the iconic property at 600 New Hampshire Avenue Northwest in 2017  for nearly  437 per square foot of area 
Further  the asset recently received a facelift through an extensive renovation program that revamped the building s entryway  lobby  elevators and common areas  Most likely  this overhaul attracted the new tenant at higher rents  
In addition to this  the building s strategic location is anticipated to have aided WashREIT to ink the lease  In fact  Watergate 600 offers 300 000 square feet of premium office space adjacent to the Kennedy Center  Furthermore  proximity to the Foggy Bottom Metro station offers convenient access  making it an iconic business address 
Per management  the repositioning of this property has enabled the company to create value and re lease majority of vacant space ahead of schedule  In addition  management believes the lease will drive significant same store net operating income  NOI  growth in 2020 and beyond  Also  it will likely enjoy decent occupancy as the building has negligible annual lease expirations until 2026 
Nonetheless  tenant move outs during fourth quarter 2018 impacted occupancy in the company s office portfolio  In fact  same store ending occupancy shrunk 30 basis points  bps   year over year  and 40 bps sequentially to 91 7   At the end of 2018  the company s overall office portfolio was 92 3  occupied and 93 6  leased 
Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have rallied 8 4  over the past three months  You can see 
Going forward  economic improvement and recovery in the job market will likely fuel demand for office spaces  This is because  as the economy revives  business grows and therefore  corporate sectors seek expansion  renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce  This is providing significant impetus to office landlords like Boston Properties  Inc    NYSE BXP    Cousins Properties Incorporated   NYSE CUZ   and Kilroy Realty Corporation   NYSE KRC   
Banking on this favorable trend  WashREIT s strategy to enhance its portfolio quality through redevelopment efforts bodes well  These will likely enable the company to retain tenants  and improve its leasing and occupancy metrics in the upcoming quarters

9136,230651,BXP,Steady Interest Rates Driving REITs Shares Higher  3 Poised For More Gains,opinion,"It s not just borrowers who are benefiting from the Federal Reserve s  patience  on interest rate hikes  Shares of real estate investment trusts  REITs   which allow individual investors to buy stock in commercial real estate portfolios that receive income from a variety of properties  are soaring thanks to the Fed s dovish shift in policy 
Real estate stocks on the S P 500 have jumped 13 7  since the start of the year  after falling 5 6  in 2018  as rising rates cut into home sales and reduced the appeal of the sector s often hefty dividend payments 

But with interest rates remaining low  at least for now  investors are flocking to REIT shares  which offer the benefits of real estate investing diversification  generally robust dividend income and an inflationary hedge without the responsibilities of owning and managing property 

Given their rich dividend yields and strong earnings growth  the three REITs below could provide some of the best long term growth potential for both fixed income and growth investors 
1  Realty Income Corporation 

Yield  4 2 
Current Annual Dividend   2 71

Realty Income Corporation  NYSE O  is a real estate investment trust that specializes in freestanding retail properties in the U S  and Puerto Rico  The company  which owns 5 172 properties totaling 89 6 million rentable square feet  focuses on businesses that are less threatened by e commerce or recessions  such as discount retailers like Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  and Dollar General  NYSE DG   It also concentrates on non discretionary businesses that have a service component  such as pharmacies  fitness gyms and movie theaters 
The stock  which is trading near an all time high  is up 13  in 2019  It closed on Friday at  71 24  Year to date  shares have gained nearly 38  

Despite falling short of analyst expectations on both revenue and net earnings in its most recent earnings report on February 20 for the fourth quarter of 2018  investors were encouraged to see that the company s business continues to grow  Its top line was a promising 10  higher on a year over year basis  while adjusted funds from operations  AFFO   a more accurate measure of REIT profitability than net income  climbed to  0 79 per share from  0 76 in the fourth quarter of 2017 
On top of that  Realty Income reported that their overall occupancy rate was a near full 98 6  in 2018  one of its best rates in years 
Realty Income is a low risk way to bring predictable growth and income to your stock portfolio for the foreseeable future due to a combination of a high dividend payout and strong growth in key metrics The company is also one of just a few REITs that pays dividends monthly  rather than quarterly 
2  EPR Properties

Yield  5 95 
Current Annual Dividend   4 50 

EPR Properties  NYSE EPR  is a specialty real estate investment trust based in the U S  that currently invests in three primary segments  entertainment  such as amusement parks and cinema multiplexes  recreation  including ski resorts  and education such as public charter schools

This random mix seems to be working very well for EPR  whose stock  which closed at  75 39 on Friday  is up 17 7  so far this year  Year to date  it has gained roughly 33  

The company s fourth quarter results  released last month  showed substantial improvements in key metrics for the period  including a 23  rise in adjusted funds from operations  AFFO   Similar to Realty Income  EPR also distributes a monthly dividend

9140,230655,BXP,5 REITs To Double Your Income In 2019,opinion,"I ve zeroed in on five real estate investment trusts  REITs  set to hand you three critical things in 2019 
High  safe payouts whose yields crush the typical S P 500 dividend 
Booming dividend growth  These five have already boosted their payouts an amazing 38   on average  in the last five years and they re just getting started 
Double digit upside as an overlooked market shift kicks in  sending investors scrambling into these ironclad income plays 
Why am I so confident 
Because a long running  and needless  worry that s shackled REITs through 2018 has just been cast aside but most folks are only starting to sense this big shift 
That means now is the time to strike and start tapping REITs  juicy income streams while we wait for their share prices to gap higher 
What Will Drive the Coming REIT Rally
Before we get to the five REITs I want to show you today  let s dive into that barely noticed shift I just mentioned  which is the main reason I see REITs making a big move up in 2019 
To get the full picture here  we need to take a quick look back at what happened in 2018 
REITs languished this year as investors fretted  falsely  that rising interest rates would pump up yields on so called  safe  investments  like Treasuries and CDs  That would theoretically hurt REITs  as they tend to appeal to the same type of investor as fixed income investments do 
Check out how the go to REIT benchmark  the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  has lagged the market since Jan  1 
A Textbook Undervalued Income Play
The thing I really want you to focus on  though  is how REITs reeled in the S P 500 and briefly overtook it at the end of that chart 
This shows us that the herd is starting to sense that something s shifted  And that s the moment we want to buy  when REITs are still cheap  but the next move up has clicked in and is about to really get rolling 
Because here s what just changed about interest rates  a couple weeks back  we were expecting 4 increases from the Federal Reserve in 2019  But fast forward to today  and we re looking at just one  and maybe none    according to traders betting through the Fed futures markets 
Source  CME Group  NASDAQ CME 
Meantime  10 year Treasuries yield all of 2 8  today  so no one s retiring on them  either 
The key takeaway  With the Fed sidelined and the economy still piping along nicely  pushing up demand for REITs  rental space   we ve got a perfect  goldilocks  situation for REITs in 2019 
To help you get in on it  I ve pored over my last 12 months of ContrarianOutlook com articles to bring you the five REITs that should be at the top of your year end shopping list 
They are  office landlord Boston Properties  NYSE BXP   healthcare property investor National Health Investors Inc  NYSE NHI   hotel owner Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc  NYSE RHP   data center owner Digital Realty Trust Inc  NYSE DLR   and warehouse manager STAG Industrial Inc  NYSE STAG  
All have unbeatable strengths that safeguard our cash and set us up for serious gains in 2019 
Ryman  for example  is a small cap REIT  its market cap is just  3 8 billion  with four resorts operating under Marriott s Gaylord hotel brand 
You might think Ryman s small size leaves it vulnerable to the whims of the broader economy  but the REIT cuts its risk by zeroing in on business conferences  This is a wonderful market  because once these clients find a resort they like  they tend to keep coming back  And Ryman s hotels are sitting in conference hotspots like Nashville  Orlando  Dallas and Washington  DC 
The best news for Ryman is that the  meeting market  is growing  with spending jumping 23  from 2009 to 2016  according to the latest numbers from travel research firm Tourism Economics 
Meantime  Digital Realty  as I pointed out a couple weeks ago  is at the heart of the shift toward artificial intelligence  one of the many tech megatrends that will power this data center landlord s share price and dividend for decades to come 
Finally  National Health Investors adds ballast to our portfolio  providing financing for steady medical tenants  such as seniors  homes and hospitals 
Your 5 REIT Portfolio  What the Numbers Say
So with that  let s put our 5 REITs to the test  starting with 3 crucial numbers for us income hounds  dividend yield  dividend growth and payout ratio  dividends as a percentage of funds from operations  FFO   a vital measure of dividend safety  
 Not including special dividends paid in Dec  2014  Dec  2015 and Dec  2016 
As you can see  these 5 names give us a nice mix of high yields and dividend growth   As I recently showed you in an example using 3M  NYSE MMM   a rising payout is the No  1 driver of stock prices  
And before you ask  yes  all of those payout ratios are easily manageable for well run REITs like these  In fact  you ll often find much higher ratios of 90  and more in REIT land that are perfectly safe  as many REITs can count on steady  predictable rent checks from long term tenants 
Finally  there are some real bargains in this bin  Ryman  for example  trades at a ridiculous 12 1 times adjusted FFO  with NHI and DLR also sitting at an attractive 16 0 and 17 8 times  respectively 
It s no surprise that the two priciest trusts are STAG  20 7 times FFO  and Boston Properties  20 3   But those are fair prices  they re both below the S P 500 s 21 3  considering BXP has the second fastest dividend grower in our basket and boasts the lowest payout ratio  And STAG sports the highest current yield and pays dividends monthly  to boot 
The bottom line  All the pieces are in place for REITs to book a nice run in 2019  as the market finally gets over its interest rate phobia and these 5 are perfectly positioned to lead the pack 
Revealed  My No  1 REIT Pick for 2019  7  dividends and big gains ahead  
My No  1 REIT pick for 2019 boasts an even higher payout than any of the 5 trusts above I m talking about a dividend yielding an incredible 6 9  as I write  What s more  this payout isn t just growing its yearly increases are getting bigger and bigger 
Imagine What This Could Do for Your Retirement
I love it when a stock with a fat dividend yield gives us strong payout growth  too  It s proof that management is making more money  so it can afford to pay us shareholders more  An accelerating payout is a flat out cry for help 
Make no mistake  this payout s growth is here to stay  This 7  payer is backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years 
And before you ask  it doesn t care about interest rates  no matter what happens with the Fed  this REIT will just continue to raise the rents on its  must have  facilities 
That s why I ve made this unsung trust a cornerstone of my  8  No Withdrawal  portfolio  a collection of 6 investments from every corner of the market that I ve assembled to do one thing  two  actually  
Deliver a safe 8  average dividend yield  That s enough to pay you  40 000 in income enough for many folks to retire on a  500 000 nest egg 
Safeguard your retirement stash  letting you fund your golden years on dividends alone without drawing down your nest egg by a single penny  This insures your retirement against a market meltdown and lets you leave a lasting legacy for your kids  and grandkids

The Zacks analyst thinks the growing momentum of Google Cloud and expanding data centers will continue to bolster the company s presence in the cloud space  Also  major updates in its search segment are enhancing search results which is a tailwind  The company has shown good execution to date  more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive search market  
Additionally  Google s strong focus on the innovation of its AI techniques and Android OS along with growing presence in the home automation space are driving its top line growth further  However  the company s growing litigation issues might hurt its profitability  Also it s increased spending on consumer gadgets  YouTube video app and cloud computing services remain concerns  Rising competition in the online ad market is a risk

The company s 20 year market outlook forecasts commercial jetliner demand to increase by 4 1   with single aisle jets being the major driver behind this demand growth  Boeing expects the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained annual growth in commercial passenger traffic along with a big wave of retiring  old planes  
Boeing s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend  ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions  However  this aerospace giant may face competitive challenges if new manufacturers like China enters the commercial jet space  Engine related issues pertaining to its 787 fleet may also hurt company s growth

The New York office landlord has acquired 66 186 zoning square feet of development rights from the adjacent lot owner at 189 Broadway  This provides light and air easement along with the right to cantilever over 189 Broadway 
It also secured a  225 million construction financing for the project with United Overseas Bank Limited and Helaba  The facility carries a floating rate and has a term of three years along with two one year extension options 
The 260 000 gross square foot building will offer nearly 209 rental units  two floors of flagship retail at the building s base and three floors of commercial space  The retail space  situated between the Fulton Transit Center and the World Trade Center  is expected to attract well known retailers 
Notably  30  of the units will be affordable apartments ranging from studio  one bedroom  two bedroom and three bedroom units  The project will be enrolled under the Affordable New York Housing Program  This will not only mark the first building in Lower Manhattan under the city s new Affordable New York Housing program  it will also allow a 35 year property tax abatement

While such efforts will enhance the company s portfolio over the long term  hike in interest rate can pose a challenge  especially as it has exposure to floating rate loans  Hence  with an increase in interest rates  we expect SL Green s interest expenses to escalate

capacity of rent that can be shelled out  Although economic growth is likely to be less robust this year  the level will likely remain stable  supporting the industry  Moreover  easy availability of

9176,230691,BXP,Boston Properties  BXP  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Boston Properties basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Boston Properties imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Boston Properties
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this real estate investment trust is expected to earn  6 95 per share  which is a change of 10 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Boston Properties  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Schwab  SCHW   NextEra  NEE  and MetLife  NYSE MET   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Schwab s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the last six months  gaining  31 7  vs  15 6   The company has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  Its first quarter 2018 results benefited from higher revenues  partly offset by higher expenses  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains well positioned to gain from the rising rate environment and its initiatives to strengthen trading income  Further  the benefits from tax act will aid financials  However  continuous rise in expenses  due to rise in compensation costs  are expected to hurt bottom line growth  Also  the company s significant dependence on fee based income remains a concern and might hamper its financials in the near term 
 You can   
Shares of NextEra have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the last year  the stock is up  17 5  vs   4 1  decline for the industry   NextEra Energy s first quarter earnings were better than expectations  thanks to strong contribution from its segments  The Zacks analyst thinks NextEra Energy s investment to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  when completed  will help it serve its expanding customer base more efficiently  
The company s focus on clean energy has helped it lower emission levels and use of new technology has saved on energy bills for its customers  The natural gas pipelines  which came online in first half of 2017  are expected to boost its performance  
However  the company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Despite investments made to strengthen its infrastructure the unpredictable nature of natural disaster could derail normal operation and impact profitability 
 You can   
Buy ranked MetLife s shares have gained  4 4  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Multi Line Insurance industry  which has lost  2 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to streamline business  only to focus on core business  are really impressive  
Its revenues grew in 2017 after declining for two years and the trend is likely to continue in 2018  Its strong international operations and disciplined capital management should drive long term growth  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 2 9  upward over the last 30 days  
MetLife  Inc  s first quarter earnings of  1 36 per share beat expectations but declined 7  year over year  The quarter benefited from favorable underwriting  volume growth and a favorable impact of the tax reform  Nevertheless  exposure to catastrophe losses and investment in efficiency programs will put pressure on margins

9188,230703,BXP,3 Unloved High Yielders To Rise With Rates  And Pay Up To 7  In Cash  ,opinion,"Once again  almost everyone has gotten sucked in by a tired investor slogan that s dead wrong and it s costing them big gains  and income  
But that s good news for contrarians like us  because we can bank some easy profits thanks to this all too predictable reflex 
That s especially true now that the Federal Reserve has sent out a blaringly obvious signal that it s stuck to its rate hike track  calling the economy  strong  after its latest meeting last week 
But let s not get ahead of ourselves  Before I go further  the shopworn myth I m talking about is that REITs nosedive when interest rates rise 
Many folks just can t be talked out of it  despite all evidence to the contrary  including the fact that REITs skyrocketed during the last sustained rising rate cycle  in 2004 06 
Taking the Short View
This  wisdom  is deceiving because it looks true  around the time the Fed raises rates or the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury takes off  REITs do take a hit 
To see this in action  check out the movements of the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  and the yield on the 10 year Treasury in the first two months of 2018  There s no doubt the higher Treasury yield weighed down REITs back then 
Rates Up  REITs Down  
But that s a very short timeframe just two months  And folks who dumped perfectly good REITs over the side back then have missed out on a huge rally since 
Because after plunging as low as 13  on the year in February  VNQ has surged  mainly on strong REIT earnings as the growing economy powers rent increases and demand for space 
The result  As of this writing  VNQ is underwater by a mere 1 5  
REIT Worriers Miss Out and Our Buy Window Narrows 
That means just one thing  our time to buy REITs cheap is running out 
But if you ve been on the sidelines this year  don t worry  Even though REITs aren t the screaming deal they were six months ago  there are still bargains waiting for us in this rebounding sector 
I ll show you 3 great examples  with dividend yields up to 5 2   in a moment  First  we need to talk about one popular REIT sector that s gotten way ahead of itself 
Retail REITs  Great for Gamblers  Lousy for Investors
Mall landlords are so popular  they re all most people think of when they hear about REITs totally forgetting all the other  and often higher yielding  corners of the sector  everything from cell tower REITs to apartment landlords  self storage operators and warehouse owners 
The truth is  retail REITs are fine to trade in and out of   in the short term 
For example  if you d bought one of the biggest retail REITs out there Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  when REITs hit their 2018 low on February 8  you d have racked up a huge 18  gain in just 6 months 
Retail REITs  Short Term Upside   
But stretch that out over a longer time say over the last three years and performance has been dismal  barely a 6  return  You d have been way better off dropping your cash into the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  
  But Longer Term Mediocrity 
I know what you re thinking   Brett  retail REITs like Simon have outperformed in the past and for long stretches  too  
That s true  But much of that growth came before Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  was taking a huge bite of mall tenants  bottom lines  as it is today 
And the fact is  while some mall owners are having success re leasing shuttered locations of Payless Shoe Source  RadioShack  Toys R Us and Bon Ton Stores just a few of the major retailers to go bankrupt last year many still have a long way to go 
The numbers tell the tale  US malls are at their lowest occupancy since 2012  according to CNBC   with 8 6  of their floor space sitting empty  This at a time when consumer spending and GDP are exploding 
The bottom line  The easy gains in mall REITs have been banked  so it s a great time to look to these 3 cheap non mall REITs instead 
REIT Pick No  1  A 37  Dividend Grower on a Roll
Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc  NYSE ARE  is still available for a lower price than you could snag it for in early January  But that won t last after the trust s second quarter results poured in last week a greatest hits list that was the envy of the REIT world 
To wit  revenue jumped 19  year over year  adjusted per share funds from operations  FFO  the best measure of REIT performance  spiked 9   and management upped its full year FFO forecast to between  6 57 and  6 63 a share  a big leap from the  6 02 ARE generated in 2017 
There s more to come  unlike the average mall landlord  ARE is enjoying superb occupancy  with 97 1  of its operating properties taken up as of quarter end  That s thanks to its focus on the growing life sciences industry  biotech firms working on the latest breakthrough drugs 
Don t confuse  biotech  with  speculative   ARE s clients are some of the biggest in the business  including Novartis AG ADR  NYSE NVS   Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   Sanofi  PA SASY  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Which brings us to the dividend  which gives you the best of both worlds  a decent yield  2 9   and superb payout growth  Over the last five years  ARE s dividend has surged 37  with the payout regularly getting bumped up twice a year 
Annual Raises Are for Suckers 
The kicker 
The payout is safe  at just 53  of FFO  low for a REIT  and reasonably priced  ARE trades at 19 4 times the midpoint of forecast FFO  cheap for a stock with rock solid tenants and a surging dividend  which will drag the share price higher as it rises  
REIT Pick No  2  A  Surprise  Special Dividend on the Way
Don t let the name fool you  Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  goes way beyond Beantown  with 164 office buildings  48 4 million square feet  in Boston  New York  Los Angeles  San Francisco and Washington  DC 
It cuts its risk further by evenly spreading those properties out among those growing metropolises  Check it out 
 Source  Boston Properties
Like Alexandria  BXP boasts top notch clients  including ultra steady Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   in Q2  BXP leased 440 000 square feet to a subsidiary of the telecom giant and broke ground on its 627 000 square foot office tower in Boston  50  owned   Verizon will lease 70  of that space for 20 years 
Meantime  management is calling for serious FFO growth  with forecast FFO coming in at  6 36 to  6 41 a share in 2018  up from BXP s previous estimate and way ahead of last year s tally of  6 22 
Like ARE  BXP s shares are below where they were in January  and they boast a similar valuation  20 6 times forward FFO again  reasonable for a REIT with an above average dividend yield  2 4   a growing payout  up 23  in the past five years  and a healthy balance sheet  its  10 3 billion of long term debt is around half its market cap  
Plus there s a hidden benefit no one pays attention to  BXP loves to drop outsized special dividends on shareholders  having done so in three of the past five years  With the  regular  payout accounting for a meager 49  of forecast FFO  another one of these surprise  specials  could come our way any day 
Let s buy now  before that happens 
REIT Pick No  3  Familiar Monthly Payer Still Looks Great
STAG Industrial Inc  NYSE STAG  gets a lot of space in my Contrarian Outlook articles  There are several good reasons for that  the warehouse owner pays dividends monthly  offers the highest dividend yield of our 3 picks  5 2    and delivers strong dividend growth  too  the monthly payout has jumped 18  in the last five years  
How does management do it 
For one  they follow one of the oldest rules in investing  diversification  Right now  STAG has 360 buildings across 37 states and doesn t lean too heavily on any one of them  Its client list is 312 strong  and these tenants are well balanced across sectors  as you can see here 
A Diverse Industrial Player  Source  STAG summer 2018 investor presentation
And second  management is constantly re evaluating the portfolio  selling properties when it feels their values have peaked and plowing the cash into better opportunities  In just the second quarter  STAG bought 15 buildings for  185 million while unloading five for  31 2 million  making a gain of  6 3 million on those sales 
Meantime  the crew at the top does a great job of attracting and retaining tenants  resulting in STAG s sky high 96 6  occupancy rate and helping boost FFO by 9 8  year over year in Q2 
And yet STAG is still overlooked  trading at the same price it did in January and at a bargain 15 8 times FFO  The dividend is safe  too  at just 81  of FFO  Grab this one and kick start its fat monthly payout stream now

On Mondays 8 30 CT futures open  the S7P 500 futures printed 2666 25  pulled back to 2864 25  and then traded up to the high of the day at 2871 25  After the high was in I put this out  IMPRO Dboy  9 49 01 AM  well if you are a seller here is the push  and a few minutes later the ES started heading south  making several lower lows all the way down to 2854 50  The ES had gone up too much too fast on Friday  and the algos started chasing sell stops 
After the early low  the ES short covered and made several higher lows until it traded up above the vwap up to 2868 25  and then pulled back down 2863 50  From there  it sold off all the way down to new lows of the day at 2851 50  as the MiM went from buy  406 million to sell to  980 million to sell  There was a small pop back up to 2859 00 before trading down to 2855 50 on the 3 00 cash close  down 19 25 handles  or  0 67   and went on to settle at 2853 75  down 21 handles on the day and down 25 handles from the Globex high 
Between 10 year note settling at 2 695   the highest level since April 2014  the end of the month rebalancing talk  and the VIX going out at 13 84  it ended up a pretty ugly day for the S P  Every bounce was a short squeeze for the final knock down at the end of the day  I said early on in the MrTopStep forum that Friday and Sunday night looked like a blow off top  and that s how it closed

While You Were Sleeping

Overnight  equity markets in Asia and Europe were down across the board  following suit with yesterday s weakness in U S  stocks  According to MarketWatch com  the main force driving stocks lower is how the increase in U S  treasury yields is affecting borrowing costs 
In the U S  the S P 500 futures opened last night s Globex session at 2853 25  and initially traded higher  printing the high at 2858 00 just after 6 00 PM CT  There was very little strength after that  and by 8 00 PM  the ES had melted all the way down to 2831 00 
Things simmered down after that  and stocks began to recover a little  As of 7 00 AM CT  the last print in the ES is 2839 75  down  13 75 handles  with 261k contracts traded 
Earnings vs  End Of The Month Rebalance  Walk Away 
Our View  Today there are two contrasting thoughts on the S P  The first is the earnings scene  According to FactSet  firms in the S P 500 are beating analyst estimates for sales at a record rate  With nearly 25  of companies in the S P reporting 2017 4th quarter earnings  81  of the firms have beaten forecasts for revenue growth  If that rate holds through the end of earnings season  it would be the highest beat rate in records going back to 2008  The other side is  with the S P up over 7  in the first trading month of the year  there is a high probability that there is going to be some type of rebalancing at the end of January 
According to a Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  model  with the S P up 7   the 10 year treasury futures down over 1 6  in January  and with those profits and losses in mind heading into month end  pension funds are set to purchase about  24 billion in fixed income securities  and selling an unusually high  12 billion of U S  equities  J P  Morgan s calculations say that  each 1  climb in stocks equates to  25 billion of bond buying by U S  pension funds to keep their asset allocation balanced  State and local government defined benefit plans have about 60  in equities and 25  in fixed income  while for private plans  the split is closer to 50 40  In total  that s  125 billion of rebalancing in the wings 
Throw in stock and commodity sentiment at record highs  Trump s State of the Union address tonight  the Federal Reserve s two day monetary policy meeting  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  reporting this week  it s not hard to see why the VIX is going up  From the December 29  2677 50 low to Sunday nights Globex high at 2878 75 high the ES has rallied 220 25 handles  When you take the 19 trading day so far this year and you divide it by 220 25 that s an average gain of 11 59 handles a day 
Our view is for increased volatility  While our lean is to sell rallies over the next few days  we do expect to see some bounces  We still see key support at the 2828 2830 level  If that breaks down the ES could see 2809 50  last weeks low  but we do not expect that

9227,230742,BXP,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   January 21  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Boston Properties  NYSE BXP   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72  If you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you retire 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  The RMD you are required to take is calculated by dividing your previous year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

9255,230770,BXP,What s In The Offing For UDR Inc  UDR  This Earnings Season ,opinion,UDR Inc    NYSE UDR   is slated to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 30  after the market closes Last quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered in line result with respect to funds from operations  FFO  per share  Results reflect growth in revenues from same store and stabilized  non mature communities Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met estimates in the other three  the average beat being nearly 0 6   The graph below depicts this surprise history United Dominion Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    For the third quarter  the company projects FFO per share in the range of 46 47 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents Let s see how things are shaping up for UDR prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market  The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U S  markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation  These are likely to drive results in the to be reported quarter Specifically  the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends  There is steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters  Along with this  the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments In fact  according to a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP     the U S  apartment market recorded stable rent growth  while occupancy remained encouraging in the third quarter  However  these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years  For new leases  effective rents inched up 0 9  during the quarter and 2 6  annually  Further  apartment occupancy came in at 95 5  for the third quarter across the nation s top 100 metros However  we remain apprehensive about UDR s performance as the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets  This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption  As such  concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end  while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is pegged at  250 1 million  denoting estimated growth of 2 8  year over year Also  prior to the third quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past two months Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for UDR is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 47 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  UDR s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter CoreSite Realty Corporation   NYSE COR

9259,230774,BXP,Forget The Fed  Buy These 5 REITs Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,opinion,The Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting  which clearly signal a December rate hike  might keep investors in the REIT space worried  The Fed s anticipation that the factors leading to a slowdown in inflation will eventually subside further enhances the chances of a rate hike However  it won t be prudent to brood too much on a rate hike  Rather  the focus should be on the expected Q3 financial results of REITs based on the fundamentals of asset categories to which they cater to  Here  we will tell you why Forget Fed MovesNo doubt  for REITs  which depend on debt for their business and pay high and consistent dividend  a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows  Therefore  asset valuation  including bond coupons and stock dividends  experiences a decline  But a rise in rates also lugs along scope for increasing future cash flows In fact  any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy and the central bank s confidence in the recovery  When economic growth picks up and inflation rises  prices of real estate generally increase  Consequently  rent and occupancy of properties go up  As such  REIT s earnings  cash flow and dividend get a boost Focus on Underlying Asset StrengthsIn fact  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery  a number of asset categories displayed strength in third quarter 2017  Take for example the industrial asset category that has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand  recovering economy and job market  strengthening e commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment Moreover  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  In fact  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm  CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBG    the U S  office vacancy rate declined to 12 9  in the third quarter amid growth in office using jobs  In most of the U S  office markets  vacancy declined  taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post recession low Also  the U S  apartment market reported stable rent growth  while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter  per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP    For new leases  effective rents inched up 0 9  during the quarter and 2 6  annually  Further  apartment occupancy came in at 95 5  for the third quarter across the country s top 100 metros Pick Stocks Poised to Beat in Q3However  not all REITs from these asset categories are poised to excel  Therefore  in addition to focusing on REITs that have healthy underlying asset category fundamentals  investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can be far more rewarding because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors  confidence in a stock Nevertheless  choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method  To make the task simple  we rely on the Zacks methodology  which takes into account a favorable rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Here are five REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they

    Residential REIT  Equity Residential has been repositioning its portfolio to focus on high barrier markets and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent quarters  The company s same store revenue growth is anticipated to bear the brunt of an elevated new supply and slowdown in high paying jobs in San Francisco and New York   Read more   Moreover  though the assets sale might help the company to focus exclusively on its core  high density urban markets over the long term  the earnings dilution impact from such a move would be impossible to avoid in the near term This Zacks Rank  3 stock also has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and is less likely to surpass estimates in the third quarter  Moreover  the company has met estimates in two and missed on the other two occasions  over the trailing four quarters  The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company EQUITY RESIDENT Price and EPS Surprise

    Liberty Property Trust is focused on industrial portfolio expansion amid favorable demand supply dynamics  The company has been making concerted efforts to divest its non core assets and utilize the proceeds for gaining preferred properties across the U S Recently  the company announced the closure of the sale of 108 properties in five markets  for  969 million  Majority of them were suburban offices and flex non core assets  In fact  with this sale  its share of total dispositions reached  1 2 billion so far this year  While such moves are a strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilution effect of sale of assets on earnings is unavoidable This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock presently has an Earnings ESP 0 00   This reduces the chances of any positive surprise in the third quarter Moreover  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Yet  this stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below LIBERTY PPTY TR Price and EPS Surprise

9372,230887,BXP,Nonfarm Payrolls Rise In October  Economy Adds 171 000 Jobs,opinion,The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment situation report Friday showing that nonfarm payrolls increased by 171 000 jobs in October and revisions added an additional 85 000 jobs  greater than estimates of an increase of 125 000 jobs on the headline number  The unemployment rate rose to 7 9 percent from 7 8 percent S P 500 futures were flat heading into the release but jumped higher by about five points after the release to 1 427 60  Also  the 10 year Treasury yield increased and the USD JPY  the most susceptible currency pair to price swings due to economic releases  jumped from near 80 30 to 80 60 on the release  As yields increase in the U S  and the economy improves  investors sell the yen against the dollar in search for higher yields and safer returns  Gold slipped below  1 700 00 per ounce on the COMEX as hopes of further QE from the Fed were dashed by the stronger than expected jobs growth Manufacturing jobs were rather strong in October  adding jobs after consecutive months of job losses  The ISM Manufacturing Index and its employment sub index hinted that this number could improve and it did  However  average hourly earnings and the average workweek remained flat  meaning employees are not seeing wage nor hours growth Boston Properties  BXP  CEO Mort Zuckerman in an interview with Bloomberg TV said that although the data was stronger than expected  adding 171 000 jobs is not nearly enough to escape the unemployment crisis that the U S  faces  He added that the economy needs to add 150 000 jobs per month just to account for the new entrants to the workforce and so an increase of 171 000 is not much higher than that limit Economists are already increasing expectations for the November release due out in one month following the effects of Superstorm Sandy  Although the storm was devastating and could cause up to  50 billion in damages  construction companies and other companies responsible for the clean up will need to hire more people to aid in the clean up efforts  Thus  the next few month s of jobs reports could continue to be strong  Also  for the past few years  job growth has tended to accelerate from the the fourth quarter through the first and into the second of the next year and then slowed again The report comes just five days before the U S  Presidential election  on which investors  eyes are now focused  Most surveys indicate the race as being too close to call at this point and the race will come down to a few states  The employment situation report will be the last major economic data release ahead of the election  which Tom Keene of Bloomberg Surveillance has deemed the economy election Good news lies in the footnotes of the report  The Labor Force Participation Rate  a good measure of people s confidence in the job market  rose to 63 8 percent in October  the second consecutive month of gains following the rate reaching a multi decade low just a few months ago  Also  the number of people employed part time for economic reasons  a measure that reflects the ability of those looking for full time employment being unable to find it  fell by 269 000  partially off setting the jump in September which was probably due to the return of students to colleges and universities where they take research co op jobs  Also  the number of discouraged workers  those who have given up looking for a job  fell By Matthew Kanterman,2012-11-04,Benzinga ,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/nonfarm-payrolls-rise-in-october,-economy-adds-171,000-jobs-142170",142170
9373,230888,BXP,Here s How To Choose The Right REIT ETF Now,opinion,It may seem like madness to suggest buying REITs at a time when yields are soaring and anything associated with  income investing  is getting slammed  But with many popular REITs down 30  or more  now is precisely the time to start digging around for value This bond market selloff roiling all income focused securities may very well continue for a while  and I don t recommend trying to catch the proverbial falling knife by calling an exact bottom in REIT shares  But at the very least  you can build a watch list of your favorite names and average into them on any weakness  This has been my approach in my own income focused portfolios But what about REIT ETFs Given the popularity of REITs  a plethora of ETFs have sprung up  each offering a slightly different approach to the asset class  While I prefer to cherry pick a portfolio of my favorite REITs  REIT ETFs may be a great option for smaller accounts or investors who prefer a  one stop shop  approach I ll go through several familiar  and probably not so familiar  names today Let s start with the biggest and most popular ETFs in the segment  which hold the largest cap equity REITs  In this space  we have the Vanguard REIT ETF  VNQ   the SPDR Dow Jones REIT  RWR   the iShares Cohen   Steers Realty Majors  ICF  and the iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate ETF  IYR    What is immediately striking about this group is the pitifully low yield on RWR and ICF  For an asset class that is ostensibly income focused  that is simply not a high enough yield to warrant serious consideration  Each of these ETFs uses a slightly different index to track the sector  but their top ten holdings are nearly identical  Simon Property Group  SPG  is the single largest holding in all four ETFs  and HCP Inc  HCP   Public Storage  PSA   Vornado  VNO   and Equity Residential  EQR  feature prominently as well  While there is nothing  wrong  with these large cap REITs  some of them have yields that are a little less than impressive for securities that were designed to be income vehicles  Simon Property Group  the largest holding in all four ETFs  yields only 2 9   Some of these REITs and Vornado has been a high profile case of this in recent years have evolved away from pure landlording and have moved to become  deal making  growth vehicles in which property speculation is as important  or more so  than collecting rent checks  Again  there is nothing inherently  wrong  with this  but it may not be what you are looking for if you consider yourself an income investor   Not surprisingly  since all four large cap REIT funds hold substantially the same securities  they tend to track each other pretty closely  see Figure 1   Given that these are index investments with no active management in place  the smartest course of action is to buy the ETF with the highest yield and lowest management fee  This leaves us with the Vanguard REIT ETF and the iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate  The iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate has a slightly higher current yield  15 basis points  though its management fee is 37 basis points higher  Normally  I would call that close enough to be a wash  But the Vanguard ETF is a purer play on actual property owning equity REITs  whereas the iShares fund has exposure to mortgage REITs and to non REIT development and holding companies such as Alexander and Baldwin  ALEX   which  among other things  produces sugar and coffee on Hawaiian plantations  For broad large cap REIT exposure  go with Vanguard s VNQ  I would consider this appropriate for a long term asset allocation  and in the interests of full disclosure that is exactly how I utilize it myself  Specialty REITSAs I mentioned in the section above  cap weighting tends to skew the large cap REIT ETFs towards a handful of very large REITs that tend to have mediocre yields  This brings me to two small to mid cap REIT ETFs  The PowerShares KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT  KBWY  and the IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF  ROOF   There is a lot to like about the small cap sector  Because the REITs are smaller and less followed by Wall Street  you can often find better pricing and higher yields  You have to do your homework and look at the underlying property portfolios for signs of over concentration in certain markets or deteriorating tenant quality  But with that added bit of work comes the potential for a lifetime of higher dividend payments  And of course  with an index fund like KBWY or ROOF  you can avoid the homework by just buying the entire basket  Unfortunately  both KBWY and ROOF are small in terms of assets under management and have fairly thin trading volumes  So  you have to be careful when buying or selling and you should use a limit order  And ROOF may be somewhat poorly named  as it includes both mortgage REITs and traditional equity REITs   For anyone needing a review   equity REITs  hold properties whereas  mortgage REITs  hold mortgages and mortgage derivatives  One is an investment in real assets  the other in paper   I like KBWY s portfolio and consider it worth owning alongside the large cap Vanguard REIT ETF  National Retail Properties  NNN  is a core holding in several income portfolios I run  and I consider Omega Healthcare Investors  OHI   Government Properties Income Trust  GOV   and Health Care REIT  HCN  to be solid income producers  And what about sector REIT ETFs  iShares has multiple offerings on this front  but none are exceptionally appealing  The iShares FTSE Industrial Office REIT ETF  FNIO  has 32  of the portfolio in just two stocks ProLogis  PLD  and Boston Properties  BXP   It also has a pitiful  12 million under management and trades only 3 000 shares per day  This ETF may not be in business a year from now  Likewise  the iShares FTSE NAREIT Retail REIT ETF  RTL  is heavily weighted in just one stock Simon Property Group  at 22  of the portfolio and trades just 8 000 shares per day  The iShares FTSE NAREIT Residential REIT ETF  REZ  is the only sector REIT ETF that has any volume to speak of  at 70 000 shares traded per day  but even this is too low a volume for a larger portfolio  This residential REIT ETF is also the best diversified of the lot  though I do not consider apartment REITs particularly attractive at current prices and yields  With the housing market recovering and with the Echo Boomers  aka  Generation Y  or the  Millennials   now  for the most part  moved out of their parents  basements and into apartments of their own  the strong demand that has underpinned the sector is looking a little more tepid  This doesn t mean that the sector is facing a pending crash  mind you  But I don t see the growth going forward  and 2 9  is not a high enough yield to warrant holding based on income alone  And finally  I should say a word about mortgage REITs  Mortgage REITs operate like  virtual banks   borrowing cheaply short term and using the proceeds to buy long dated mortgages  The difference between the two is the  spread   which varied based on the term structure of interest rates  Rising bond yields have wrecked the book value of the REITs  mortgage holdings and have prompted investors to dump the securities en masse  But going forward  a steeper yield curve is actually good  as it increases the spread between the borrowing rate and the lending rate  The question you have to ask yourself as a potential investor is this  Has the curve finished steepening  or do we have a ways to go  If believe  as I do  that the hike in Treasury bond yields is a short term blip and not a major regime shift  then mortgage REITs as a sector make sense  Many of the larger names such as Annaly Capital Management  NLY  now sell for well below book value  But I should be clear here  while equity REITs are solid  buy and hold  investments for investors who want exposure to real  income producing assets  mortgage REITs most assuredly are not  They are closer to publically traded hedge funds and are nothing more than highly leveraged paper shuffling vehicles  Mortgage REITs should be viewed as a trade  not a long term investment  On the ETF front  there are two mortgage REIT funds of note  the Market Vectors Mortgage REIT ETF  MORT  and the iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage Plus Index ETF  REM   which currently yield 9 25  and 11 15   respectively  Though please note that mortgage REIT dividends are fair less consistent than equity REIT dividends  Note  There are plenty of REIT ETFs I left out of this write up either due to lack of assets under management and liquidity concerns or due to the fact that  in my estimation  they added no noteworthy new exposure that wasn t already covered by another ETF  Disclosures

9374,230889,BXP,Beginning September 2015  REITs Will Be 11th Sector Of The S P 500 ,opinion,"Standard   Poor s made a big announcement in the last few weeks  Real Estate Investment Trusts  REITs  will be broken out as a separate asset class beginning in September  2015 and will constitute the 11th sector of the S P 500  If you follow our regular weekly earnings work on this blog  you know the other 10 sectors by now 
Greg Harrison of Thomson Reuters provided me with the following spreadsheet on the new sector and I was somewhat surprised at its small size  
The market cap will be less than 3  of the S P 500  which means that the REITs listed will be smaller than the Telco  Utilities  and Basic Materials sectors of the S P 500  The REIT sector will be roughly 2 3  of the S P 500 when it is spun out  and is currently contained in the Financial sector of the S P 500

Sam Zell timed the market perfectly in late 2006  when he sold Equity Office to Blackstone  so Boston Properties  NYSE BXP  looks like it will be the only commercial real estate or office property REIT in the index 
I got to know some of the retail REITs like Kimco  NYSE KIM  and others as well in the early 1990s  although you would think mall properties are another sector being punished or pressured by Amazon   Long Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN

34374,255889,BXP,Key Factors To Impact Essex Property s  ESS  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Essex Property Trust  Inc    NYSE ESS   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Jan 29  after the closing bell  The company s performance will likely display year over year growth in funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this San Mateo  CA based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  reported a negative surprise of 0 3  in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected improved net operating income  NOI  from its communities  while occupancy level moderated sequentially and year over year Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  the average beat being 0 78   This is depicted in the graph below  Essex Property Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors at PlayFollowing a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   occupancy at the end of fourth quarter 2019 remained as high as 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 With a solid balance sheet  Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends  household formation and job market growth in its markets  Substantial exposure to the West Coast market  which is home to several innovation and technology companies  is anticipated to have provided ample scope to bolster its top line growth in the quarter under review In fact  the region has been witnessing solid job growth  higher wages  increased percentage of renters than owners and favorable migration trends  Further  transition from renter to homeowner is difficult in its markets due to high cost of homeownership  These are likely to have favorably impacted rental housing demand during the period under consideration As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues of  373 8 million indicates a 5 8  improvement  year on year  In addition  the company estimates core FFO per share of  3 36  3 46 for the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pinned at  3 42  It reflects 7 2  growth from the prior year quarter s reported tally Moreover  Essex Property maintains a solid balance sheet and enjoys financial flexibility  As of Oct 22  2019  the company had  1 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities  This healthy financial position is likely to have helped the company strengthen and expand its business  Also  management noted that decrease in cost of capital since last January has helped it exceed high end of its acquisition targets and it is seeking out accretive opportunities Nevertheless  apartment deliveries are expected to be elevated in a number of the company s markets in the near term  This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Additionally  in this seasonally slower demand period  occupancy and rent growth are likely to have been limited In addition to the above  Essex Property s activities during the October December period were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged in the past two months For 2019  the company expects its core FFO per share in the  13 28  13 38 range  The full year outlook is backed by the same property gross revenue growth guidance of 3 1 3 4   and NOI increase of 3 4 3 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 s FFO per share is currently pinned at  13 35  indicating 6 2  increase year over year on revenues of  1 46 billion Here is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts a beat in terms of FFO per share for Essex Property this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases

We completed another strong quarter of performance which capped off a very successful year at Boston Properties  Specifically in the fourth quarter of 2019  we generated FFO per share of  1 87  which is a quarterly record for Boston Properties and  0 02 above our prior guidance and market consensus  We leased 1 7 million square feet including significant leases at the GM Building 399 Park  Reston Town Center and Colorado Center  We delivered and placed in service 866 000 square feet of new developments that were 98  pre leased  with an initial cash yield of 7 5   We increased in service portfolio occupancy to 93  which is a 40 basis point increase over the last quarter and 160 basis point increase over where we were a year ago We increased our average net rental rates on our second generation leases by 48  for the quarter and 28  for all of 2019  We increased our regular quarterly dividend 3  to  0 98 per share  Boston Properties has now increased its quarterly dividend by 42  over the past three years  and we increased our growth outlook for 2020 by raising the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance by a penny  We continue to forecast 8  growth in 2020 following a 11  growth in 2019 leading our office peers over the last two years In terms of full year 2019 operational highlights  we completed 7 6 million square feet of in service asset and development leasing exceeding 2018 leasing numbers and our second highest level of annual leasing ever  We commenced 8 000 square feet of new developments  including 325 Main Street in Cambridge and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington We completed new acquisitions for a total of  336 million  including 880 and 890 Winter Street in Waltham  the remaining 5  interest in our salesforce tower development in San Francisco and land parcels at Carnegie Center in Princeton  We completed approximately  406 million of asset sales versus our goal of  200 million  including the sale of 540 Madison Avenue in New York  Tower Center in East Brunswick  New Jersey and land parcels in Suburban Maryland and Massachusetts  We also formed a joint venture with CPPIB which now holds a 45  interest in our Platform 16 development site in San Jose We raised  2 2 billion in debt financing  including  850 million in green bonds at very attractive interest rate and once again we are recognized throughout the year for sustainability performance and leadership  earning in eighth consecutive Greenstar recognition ranking among the top 4  of almost 1 000 worldwide participants in the GRESB assessment and earning Energy Star Partner of the Year from the EPA Overall  2019 was an excellent year from a management  development  leasing and capital markets perspective  A differentiator for Boston Properties is the depth and strength of our regional and corporate management teams  I m very proud of our entire team at Boston Properties and what we accomplished in 2019 through experience  relationships teamwork and commitment to success Now  turning to the economic environment  Conditions remain very favorable for our business and leasing activity is robust in our core markets with few exceptions  Economic growth in the US at around 2 1  projected for 2020 remains high enough to power job creation  space demand and rent growth  but not high enough to spark inflation and higher interest rate  The 10 year US Treasury remains around 1 6   1 7  and the Fed appears to be on indefinite hold for further rate action  Job creation and inexpensive capital is very constructive for what we do  And in addition concerns over the geopolitical risks of 2019 particularly trade disputes are currently more tempered creating confidence for business leaders to make investments like new space requirements  and for investors to move financial markets positively as we have recently witnessed The private capital market for real estate and office assets in our core markets remained healthy  US real estate assets remain an attractive destination for domestic and foreign institutional capital with stable    with stable and growing economy relatively higher yields and decreasing hedging costs significant office transaction volume in the US ended the fourth quarter  up 24 3  from the prior quarter and up 3  for all of 2019  Yet again  there were numerous significant asset transactions this past quarter and I ll cover the largest of which  which were One Marina Park in the Seaport District of Boston sold for a little over  480 million or  918 a square foot and about a 4 6  stabilized cap rate  This a little over 0 5 million square foot building is 100  leased and was sold to a domestic real estate investment manager  And secondly in New York 330 Madison Avenue in Midtown East is under agreement to sell for  900 million or  1 060 a square foot  and a 4 8  cap rate  This 850 000 square foot property is 95  leased and will be sold to a non US insurance company Now  moving to Boston Properties  capital activities  Development continues to be our primary strategy for creating value for shareholders and we remain active in our pursuit of new projects and value added redevelopment  In the fourth quarter of 2019  we delivered two successful and accretive projects into service  We completed 145 Broadway  the new 485 000 square foot headquarters for Akamai in Cambridge The building is 98  leased to Akamai and was delivered on time and budget at an attractive yield We also completed the podium phase of our Hub on Causeway development in Boston  This 381 000 square feet project is 97  leased and was also delivered at an attractive yield  The Hub on Causeway podium is the new entrants to the TD Garden and North Station and includes multi level retail amenities restaurants  theaters and other exciting entertainment venues  further phases of this development  all of which will be built on top of the podium include Hub50House  a 440 unit residential tower to be delivered this quarter  100 Causeway a 632 000 square foot office tower that is 87  leased and expected to open in 2021  And land under long term lease to citizenM  a luxury hotel  which was delivered last year With these deliveries removed  our current development pipeline stands at 12 office and residential developments and redevelopments  comprising 5 5 million square feet and  3 1 billion of total investment for our share  The commercial component of this portfolio is currently 76  pre leased and aggregate projected cash yields on cost are just shy of 7   Most of the development pipeline is well under way and we have  1 4 billion of equity capital remaining to fund In 2020  we anticipate our development pipeline will continue to be dynamic  We plan to deliver six projects representing 2 million square feet and  1 1 billion of investment including 1750 President Street  159 East 53rd Street  Dock 72  20 CityPoint  Hub50House and Skyline  We are already recognizing a portion of the income expected from most of these projects As replacement for these deliveries  we expect to begin the first phases of 4th and Harrison in San Francisco and Platform 16 in San Jose  4th and Harrison received 505 000 square feet of Prop M allocation in the fourth quarter of 2019 that will allow us to begin construction in 2020  And site enablement work is under way at Platform 16  The first phases of these future developments total 935 000 approximately  1 billion in new investments With our current pipeline of deliveries in these new potential starts our development pipeline at year end 2020 could be approximately eight projects  comprising 4 4 million square feet and  3 billion of investment  And for beyond 2020  we have a 13 million square foot land bank under control  which should lead to additional development opportunities  Near term prospects in this portfolio include 3 Hudson Boulevard in New York  25  owned by us  171 Dartmouth Street adjacent to the Back Bay station in Boston and City Point in Waltham  for all of which we are pursuing anchor tenants before commencing vertical development In addition  we have another phase of significant residential development at Reston Town Center  Moving to acquisitions and dispositions  we are under contract  subject to due diligence for the sale of New Dominion Technology Park for in excess of  250 million that we will  that we believe will close this quarter  The property comprises 493 000 square feet leased to the federal government in two buildings located in Northern Virginia  We recently extended the current government tenancy for 15 years of flat rents making the property a strong disposition candidate  We anticipate completing a lifetime exchange for this asset and retaining all proceeds for other investment We also just completed a joint venture with Alexandria Real Estate Equities for our Gateway Commons portfolio in South San Francisco  This joint venture where both parties will have approximately a 50  ownership when fully funded will be formed with Boston Properties contributing three existing office buildings totaling 768 000 square feet and Alexandria contributing three adjacent buildings  including a newly constructed amenity center totaling 313 000 square feet The critical value creation for Boston Properties and Alexandria with the joint venture is that both parties will contribute land including a parcel owned by us and encumbered with surface parking by Alexandria and excess structured parking associated with the existing buildings  Creating three sites totaling a minimum of 640 000 square feet of potential development for lab and office use  Upon completion of the development plan  the joint venture will comprise a significant critical mass of 1 7 million square feet of office and life science space in a premier location in one of the strongest life science market in the US  So in summary  2019 was a very successful year for Boston Properties  We executed well on our growth plan  driven by the lease up of in service properties and external growth driven by development Given our leading property market positioning constructive market condition  growing new investment pipeline and a team eager to produce  We are very excited for 2020 and beyond Let me turn it over to Doug Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorThanks  Owen  Good morning  everybody  Happy New Year  We re not going to sit  Phonetic  anymore  It should be pretty clear from Owen s macro commentary that we are feeling really good  very positive about the state of the business economy and the overall daily transaction leasing activity that we are experiencing across our portfolio really is in lock step and as you heard during the last 12 months  we increased our in service occupancy by more than 160 basis points  So strong leasing volumes everywhere You shouldn t interpret this note  I mean that every market is strong  We have our strong markets  which are characterized by tight supply and very modest short term new deliveries Boston  Cambridge  Waltham  Lexington  San Francisco  CBD in West LA  and there we have rental economics that continue to grow and grow significantly strongly  We operate in the second group of markets  which have higher availability consistent new construction deliveries  I e  less than supply constraints  But they are coupled with very significant technology demand  So  the Silicon Valley  the Reston Town Center area  the new construction on the far west side of Manhattan  These markets are improving  So  it s more of a function of the premium of new products being added to the market as opposed to simple market conditions The third segment is the Plaza District in Manhattan  it behaves differently since it lacks the technology demand growth  We continue to have strong activity from non tech users  Obviously  they have more modest growth  although we had two deals this quarter  which were expansions from non tech users and we will talk about those in a few minutes  But there does remain significant supply and there really hasn t been much in the way of changes in the economics over the last year or two  And then the fourth category really is limited in our portfolio to DC  CBD  which both has supply and demand headwinds  the best buildings  continue to have leasing activity  but the market concessions are at an elevated level Our primary customers  large real estate users be a private or public  start up or established continue to make decisions to upgrade and consolidate their space and in many cases expand as they use their space in the competition for talent  which is the key to our business  Even in our most expensive markets we see very few tenants taking actions that reflect looming concerns about their business prospects  A case in point  We re in discussions with the service firm in San Francisco that is currently located in the base of one of our EC buildings  The tenant is negotiating to move to the top of the building with a rent will be 25  higher that s on a renewal in one place versus the other and they will have to come out of pocket  over  100 a square foot to build their new improvements and their square footage isn t changing a bit Let s talk about the markets now our expectations and what s going on in our portfolio  Let me begin with New York City  The significant technology tenant leasing in Manhattan that was completed over the last few months was very much in line with market rumors and expectations  There really weren t any surprises  It s great  Since it represents a lots of growth in absorption and practically speaking we think it may accelerate the timing of 3 Hudson Boulevard  since there are fewer new construction options with large space block opportunities The two law firm leases in the new developments that were announced will lead to availability and existing product  so we are optimistic    while we are optimistic about the shrinking availability of the newly constructed space  We will continue to have a cautious view of transaction economics over the next few years  That being said  leasing volumes very strong  Last quarter  we completed a 20 year lease renewal at 599 Lexington Avenue with Sherman Sterling our anchor tenant  starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338 000 square feet  We ve now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140 000 square feet that was due to expire through 2024 and the reason I use 140 000 square feet is we have a tenant that looks to be moving into one of the new developments in our 601 Lexington Avenue development in 2022 We have signed leases on three of the four available floors at 399 Park Avenue and are negotiating a lease on the remaining floor  As a barometer of market conditions  these leases on these four floors have an average starting rents of about  100 a square foot and market level rent bumps TIs and free the expiring on the floors is about  107 a square foot  We would have done a similar deal in 2018 or 2019  In addition  we signed a renewal and expansion at the base for 80 000 square feet and we are negotiating an expansion from one of the tower floors that we re going to get back in 2021  So again  very strong leasing activity At the General Motors building  since the completion of the plaza work and the opening of the Apple Cube in September  We ve completed 140 000 square of office leasing  including a new tenant on a vacant floor  full floor in the upper portion of the building  A long term expansion and two short term renewal  CBRE reports that the city saw more than 2 1 million square feet of relocation deals with starting rents over  120 a square foot and  1 2 million a relocation deals with starting rents between  100 and  119 so that s 3 3 million square feet and that versus 2 5 million square feet in 2018  So  we are encouraged by the level of activity at the high end in the market and at our building  We also completed a lease on the available 6600 square feet a 5th Avenue retail space for a retailer that is playing to remodel an existing Madison Avenue store and we did a 7 500 square feet renewal with our for our 2021 exploration on Madison Avenue retail Switching to Washington DC  the CBD where the rent will be 25  higher  that s on a renewal in one place versus the other and they will have to come out of pocket  over  100 a square foot to build their new improvements and their square footage isn t changing a bit  Let s talk about the markets now Our expectations and what s going on in our portfolio  Let me begin with New York City  The significant technology tenant leasing in Manhattan that was completed over the last few months was very much in line with market rumors and expectations  There really weren t any surprises  It s great since it represents lots of growth in absorption and practically speaking  we think it may accelerate the timing of 3 Hudson Boulevard  since there are fewer new construction options with large space block opportunities  The two law firm leases in the new developments that were announced will lead to availability in existing product  So we are optimistic While we re optimistic about the shrinking availability of the newly constructed space  we will continue to have a cautious view of transaction economics over the next few years  That being said  leasing volume is very strong  Last quarter  we completed a 20 year lease renewal at 599 Lexington Avenue with Shearman   Sterling  our anchor tenant  starting in 2022 for a minimum of 338 000 square feet  We ve now extended every major lease expiration in our portfolio above 140 000 square feet that was due to expire through 2024  And the reason I use 140 000 square feet is we have a tenant that looks to be moving into one of the new developments in our 601 Lexington Avenue development in 2022 We have signed leases on three of the four available floors at 399 Park Avenue and are negotiating a lease on the remaining floor  As a barometer of market conditions  these leases on these four floors have average starting rents of about  100 a square foot and market level rent bumps TIs and free rent  The expiring rent on the floors is about  107 a square foot  We would have done a similar deal in 2018 or 2019  In addition  we signed a renewal and expansion at the base for 80 000 square feet and we are negotiating an expansion from one of the tower floors that we re going to get back in 2021  So again  very strong leasing activity  At the

floor  full floor in the upper portion of the building  a long term expansion and two short term renewal  CBRE reports say the city saw some more than 2 1 million square feet of relocations deals with starting rents over  120 a square foot  and 1 2 million square feet of relocation deals with starting rents between  100 and  119  So that s 3 3 million square feet and that s versus 2 5 million square feet in 2018  So we are encouraged by the level of activity at the high end in the market and at our building  We also completed a lease on the available 6600 square feet of Fifth Avenue retail space for a retailer that is planning to remodel an existing Madison Avenue store and we did a 75 00 square foot renewal with expiry  Indecipherable  2021 expiration on Madison Avenue retail  Switching to Washington DC  the CBD continues to have  as I said  the most challenging market conditions among our regions  So it would only represent 6  of our NOI  This quarter  we completed a 76 000 square foot 10 year renewal at 2200 Penn for a lease that was expected to expire in  21 The current rent  which has been escalating for 2 5  for a decade is going to roll down about 18   to give you a sense of the conditions in DC  In Northern Virginia where 90  of our company NOI originates and where we are developing  continues to have significant tenant demand growth  The same technology companies that are growing in San Francisco and in Boston and in New York City  are also expanding in Northern Virginia as they both service the U S  government and search for the highest quality labor market  We believe that the  10 billion JEDI Cloud Computing contract will create significant office demand in Northern Virginia  There is still significant vacancy in the market  but the urban core in Reston continues to outperform with starting rents in the high 40s to low 50s This quarter  we completed 438 000 square feet of leasing in Reston Town Center  including 75 000 square feet for Facebook and 312 000 square feet renewal with Bechtel in 11 smaller deals  We are in lease renewal and relocation negotiations with another 135 000 square feet tenant  The 270 000 square feet of Leidos relocation and expansion  the 1750 is expected to occur by the end of April  So they re going to vacate one into Freedom Square  so we ll still have some work to do  building our 500 000 square feet of availability in Reston  but we are in active discussions with tenants that could fill significant portions of that space  And most recently we entered into a dialog  aka  a lease negotiation with a tenant with a 2023 to 2024 occupancy requirement that is interested in a significant portion of the availability at RTC Next  That s the building that s under construction for Fanny Mae  So really strong activity in Reston Switching to the West Coast The story in San Francisco CBD is a lack of availability in 2020 through 2022 and the meaningful increase in asking and taking rents that has occurred  The vacancy rate is at its all time lowest level since the last cycle began after the great financial crisis  There is about 3 5 million square feet of either under construction or announced and permitted projects with delivery beginning no earlier than late 2022 and more than 1 6 million square feet is either in lease negotiation or leased  With our Prop M allocation in hand  we are moving toward the purchase of the land to develop 4th in Harrison and we could start construction in late 2020 for in early 2023 delivery  tenant conversations have begun  There are additional permitted potential development in 2024 for and beyond  New construction rents are approaching over  100 a square foot triple net on all this new development New to the market are about 700 000 of sublet opportunities stemming from Uber s anticipated move to Mission Bay  so perhaps  there will be a little bit early for tenant  Our San Francisco CBD portfolio ended the quarter at 97 2  occupied and 98  committed  With little availability  we had one of the quietest quarters I can remember with only 24 000 square feet of CBD leasing  In 2020  we have very limited availability  So  our focus today is 21 and 22 expirations  Based on current market fundamentals  We continue to believe that we will realize double digit rental increases as we relet space As an example  we just recaptured a floor at 680 Folsom Street that was leased in 2015  The terminated lease  which had 3  annual bumps had a mark to market in 2020 even after five years of escalations of almost 20  so the market rent continue to grow  In the Silicon Valley  we have our Mountain View assets and a portfolio of great development opportunities  This market continue to experience strong growth led by Google which leased another 475 000 square feet during the quarter  and the market had a record setting absorption in 2019  In our existing Mountain View portfolio  we continue to release and renew space at rents in excess of  55 triple net  This quarter  we completed two leases totaling 50 000 square feet with an average rental increase of 65    In 2020 our most significant opportunity in the Bay Area is in the Mountain View portfolio  where we ll have about 150 000 square feet of availability Owen mentioned Platform 16 and our opportunity in San Jose  It s been quite clear that is a technology companies continue to grow their employees can be to work is becoming a critical factor in their recruitment and retention  We ve seen companies like Facebook and Google expanded San Francisco as they provide an alternative location for employees that may spend three plus hours a day on a private bus and likewise Uber and Splunk and Twitter and Airbnb have all expanded down into the Silicon Valley for similar  We have seen a distinct premium for those Valley and Peninsula office assets that are in close proximity to the Caltrain stops and particularly the bullet locations  Platform 16 and the plaza development and our other development are less than one mile from the Diridon Caltrain bullet stops  as well as future Bart connection I think the last owner occupied new construction in downtown San Jose was in 2009  a 11 years ago  and it was based on a set of plans that was drawn in 1987  we believe downtown San Jose has seen some significant growth  and as you read in the Wall Street Journal it s clearly coming  But last but not least  we re going to get the Boston  The CBD Cambridge and Waltham Lexington  continue to be the beneficiaries of ongoing growth in the technology and life science sectors and significant migration from the outer suburban market and corporate relocation As the Boston region  comprises more than one third of our NOI  we are benefiting from this growth in a big way  Similar to San Francisco  There is very little available space in large blocks in the Boston CBD  There are multiple buildings under construction in Boston  which will deliver in late  22 and  23 with some current availability and there are active plans for new construction  including as Owen suggested are permitted project at 171 Dartmouth  that s the Back Bay station site  which will create additional supply in 2023 and beyond to meet demand and an interesting twist  many of the new buildings are being designed for life science users as we availability in Cambridge has all but disappeared Our CBD  portfolio is 99  leased today and we continue to complete forward leasing transaction  During the quarter we did about 200 000 square feet including 72 000 square at the Hub on Causeway as Owen talked about  In addition  at 200 Clarendon  we continue to get early renewals and expansion  We completed over 114 000 square feet of leases with an average increase of rents of 30  In Cambridge  145 Broadway  485 000 square feet building leased to Akamai is open and to put the strength of the Cambridge office marketing perspective if the Akamai lease which was negotiated in 2016 were to roll to market today  the mark to market would be over 50   four years  four years  There continues to be significant demand in the Waltham Lexington suburban market  which is where we have our largest availability in the region in 2020  our 200 West Street project  which is actively being converted to lab use we ll be ready for tenant build out in the third quarter we will continue to expand our potential tenant universe in Waltham to include lab requirements  New construction office rents in this market are in the mid 40s triple net and lab rents are pushing through  60 triple net Our 180 City Point project is permitted and in a position to start with  either a lab or an office installation  I ll conclude with a comment about the Prudential Center Observatory  Later this year we expect to commence on major repositioning of the 50 to 52nd floors of the Prudential Power  We anticipate spending in excess of  125 million creating an extraordinary experience for local area residents and visitors to Boston  expect an initial return on this capital investment including foregone income from this space  which is part of our 2020 guidance  in line with our recent development projects and we hope to open this public facility in mid 2022  With that  Mike has some comments about the fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook Michael E  LaBelle    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerGreat  thank you  Doug  Good morning  As Owen described  we had a really strong year in 2019  In addition to our 11  FFO growth  we demonstrated substantial revenue growth of 9  and the growth came organically from higher occupancy and higher rents in the same property portfolio  as well as externally from the delivery of developments  Our share of 2019 same property NOI growth ended the year higher by 5 4  over full year 2018 and it was even higher on a cash basis at 6 7  growth  We also had an incremental  78 million in NOI from our developments  contributing 6 5  to our growth and we still have an active pipeline of  3 1 billion in developments under construction that are projected to provide incremental earnings growth every year for the next several years Turning to our fourth quarter 2019 results  We reported funds from operation of a  1 87 per share and that was  0 02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance  The increase was primarily from improved portfolio revenues due to a combination of leases commencing earlier than projected as well as better than projected service income from our tenants in the quarter  Our results would have been  0 01 stronger had we not incurred a  1 5 million charge from extinguishment of debt  We elected to prepay a  26 5 million mortgage encumbering our New Dominion property  The loan carried a high interest rate of 7 69  and the repayment is reflected in our lower interest expense assumptions for 2020 Looking ahead to 2020  we have updated our FFO guidance with changes primarily coming from a pending asset sale and changes in our interest expense assumptions  Our portfolio NOI assumptions remain in line with last quarter s guidance  Doug detailed the solid leasing activity we re seeing in the majority of our markets  which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver ongoing same property growth  Our assumptions for 2020 includes same property NOI growth of between 3  and 4 75  and incremental growth from our non same properties  primarily our development deliveries of  60 million to  70 million As Owen described we have New Dominion under contract for sale and we expect diligence to be completed in the sale to close in the first quarter  The sale results in a significant gain  We plan to complete a like kind of exchange with 880  890 Winter Street that we acquired in 2019  And the acquisition of the land under our 4th in Harrison development in San Francisco that is currently under option  These exchanges allow us to retain the sale proceeds for reinvestment in higher growth developments The projected earnings impact of the sale  net of interest earned on the proceeds is  0 04 per share of FFO dilution compared to our prior guidance  The other change in our assumptions relates to reduced interest expense  We now anticipate that we will commence construction this year on the first phases of both our Platform 16 development in San Jose and our 4th in Harrison development in San Francisco  The associated capitalized interest for these developments reduces our interest expense assumptions  Also contributing to the reduced interest expense are the repayment of the New Dominion mortgage and lower interest rates overall  The combination of these items lowers our assumption for net interest expense by approximately  15 million at the midpoint and our new range is  395 million to  415 million for 2020  So  we are increasing our guidance for 2020 funds from operation by a penny per share at the midpoint  despite the projected dilution of  0 04 per share from asset sales Our revised guidance range is  7 47 to  7 65 per share  So  excluding the asset sale  we would have increased our guidance by  0 05 per share  All of this points to continuing our strong earnings growth rate with 11  FFO growth in 2019 followed up by projected 8  FFO growth in 2020 at the midpoint  Our 2020 growth will be driven by strong top line revenue growth from increasing rental rates in our existing portfolio and the delivery of profitable developments from our pipeline  We have a robust  3 1 billion development pipeline under construction with the commercial space currently 76  pre leased  This plus the expected additions of Platform 16 and 4th in Harrison later this year  position us well to deliver continued multi year growth That s all we have for our formal remarks  I think the operator will now open it up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  Good morning  everyone  I guess starting out with the new joint venture in South San Francisco  Clearly very strong market  can you just give us a feel for how this is going to work in terms of redeveloping existing buildings versus doing new development  And if there is any    I know you re going through the plans still  but is there any early indications of how we should think about cost per square foot incrementally to build this out  along with rents  you think you can get in the market today Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorNick  let me    let me start off  I m sure  Doug will have a few comments as well  So just to back up for a second and talk a little bit about our rationale for doing this joint venture  Gateway is a very well located office park near transit in South San Francisco  which is a very strong lab market and  frankly a less strong office market  The keys that drove the joint venture is there is a land parcel that is located between our assets and Alexandria s assets that are part of this joint venture  And that land is owned by us  but it s encumbered by a surface parking easement by one of the Alexandria buildings  So by doing this joint venture  both we and Alexandria are contributing our rights to that site  And we can develop on it  So  this JV opens up that parcel to new development and we and Alexandria also contributed additional sites  And also on the Boston Property site  we have some excess parking that we can contribute to as well  So the way we look at this is from our standpoint and I do think Alexandria s    this is one plus one equal three  It s    we re creating value just by putting the two sides together  Also from our standpoint  we get to reorient our investment in Gateway  which is primarily an office project today to the lab market locally  which is much stronger  We free up three new development opportunities  We have no loss of income  So again  I think this is a win win for both Boston Properties and Alexandria  As it relates to some of your questions about the development  the total development rights  as I mentioned and as mentioned in the release  and in my remarks  is over 600 000 feet  It s on three separate sites  We and Alexandria are    will    have been and will be working on development plans for those sites  So we re not prepared at this point to answer some of your questions as it relates to cost  There is a possibility that we could launch one of these buildings this year  so not all of them  but one of them Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorYeah  I would just add a couple of more  just clarifying comment  So  the current portfolio is our three office buildings  a office building that Alexandria owns a lab building the Alexandria owned and amenity building  So  I think if this way  Right now  we re 100  office and as of the formation of transaction where have about 13  lab  so we ve reduced our office exposure and assuming we build all the lab buildings and we do some conversion of some of our    of the existing assets  we re probably going to be somewhere closer to 50  or 60  lab in this marketplace at the end of the day  Right now  I think we contemplate that the buildings that will be developed will be lab buildings  They re all sort of in a couple of hundred thousand square feet range and we are actually  there is there is a plan that we ve agreed to for the first building and we re hopeful that we re going to be in a position to have gotten our permits pulled and start construction on that building by the latter parts of 2020 and as with regards to market rents  I think our view of market rents and is that the lab rents are in the mid 50s plus or minus  And so  we try to achieve a 7  return on cost and I think Alexandria has the same perspective  And so  I can sort of give you a sense of where we think new construction will be Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then  and then just in terms of the 50 50 nature of the venture  are we to assume that the contributions are roughly equal  So  any future spend would be split 50 50 Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorWe are    the value of what we are contributing is slightly more than the value of what Alexander is contributing  So  the venture starting off with us owning a little bit more than 50  and as we proceed with new development Alexandria  we ll be funding all of it until its trued up to 50 50 Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  thanks  Just one last question on the GM Building  I was just hoping to get an update  I know you ve got some leasing done in the quarter  But in terms of the leasing prospects for the remaining vacancy there as well as the upcoming lease expirations and as well  there was    there has been some reports about Perella Weinberg  which has a lease for  I think 130 000 square feet in the building expiring in early  22  There have been some reports about them being quoted for some other redevelopments in the city  How the renewal prospects looking for that along with the rest of the leasing  you re trying to do right now  Thanks Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorJohn Powers  do you want to take that one John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionYes  we think Perrella will leave  We tried to keep them  We worked on that very  very hard  but for a number of reasons in restocking in place is always difficult  And I think that they will leave the building  We are talking right now to a couple of tenants for that space  I don t know if we ll make that deals  those deals and we have space rolling up  but as Doug said  we had a pretty good quarter at the end of the year  And I m pretty optimistic  I think we will be moving forward with some amenity space in the building  which will also be a plus Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystThanks everyone OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  guys  The  12 million increase in NOI loss from dispositions  Is that all Dominion or is there    there is no leakage from the JV contribution Michael E  LaBelle    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerNo  not at all  It s a 100  New Dominion  Obviously that s not a net number  right  That s just a gross number Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystSo what    depending on  I don t know what timing you guys have in there  What was the cap rate on New Dominion Michael E  LaBelle    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerWe re not going to talk about that  It s not a closed deal Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then just  you guys had talked about 3 Hudson maybe kicking off sooner than expected  I mean what kind of interest are you guys getting now that a lot of the other resupply is being absorbed and what timing do you think realistically could it be accelerated to Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorJohn  you want to answer that one  John John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionCan you hear me Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionYeah  Thanks  Owen  Yeah  we are    we are pretty optimistic based on the tenant response  first of all  to the building that we ve received very positive response  The building  of course  it s on a full acre and it has avenues on three sides  So it s a great site and we ve    we ve designed a building that s    that s pretty design  we re in a 100  CDs now  So we re    we ve shown it to a lot of brokers  but we ve made probably a dozen tenant presentations and it s been very  very well received  So based on that  we are    we re still rolling with the foundation  The foundation is not quite complete yet  Obviously  we will not go forward without an anchor tenant  We have a stream of tenants that are interested  some have    we could make a  24 lease expiration date  that would be the earliest that we could make  some of the deals that have been done  that have been announced  those tenants met with us  I think every one of them liked the building  but we could not make the earlier dates that they    that they really wanted  So we have also some tenants with later dates  We re talking to some  25   26  even  27s  So I think what we ve decided now is we have the building that we want to build  We have the foundations and so this is going to be a win  not if  and we have to just see how it goes over the next quarter or two quarters to see whether we just continue on go forward or we slowed down the construction process Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  And then just one last one  I know we ve talked previously about a land site in Dallas  Is that still kicking around where are you guys on that Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorWe are looking at different sites  all the time  And so  we continue to  to think about Northern Virginia as a really important focus for our growth  And so  we don t have anything that we can comment on specifically  but we continue to look at different asset Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystIt s Michael Bilerman here with Manny  Doug  in your opening comments you talked about the three other pre development project 3 Hudson Yards  which John just talked about Waltham and Back Bay  I guess if you had to think about the probability of one or more of those projects  starting this year  I guess how would you rank them and how much of it is tenant demand driven versus the rents and the returns that you require in getting those projects off the ground  right  because I assume that it s part of both  right  You need it tends to show up  and then you need them to pay the rents that you want for your shareholders to earn the returns that they thought Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorYes  So I would answer the question in the following way  Michael  The  so we are actively engaged in conversations with tenants  as John said  at 3 Hudson Boulevard and we are also actively engaged with tenants on conversations on both 171 Dartmouth Street and on 180 City Point  We don t have a signed letter of intent with anyone yet  So  I don t  I don t think we re in a position where we re close to announcing something  The rents that we are asking our  I would say commensurate with where the market is today and they are more than satisfactory to provide us with an acceptable return to start those buildings  So  if you force me to push from a timing perspective  I think that the 171 Dartmouth Street building is probably the one where we have the most significant conversation with tenants who we know are going to want to make a move from where they currently are we re expand in the city  and so  I d say that s probably the one of the three that s most likely this cohort Bryan J  Koop    Executive Vice President  Boston RegionThis is Bryan Koop  Some additional color would be as we ended last year with the completion of leasing  let s say for the Hub which was our major exposure on the urban side  It s  we re thrilled with our position on our development pipeline from the standpoint of our basis as well  Because when you look at the recent sales of land at record numbers we couldn t be more thrilled with our position in this late cycle with both the Back Bay station and also Waltham with some of the new sites that have been delivered up for sale exceeding  500 a buildable foot and then you compound that with 6  increases in construction costs over the last five years  we couldn t be happier about our position with these development sites that Doug mentioned Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Well  thank you for that Koop  And then the second question  I mean  Owen or Doug  can you take us a little bit behind the curtain on the joint venture with Alexandria  sort of when your discussions started  And also you have a lot of overlap in some of your other core markets  you think about holdings in Cambridge  or in San Francisco  Did you have your conversations expanded to see other ways that you can have a one plus one equal greater than two between your two organizations that do have very similar philosophies to capital allocation  to development  to management through all those sorts of things Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  So  Michael  it s Owen  We initiated these conversations with Alexandria last year and the reason we initiated it was for the rationale that I went through earlier  the one plus one equals three  reorienting our investment in Gateway from office to lab  no loss of income and also I think not only win for us  but also win for Alexandria  So we initiated it  we just got to close  as you know  We have and we hope to continue to have a strong relationship with Alexandria  but there is no additional dialog with them at this time about other joint ventures or other cooperation Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystDid you discuss at all just selling outright your holdings to them or them selling their holdings to you Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorOur preference was to do the deal that we ve currently constructed  We think that s a better outcome for Boston Properties  shareholders and selling the park  Because it s all  as I mentioned earlier  it s all office  It s in a strong the lab market  We think we ll create more value for our shareholders by doing the joint venture as currently constructed than we would if we sold it for cash Michael Bilerman    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Securities Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  thank you  Just a quick follow up on the JV  Can you talk about who is going to be managing construction and then managing the assets Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorSo the joint venture will be jointly controlled from a governance standpoint  Alexandria will be the property manager  although we will receive a portion of the fees  We and Alexandria will be co developers  though Alexandria will be in the lead  And we will also receive a portion of those fees  And we think this structure makes sense given the larger presence that Alexandria has in South San Francisco market Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And it sounds like there s an amenity building that s now going to be included in your joint portfolio in the gateway  I mean what kind of value  do you think that adds to your holdings in that submarket Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  this is Doug  We think it hold a lot value  which is why we did the transaction  So  we have three buildings of almost 700 000 square feet that are currently office buildings and are pretty de minimis amount of amenities and we saw that Alexander is building was building at 17 000 square foot high quality first class amenities building with a significant advantage from a leasing perspective with regards to both office and the lab tenants that are in that marketplace  So  we really  this was  this was truly an opportunity where the two organizations  looked at their assets in this particular submarket and said  we are much better off operating this as one collective as opposed to us sort of doing our own separate things and not being able to untie this piece of land where we owned it and they had in easement on it  and where we had extra parking and other assets and where they had an amendment building  So  you throw all this stuff together and it s a win win for all of the customers in both locations today and in the future Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAll right  thanks  And then  Owen  I want to go back to some of your comments at the beginning of the call  I guess starting out maybe just your thoughts on capital flows  You talked about hedging costs and maybe it maybe a potential increase in foreign capital  Just as you look at the office business or office assets that have been kind of slow to trade in the last few years  Do you see a meaningful pickup and if so  kind of what markets and what types of assets  whether it s core value add opportunistic just anything you think may change here Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  So  I    if you just look at the numbers  the transaction volume for our space those being larger office buildings  was a little bit up in  19 versus  18  but I think the market is very solid  There is good liquidity  I look at things like interest rate to coating down in cap rates are at least so far have not so that spread between where the cap rates are and the risk free rate is very healthy  From a liquidity standpoint I think there is a lot of liquidity in the world is looking for real estate  I think the US is a very strong destination given that even though our    we look at our rates as being low  They are lower in most of the other developed countries and cap rates are even lower  So  there is yield available here there is stability available here and I m optimistic for capital flows going into 2020 In terms of the markets  I do think there is a higher level of liquidity for the tech and life science sectors of the private capital markets  So  I think competitions for buildings that are in Boston or in San Francisco or in West LA are stronger  I think in general  than they are in New York  for example Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  We ve heard about the push back just people getting their heads around capex costs when it comes to office  Do you think that s that tone has changed at all or that s going to  that s going to be persistent Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI don t know if it s changed  it s certainly a focus on the private market as well  but again every quarter and I did a couple more this quarter  the cap rates haven t changed much  I mean I ve been giving on these calls a pretty robust report on the private capital market for Class A office buildings in our core markets in the cap rates have been sticking more or less in the 4th  So  I think capex is always something that s discussed for office and frankly for all types of real estate  But I don t think it s had a material impact on the cap rate Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  and then just finally  you would also commented that business conditions and business confidence in better today than heading into 2019  given some of the global risks at the time  We saw a lot of tech leasing  last year  do you think this is going to spread to other sectors where you could see major large expansions from other sectors into some of these markets or do you think it will still be mostly tech that s taking down most of the space Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  I think that tech in life science and other creative industries will continue to be the drivers of net absorption  I think the more traditional industries financial customers  legal customers their businesses are fine  They re doing well  I don t see as much growth in those areas  So  I think you ll see them there ll be lease expiration driven leasing  I think many of these employers will also be seeking to upgrade their space  but I m not sure they re going to necessarily grow substantially Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  thank you Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank Derek Johnston    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  everyone  Doug  do you believe the technology company demand you mentioned in New York City actually have some runway and could it potentially continue at this pace or potentially even accelerate Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  Derrick  I would answer the question in the following way  I believe that New York City as a physical location for the kind of worker that the technology companies are looking forward will continue to be very attractive  It has relatively speaking  the best transportation system in all of the major metropolitan markets  And it has got affordable and reasonable housing prices within great easy proximity to where companies are locating and those two things  in my opinion  are very important determinants for where the technology companies are looking to expand their workforce  plus they obviously have a lot of college educated workers  So I do believe that New York City  has a lot of legs under it  And on a long term basis will be a market where the technology companies will continue to grow and prosper Derek Johnston    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  great  guys  That s it for me OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI Jason Green    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  A split roll in California has been a topic that s getting a lot of traction to start the year  Just curious if you re able to share your thoughts on the probability of passage and also the impact it would have on your portfolio Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorSo I ll talk about what the impact on the portfolio will be  And I m going to let Bob Pester talk about the  probability  of passage  So the way    the way we look at this is that we have triple net leases and we have gross leases  In a strong market  you can very easily make the argument that well  that the triple net lease escalation of taxes will get pushed along through the tenants  and with the gross leases  the escalation to the tenants if it s not rolling will get passed along  but to the extent that you re resetting  Indecipherable  on gross leases  the question will be how will that impact your net  And if it s a really strong market  you probably could chose to move those gross leases to net leases and sort of continue that  path  along with your other portfolio  The thing about this    this split tax is that it s very unclear is how the reassessments will occur  how long it will take  how they re going to do it  how much  annual escalation  there will be  and the assessments will be every three years that they get to you  will they be on an annual basis  how long  how many years will take for them to actually start the reassessment process  So all of that stuff is very  very much in flux  If you said to us  OK  well  assuming everything had to get reassessed and assuming you were able to continue to pass along all of your triple net escalations to the tenants  but on your gross leases you had to demonstrate what the impact was  we would tell you it s probably somewhere between  0 02 and  0 03 a share on our portfolio and it would take our average lease length as a year  So we take eight years for that to roll through  Rob  you want to talk about the probability of the split roll packaging Robert E  Pester    Executive Vice President  San Francisco RegionSure  I think the jury is still out on how this is going to turn out  Although I believe current polling is showing that it doesn t pass and then there is the issue is that s just the first step of them trying to raise property taxes  not just on commercial properties  But then having a second phase that hits residential  which I think is a non starter for anyone that owns a house in California  This ll play out over the next six to nine months and we ll have a better feel during that time  But at present time  I don t think it s going to pass Jason Green    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  And then I guess just to follow up  just given the votes getting closer  Have you seen any change in asset pricing transaction activity in California just relative to this being on the ballot Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI have not Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorAnd remember that when a new building is sold it get access to market  So  unless there were some odd structure about the way the sale is going to occur every one would assume that the assessment would change and I don t think people are viewing the building escalations after the assessment to have a material impact on the value on a going forward basis Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorAnd that s not a change  Doug  They always been that they always get reassessed on purchase  So  that s always been kind of baked into the in those assets Jason Green    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  good morning  up there  So  two questions from us  So  first one just on the Shearman   Sterling renewal  Can you just talk about what played into that  I don t  maybe every partner there commutes in and out of Grand Central  But can you talk about the things that you were able to do to keep them in that building versus some of the other major law firms that shows and other major tenant that chose to go to new construction  So  I don t know if they re restocking in place  But maybe I don t know if there particular things or if it was just general they just  they like where they office  they weren t interested in relocating to a different submarkets  just curious Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  I ll just make one quick comment and then I ll let John describe the negotiation  We re really good at what we do  Alex  and so  tenant like to be in our buildings  I just make that as sort of visceral reaction that  John  do you want to talk about Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  Thank you  Doug  I appreciate  I would expect nothing less from you John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionMaybe I ll be a little more specific  Yeah  They were  I think they were intending to leave  I think they were going to leave  And I have lunch  We ve kept in touch with them  but I had lunch with the Chief Operating Officer there and he gave me a list of all the things that we re forcing them to leave  and then we took that list one by one and we responded to it and we found swing space for them in the building  we made a deal with Citibank across the street can move to get there  The conference center  So that would be available  It s very hard to rebuild the conference center pay for that and then move back into a conference center so Citibank as downsized as everyone knows here on the corner and they were  they were ready to do something different with that conference center  So  we made a deal with a firm in London to sublease it from Citibank and then we made a deal with the firm that subleased it to allow Shearman to use it for a year  They go across the street to rebuild their conference center  So  the swing space  The conference center  They had some operational issues in the building  because it was a    these weren t really build base building problems  but they were problems that stemmed from the way they did their build out  way  way back in the late 1980s and we were able to  on the    get them to understand how that will happen  From an MET standpoint and they were very comfortable that we re going to fix it all  So  giving you a high point of a number of things on a much longer list  but when we had all that done  they decided when they looked at their alternatives that they could live here happily for another 20 years  which will  by the way  make it 50 years at the end of that 20 that there ll be in this asset Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  thank you  And then second question is  I was talking to a broker recently in one of the life science markets and the point came up about the political rhetoric that it was on the campaign trail and healthcare and all the fun stuff and the question is if it s having any impact on life science leasing  So  were you    are you seeing any life science tenants maybe starting to dial back their thoughts on taking space  Based on what may happen in the election or in healthcare legislation or is all that rhetoric not having any impact in life science continues to go full bore Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  our venue on life science is primarily in the Greater Boston Market because that s where our life science assets are  and I would tell you that our view is that  Interestingly enough  there are more life science tenants looking for space today than there ever have been and many of those same life science tenants are actually  if you will  warehousing space because they re concerned about finding space as they grow  So  we have not seen any of the rhetoric translate into a of visceral reaction that we should slow down or stop  What we re doing because our business models are going to somehow be stressed by what goes on from a political perspective Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  Doug Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorWe haven t also seen any slowdown in the investment portion of the life sciences  We had a record number of VC investment last year  I think it was one out of every  4 in VC came to the Boston market  We continue to see that and then we also continue to see several of our clients have a pipeline of call it new drugs that are up for approval  which have a tremendous amount of opportunity  So  we haven t seen any of the rhetoric translate into demand Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley Vikram Malhotra    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks for taking the question  So  just two quick ones  One  two quick ones  One  can you pull a sort of WeWork and maybe just a bit of a slowing down in base here in New York and maybe some other markets  Just give us some updated thoughts on how you see BXP Flex evolving and just maybe broader thoughts or specific thoughts on plans for the make ready suites that you referenced in the past Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  OK  So maybe I ll make a general comment on the whole shared workspace business  I ll turn it over to Bryan to talk about Flex by BXP  Yeah  clearly  there has been a slowdown in new leasing from the co working operators  given all of the tumult with WeWork last year  And I think that s not only been true of WeWork  but also some of the smaller operators  And I think the market    the markets continue to be  Indecipherable  that demand driver has gone away at least for the beginning of 2020 Bryan J  Koop    Executive Vice President  Boston RegionYeah  this is Bryan Koop  If you look at our strategy with Flex in Boston  it s really been almost complementary to our existing products  So as an example  with the Hub on Causeway  we have one full floor that we had always planned on putting in the podium and that s 100  pre leased and opened last week and we re just thrilled with the product and how it came out  By year end  we hope to have four locations  but it s really complementary to our existing assets and has nothing to do with what s taking place in the greater market  And then in the greater market on co working  I think our Flex products has been immune from  call it  a lot of the noise because the Flex product is really for the small to medium enterprise and it s not a co working product per se  it s a space as a service for small to medium enterprisesOwen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorYeah  so we look at it as we re not trying to grow Flex for the sake of growth  but if we have  we do think the product is interesting to a segment of our customer base  And if we have the right space in the right place  we ll consider future stores  And we re the only other places that we re currently in processes  Technical Issues  we actually got back in November  and it s under way to be a floor of a similar ilk in San Francisco Vikram Malhotra    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  And then just the JV with Alexandria  definitely interesting  thanks for all the color  Is this    is this a very    this seems like a very specific deal and a specific opportunity  but just curious as you step back and look at sort of your holdings on the East Coast as well  do you think there are opportunities  kind of to partner with  whether it s private capital or other firms sort of more in a joint venture basis given sort of maybe where we are in the cycle Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo to answer your    let me    I think you asked kind of two questions there  The    absolutely  this joint venture at Gateway  we re very excited about it  We think it s going to create a lot of value for shareholders versus what we own right now  but it s very specific  it was very specific to the fact that Alexandria on the assets next door and had these sites where the development potential was unlocked  So  that s why we did it  As it relates to joint ventures overall  we are increasingly using joint ventures in our portfolio for different reasons then the Gateway project  We recently brought in CPP to own a 45  interest in the Platform 16 project  They are our partner on the Santa Monica Business Park acquisition that we    I guess increasingly less recently made  So  we are continuing and will continue to inject private equity into our investment portfolio to extend our capital  But the rationale for that is very different from the rationale of the Gateway joint venture Vikram Malhotra    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  And then just one last quick one  So  the street retail deals are you referenced earlier in the two deals I think you recently did  Maybe just give us a  there is obviously been a lot of churn in 5th Avenue Madison sort of sub markets and I m just curious  your thoughts on what you don t have a  there s not a massive exposure there  but just your thoughts on where we are in the sort of evolution in terms of rent resets  And do you have a sense of where rents that might be there in the two specific sub markets where you have exposure Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  the answer is  obviously we know the rents are of the deals that we just did  but we re not going to disclose the specifics of what those tenants are paying  I just make two comments and then John Powers if you want to make some more  You re welcome  The first is that  we have now had our second what I would refer to as success successful tenant look at the 5th Avenue store that we have as a great place to conduct their business while they are on doing an ongoing remodel and they ve paid what we would believe our fair market rents for that space and    but they have not invested in    on the long term basis  And then on Madison Avenue  we recognize that the rents are not where they were five years ago and so  there is a reset and where that s just the reality  John  do you have any other comments John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionWe don t have any retail exposures in that area  Obviously  the overall rents have dropped in the retail market  but for a specific store for a specific need  there were still people in the market  Looking at different alternatives  What we ve done in some of our other retail is concentrated on food and beverage because that s an amenity to the office towers  which is very important Vikram Malhotra    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Okay  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel John Guinee    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystGreat  thank you  Wonderful quarter  wonderful guidance  life is good  One question  Mike  You re bouncing up around 6 3  6 4 net debt to EBITDA  And I think you are on a path to deliver about  800 million to  1 billion of development every year maybe sell  200 million to  400 million of assets  When do you    what is your self imposed maximum on your net debt to EBITDA  And when do you anticipate needing to go to the equity markets if at all Michael E  LaBelle    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerSo our     we ve been pretty consistent over the last many years of targeting net debt to EBITDA between 6 5 and 7 5 times  So we ve been able to do a lot of development and deliver a lot of properties without raising equity  We have a number of opportunities in front of us  including two we talked about today and things that are in the future pipeline  And as we determine if those and when those will come in  we will look at all of the sources of capital that are available to us  So we mentioned private equity and bringing that in  and we did that with CVP  we can bring in additional debt  which is very attractive and very inexpensive and we would also consider public equity in the future to make sure that we maintain our leverage in a place where we think we should be John Guinee    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystGreat  And then just a couple of cleanup questions  I don t think 3 Hudson is in your development paid on the sub  Any reason for that or maybe I just missed it  And then second  is everything going smoothly on Dock 72 and WeWork taking it on time  taking space on time Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorI ll respond just to the 3 Hudson  So  right now  that s in our land position  and the work that we re doing there is improving the land and since we have not made a commitment or decision to move forward with that full development  we are not putting it on our development page until such time as we would do that  And that s very similar to the way that we handle these other projects  I mean for example  Platform 16 that we talked about  we re doing enabling work  we re doing prep work  So we re improving the land that we have  but until we decide that we re going forward  we aren t going to put those projects on the development pipeline John Guinee    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystGreat  Thank you Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorJohn  do you want to make a comment about Dock 72 John F  Powers    Executive Vice President  New York RegionYes  everything is fine on the WeWork side  they re    they ve built out about two thirds of this space and they re paying rent on all those space  They have a good number of members signed up  We are slow unfortunately on the amenities and we need to get that done  That will be done in the first quarter and after that s complete we should we expect that more we work members will move in  The amenities 35 000 feet and they are a key part of what we re creating there on the leasing side  it s been very slow  As you know  we do have a proposal and we are trading paper on a 50 000 foot full floor which we are optimistic about but we ll have to see how it comes out John Guinee    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystGreat  thank you Operator Operator Instructions  Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisor Daniel Ismail    Green Street Advisor    AnalystThank you and good morning  So  the observation deck at Prudential Tower  this is something you re going to see to manage internally you look for an operator and then are there any opportunities to add this in other developments like 3 Hudson Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  Daniel  we haven t made any decisions  firm decisions yet about how the observation deck  on the pre tower will get operated  Interestingly  that it s it exists and therefore doing a major renovation of it obviously made a lot of sense  We thought about having an observation deck when we were developing Salesforce Tower  But we just couldn t make the vertical transportation work in that building given where the design  had already been and I would say that at the moment  none of our other assets are candidates for those types of uses Daniel Ismail    Green Street Advisor    AnalystThank you  And then on proposition is on the ballot in San Francisco in March  assuming it passes  does this cause you guys change your thinking on development timing or acquisitions outside of the city  and are you hearing anything from tenants regarding this ballot initiative Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorBob  do you want to explain what ballot initiative is so everyone understands it Robert E  Pester    Executive Vice President  San Francisco RegionYeah  Proposition is a ballot measure put forth by John ever link and basically it would tie affordable housing deliveries to the amount of office space that could be delivered in San Francisco  thereby reducing the amount of Prop M allocation if the affordable housing goals aren t met  It s pulling fairly well right now  In our case  the Central SoMa projects all would get their existing allocation that s still outstanding  So  in our case would get another 250 000 feet because they want to get the fees from the developers upfront  We re not hearing anything from any tenants as far as it s impacting their desire to be in San Francisco or they re looking elsewhere  and San Francisco has always been a difficult market developing  So  I don t think it really changes anything Daniel Ismail    Green Street Advisor    AnalystDo you think this would impact the an accelerated phasing of projects in San Francisco or elsewhere Robert E  Pester    Executive Vice President  San Francisco RegionOnly on the Central SoMa projects that have already been approved  Where it would accelerate the second phase of their Prop M alignment  So what the impact will be is existing product  the rent should continue to rise substantially  because it s going to restrict supply Douglas T  Linde    President and DirectorSo  Danny  the way the way this works is that the projects that are currently in the pipeline in south    in Central SoMa will get there additional allocation  The reason why there would be theory an acceleration is because if you don t use your Prop M allocation within a certain period of time  Bob I think it s two years  then it really  it goes back into the bank and so  to the extent that you get the allocation you d want to figure out a way to use it Daniel Ismail    Green Street Advisor    AnalystMakes sense  Thanks  everyone OperatorThere are no further questions at this time  I would now like to turn it back over to the speakers for closing remarks Owen D  Thomas    Chief Executive Officer and DirectorOkay  Well  I think that concludes all the questions  that concludes all of management remarks  Thank you all for your the attention and interest in Boston
