4821,226336,ENGIE,French state opposed to renewing Kocher s mandate as Engie CEO  report,news,"PARIS  Reuters    Engie  PA ENGIE  chief executive Isabelle Kocher will not get state backing to serve another term after her tenure at the French gas and power group ends in May  Les Echos reported on Monday 
Kocher  who has been in the job since 2016  has come under pressure amid reports of a strategy split within the group and disagreements between board members on whether to pursue a sell off of some gas assets 
The French state  which holds a 24  stake in the company  is not in favor of renewing her mandate  although it does not plan to force her exit  Les Echos reported  without saying where it got the information 
Kocher s job could be up for discussion at a Dec  17 board meeting  BFM Business reported last week  The company will publish its shareholder meeting resolutions  which would include nomination proposals  early next year 
France s economy and finance ministry and Engie declined to comment 
Kocher became the first woman to head up a blue chip French company when she took on the chief executive role in May 2016 to replace Gerard Mestrallet who became board chairman 
She campaigned in 2018 to take on the chairman s role when Mestrallet retired  but lost out after the government backed Jean Pierre Clamadieu  then head of Belgian chemical group  Solvay   BR SOLB   for the job 
Under Kocher  Engie embarked on a major divestment plan to switch the company away from fossil fuels and focus on power grids  renewable energy and energy services 
But she has opposed selling off some of the firm s gas assets  including storage unit Storengy  which would help streamline Engie s structure 
 Our group obviously needs to evolve  we obviously have to accelerate our transformation   she told Le Figaro last week   But we mustn t dismantle and sell off Engie by bits  I believe that vehemently  ",2019-12-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/french-state-opposed-to-renewing-kochers-mandate-as-engie-ceo-report-2036736,2036736

4824,226339,ENGIE,Top Ten Utilities ETFs,opinion,There is currently an expanding list of 24 ETFs oriented to the utility and infrastructure sector with more on the way  The following analysis features a fair representation of ETFs available  We believe investors may choose from this list an appropriate ETF to satisfy the best index based offerings available The Conservative EndUtility investments are at the conservative end of investing  Most investors buy them for the steady dividends and lower market volatility  This feature hasn t changed much Currently  utilities are under significant regulatory and macro economic pressure  From a regulatory point of view  most utilities need a more contemporary grid  but the climate is uncertain given a wide variety of local issues Power issuesAtop this are fuel issues including whether to upgrade older plants with cheap and readily available coal  natural gas  oil or nuclear  Hydro electric systems seem completely stopped from an environmental view and most available sources have been tapped  Nuclear power seems safe enough for new plants but with an old Fukushima plant and disaster in the publics  mind  these unfortunately seem an unlikely source  Oil powered utilities are more acceptable but fuel costs are high  Alternative  green  energy is still unavailable in the amount necessary and are more costly  The best bet is natural gas  which utilities are moving toward and away from coal where possible Another drag on public utilities is the economic climate  When the economy slows  power use drops as too  Perhaps the best example is the high number of vacant homes in the U S  currently with unused meters ETFs are based on indexes tied to well known index providers including Russell  S P  Barclays  MSCI  Dow Jones  Wisdom Tree  PowerShares  EG Shares and so forth  Also included are some so called  enhanced  indexes that attempt to achieve better performance through more active management of the index  Investors

4834,226349,ENGIE,Apple says  14 billion EU tax order  defies reality and common sense ,news,"By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG  Reuters    The European Union s order for Apple  O AAPL  to pay 13 billion euros   14 billion  in back taxes to Ireland  defies reality and common sense   the U S  company said on Tuesday  as it launched a legal challenge against the 2016 ruling 
The iPhone maker also accused the executive European Commission of using its powers to combat state aid  to retrofit changes to national law   in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses 
Apple s arguments at the General Court  Europe s second highest  came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades 
The case is key to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager s crackdown on sweetheart deals for multinationals  a campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks  O SBUX    Fiat   MI FCHA   Engie  PA ENGIE   Amazon  O AMZN  and others 
Apple s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments from both sides  as well as Ireland  Luxembourg  Poland and the EFTA Surveillance Authority  over two days 
 The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland   Apple s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court 
He said the fact the iPhone  the iPad  the App Store  other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States  and not in Ireland  showed the flaws in the Commission s case 
 The branches  activities did not involve creating  developing or managing those rights  Based on the facts of this case  the primary line defies reality and common sense   Beard said 
 The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple s profits outside the Americas  
Beard dismissed criticism of the 0 005  tax rate paid by Apple s main Irish unit in 2014  which was cited by the Commission in its decision  saying the regulator was just seeking  headlines by quoting tiny numbers  
Paying an average global tax rate of 26   Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U S  taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland 
In its current financial quarter  Apple expects revenue of  61 64 billion and a gross margin of 37 5 38 5  
Ireland  whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates  is also challenging the Commission s decision 
 As Ireland has already emphasized  it undermines legal certainty if state aid measures are used to retrofit changes to national law     and legal certainty is a key principle of EU law  one upon which businesses depend   Beard said 
 Some may want to change the international tax system  but that is a tax law issue   not state aid   he said 
Ireland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U S  tax systems 
 The Commission s decision is fundamentally flawed   Paul Gallagher  lawyer for Ireland  told the court 
Lawyers for the Commission will also make their case on Tuesday  The court is expected to rule in the coming months  with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years

4836,226351,ENGIE,Apple May Get Clues About Its Chances of Winning Tax Case of the Century,news," Bloomberg     Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   may only need to wait until Tuesday to get early clues about its chances of success in the biggest tax case in recent history 
The iPhone maker has been arguing its case at the European Union s General Court to topple a record 13 billion euro   14 3 billion  EU tax order  This week the same panel of judges will deliver a ruling on two smaller but related challenges by  Starbucks Corp   NASDAQ SBUX   and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV unit 
They re the first in a series of cases to come to a decision as companies rail against EU Competition chief Margrethe Vestager s five year crackdown on allegedly unfair tax deals 
While the facts of the various appeals differ  Tuesday s decisions  should have a far reaching impact  both on the other pending cases and going forward   said Howard Liebman  a tax partner at law firm Jones Day in Brussels  who isn t involved in the disputes 
The judges  stance will  presumably establish some precedent as to how far the court is willing to allow the commission to extend its approach of judging tax regimes    and individual tax rulings    in the context of a state aids analysis   he said 
Vestager s Probes
Appeals have been piling up at the EU courts since state aid investigators started work in 2013 to unearth what they deem to be the most problematic examples of otherwise legal individual tax agreements doled out to companies by countries  The judges  verdicts could empower or halt Vestager s probes  which are now centering on fiscal deals done by Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc 
Starbucks and Fiat were targeted on the same day in 2015 by a similar EU order to pay back about 30 million euros each over their tax arrangements in the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively 
The commission accused Luxembourg and the Netherlands of granting so called tax rulings to the companies that backed  artificial and complex methods  to calculate their taxable profits that didn t reflect  economic reality  
The EU said at the time the companies did this by setting prices for products and services sold between units    called transfer prices    that didn t reflect market conditions 
 As a result  most of the profits of Starbucks  coffee roasting company are shifted abroad  where they are also not taxed  and Fiat s financing company only paid taxes on underestimated profits   said in a 2015 statement 
Back Taxes
Luxembourg has since also been ordered to recoup 250 million euros from Amazon com and 120 million euros in back taxes from energy utility Engie SA  France s former natural gas monopoly  previously known as GDF Suez  PA ENGIE  
In the Apple case  the EU said Ireland illegally slashed the iPhone maker s tax bill between 2003 2014  a finding the company and Irish officials don t accept 
The EU alleged that  Apple paid essentially no tax on earnings in Europe  and  sought headlines by quoting tiny numbers  but this public campaign ignores the taxes Apple pays all across the world   Apple attorney Daniel Beard said at last week s hearing 
The Dutch finance ministry said it had nothing to add to previous statements criticizing the EU s approach  Fiat Chrysler  Starbucks  Apple and the commission declined to comment  as did the Luxembourg and Irish finance ministries 
EU nations ordered to claw back the allegedly illegal tax aid have accused the commission of overreaching itself by using state aid law to attack individual fiscal arrangements that dated back many years  A key question for the commission in the cases is whether its argument that these tax rulings were selective and unfair stands up in court 
 The commission did not identify a single instance where a taxpayer was treated less favorably than Apple   Paul Gallagher  a lawyer for Ireland  told the judges in the court hearings last week 
Luxembourg  which has so far faced the brunt of the EU s decisions  has attacked the  arbitrary nature  of the commission s approach which creates  complete legal uncertainty   their lawyer Denis Waelbroeck said in a court hearing about Fiat s case last year  Ireland and Luxembourg have supported each other in their respective appeals 
The nation was among the first EU countries to be singled out in 2014 over its tax practices  when a group of investigative reporters published thousands of pages from secret arrangements between the tiny nation and companies including Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  Co    Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT   s Skype and PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc  The so called LuxLeaks publications have been used by EU regulators in their deliberations and EU officials further expanded their probes by seeking new information to find more  outliers  among these tax deals 
Still  in a first in the EU s continued crackdown on  outliers  among these otherwise legal tax rulings  the commission last year closed its probe into the fiscal deal between McDonald s Corp  and Luxembourg  finding there was no violation of state aid laws 
The cases are T 636 16   Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v  Commission  T 755 15   Luxembourg v  Commission  T 759 15   Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v  Commission  T 760 15   Netherlands v  Commission

4845,226360,ENGIE,Privatization to dominate capital markets  M A in Brazil this year,news,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO  Reuters    The sale of state owned assets is expected to drive M A transactions and share offerings volume in Brazil in the second half of the year  bankers and investors said  after a slower than expected first half 
As court injunctions delayed asset sales by oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4  and discussion of pension reform dragged on in Congress  the volume of mergers and acquisitions in the first half of the year fell 19  to  20 8 billion  according to Refinitiv data 
But state controlled companies faced less hurdles to selling stakes in companies already listed  and the volume of share offerings rose 45  in the first half to 8 6 billion reais   2 25 billion   It was the best first half of the year since 2013 
After Brazil s Supreme Court finally cleared the way for Brazil s largest deal this year  the sale by Petrobras of gas pipeline network TAG to France s Engie SA  PA ENGIE  for  8 6 billion  banks expect the volume of privatization related M A to grow  The next one on the block is fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA  SA BRDT3   which will be privatized through a share offering by the end of the month 
 We are expecting a new round of infrastructure auctions that may include licenses to operate airports  railroads and highways   said Hans Lin  head of investment banking in Brazil at Bank of America  NYSE BAC  
The approval of pension reform by Congress is expected to unlock strategic moves by Brazilian companies that were waiting for a clearer outlook for the economy 
 We expect private M A activity to rise more sharply next year  as the transactions take around nine months between initial talks and announcements   said Eduardo Miras  head of investment banking in Brazil at  Citigroup   NYSE C   Citi is leading the M A advisory ranking so far this year with five deals announced  totaling  10 2 billion 
One of the few recent private deals announced is the proposed merger between food processors BRF SA  SA BRFS3  and Marfrig Global Foods SA  SA MRFG3   Miras expects more deals on the power industry in the second half 
Alessandro Zema  country head of  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in Brazil and also head of its investment banking unit  also noticed more activity in private mandates recently  and expects new deals in retail  following recent acquisitions of e commerce Netshoes and appliance retailer  Via Varejo SA   SA VVAR3  
 Industries more directly affected by the recession  such as retail and consumer products  also had lower M A activity   Zema said   We believe this is going to change with a better outlook for the economy  
Zema also pointed out that some Brazilian companies in good shape are looking for targets outside the country as a way to balance risks  Last month  Natura Cosmeticos SA  SA NATU3  acquired  Avon Products  Inc   N AVP  
Another driver for future M A activity is the fast growth of start ups in the country  which has become a main target of investors such as Japan s Softbank  T 9434   Softbank has raised a  5 billion fund for Latin America 
EQUITIES
Much of the growth in share offerings  volume was led by state controlled banks Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil  which sold their stakes in Petrobras and power company Neoenergia SA   respectively  Caixa also sold a stake in the reinsurer  IRB Brasil Resseguros  SA  SA IRBR3   owned by a fund managed by the bank 
Many follow ons in the pipeline for the coming months also involve divestments by the government or state owned companies  totaling at least 30 billion reais  This list includes follow ons by Banco do Brasil  Alupar Investimento SA  SA ALUP11   Petrobras Distribuidora SA  SA BRDT3  and IRB  besides an IPO by insurance company Caixa Seguridade 
Despite high volumes in share offerings  only two companies dared an initial public offering so far  sporting goods retailer Centauro and Neoenergia SA 
 IPO s market would resume on a relevant scale once foreign equity investors massively return to Brazil   said Cristiano Guimaraes  Itau BBA s managing director   Their return will largely depend on the approval of a significant pension reform

4849,226364,ENGIE,Exclusive  Denmark s Nord Stream 2 route request could cause eight month delay  cost 660 million euros   operator,news,"By Jacob Gronholt Pedersen and Maria Grabar
COPENHAGEN MOSCOW  Reuters    A Russian led gas pipeline project across the Baltic Sea to Europe could be delayed by up to eight months and cost an extra 660 million euros   740 million  due to hurdles in securing the necessary permits from Denmark  the pipeline operator has said 
The 1 230 km  765 mile  Nord Stream 2 pipeline  now under construction  has come under fire from the United States and several eastern European  Nordic and Baltic countries  which say the conduit will increase Europe s reliance on Russian gas 
The timeline of the project  led by state owned Gazprom  MM GAZP   is key for the future of the gas transit contract between Moscow and Kiev  as Ukraine is Russia s main gas route for exports to Europe 
The transit contract  a large source of budget revenue for Ukraine  expires at the end of this year  Nord Stream 2  according to its initial schedule  should have been ready by then 
Gazprom has completed more than 70  of Nord Stream 2 but since April 2017 has had pending applications with Danish authorities to lay between 147 and 175 km via Danish waters 
Nord Stream 2  aimed at doubling the annual capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline by adding 55 billion cubic meters  is to run via the waters of Finland  Sweden  Denmark and Germany  It has approvals from all countries whose waters it crosses apart from Denmark 
The Russian led company submitted two route applications with the Danish authorities  of which the first was proposed more than two years ago  In March  the Danish Energy Agency requested an environmental assessment of a third route option 
Nord Stream 2 labeled the third route request  a deliberate attempt to delay the project s completion  
Nord Stream 2  in a complaint to the Danish authorities in April  said costs related to the new request for a third route had already totaled more than 100 million euros 
According to the letter  obtained by Reuters  the request for a third route could result in a delay of up to eight months and further costs of 560 million euros  The initial budget was 9 5 billion euros 
 Delaying the project will result in a significant financial loss for Nord Stream 2   the letter said  asking the Danish Energy Board of Appeal to nix the energy agency s request 
Nord Stream 2 said in the letter that it had  repeatedly asked for a status update     without receiving any response  
Aside from Gazprom  half of the funding for Nord Stream 2 is being provided by Germany s Uniper  DE UN01  and BASF s  DE BASFn  Wintershall unit  Anglo Dutch company Shell  L RDSa   Austria s OMV  VI OMVV  and France s Engie  PA ENGIE  
Reuters obtained the document from the Danish Energy Board of Appeal under laws on freedom of information 
The Danish Energy Agency confirmed that Nord Stream 2 had appealed its decision  The agency said it has made its reasons for requesting a third route application clear to the appeal board but declined to elaborate 
NO MORE VETO
Nord Stream 2 told Reuters it had informed the Danish Energy Agency about the potential impact of delays on costs and the project schedule  but declined to confirm the figures contained in the letter 
 A delay of several months will lead to additional costs of several hundred million euros but we cannot fully quantify because the final impacts depend on the timing of the permit decision of the responsible authorities   it said 
In June  Nord Stream 2 withdrew its initial 2017 application for a route through Danish territorial waters south of the Baltic island of Bornholm 
Denmark could have vetoed the initial route  The country passed a law in 2017 that would allow it to ban the pipeline from passing through its territorial waters on security grounds 
However  no veto can be applied for the two remaining route options as they would steer the pipeline through Denmark s exclusive economic zone  not its territorial waters 
According to Reuters calculations based on Nord Stream 2 data and the speed of construction  Gazprom s pipe layers will reach the Danish exclusive economic zone between three and five months from now 
Nord Stream 2 said in May the project may be launched in 2020 rather than the end of 2019 due to delays in obtaining permits from Denmark 
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last month that Moscow had offered Kiev a short term gas transit deal to substitute the current 10 year contract after it ends this year ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-denmarks-nord-stream-2-route-request-could-cause-eightmonth-delay-cost-660-million-euros--operator-1949476,1949476
4850,226365,ENGIE,Exclusive  Brazil s Petrobras refineries sale lures trading companies  PetroChina  Saudi Aramco   sources,news,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
SAO PAULO RIO DE JANEIRO  Reuters    Brazil s planned privatization of eight Petroleo Brasileiro SA  SA PETR4  refineries has lured several of the world s largest trading and oil companies as prospective bidders  two sources with knowledge of the matter said 
Around 20 companies have signed non disclosure agreements granting them access to the refineries  data and signaling that they are considering a bid  the sources added  speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private details of the sale 
The first round of non binding offers for four of the eight refineries Petrobras put on the block is due on Oct  11  the sources said  The eight refineries have total capacity of 1 1 million barrels per day 
Among the potential bidders are trading firms Vitol SA   Glencore  PLC  L GLEN  and Trafigura AG  Local companies Ultrapar Participa  es SA  SA UGPA3  and Raizen  a joint venture of Brazil s Cosan SA  SA CSAN3  and Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa   also signed non disclosure agreements 
Other companies interested  according to the sources  include PetroChina Co  SS 601857  and Sinopec  SS 600688   which already has a Brazilian joint venture with Spain s Repsol  MC REP   Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco  which is planning one of the world s largest initial public offerings  is also looking at the refining units  numbers 
The request to access the data room is just the first step of companies interested in the deal  and does not mean they will deliver bids on Oct  11 
Petrobras  PetroChina  Ultrapar  Sinopec and Vitol did not immediately comment on the matter  Raizen  Trafigura  Saudi Aramco and Glencore declined to comment 
TRANSFORMATIVE DEALS
The deal  to be one of Petrobras  largest divestitures ever  would transform Brazil s oil industry and may raise around  18 billion  bankers working on the deal say  Refining has traditionally been state owned in Brazil  triggering occasional calls for government price controls 
At least partial privatization is widely seen as one of the best possible ways to bring real competition to the Brazilian oil industry 
Antitrust watchdog CADE has already forced Petrobras to change its refinery sale process to boost competition  demanding the separate sale of each of the eight refineries  A single buyer will be barred from buying two of the largest refineries in the same area  whether it be the northeast  the south or the southeast 
Petrobras is also carving out logistics assets  such as oil pipelines and terminals  to sell along with the refineries  one of the sources said 
Most of the bidding groups are expected to include private pipeline operators  possibly including France s Engie  PA ENGIE  and Canada s Brookfield  TO BAMa   one of the sources said  explaining that oil companies are reaching out to them  Both companies recently acquired Petrobras assets ",2019-08-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-brazils-petrobras-refineries-sale-lures-trading-companies-petrochina-saudi-aramco--sources-1963923,1963923

4855,226370,ENGIE,Europe should brace for U S  tariffs on several fronts  German official,news,By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    European Union member states should brace for U S  tariffs on several fronts in the coming months  a senior German official said late on Tuesday  following meetings with U S  officials and lawmakers in Washington  Peter Beyer  a German lawmaker and Germany s transatlantic coordinator  said there was continued U S  interest in dialogue with Europe  but the Trump administration appeared poised to impose tariffs over disputes about aircraft subsidies  the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline and European car imports  President Donald Trump said in May some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat   but postponed a decision for as long as six months on imposing tariffs on European and Japanese auto imports to allow time for trade talks with both partners   European officials fear that Trump will now turn his attention to Europe  after brokering a truce in a protracted trade battle with China    These are difficult discussions in a difficult international environment   Germany Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said after a meeting with U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington  He said the exchange with Mnuchin was  productive and constructive   focusing on reducing global tensions  easing trade disputes and keeping jobs in both countries  Beyer  who met with officials from the U S  Trade Representative s office and the White House  as well as U S  lawmakers  said the car tariffs were likely in mid November  given growing U S  impatience with the European Union and its refusal to include agriculture in broader trade talks   When it comes to the car tariffs  I unfortunately think they are more likely than not to be imposed in mid November  There is quite a lot of impatience on the U S  side  But that also requires us on the European side to be strong and unified   Beyer said the U S  government appeared interested in resolving disputes between the United States and the EU before the World Trade Organization  WTO  over aircraft subsidies  but was unlikely to refrain from imposing tariffs in the interim   The WTO arbitrator decision is expected soon  as early as next week  I fully expect the Trump administration to impose tariffs  The U S  side feels entitled to impose the tariffs and I believe they will  in any case   he said  The WTO has found that both U S  based Boeing   N BA  and Europe s Airbus  PA AIR   the world s two largest planemakers  have received billions of dollars of harmful or illegal government subsidies  to gain advantage in the global jet business   The United States and EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit for tat tariffs  with Washington first in line to seek tariffs under the WTO timetable  The WTO arbitrator is due to decide how much of the  11 2 billion in tariffs proposed by Washington can be applied  Altmaier said he would discuss efforts to settle the dispute with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday  adding   In our view it is in the interest of both sides to avoid these tit for tit tariffs   he told reporters  The EU this month said it was open to talks with Washington in the dispute  but no formal talks have begun  according to sources familiar with the issue  Beyer said he told U S  officials that he did not view imposing tariffs ahead of any such settlement talks  as a great way to build confidence in that process   European companies could also face sanctions as early as August or September over U S  objections about Russia s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project   Beyer said   The 760 mile  1 225 km  pipeline project to ship gas from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany has drawn U S  objections on security grounds and divided the European Union  Nord Stream 2 is led by Russian state gas producer Gazprom  MM GAZP   with 50  of the funding provided by Germany s Uniper  DE UN01  and BASF s  DE BASFn  Wintershall unit  Anglo Dutch firm Shell  L RDSa   Austria s OMV  VI OMVV  and France s Engie  PA ENGIE   U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry in May said a sanctions bill  putting onerous restrictions on companies involved in the project would come in the  not too distant future   Washington fears the pipeline will increase the European Union s reliance on Russian gas ,2019-07-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/europe-should-brace-for-us-tariffs-on-several-fronts-german-official-1919820,1919820
4860,226375,ENGIE,Aggressive U S  energy policy tests ties with European allies,news,By Timothy Gardner and Alissa de Carbonnel WASHINGTON BRUSSELS  Reuters    For the administration of President Donald Trump  a policy of  energy dominance  means reducing dependence on imported oil and promoting exports to boost the national economy and Washington s political influence overseas  For many of America s European allies  however  it means unwelcome interference in its markets  The Trump administration has capitalized on a decade long U S  drilling boom to pursue some of the most aggressive foreign energy policies in the nation s history  So far  that has meant sanctions on oil exports from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela and threats against firms helping Russia build a natural gas pipeline into Europe   To fill the supply gap  Washington is promoting a rising wave of U S  crude oil and natural gas exports   The Trump administration has billed the moves as a way to achieve foreign policy goals  with the added benefit of helping both U S  energy producers expand their markets and American allies diversify their supplies  But Washington has irritated many European diplomats and energy companies who resent its growing global influence on energy markets and view its policies mainly as a way to give U S  producers an advantage  according to interviews with diplomats  executives and analysts   Growing friction over energy is grating on trans Atlantic ties that are already strained by squabbles over NATO funding  trade  climate change and diplomatic gaffes   We value highly the relationship with our American partners  allies and friends   EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters at a briefing in Brussels last month   But     they should also refrain from unilateral action   Moscovici also advocated using the euro in more international energy transactions  which are almost universally conducted in U S  dollars   We are all about the diplomacy  but you have to ask at some point whether it is worth it   said another EU diplomat  who asked not to be named  The diplomat spoke to Reuters at a U S  embassy party attended by U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Brussels in June  where a handful of other European diplomats were sharing gripes about what they saw as Trump s brash  go it alone approach on energy  A senior Trump administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the energy strategy aims at the mutual benefit of the United States and its allies   What the U S  energy sector is doing is unleashing our energy resources and our technologies and sharing them with our partners and allies around the world to help them diversify their energy mix and ensure reliable supply   said the official   A Department of Energy press release recently called U S  gas exports to Europe a way to spread  molecules of freedom  across the Atlantic  The United States has become the world s top oil producer and is on a path to become the world s third largest exporter of natural gas  thanks to a technology led drilling boom that the Trump administration has sought to boost by slashing environmental regulations  The United States sent of 43 3 million barrels of crude oil and products to Europe in the six months ended in March  a 27 percent increase from the same period a year earlier  according to the Energy Information Administration  Meanwhile  U S  liquefied natural gas exports to Europe have nearly tripled since last year  when the European Commission agreed to buy more in a trade meeting with Trump   Increasingly  the America First framework translates into advocating for oil and gas sales around the world   said Tim Boersma  a senior research scholar at Columbia University s Center on Global Energy Policy  EUROPEAN RESISTANCE The unilateral U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela would have triggered steep oil price increases without the surge in U S  supply  Trump s decision last year to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal   which has evolved into an unprecedented effort to completely block its oil exports   was opposed by Europe s leaders and reluctantly accepted by its energy companies  who faced U S  penalties including being excluded from the U S  financial system  Germany  France and the UK have since taken steps to resist Washington  including setting up a barter based trade mechanism called Instex that would allow it to trade with Iran outside the U S  financial system in a way that skirts U S  sanctions  Europe hopes to use Instex to allow Iran to exchange its oil and gas or other goods for medicine  food or other humanitarian supplies from the EU   They have sovereignty and self respect at issue here  They re trying to say we re going to do Iran trade  we re going save the nuclear deal and provide a mechanism  and we don t appreciate being unilaterally dictated to   said Sanjay Mullick  a sanctions lawyer at Kirkland   Ellis LLP  SQUABBLES OVER SANCTIONS Meanwhile  British and Swiss based trading houses and refineries have received insistent calls from U S  State Department officials warning about trading oil products with sanctioned countries   Last month  for example  Mark Saavedra  a State Department official at the bureau of energy resources  called several European energy trading houses to instruct them not to trade jet fuel with Venezuela  a product that was not specifically on the U S  sanctions list for that country  according to three industry sources familiar with the calls   The U S  has been trying to block shipments of refined fuels to the Latin American country to prevent it from blending it with its heavy crude oil to make it more suitable for export  part of an effort to ratchet up pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro  The sources said the trading houses believed the State Department had overstepped its authority  Frank Fannon  the U S  Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources  said don t expect State to put down the phone anytime soon  Such requests  he said  are a friendly way to tell allies how to avoid sanctions themselves   It may be unwelcome news  but it s important that we convey that clearly and unequivocally   Fannon said  FIGHTING A RUSSIAN PIPELINE  Trump has also hurled criticism at European nations for supporting a long planned  multi billion dollar Russian gas pipeline to Germany  the Nord Stream 2  saying it would give Moscow too much influence over Europe s biggest economy and threatening to sanction companies that help the project   That s rubbed some EU diplomats and companies the wrong way   It will be a disaster for Europe to ditch Nord Stream 2 under U S  pressure   said Rainer Seele  CEO of energy company OMV Austria s largest company and one of five European companies including France s Engie helping to finance Nord Stream 2   The Russian gas via pipeline is cheaper than U S  liquid natural gas  he said  and U S  pressure threatens  Europe s independence and security of energy supplies   Some countries such as Poland and Lithuania  however  are happy to buy the incoming U S  liquefied natural gas shipments to help break reliance and barter better prices from Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom  MCX GAZP    On June 12  Polish Oil and Gas Company  PGNiG  signed an agreement with U S  company Venture Global LNG to buy 1 5 million metric tons of LNG a year  But even diplomats opposed to Nord Stream 2 take issue with Washington s tone and tenor  according to the Reuters interviews   We don t want to be dictated to   said one ,2019-07-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/aggressive-us-energy-policy-tests-ties-with-european-allies-1919456,1919456

5022,226537,ENGIE,EU says McDonald s  Luxembourg tax deal not illegal,news,"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS  Reuters    McDonald s  N MCD  avoided having to repay millions of euros in back taxes after EU antitrust regulators said that its tax deal with Luxembourg was not illegal  citing quirks in the Grand Duchy s bilateral tax treaty with the United States  The decision by the European Commission came after a three year long investigation  part of its crackdown on illegal sweetheart deals between EU governments and multinationals that has resulted in Apple  O AAPL   Starbucks  O SBUX  and  Fiat   MI FCHA  paying billions of euros in back taxes  The Commission said McDonald s tax deal was in line with national tax laws and the Luxembourg U S  double taxation treaty   Our in depth investigation has shown that the reason for double non taxation in this case is a mismatch between Luxembourg and U S  tax laws  and not a special treatment by Luxembourg  Therefore  Luxembourg did not break EU state aid rules   European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said   Of course  the fact remains that McDonald s did not pay any taxes on these profits   and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view   she said  The investigation had focused on McDonald s Luxembourg based subsidiary Europe Franchising which receives royalties from franchisees in Europe  Ukraine and Russia  Luxembourg in a 2009 tax ruling said the company did not have to pay corporate taxes as its profits would be taxed in the United States  In a second tax ruling  the Grand Duchy said that the company was no longer required to prove that its royalty income was subject to U S  taxation   HAPPY MEAL  The Commission said 70 companies benefited from the bilateral tax treaty but were not being investigated  In June this year  Luxembourg presented draft legislation to avoid double non taxation   Luxembourg said in a statement that it welcomed the Commission s recognition of the steps it had taken to avoid similar cases in future  It had been ordered to claw back millions from Engie  PA ENGIE   Amazon  O AMZN  and Fiat  MI FCHA  in the last three years   We pay the taxes that are owed and  from 2013 2017  McDonald s companies paid more than  3 billion just in corporate income taxes in the European Union with an average tax rate approaching 29 percent   McDonald s said   We will continue to invest in Europe and expect to create 50 000 new jobs over the next four years   Sven Giegold  a Greens lawmaker at the European Parliament who has been pushing for more action to tackle tax loopholes  criticized the EU decision    Luxembourg and other EU countries are serving McDonald s a happy meal with tax loopholes  and taxpayers must pay the bill   said Giegold  The ruling is a recognition by enforcers that they cannot make unlimited use of their state aid powers on taxation issues  said Natura Garcia  a partner at law firm Linklaters  
 This is a welcome development given the wider context of other state aid investigations into tax rulings and will give some comfort to companies which have obtained similar tax rulings in Luxembourg or elsewhere in the EU   she said ",2018-09-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-says-mcdonalds-luxembourg-tax-deal-not-illegal-1615638,1615638

5049,226564,ENGIE,Run your dishwasher when the sun shines  dynamic power pricing grows,news,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS  Reuters    One day  the weather could drive your domestic schedule  Your dishwasher springs to life at the windiest time of day  The washing machine starts spinning when the sun beats down 
In such scenarios  algorithms in smart appliances automatically respond to price drops on wholesale spot markets caused by higher supplies of wind and solar power  saving households money and balancing the electricity market 
This may be many years away  but it is the future envisioned by the European Union  which wants to make the electricity system more efficient as the continent switches from predictable fossil fuel power generation to intermittent renewables 
Most utilities have long offered cheaper night time tariffs  but new EU rules expected in 2020 will require them to provide more flexible options that encourage customers to use power during sunny or windy periods  at varied times of day or when businesses are shut at weekends 
These kind of flexible  dynamic pricing  contracts are already widely offered in Spain and Scandinavia  But utilities in some of the biggest European markets like Britain and France are now beginning to follow suit in a shift that analysts say could disrupt the continent s electricity retailing industry 
The nascent drive is enabled by the mass rollout of smart meters  which can precisely record energy usage patterns 
 From now on  consumers in Europe will be able to seize more spot market opportunities as the rise of renewable power and the availability of smart meters and internet connected appliances boost dynamic pricing   said Jean Marc Ollagnier  group CEO of consultancy Accenture Resources 
Newer  smaller players are offering the most experimental tariffs  selling power in hourly or even half hourly slots tied to wholesale spot prices  The big  traditional utilities like EDF  PA EDF  and  Centrica   L CNA  are responding more gradually by offering variable time pricing options 
Klaus Dieter Borchardt  director Internal Energy Market at the European Commission  the EU s executive  says variable pricing could cut power bills for a household by up to 400 euros   470  a year 
It is early days in Europe  and in other developed power markets such as the United States and Australia  Utilities largely sell at fixed prices  regardless of wholesale swings or time of usage  and dynamic pricing accounts for a fraction of the market   but it is growing 
The number of customers on dynamic pricing rates globally is expected to rise from 4 5 million in 2018 to 75 million by 2025  of which 15 million will be in Europe  according to Navigant Research analyst Brett Feldman 
Experts say automation will be crucial for take up 
The proportion of households with smart appliances is expected to rise to about 10 6 percent globally by 2022 from 3 5 percent now  according to market data provider Statista 
 Convenience is key   Ollagnier said   Users want to be able to  set and forget  smart rules for their appliances  
The Commission agrees   To enable consumers to benefit financially from those new opportunities  they must have access to fit for purpose smart systems as well as electricity supply contracts with dynamic prices   it said in a policy document 
An anticipated surge in electric vehicle usage will also bolster uptake of flexible pricing tariffs  analysts say 
STARTUPS LEAD WAY
British startup Octopus Energy in March launched an  Agile  tariff which sells power in 30 minute slots tied to wholesale spot prices  It also sends SMS alerts when prices turn negative and customers get paid for taking excess power off the grid  which happens a few times a year on sunny and windy days 
The two year old company  whose UK market share is about 1 percent  has limited the experimental tariff to 500 of its more than 200 000 residential customers   We hit that limit quickly and are now assessing the impact before expanding further  which we expect to do next year   CEO Greg Jackson said 
Octopus told Reuters it was working with electronics companies including Samsung  KS 005930  to allow its software to communicate with smart household appliances so that they can switch on automatically at the cheapest time 
The company said a family on its Agile tariff could have saved 210 pounds   275  over the last 12 months compared with average British fixed rate prices 
Green Energy UK  another small player  is offering contracts with varying  time of day  rates for residential customers  ranging on weekdays from 5 pence per kilowatt hour to 20 pence 
In France  Engie  PA ENGIE   which has 4 million customers  has also started offering flexible pricing deals including 30 percent weekend discounts and  for electric vehicle owners  a 50 percent discount for nighttime charging 
Engie s retail chief Augustin Honorat declined to detail how many customers have flexible tariffs   It is a success  as the offers are among our best sellers   he said 
The flexible contracts offered by new players are prompting traditional utilities to offer their own options  analysts say 
French market leader EDF  for example  has launched offers with 30 to 40 percent tariff discounts for weekend use and a tariff that offers varying rates for each eight hour period of the day  EDF marketing director Gregory Trannoy said the new offers were  growing quickly  but declined to give numbers 
Oliver Wyman consultant Keric Morris said dynamic pricing was a big operational challenge for traditional utilities 
 It is much more difficult for an incumbent with all its legacy systems  than for a nimble start up   he said 
SPANISH CASE STUDY
The European Commission s Nov  2016 Clean Energy Package aims to force all utilities to offer customers smart meters and a dynamic price contract linked to spot market prices  The rules are being negotiated with the EU Parliament and member states this year  with a target for implementation from 2020 
That may be overly ambitious  several EU states do not yet have the smart meters required for flexible pricing  notably major power market Germany 
The case of Spain gives an idea of the potential of dynamic pricing   as well as the possible obstacles 
Spain decreed in 2014 that utilities had to offer dynamic pricing contracts as the default regulated offer  All Spanish utilities now offer contracts linked to hourly spot prices on the OMIE exchange and with utilities  margins set by regulation 
The European Commission estimates that in Spain   where 28 million smart meters were installed end 2017   about 40 percent of power users have some form dynamic pricing 
However  Pedro Gonzalez  head of regulation at Spanish utilities association Unesa  told Reuters that this is down from about 60 percent four year ago 
Despite the fact that power is slightly cheaper on dynamic contracts  their number has fallen as customers switch to fixed price contracts because they want the peace of mind of not being exposed to fluctuating wholesale prices 
 Surprisingly  despite the fact that average dynamic prices should be lower  many people want to avoid risk and prefer to pay a fixed amount per month   Gonzalez said 
He said the number of people on dynamic pricing contracts has been stable over the past year  and that in recent months utilities have started offering intermediate options such as varying rates for different blocks of the day 
In the Nordics  many utilities offer dynamic pricing  though uptake ranges from about 30 percent in the tiny but highly digital Baltic country Estonia to 10 percent in Finland and a few percent in Sweden and Norway  according to EU data 
Industry specialists say much will depend on to what extent the European Commission s proposal on dynamic pricing is accepted  but all agree the higher the share of renewables in total generation  the bigger the pressure will become to make demand more flexible 
Octopus Energy s Jackson said mass rollout of smart meters could ultimately lead to a sophisticated form of congestion pricing  with supply and demand increasingly driving prices 

 On trains and airlines  the first seats are very cheap  the last ones very expensive   he said   The electricity market will end up like that too  ",2018-08-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/run-your-dishwasher-when-the-sun-shines-dynamic-power-pricing-grows-1556739,1556739

5070,226585,ENGIE,German business group enraged by Trump attacks on Nord Stream pipeline,news,"BERLIN  Reuters    German companies active in eastern European business on Thursday dismissed U S  President Donald Trump s criticism of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline plan  a day after he called Berlin  a captive to Russia  
The U S  State Department overnight repeated a warning to Western firms involved in the deal for the pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea  saying the project could divide Europe and they were at risk of sanctions 
 Threats of U S  sanctions against European companies invested in Nord Stream 2 encroach on European energy policy   the chairman of the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations  Ostausschuss   Wolfgang Buechele  told Reuters 
He said that Trump s remarks and sanctions against Russia that also target foreign companies there were  an assault on business relations between German and European countries and Russia  
The  11 billion project  led by Gazprom  MM GAZP   aims to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from next year  bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine 
Germany s Uniper  DE UN01  and Wintershall  DE BASFn  are among western partners  that also include Anglo Dutch Shell  L RDSa   France s Engie  PA ENGIE  and Austria s OMV  VIE OMVV  
The German committee groups 350 members active in 29 countries in eastern Europe accounting for about a fifth of Germany s total foreign trade  which is more sizeable than bilateral trades Germany conducts with the U S  and China individually 
Buechele said it was not up to Washington to identify which countries German companies were allowed to trade with 
The energy partnership with Russia had stretched over decades with mutual benefits  and gas imports from Russia were a competitively priced and reliable energy source for private consumers and industry  he said 
Chancellor Angela Merkel insists the project is a private commercial venture 
Buechele also said that to claim Russia would be able to control gas markets was  factually wrong and politically absurd  
A spokesman for Uniper declined comment on the latest exchanges but offered a wider statement by chief executive Klaus Schaefer saying that he wished for a de escalation of the sanctions spiral 
 We are holding on to our contractual obligations regarding Nord Stream 2  of whose value for Germany and Europe we are convinced  given the background of declining gas production in Europe   Schaefer said

5072,226587,ENGIE,France to bolster anti takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,news,"By Mathieu Rosemain  Gw na lle Barzic and Michel Rose
PARIS  Reuters    France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States 
In a wide ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn  President Emmanuel Macron s government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of  golden shares  to protect national interests 
Under the proposals  the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance  These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company s annual revenues  according to a draft seen by Reuters 
The minister could also suspend investors  voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures 
The move comes after several national champions such as train maker  Alstom   PA ALSO  and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel Lucent  PA ALUA  changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state 
 General Electric  s  N GE  acquisition of Alstom s power division   whose turbines equip all of France s nuclear reactors    Technip   PA FTI  s merger with U S  based FMC Technologies  N FTI  and Chinese investors  increasing influence in Peugeot Citroen  PA PEUP  and  Accor   PA ACCP  are other recent examples 
They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U S  style legislative apparatus  In the United States  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  or CFIUS  has far reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers 
While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade  he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake    he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands  although he later approved its acquisition by Italy s Fincantieri  MI FCT  
He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions  but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France s corporate jewels   
 This is a doctrine which  because it believes in free trade  knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety   said Stanislas Guerini  a member of the president s majority in parliament and part of Macron s inner circle 
BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS
The proposed anti takeover legislation  which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree  is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019  Guerini said  Macron s party holds an outright majority in parliament 
A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency  Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017  according to trade agency Business France 
Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree  But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence  microchips  space technology and data storage 
Golden shares  which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers  could be distributed to the companies in France s state shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk 
Firms in which France s state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included  meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group  PA PEUP  and  Renault   PA RENA  to airline Air France KLM  PA AIF  and energy group Engie  PA ENGIE  would fall under its umbrella 
Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the  golden share  tool as it allows debt ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence 
 The full range is now comprehensive and efficient  It allows  the state  to cover all types of situations   said Pascal Bine  a partner at law firm Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom 
Investors have been more ambivalent   It s very protectionist   said Loic Dessaint  CEO of Proxinvest  a shareholder advisory firm   But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives  in recent cases   
Colette Neuville  head of an interest group representing minority shareholders  said   I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago  
The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the  golden share  protection could not be extended after the law s adoption 
EUROPEAN TREND
France is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe 
Germany  which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka   DE KU2G  by China s Midea  SZ 000333   became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene 
Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad 
Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi   PA VIV  sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset   MI MS  and  Telecom Italia   MI TLIT  
European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state owned Chinese firms  and France  Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments 
A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion ",2018-07-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/france-to-bolster-antitakeover-measures-amid-foreign-investment-boom-1536821,1536821

5107,226622,ENGIE,France s Macron sets out corporate law shake up in reform bill,news,"PARIS  Reuters    France s finance minister promised to cut red tape on companies  open up more financing for them and create incentives for employee profit sharing under a new bill presented on Monday  The proposed law is part of President Emmanuel Macron s pro business reform drive that has already eased labor laws and cut companies  and entrepreneurs  taxes   The law s ultimate objective is more growth and the creation of a new French economic growth model   Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters  Le Maire said that by 2025 the overhaul of French corporate law was expected to boost overall gross domestic product by one percent over the long term  The new law aims to address one long standing complaint from business owners about a complex system that imposes new charges in multiple stages as companies increase their workforce  The bill would simplify the system  Le Maire said  by halving the number of those stages to three   bringing in new charges and obligations when a company has 11  50 and then 250 employees  It would also make it easier  cheaper and faster to register a company  giving entrepreneurs a single online platform to replace the current round of seven administrative bodies  Liquidation of insolvent companies will be sped up so business owners can move on and bankruptcy law will give more power to creditors who have a stake in seeing the firm survive  the minister added  The government aims to boost the more than 220 billion euros French people currently hold in long term retirement savings  which it hopes will make more funds available to be invested in companies  capital  To do that  employees  voluntary contributions will largely be made tax deductible for all types of savings products and they will be able to transfer savings from one money manager to another at no cost  potentially boosting competition  according to a statement on the bill  The government aims to make profit sharing much more common in small companies by scrapping charges employers currently have to make on payouts to employees  Largely because of that measure  the new law is expected to cost the government 1 2 billion euros annually  which Le Maire said would be paid for by planned cuts in subsidies to companies  The law also sets the stage for several large privatizations with the proceeds already earmarked for a new 10 billion euro innovation fund  It will in particular lift legal restraints on selling down stakes in airport operator ADP  PA ADP  and energy group Engie  PA ENGIE  while allowing the national lottery FDA to be privatized  
While some left wing and far right politicians have said the sales amounted to selling the family jewels  Macron s party has a sufficiently large parliamentary majority to pass the bill with little trouble early next year ",2018-06-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/frances-macron-sets-out-corporate-law-shakeup-in-reform-bill-1497221,1497221

5153,226668,ENGIE,European utilities retrench as cross border deals lose appeal,news,By Geert De Clercq and Christoph Steitz PARIS FRANKFURT  Reuters    European utility companies are retrenching in their home markets and looking to unwind debt financed cross border mergers deals as increasingly nationalist governments balk at foreign ownership of strategic power supplies  Hungary was one of the first European countries to turn against foreign ownership of utilities back in 2013 but there are growing signs that borders are springing up again in an industry that has struggled to make international deals pay off  Several European utilities were lining up to buy German utility RWE s  DE RWEG  subsidiary Innogy  DE IGY  but in March RWE and domestic rival E ON  DE EONGn  agreed to carve up the renewable energy firm themselves in an all German deal  Then this week  French electricity retailer  Direct Energie   PA DIREN   the biggest independent challenger to market leader EDF  PA EDF   went to French energy giant  Total   PA TOTF  in another all domestic deal   In a business as sovereign and strategic as utilities  it is hard to see major deals materializing in today s Europe   said a banker in Paris who has worked on cross border mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the utilities sector  Bankers say the German deal  hammered out within two months  was partly aimed at keeping Innogy s prized assets out of foreign hands and the backlash against foreign owners is now fuelling speculation some big cross border deals may be unwound  EDF s Italian energy subsidiary Edison  MI EDNn   the third biggest power producer in Italy  is seen as a prime example of a legacy cross border investment ripe for unwinding  Edison s oil and gas activities no longer fit EDF s low carbon strategy and its prospects of winning retail market share from  Enel   MI ENEI   in which the Italian state has a 24 percent stake  look limited   The Italians have never accepted that Edison is no longer Italian   said the Paris banker  adding that the firm s growth outlook in Italy would always be constrained by its French ownership  Sources told Reuters this month that Edison had selected banks to sell its oil and gas exploration and production division   joining other utility firms that have sold off hydrocarbon assets as they grapple with sluggish energy demand  low wholesale prices and a surge in cleaner  renewable energy  TAKEOVER WAVE Spain s  Endesa   MC ELE  is another asset owned by a foreign utility seen as a potential candidate for resale  Italy s Enel  Europe s biggest utility  outbid E ON for Endesa in 2007 during a spate of cross border European utility mergers  While Enel  which owns 70 1 percent of Endesa  has denied it has plans to sell  its control has drawn criticism from Spanish politicians who say Endesa is not investing enough locally and pays too much in dividends to its owners  Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace acknowledged nationalism was having an impact on utilities M A in Europe   There is some but I don t think Europe s big countries can afford to be nationalistic because they would need really deep pockets to keep these companies off their markets   he told Reuters  Edison and EDF declined to comment  The spate of cross border utility takeovers before and just after the 2008 financial crisis came as 10 countries joined the European Union in its biggest enlargement and European power companies saw a chance to become regional power giants  E ON spent 11 5 billion euros   14 2 billion  on foreign assets after losing the battle for Endesa  RWE bought Britain s npower  EDF bought Edison and British Energy  EDFBR UL   France s Engie  PA ENGIE  bought Britain s International Power   Spain s  Iberdrola   MC IBE  bought Scottish Power and Sweden s Vattenfall  VATN UL  bought Dutch Nuon Energy  But the collapse in wholesale power prices since has undermined many of these debt fueled deals  Engie  E ON and Vattenfall alone have written a combined 34 billion euros at least off the value of their international acquisitions   A VERY NATIONAL BUSINESS  Now  not much of the cross border deal euphoria is left  With nationalists in power in Hungary  Poland and Austria  and right wing parties on the rise in other large European countries  utilities are feeling a backlash against the internationalization they embraced a decade earlier   This is still a very national business   said a senior banker who worked on the Innogy deal   The most difficult situations in a big transaction are those that involve players from different countries   While potential foreign ownership had not become a political issue ahead of the Innogy deal  German politicians publicly opposed attempts by China State Grid Corp  STGRD UL  to buy a stake in German grid operator 50Hertz from Australian fund IFM  A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that German officials had encouraged Belgium s Elia  BR ELI    the leading shareholding in 50Hertz   to increase its stake rather than let State Grid buy it  The first moves against international ownership of utilities came in Hungary  where right wing populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in 2013 the state would seek to buy back Hungarian assets of E ON  RWE  EDF  Engie and Italy s Eni  MI ENI   Since then  Orban has imposed sharp cuts in energy prices  making mostly foreign owned firms foot the bill  and several foreign utilities have sold their operations to the state  In Poland  EDF and Engie felt the sting of nationalist energy policies in 2016 when the ruling Law and Justice party put assets owned by French utilities on a list of firms deemed important for energy security  to block their potential sale  EDF  which had been in talks with Czech firm EPH and IFM about selling its assets in Poland  was ultimately forced to sell to Polish state run firms   Has there ever been a big value creating cross border M A deal in the utility world  I would have to think very hard to find an answer   said an M A banker based in Frankfurt  who has worked on German and European sector deals

5173,226688,ENGIE,RWE  E ON reshape German power sector in Innogy asset swap deal,news,"By Christoph Steitz and Tom K ckenhoff ESSEN DUESSELDORF  Reuters    Germany s top utilities on Sunday announced plans to break up Innogy  DE IGY   whose assets will be divided among parent RWE  DE RWED  and rival E ON  DE EONGN  in the sector s biggest overhaul since a landmark move to exit nuclear power  The deal  which includes E ON making a 5 2 billion euro   6 4 billion  takeover offer to Innogy s minority shareholders  spells the end of the network  renewables and retail energy group  carved out from RWE two years ago  as a standalone unit  Chancellor Angela Merkel s decision to abandon nuclear power after Japan s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 has forced the sector to radically restructure in order to survive and already caused major plant shutdowns and billions of euros of losses  Peter Altmaier  the next economy minister and a close ally of Merkel  said the deal was a consequence of that shift  known as the  Energiewende  in German  The companies had to adapt  he told the Rheinische Post newspaper  Through the deal  which includes a share issue and asset swaps  E ON will acquire Innogy s prized regulated energy networks and customer operations  while RWE will take on the renewables businesses of both E ON and Innogy  That would position RWE  which relies heavily on coal and gas fired power plants  as a champion of the shift away from fossil fuels towards a more sustainable mix of energy sources  RWE kept 76 8 percent of Innogy after the 2016 carve out  ADVANTAGEOUS STEP A source involved in the deal said it would be slightly more beneficial to E ON  which would become a bigger regulated business by adding more networks  while RWE would end up owning interests in the riskier and more competitive renewables sector  The source said that E ON had been in a better bargaining position after RWE shopped Innogy to other European rivals  including France s Engie  PA ENGIE   Italy s  Enel   MI ENEI  and Spain s  Iberdrola   MC IBE   without striking a deal   This looks like an advantageous step for E ON at first glance   said Thomas Deser  fund manager at Union Investment  which holds shares in E ON  RWE and Innogy   Through the renewable pipeline  RWE  too  should be able to offset its dwindling nuclear and lignite business as well as attract partners for the expansion of its wind business   The all German transaction comes less than two years after E ON and RWE both split up their businesses to separate legacy fossil fuel power plants from more promising networks and renewable assets  E ON in January agreed to sell a remaining 46 65 percent stake in its power plant and trading unit Uniper  DE UN01   which it spun off in 2016  to Finland s  Fortum   HE FORTUM   a deal expected to close later this year  The RWE E ON swap will also hand RWE   Germany s biggest electricity producer   a 16 67 percent stake in E ON by way of a 20 percent capital increase  RWE will pay another 1 5 billion euros to E ON to close a valuation gap that results from the complex structure of the asset swaps  The transactions  which still require approval from the company s boards  face scrutiny by European Union regulators as well as from Germany s Federal Cartel Office  which did not respond to an emailed request for comment  The European Commission declined to comment  Innogy has been in turmoil since Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December in the wake of a profit warning and Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther fell victim to a recent acid attack  M A TARGET Innogy has been the target of persistent takeover talk  with sources saying recently that RWE had talked to Engie and Italy s Enel about a possible asset swap deal  Other firms linked to Innogy included Iberdrola and Australian bank Macquarie  AX MQG   an acquisitive infrastructure investor  Innogy reports its annual results on Monday  while RWE does so on Tuesday and E ON on Wednesday  The supervisory boards of both RWE and E ON were due to meet on Sunday to review the deal  according to people familiar with the matter  RWE s municipal shareholders  VkA  which jointly hold about 23 percent in the group  were caught off guard by the announcement and said the plans would have to be thoroughly examined  If approved  the deal could result in synergies of about 500 million euros  analysts at Bernstein estimate  pointing to double staffing on the customer support side  Labour sources welcomed the plans  saying that each company individually was unable to fund the networks  renewables and customer business in an adequate ways  but added talks about job protection would be a key demand  Under the proposed transaction  E ON would make a voluntary cash offer to buy RWE s Innogy stake valued at 40 00 euros per share  E ON said in a filing issued early on Sunday  Innogy shares closed at 34 53 euros on Friday  This price includes an offer of 36 76 euros per share plus assumed dividends of Innogy for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 in the total aggregate amount of 3 24 euros per share  E ON said  RWE will not participate in the offer  E ON also agreed to transfer most of its renewables business to RWE  including minority interests currently held by E ON s subsidiary PreussenElektra in the RWE operated nuclear power plants Emsland and Gundremmingen  
RWE in turn  will receive Innogy s renewables and gas storage business as well as Innogy s stake in Austrian energy supplier Kelag  KELAG UL   E ON said ",2018-03-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rwe-goes-green-in-mega-deal-to-sell-innogy-to-eon-1335603,1335603

5234,226749,ENGIE,StockBeat  Markets Tumble on Trump s China Threats,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Stocks are in retreat all across Europe on Monday after U S  President Donald Trump reignited fears of an all out trade war between the U S  and China 
At 4 AM ET  0800 GMT   the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 5 34 points  or 1 4  at 385 02
The French CAC 40 was the worst affected  losing 2 0   while the German DAX was down 1 7   The U K  FTSE was closed due a public holiday 
They re all following the Chinese market  which had its worst one day loss in three years after Trump revived threats of raising tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to 25  from 10   as well as threatening to levy 25  tariffs on  325 billion more in Chinese goods previously unaffected by the dispute 
Trump s threats represent a serious and surprising blow to market morale  after weeks of guidance from both U S  and Chinese officials that an agreement on trade between the two countries was likely  They came only 48 hours after the monthly U S  employment report showed the U S  economy still performing well  adding more jobs than expected without any noticeable pick up in inflation 
The U S  China angle is overshadowing domestic news  There was little reaction to the release of IHS Markit s Eurozone composite purchasing managers index  which showed that activity picked up marginally in April 
Stocks sensitive to global trade are among the worst losers  with German chemicals company BASF  DE BASFN  down over 7   that s also due in part to its going ex dividend  and French auto supplier  Valeo   PA VLOF  down 4   The big French and German automakers are all down  as is steelmaker ArcelorMittal  which announced sharp but notionally temporary cutbacks in European steel production earlier  citing the weak economic outlook  along with high electricity and carbon costs

5236,226751,ENGIE,Exclusive  After Grenfell fire  same builders rehired to replace dangerous cladding  Reuters finds,news,"By Tom Bergin LONDON  Reuters    Some building companies that installed dangerous cladding on social housing blocks across Britain are now winning new contracts following the Grenfell Tower blaze to remove their original work and install panels that can pass safety tests  a Reuters review shows  The safety of high rise buildings has come under scrutiny since the Grenfell disaster in June which killed 71 people  The British government  which ordered a series of tests to establish which types of cladding panels met fire safety rules  said those on the London tower block did not comply  A Reuters review identified 65 other towers with cladding of a type that was approved by local building inspectors  but which government tests found did not comply with the statutory regulations  The towers were clad by major builders including French groups Engie  PA ENGIE  and  Bouygues   PA BOUY   and Britain s  Galliford Try   L GFRD   Forrest  Wates Group  Rydon Group and Willmott Dixon   The Reuters review was based on publicly available building planning permission documents  which detail the work carried out and the materials used  as well as visits to the towers and statements from housing providers and builders   For 29 of the buildings  the same builders that installed the cladding have won new contracts to remove or replace the panels  according to the owners of the buildings  who said they were paying millions of pounds for the work  The rehired companies are Willmott Dixon  Wates and Engie   Willmott Dixon and Rydon said their cladding work complied with safety regulations  but did not say how  Wates  Bouygues  Galliford Try and Engie declined to answer questions on whether their work complied with regulations   Following the Grenfell tragedy  we have been supporting the relevant councils  and removed the cladding where requested  Our primary concern is to ensure all residents in these buildings are secure and safe   said an Engie spokesman  In the wake of Grenfell  the government ordered an independent review into building regulations and fire safety  and the way the rules are complied with and enforced  The review is due to report its findings early next year   The 65 towers in question are owned by local governments   known as councils   or housing associations  which are publicly funded  non profit bodies that provide housing intended for low income people   At the time all the panels were installed  building inspectors   usually council workers but sometimes staff of inspection firms licensed by councils   signed off the work as being compliant with safety regulations  according to the owners of the blocks and the building firms involved   Chris Blythe  CEO of trade body the Chartered Institute of Building  said builders hired to carry out high rise cladding projects used many subcontractors and advisers  and that this could lead to misunderstandings  with one party thinking another had ensured work was compliant    The business model we have is almost geared up for potential failure   said Blythe  adding that if fewer parties were involved  there would be less room for confusion over responsibilities  For all 65 blocks identified by Reuters  the councils or council licensed firms whose inspectors approved the work as compliant either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment while the independent review was ongoing  The government has already acknowledged problems with the inspection process  with Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd saying in July there was a  system failure  built up over many years  in the area of regulation enforcement   However a spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government  DCLG   which ordered the cladding tests and regulations review  said sign off by inspectors did not absolve contractors of responsibility to meet safety standards   FIRE TESTS Cladding systems are panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency   Since 2006  building regulations have required materials used in cladding on high rise buildings to be able to pass the  BS 8414 test  which measures combustibility  After Grenfell  the DCLG ordered a series BS 8414 tests to establish which types of cladding met fire safety rules  It said that  of around 600 social housing towers in England that had cladding  161 had systems of a type that failed the tests  But it did not name the towers  Reuters identified 60 blocks which  since 2006  had been cladded with aluminum panels with polyethylene cores   a form of cladding that failed the DCLG s test  and which the prime minister and three other ministers have said breaches safety regulations when used in tall buildings  Five other blocks  also cladded since 2006  had combinations of panel and insulation board that failed the test   The three companies that were rehired to replace the cladding on 29 of the towers had all originally fitted aluminum panels with polyethylene cores   Wates secured contracts with Westminster council in central London and One Manchester housing association to reclad 14 towers it covered in 2007 and 2010   Willmott Dixon has received contracts from Oxford council and west London s Octavia housing association to replace panels it installed on three blocks early this year and in 2013  Engie has been hired by Barnet Homes in north London to replace cladding on three blocks it clad in 2012  It also has a contract to remove cladding from nine blocks in Salford  north England  owned by the local council that it clad around 2016   Engie has been hired to remove panels from 12 blocks it clad in 2012 and 2016  and install new cladding on three of them  The contracts are with housing associations Barnet Homes in north London  and Pendleton Together in Salford  north England   The three building companies declined to comment on how much the contracts were worth  However five of the six owners of the buildings told Reuters how much money they were paying for the work  Oxford council said about 1 million pounds   1 3 million  for its two blocks  Octavia said about 2 million pounds for one block  Westminster council said about 6 million pounds for six blocks  and Barnet Homes said 8 2 million pounds for three blocks   Salford council said it expects to spend up to 25 million pounds in total for the removal and recladding work on nine blocks  Engie has been hired to remove its original panels  but the recladding contractor has not yet been named  One Manchester declined to comment on how much its recladding work would cost   The building companies declined to comment on the figures  LEGAL ACTION Jonathan Raynes a partner with law firm Steptoe   Johnson said councils or housing associations who paid contractors for cladding that turned out to be non compliant could sue the contractor for the cost of replacing the cladding    The contract will almost certainly have a provision that says the contractor must build in accordance with statutory requirements   he said  adding that if the contract didn t say this  a requirement to act legally could be deemed implicit  Raynes and Adam Creasey  a solicitor with Lewis Nedas  said the fact building inspectors signed off on work did not remove the builder s responsibility to adhere to building regulations  Creasey added a builder could conceivably try and reclaim any money awarded against it from the body which provided the inspection sign off   Reuters contacted the owners of all 65 blocks with cladding of a type that failed the government tests   seven local councils and 10 housing associations   and asked if they were considering legal action against contractors to recover the money spent on cladding  or to cover the cost of replacement  Only Camden council in north London said it was considering legal action  It declined to elaborate on its plans  Barnet said it was not seeking any money from its contractor  Engie  over the original cladding but declined to say why  Westminster council said it was not seeking any money from its contractor  Wates  because it believed the original work was compliant with the rules in place at the time   Oxford council said it had not sought money from Willmott Dixon over the original cladding and would only consider taking legal advice after the independent review was completed   
One Manchester said it would not talk about seeking recompense while the review was on going ",2017-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-after-grenfell-fire-same-builders-rehired-to-replace-dangerous-cladding-reuters-finds-985892,985892

5295,226810,ENGIE,EU orders Amazon to repay  295 million in Luxembourg back taxes,news,"By Robert Jan Bartunek BRUSSELS  Reuters    Amazon  O AMZN  was told on Wednesday to pay about 250 million euros   295 million  in back taxes to Luxembourg  the latest U S  tech company to be caught up in a European Union crackdown on unfair tax deals  The fine was much lower than some sources close to the case had expected and is only a fraction of the 13 billion euros that Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   was ordered to pay to Ireland last year  EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager  who has other big U S  tech companies in her sights  has taken a tough line on multinational companies  approach to tax   Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon  As a result  almost three quarters of Amazon s profits were not taxed   Vestager said  Amazon said it was considering an appeal   We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law   Amazon said in a statement after the announcement  Amazon shares were little changed in early Wednesday trading  Though the EU has taken on several U S  tech companies  both in antitrust and in tax avoidance cases  Vestager said that her approach was not biased against foreign companies  This is about competition in Europe  no matter your flag  no matter you ownership   Vestager said  She also welcomed the debate kicked off by French President Emmanuel Macron who called for more integrated corporate tax regimes in Europe  aiming to close the loopholes used to reduce tax bills  RAZOR THIN MARGINS While the exact amount Amazon needs to repay is yet to be calculated  the 250 million euros is significantly less than the 400 million euros which sources close to the matter told Reuters a year ago was under consideration by Vestager  The bill suggests the Commission believes Amazon shielded around 900 million euros in EU profits from tax  calculations by Reuters show   For most of its existence  Amazon has worked on razor thin profit margins to fuel its global expansion  making only  2 4 billion profit on global revenues of  136 billion in 2016  The Commission said Luxembourg allowed Amazon to channel a significant portion of its profits to a holding company without paying tax  The holding company was allowed to do this because it held certain intellectual property rights   Tax advisers say an important way for companies to shift profits out of the United States is to sell intellectual property  like brands or patents  to a subsidiary in a country where such profits are not taxed and have that unit license the intellectual property to other overseas affiliates  Amazon s corporate set up with subsidies in Luxembourg was also subject of a  1 5 billion court case with U S  tax authorities  which Amazon won in March  Amazon  which employs 1 500 in the grand duchy  is one of the biggest employers in the country of half a million people  It has a Europe wide staff of some 50 000  Luxembourg  whose tiny economy has benefited from providing a European base for multinational companies  rejected the finding and said it was looking at its legal options  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker was prime minister of Luxembourg for almost two decades until 2013 and has been criticized for his role in enabling the many tax deals that are now being unraveled  He denies doing anything wrong and says the Commission is committed to ensuring fair taxation  In 2014  Luxembourg made international headlines in the wake of the publication of  LuxLeaks   documents that showed how large accounting firms helped multinational companies channel proceeds through the country while paying little or no tax  Luxembourg is also under EU scrutiny over tax deals with fast food chain McDonald s  N MCD  and French energy company Engie  PA ENGIE   Luxembourg has appealed against a ruling in 2015 that carmaker  Fiat   MI FCHA  should pay it back taxes  As well as Ireland  tax for multinationals in Belgium and the Netherlands have also come under Commission scrutiny   Luxembourg has been fully cooperating with the Commission in its investigation and is strongly committed to tax transparency and the fight against harmful tax avoidance   the country s finance ministry said on Wednesday  Amazon revamped its European tax practices in 2015 so that it can book sales and pay taxes in Britain  Germany  Spain and Italy instead of channeling all sales through Luxembourg where it is headquartered  a move that may raise its tax bill

5306,226821,ENGIE,Up against Germany  EU bid for gas talks with Moscow falters,news,"By Alissa de Carbonnel and Peter Maushagen BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Commission s attempts to intervene in Russia s plans for a new gas pipeline to Germany have been dealt a blow by legal advice  according to EU diplomats and a document seen by Reuters  Brussels  backed by some EU member states  is concerned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will increase the bloc s reliance on Russian gas and cut gas transit revenues for Ukraine  damaging its fragile economy  So the Commission is seeking a mandate from EU members to hold talks with Russia   But Germany  the EU s biggest economy and the end point for the pipeline planned to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year  believes Brussels should not get involved  According to an opinion by the legal service of the European Council  a body where EU nations meet  the Commission s proposed mandate for talks with Russia failed to establish  any legal need to negotiate  and contained  mere political arguments   The opinion also took aim at the Commission s concern that the pipeline would increase dependence on Russia s state owned gas firm Gazprom  MM GAZP   This  is at the very least counter intuitive   the document  dated Sept  27  said   It pretty much kills the mandate   one EU official said  With the opinion suggesting the Commission may need unanimous backing from EU members for its plan  another EU official said   I see very little room for moving forward  and in the meantime  the pipeline will be built   Eastern European and Baltic Sea states fear the project strengthens Russia s hand  while Germany and other beneficiaries in northern Europe see a commercial payoff  Both sides  however  fear the potential loss for Ukraine of some  2 billion per year of Russian gas transit fees will undermine its war torn economy  complicating the bloc s investment in reforms there  Many see the project at odds with sanctions Western countries have imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine   Our main concern is how to stabilize Ukraine   said an EU diplomat  But he added   Apart from Russia  there aren t many gas rich countries left close to Germany     Nord Stream 2 is unsavory  but the right thing to do   The opinion  the latest legal tussle over the pipeline  will make it harder for the EU s 28 members to find common ground when they debate the issue on Thursday  EU sources said  Germany has seized on it as proof EU regulators should not meddle  while others accuse Berlin of strong arming EU institutions   Our German colleagues are crowing right now   said an EU diplomat  whose country backs the Commission bid  Another was defiant   We are not rolling over yet   the diplomat said   This is not a legal issue but about taking care of geopolitics   Poland  one of the pipeline s fiercest opponents  plans to put forward its own legal opinion this week  one of its diplomats said  dismissing the Council document as  just an opinion    Within a bloc still reeling from Brexit  EU officials say there is little appetite for divisive initiatives and the Commission will not move ahead without a strong mandate  It is also wary of any future court challenge  they added   UP TO MERKEL  German energy groups Uniper  DE UN01  and Wintershall  DE BASFn  are not alone in having a stake in the 1 225 km  760 mile  pipeline  which will pump Russian gas via the Baltic Sea  Austria s OMV  VI OMVV   Anglo Dutch group Shell  L RDSa   and France s Engie  PA ENGIE  are also invested  Several EU diplomats said German counterparts were under pressure to sweep away an issue that could interfere with Chancellor Angela Merkel s efforts to build a new coalition  including with the Green party  after Sept  24 elections  Merkel says she sees no need for the EU to get involved  and her government has sought assurances from Moscow that it will keep pumping gas through Ukraine after its gas transit contract expires in 2019  Those in Brussels who do not want to see the EU bid fail worry the bloc will loose leverage to seek such assurances  
 Then it will be up to Merkel to negotiate Ukraine transits with Russia   one EU official said ",2017-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/up-against-germany-eu-bid-for-gas-talks-with-moscow-falters-540029,540029

5317,226832,ENGIE,Energy firms battle startups to wire Europe s highways for electric cars,news,By Geert De Clercq and Christoph Steitz PARIS FRANKFURT  Reuters    The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent s cities to its motorways  Power utilities  tech start ups and oil majors are fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in the fast growing business of charging stations   but advances in electric vehicles means where they build them is changing  Refuelling conventional petrol and diesel cars on motorways has long been the domain of the oil companies  which typically have their own networks of filling stations  Several are now talking about setting up high power charging networks  creating major competition for limited space at motorway service areas   It is a bit of a landgrab now to win this sector   said Tim Payne  chief executive of British charging start up InstaVolt  which has raised 12 million pounds to install 3 000 charge points across Britain by 2020  While the range of electric vehicles  EVs  was less than 100 km  60 miles   Europe s utilities were happy to help cities and companies install slow and inexpensive charging points at homes  offices and shops  often supported by state subsidies  But Tesla  O TSLA   Porsche  DE VOWG p  and BMW  DE BMWG  are now making battery powered cars with enough range to drive across countries   Daimler   DE DAIGn  and Volkswagen also announced plans on the eve of this week s Frankfurt motor show to accelerate their shift to electric cars  Charging infrastructure remains nowhere near it needs to be   Where is the network of charging points that will be required  Indeed where is the power and the grid   Ralf Speth  boss of Britain s Jaguar Land Rover  asked last week  Experts including ChargePoint and Engie  PA ENGIE  are  however  making plans to build pan European networks of high voltage fast charging stations which can refill a battery in less than half an hour instead of overnight  In Britain  InstaVolt is renting land from filling station operators  bringing them additional revenue from the lease as well as the increased traffic to their shops at the sites  It earns a margin by selling power through the chargers  InstaVolt struck a deal in May with ChargePoint  which itself is on a  125 million expansion spree in Europe  to install about 200 of the U S  group s ultra fast chargers close to popular roads across Britain  UP FOR GRABS Morgan Stanley estimates that 1 3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030  adding that while utilities have natural skills in the new industry  it was too early to determine who will come put on top   The winning business model is up for grabs   it said  Today  there are fewer than 100 000 public charging points available in Europe  with only about six percent of them fast  according to the International Energy Agency  Almost none of these is super fast  a term usually used for charging stations with an output of at least 150 kilowatts  More than three times faster than current generation chargers  they are now being targeted by those trying to become market leaders   Contenders include Dutch EV Box  one of Europe s biggest makers of charging stations  which was snapped up by French utility Engie  PA ENGIE  in March   We expect hundreds of millions of annual revenue from EV Box in a few years   Thierry Lepercq  head of innovation at Engie  told Reuters  He sees Engie s EV charging revenue growing by a factor of 20 in three to five years  Last year  EV Box had sales of 16 million euros   19 1 million   EV Box Chief Executive Kristof Vereenooghe said that unlike most of its competitors EV Box has been profitable from the start  a claim that makes it stand out in an industry where gaining scale is considered more important for now  That s why German utility E ON  DE EONGn   too  announced a strategic partnership with Danish startup CLEVER and said it had the ambition to roll out several hundred ultra fast charging stations along European motorways  CLEVER  which is owned by a group of Danish utilities and runs charging networks in Denmark  Sweden and Germany  wants to extend its network to France  Britain and Italy with E ON  The firm  which unlike EV Box and ChargePoint does not make its own hardware  is also still looking for other partners   We want to connect cities so that you can easily drive across Europe in an electric vehicle   CLEVER Chief Executive Casper Kirketerp Moeller said   TALK LESS  INSTALL MORE Among the oil majors   BP   L BP   Shell  L RDSa  and  PA TOTF  have all either announced plans or launched pilot projects for EV charging  Few people  however  expect them to become serious contenders for a business that would effectively curb demand for their chief product  oil

5361,226876,ENGIE,StockBeat  Engie  EDP Play Catch Up in Energy s Big Growth Sector,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Europe s electricity giants have had a hard time moving beyond fossil and nuclear fuels into renewables  but the continent s climate policy agenda leaves them no choice 
That explains  in part  the announcement by France s Engie  PA ENGIE  and Portugal s EDP  LS EDP   two of Europe s old style legacy incumbents  to team up in the fast growing sector of offshore wind 
The two said on Monday they intend to have up to 7 gigawatts of installed capacity   the equivalent of eight or nine old style gas or coal fired generation plants   operating by 2025  with another 5 to 10 gigawatts at an advanced stage of development  They have cooperated at a project level already since 2013  and already have 5 5 GW in construction or under development  but that is still a hefty expansion plan 
The logic of the deal seems clear enough  although it may be a slow burner in terms of value creation  EDP s stock rose 1  on Tuesday and is up another 0 2  today  Engie s would have been up a similar amount had it not gone ex dividend 
Europe s bourses are in mixed spirits Wednesday  with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0 1   while Germany s Dax is flat and the U K  FTSE 100 up 0 4  largely due to sterling weakness 
Their aim is to become the second largest wind farm developers in the world behind Denmark s Oersted  CO ORSTED   and leap frogging Spain s  Iberdrola   MC IBE   Orsted has been one of the biggest stock market successes in Europe of recent years  up more than 125  since its IPO in June 2016  skilfully exploiting a sector where government subsidies and market dynamics are in constant flux 
Iberdrola has needed longer to take off but its stock has risen 35  since October  Conspicuously  both of those stocks have been immune to the general increase in market volatility in the last eight months 
Both EDP and Engie could do with a little bit of Orsted Iberdrola magic 
EDP is looking to move beyond the collapse of a takeover attempt by China Three Gorges  a state controlled generator  Its stock lost some 15  from the start of April as that episode unravelled 
Engie investors  meanwhile  have yet to buy into CEO Isabelle Kocher s plans to streamline the sprawling business  although she made a promising start in February by promising to get out of 20 of its 70 markets  It has a headache with its investment in the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline  which has landed it in the U S  administration s crosshairs  The U S  confirmed on Monday that it is preparing new sanctions against the Russian controlled pipeline  in which Engie has a 10  stake ",2019-05-22,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-engie-edp-play-catchup-in-energys-big-growth-sector-1875462,1875462

5395,226910,ENGIE,Russian gas pipelines to go ahead despite U S  sanctions,news,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Alissa de Carbonnel MOSCOW BRUSSELS  Reuters    New U S  sanctions will make it harder for Russia to build two gas export pipelines to Europe but the projects are unlikely to be stopped   U S  President Donald Trump has reluctantly signed into law further sanctions on Russia but some of the measures are discretionary and most White House watchers believe he will not take action against Russia s energy infrastructure   This would allow Gazprom s two big pipeline projects to go ahead  although at a higher price and with some delays  The Kremlin  dependent on oil and gas revenues  sees the pipelines to Germany and Turkey   Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream   as crucial to increasing its market share in Europe   It also fears that Western partners   needed to develop the deepwater  shale and Arctic gas deposits that will fill the pipelines   will be scared off by sanctions   Gazprom  MCX GAZP  warned investors last month that the sanctions  may result in delays  or otherwise impair or prevent the completion of the projects by the group   With all that in mind  the Russian gas giant is taking steps to reduce the impact of sanctions  It has accelerated pipe laying by Swiss contractor Allseas Group under the Black Sea for TurkStream   even though there is no final agreement on where the pipeline will make landfall in Turkey  It is also hurriedly building a second TurkStream line to export gas to Europe   The construction of the second line is underway just in case the sanctions hit   a senior Gazprom source told Reuters  A spokesman for Allseas said 100 km of the 900 km first line have been built since June 23 and preparatory work is underway for the second line  THE UKRAINIAN CONNECTION The biggest cost of any delays to the new lines could come from increased transit fees paid to Ukraine  the route by which Russian gas has traditionally reached Europe  Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream bypass Ukraine  but if they are brought into use late  Gazprom will have to continue using the Ukrainian route and may have to pay more for the privilege  The European Union  fearing sanctions will hurt oil and gas projects on which it depends  said it was ready to retaliate unless it obtained U S  guarantees that European firms would not be targeted   Five Western firms that have invested in Nord Stream 2   Wintershall  DE BASFn  and Uniper  DE UN01  of Germany  Austria s OMV  VI OMVV   Anglo Dutch Shell  L RDSa   and France s Engie  PA ENGIE    say it is too early to judge the impact of sanctions  For now  they are standing by their pledge of up to 950 million euros   1 13 billion  each to finance the 1 225 km  760 mile  Nord Stream 2  Despite Trump s desire to promote U S  liquefied natural gas exports to Europe that would compete with the Russian gas  he said he did not want the sanctions to get in the way of efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine  EU officials  industry sources and experts therefore doubt that Trump will use what he regards as  significantly flawed  sanctions to punish Moscow   Their approach is going to be strictly by the letter of the law  what do they have to do   Richard Nephew  a former U S  deputy chief of sanctions now with Columbia University s Center on Global Energy Policy  RISK PREMIUM The sanctions law is however expected to hamper Gazprom s efforts to raise money   The price of any project automatically increases   said Tatiana Mitrova  director of the Skolkovo Energy Center   Gazprom s relationships with partners  subcontractors  and equipment and service providers are severely complicated   she said   They will all ask for a risk premium    Gazprom will have to take on the additional cost itself  depend on Russian state banks  or seek money at higher rates from Asian lenders  financial analysts said   This  however  does not mean that Nord Stream 2 won t be built   said Katja Yafimava of the Oxford Energy Institute  Industry sources say the loans from Western partners for Nord Stream 2 are already at above market rates to reflect the political risk of partnering with Russia in a project that has also faced opposition in Europe   The added uncertainty ups the stakes further   It s like reading tea leaves   one source with knowledge of the European side of the Nord Stream 2 financing structure told Reuters  While big players may be able to stomach the risk  analysts say the smaller contractors on which Gazprom depends to build the pipelines may get spooked   Not all partners can afford to see things through with Gazprom   said Valery Nesterov  an analyst at Moscow based Sberbank CIB  A spokesman for Nord Stream 2 said more than 200 non Russian companies from 17 countries  most of them European  are building the pipeline  Most of the big contracts for steel  port logistics and construction have already been concluded  By forcing the pace of construction  Gazprom may have gained enough time to build the new pipelines but longer term projects will take a hit   Unless Trump takes a really sharp turn  it is highly unlikely that companies that are supplying pipeline goods are going to be punished in the next year or so   Nephew said   A lot of companies are now thinking   I ve got maybe 12  maybe 18 months in which I can do some stuff but after that maybe I won t

5414,226929,ENGIE,Trump and Macron may not be an odd couple after all,news,"By John Irish and Ayesha Rascoe PARIS WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s relationship with Emmanuel Macron got off to an awkward start  with a jaw clenching handshake at a summit in Brussels before the French president rebuked the U S  leader for his stance on climate change   The two men would appear to have little in common  Trump  71  is an anti globalist elected on a pledge to  make America great again  who is unpredictable on foreign policy  Macron  39  is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations  Trump s visit to Paris this week  to celebrate 100 years since U S  troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain  follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world s major economies at a G20 summit last weekend  In Paris  Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors  Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport  and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship  Trump could use a friend overseas  His preference for a more unilateral  transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U S  president appearing isolated among world leaders    Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don t like  such as on climate  but we can deal with it in two ways  we can say   We are not going to talk to you   or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle   government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI   Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand   POLITICAL OUTSIDERS Trump and Macron are political outsiders  the American a real estate mogul  his French counterpart a former investment banker  Both love a good deal  demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions  and have a penchant for showmanship  Like Macron  Trump will be looking for common ground  Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg  Gary Cohn  director of the White House National Economic Council  said Trump and Macron enjoyed a  great  relationship   You know  Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal  but I think the end goal is the same   Cohn said  Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change  In hard fought negotiations in Germany  Macron tried to soften U S  language on climate policy   Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy  He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as  a long bilateral meeting between the two men   Having reshaped their countries  political landscapes  both now have certain shared objectives  making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority  It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran  possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U S  Congress that might derail a 9 5 billion euro   10 9 billion  gas pipe project in which France s Engie SA  PA ENGIE  has a stake  The United States and France hold differing views on Iran  On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May  Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups  During the U S  presidential race  he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran s nuclear program  branding it  the worst deal ever negotiated   So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE  PA AIR   oil major  Total  SA  PA TOTF  and automobile manufacturers  Peugeot  SA  PA PEUP  and  Renault  SA  PA RENA  to sign initial deals   A WIN WIN FOR BOTH  Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France s former monarchy  Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp  with U S  soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees  For Macron  France s youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago  it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump s confidence and set about influencing U S  foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction   The visit is a win win for both   said one French diplomat   Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys  Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no fuss picture with the leader of the  free world    Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner  French diplomats said  Moreover  he senses an opportunity to sway U S  thinking and elevate the role of France  a nuclear power and permanent member of the U N  Security Council  in global affairs  in particular on Syria and the Middle East  they added  France is the second biggest contributor to the U S  led coalition in Syria  and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State  It is one reason  the diplomats say  that in his first two months as president  Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin  just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U S  election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him   The Russians are pleased to have a grown up to talk to in Europe   a second French diplomat said  
Daniel Fried  an expert on U S  European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton  George W  Bush and Barack Obama  said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself   By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage  ",2017-07-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-and-macron-may-not-be-an-odd-couple-after-all-504423,504423

A spokesman for NuGen said it could not comment on specific financial issues relating directly to Toshiba or Westinghouse and that it will continue  business as usual  to gain the necessary permits and licenses to build the project   additional reporting by Karolin Schaps  editing by Alexander Smith ",2017-03-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/westinghouse-set-to-win-uk-reactor-approval-469897,469897

5573,227088,ENGIE,South Australia taps new gas plant  batteries to fix power crisis,news,"By Sonali Paul
SYDNEY  Reuters    South Australia  the country s most renewable energy dependent state  outlined plans on Tuesday to spend A 510 million   385 million  to keep the lights on  just four days after Tesla Inc  O TSLA  boss Elon Musk offered to save the state from blackouts by installing large scale battery storage 
The plan includes A 150 million to encourage the development of a 100 megawatts of battery storage  possibly from Musk or from local providers  The state will also build and operate a new A 360 million 250 megawatt gas power plant to stabilize its electricity system 
The South Australia government came up with the emergency plan after a state wide blackout last September during a storm left homes and businesses in the dark for up to eight hours and paralyzed some industries for up to two weeks 
 Today  South Australia takes hold of its energy future  We have a national electricity market which is failing not only South Australia but failing the nation   state Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement 
The state  which relies on wind for about a third of its power capacity  has become vulnerable to outages and soaring prices as it does not have enough back up power when the wind is not blowing 
South Australia s last coal fired power station shut down last May  as it was making losses  and France s Engie SA  PA ENGIE  mothballed one of two units at a gas fired power plant for the same reason 
On the batteries front  Weatherill said he was speaking to a range of providers 
 We want as much local content as possible   he told a news conference   We also need to put in the balance the reputational effect of attracting an international player of the size of Elon Musk to South Australia   
Weatherill spoke to Musk on Saturday after Australian tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon Brookes said he would help raise funding and political support for the Tesla chief s offer to supply 100 megawatt hours of batteries for  25 million within 100 days of signing a contract  or provide it free 
 Over the coming days Tesla are assessing with stakeholders how best to deliver on this exciting opportunity for the benefit of the Australian energy market   a Tesla spokesman said 
South Australia released its plan a day ahead of a crisis meeting called by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull with the heads of Australia s gas producers to find ways to boost gas supply  crucial for power plants and manufacturers 
Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg slammed South Australia s plan saying it could drive up power prices and undermine national electricity market rules 
Top global miner BHP Billiton  AX BHP   L BLT   which lost  105 million at its Olympic Dam copper mine after the blackout last September  welcomed the state s effort to boost energy security  but warned it could have  pricing implications  and affect expansion plans 

 South Australian business and residents cannot afford a repeat of the energy issues experienced over the past eight months  and we look forward to immediate steps being taken which will provide greater energy security for the State before the end of the year   a BHP Billiton spokesman said ",2017-03-14,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/south-australia-aims-for-new-gas-plant,-battery-to-fix-power-crisis-465849",465849

5576,227091,ENGIE,EU stalls Russian gas pipeline  but probably won t stop it,news,"By Alissa de Carbonnel and Vera Eckert BRUSSELS FRANKFURT  Reuters    Russia has the European Union in a bind  The bloc is divided between eastern European and Baltic Sea countries that see a new pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic making the EU a hostage to Moscow   and those in northern Europe  most especially the main beneficiary Germany  for whom the economic benefits take priority  The result  EU sources say  is that the EU executive  the Commission  sensing that there may ultimately be no legal basis to block approval of Nord Stream 2  is delaying it as long as possible  hoping to get past 2019   the date when Russia must renegotiate a gas transit deal with Ukraine   There s a difference between not supporting the project and having a legal basis to stop it   said one EU diplomat  adding that the aim for now was  a break to avoid the project going anywhere in 2019   And for now  that means doing nothing  to the intense frustration of members such as Denmark  whose prime minister challenged the Commission at a summit of EU leaders this month to make good on strong words criticizing the pipeline  Last summer  seven eastern member states  all formerly dominated by Moscow and at the center of an EU antitrust case accusing Gazprom  MCX GAZP  of abusing its market dominance  sent a letter of protest to Commission President Jean Claude Juncker  They too are still waiting for a clear response  EU sources say the Commission is in fact cultivating uncertainty by hinting that the pipeline may fall foul of EU rules  in the hope of scaring off Western investors  for a time at least  And in fact  last July  Gazprom s Western partners   Uniper  DE EONGn   Wintershall  DE BASFn   Shell  L RDSa   OMV  VI OMVV  and Engie  PA ENGIE    did withdraw from pledges to provide 1 2 billion euros of equity for the pipeline  a twin to Nord Stream 1  which began pumping in 2011  DEEP DIVISIONS Germany is also not actively promoting the pipeline for now  with a parliamentary election looming this autumn   The feeling is   Why use up political capital to defend it   said one EU diplomat  Broadly  the plan to bring more Russian gas to Europe plays into deep divisions between EU nations over whether to do more business with Moscow while countering its military power plays in Ukraine and Syria  Germany itself has taken a firm stance on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine  But it also argues that EU market rules guarantee that the pipeline remains a purely commercial project  while eastern and Baltic states accuse President Vladimir Putin of exploiting energy exports as a geopolitical tool  Meanwhile  littoral states that feel increasingly threatened by Moscow s military posturing in and around the Baltic Sea want clarity from Brussels before going ahead with routine environmental assessments of Nord Stream 2       This has lots of geopolitical questions and it is not fair that one country should answer alone whether this is an good idea   Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said last month   This is not a question only for Denmark but for the European Union   Russia already accounts for one third of EU gas imports  and that could rise with the help of Nord Stream 2  as Gazprom fights for market share with the EU s domestic supplies decreasing  It would also sharply reduce the need for Russia to export gas through Ukraine  where the EU is trying to support stumbling economic reforms  This would deprive Kiev of lucrative transit fees  and of a lever in its tortured relations with Moscow  Hence the Commission s desire to at least stall approval until 2019  STALLING  NOT STOPPING But sooner or later  EU sources grudgingly admit that Russia s determined push for Nord Stream 2 looks set to carry it over the numerous legal and financial hurdles in its path  Gazprom s Western partner firms say they are looking for new ways to share the financial burden  notwithstanding the uncertainty   If it isn t stopped politically  its commercial logic will prevail   one industry source said  Gazprom is busily ordering steel pipes  renting facilities in Sweden  Finland and Germany and applying for permits to lay the 1 225 km  760 mile  pipe  And Germany  by hosting the end point of the 55 billion cubic meter a year pipeline  stands to grow into a gas hub for central  eastern and southern Europe  alongside the Dutch and British markets   What Germany wants  Germany gets   said one official in Brussels  In an opinion seen by Reuters  it the Commission argued last January for EU gas market liberalization rules to be applied to Nord Stream 2  citing  serious diversification and security of supply concerns   But that was rejected by the EU s own lawyers as well as the German energy regulator  the Bundesnetzagentur  Responding this month to a missive from Brussels  the Bundesnetzagentur said Nord Stream 2 should simply be treated as an import pipeline like Nord Stream 1  Algeria s Medgaz and Libya s Greenstream  To subject it to internal EU energy market rules would be  just as inappropriate as it would be improper   the agency s president  Jochen Homann  wrote in the March 3 letter  seen by Reuters   MONEY TALKS  Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that talks with the agency were far from over  insisting that EU rules to promote competition passed since Nord Stream 1 was built should apply to the new pipeline   Key EU legal principles must also be respected in the offshore part of the pipeline   he told Reuters   We ll negotiate with the German regulator how to secure that   He said the legal tussle should be dealt with via an intergovernmental agreement between Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel   which both sides have eschewed  That would give the EU a chance to vet the deal under new rules  adopted on Tuesday  that give Brussels the power to vet oil and gas deals with outside countries to guard against anti competitive practices and supply disruptions  There are also legal questions over Eugal  a smaller pipeline intended to feed gas from the offshore Nord Stream 2 to Germany and beyond  German regulatory sources say they will not approve Eugal until Europe s highest court decides whether to uphold a deal between EU regulators and Germany to remove limits on Gazprom s access to a similar pipeline running from Nord Stream 1   That ruling could take up to two years  although an interim ruling is expected to give a signal within weeks  Ultimately  the pipeline means big business  Building up a case to comply with German regulation  five pipeline operators ran an auction this month that indicated demand from shippers for almost the full capacity of the Eugal pipeline over 20 years from 2019  When Sweden s government voiced national security concerns over Gazprom using the island of Gotland as a base for construction  several other ports stepped forward hoping to win the business  The chosen site  Karlshamn  stands to benefit from 100 million SEK   11 3 million  worth of business   Money talks   said one EU diplomat   If it s not illegal  then politically there s little we can do   
One senior German industry source put it bluntly   I don t care where the gas comes from as long as they are pumping more  ",2017-03-24,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/eu-stalls-russian-gas-pipeline,-but-probably-won't-stop-it-468664",468664

5603,227118,ENGIE,London or Paris  Choice proves a taxing question for bankers,news,"By Anjuli Davies
LONDON  Reuters    Forget fine wine  haute cuisine and art     the big question from London s bankers for a French delegation trying to lure them to Paris was  how much tax will I pay 
 Most were interested in income tax and executive tax on pay   Gerard Mestrallet  president of France s finance industry lobby Europlace who led Monday s roadshow  said 
More than 80 representatives from banks and business met with authorities from Paris who are highlighting the attractions of the French capital if Britain s exit from the European Union forces the relocation of some activities to continental Europe 
Global banks and insurers have begun signaling how they cope with a  hard  exit from the EU  after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would leave the single market 
And Brexit has opened up  fierce competition  among the main financial cities of Europe    which include Paris  Frankfurt  Dublin and Luxembourg    Valerie Pecresse  the head of the wider Paris region  said 
HSBC  L HSBA   Europe s biggest bank  has said it could move some of its operations to Paris  where it has a subsidiary that holds most of the licenses needed by an investment bank thanks to its purchase of CCF in 2000 
LABOR LAW CONCERNS
Pecresse estimated that the French capital could attract about 10 000 jobs  although bankers at the event raised concerns about French tax rules and labor laws as a possible deterrent 
 The expatriate regime has dramatically improved but there are also some concerns about labor flexibility   Mestrallet  who is chairman of French utilities Engie  PA ENGIE  and Suez  PA SEVI   said 
The French government introduced extra tax concessions for expatriates last year in the hope Paris could profit from Brexit  but experts say other centers with more flexible labor and tax rules are likely to be bigger beneficiaries 
With the exception of HSBC  most financial firms have yet to make a decision on relocation plans to Paris  according to Mestrallet   Many will wait three months to have more clarity on the outcome of the French elections  
Germany is also seeking to attract finance jobs from Britain  The country s senior regulators met about 50 envoys from foreign banks last week to explain how they could move business to Europe s biggest economy after Britain leaves the EU  German financial watchdog Bafin said 
But the Parisian delegation thinks it has the upper hand

Maersk Oil produced an average of 295 000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first nine months of 2016  It suffered a major setback when Qatar chose not to extend its 25 year license to operate the giant Al Shaheen field and award it from 2017 to  Total   PA TOTF  ",2016-12-14,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive:-maersk,-dong-oil-and-gas-merger-talks-stall---sources-447652",447652

5657,227172,ENGIE,New Russia Sanctions Could Push U S   EU Further Apart,opinion,"You would think that a stiffening of Washington s backbone when it comes to Russia would be welcomed by Europe  After all  it was Germany s Angela Markel that has led the tough stand taken against Moscow following the Russian sponsored uprising in eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea 
But on the contrary  cross party support in the US House of Representatives led to a 419 to 3 vote in favor of new financial sanctions against Russia this week  a move that has faced fierce criticism from Bonn and considerable debate about the wider implications 
The EU probably does not care about the inclusion of North Korea in the proposed sanctions  although it has taken a distinctly different and more tolerant line on Iran  the third regime included in the action  
But it is  in Bonn according to Carnegie Europe  a Brussels based think tank 
Impact on Europe
A post on the site reports the action could not only severely impact many European companies who have already invested heavily in projects  particularly in the oil and gas sector  but that it could also precipitate a political divide among Europe s partners  Seen in the context of this development  President Donald Trump s focus on Poland during his recent visit to the continent for the G 20 summit takes on a more sinister slant   at least  that is the view many Europeans are taking 
The bill singles out Nord Stream 2  a natural gas pipeline project which would expand an existing gas pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea  currently led by Russian energy giant Gazprom  MCX GAZP   Its partners  Carnegie explains  consist of five major European energy companies  France s Engie  PA ENGIE   the British Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   Austria s OMV  VIE OMVV   and Germany s Uniper  F UN01  and Wintershall  Poland and the Baltic states claim  however  that Nord Stream 2 will increase  not weaken  Europe s dependence on Russian gas  and by circumventing Ukraine and Poland would reduce transit fees paid to countries with the original the Bratstvo and Soyuz overland pipelines 
Adding further angst in Europe is a suspicion the US sanctions bill is designed to deny Europe access to Russian gas so it will be forced to import more liquefied natural gas  LNG  from America s shale frackers 
Those involved with Nord Stream 2 wouldn t be the only casualties 
Companies working with the Russian energy company Lukoil  LON LKOHyq   which is developing the large Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan  would also be fined  Carnegie explains  In addition  Caspian gas shipments to Europe via the Southern Gas Corridor  which would be fed gas from the Shah Deniz field  would be affected  That would deny Europe the chance of more energy security and diversification  Brussels claims 
Then there is the Caspian Pipeline Consortium  in which the US company Chevron  NYSE CVX  holds a 15  stake  That  too  would be hit  because Russia holds a 24  stake in the project  As for the planned Turkish Stream pipeline  which would send Russian gas to Turkey under the Black Sea  the proposed US sanctions would further increase antagonism between Ankara and Washington 
Disagreement about the policy is set to run as the details are hashed out  On top of environmental policy  NATO and possible trade sanctions fallout from the US Department of Commerce s Section 232 investigations  Europe and the US seem ever further apart

5658,227173,ENGIE,Russia Balks And The Italians Talk ,opinion,"Oil prices roared back after the Russia central bank sent signals that they were not very happy about the rapid drop in crude prices  and European markets bounced back as Italian political factions have decided to talk  This comes as there is more evidence that OPEC and Non OPEC have achieved their goal of getting rid of the global petroleum glut  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  reports that the global glut of oil and liquids is gone  as global supplies are back at the five year average 
This is not comforting as more companies are bailing on doing business with Iran as U S  sanctions loom while global demand is soaring  As we predicted years ago when everyone was telling you that cheap energy prices were here for the foreseeable future  we said that we were laying the groundwork for a new super bull cycle  While we may see another test of the lows in oil  that may be the next best buying opportunity this year 
When Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled that they were laying the groundwork for a potential oil production increase at the June 22 meeting to offset the plunge in Venezuelan output and the potential loss of Iranian supply  they had no idea that it would quickly take almost 8  off the price in a few days  They probably had no idea because the increase  rumored on the high side to be an increase of 1 million barrels a day  is only a drop in the bucket compared to what the market was losing from the OPEC bad boys  Iran and Venezuela 
So  when Reuters reported that the Russian central bank said falling oil prices would pose a risk to the country s financial sector  the market took that as a sign that Russia may not want to agree to raise output unless prices stabilize  And if Russia is worried about the sharp drop in oil prices in such a short period of time  you can bet your bottom barrel that the rest of the OPEC members are concerned as well  So traders  you must play close attention to the OPEC pre meeting on June 2 in Kuwait City as they meet to discuss  OPEC matters  ahead of next month s OPEC non OPEC meeting in Vienna 
Italy Cries  that is so two days ago  Not to make light of the financial and political issues in Italy and Spain but the market s reaction to the turmoil was overdone and ahead of itself  The Guardian reports that the leader of the Italian far right party  the League   Matteo Salvini  cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday  in what was a sign that what has left the country without a fully functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end  Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner  Luigi Di Maio  the 31 year old head of the anti establishment  Five Star Movement   to form a government 
The Guardian says that Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League  formerly known as the Lega Nord  and M5S would include the nomination   again   of Giuseppe Conte  a formerly obscure law professor  to serve as prime minister  But the two populists  Di Maio and Salvini  were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81 year old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona  who had called Italy s adoption of the euro a  historic mistake   serve as finance minister  So  in other words the fears of a full blown crisis in the EU is unlikely and even if it does happen the global economy is in a much better position to handle it 
The real crisis may be another price spike in oil as companies run away from Iran  greatly increasing the odds that Iran s oil exports will be greatly reduced shortly  Reuters has reported on a few  French gas and power group Engie  PA ENGIE  said on May 18 it would end its engineering contracts in Iran by November  Poland s dominant gas firm PGNiG  PGN WA  has suspended a gas project in Iran because of the risk from U S  sanctions  its deputy chief executive said on May 18  French oil major Total  PA TOTF  said on May 16 it would pull out of the South Pars project and unwind all related operations by Nov  4  unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by U S  authorities with the support of the French and European authorities   There are surely more that will be added 
This comes as the glut is gone  Do you remember the oil supply glut that they said would never go away because of shale oil and OPEC not being able to comply with cuts  They told us that that we would have a glut for maybe decades to come  Well they forgot to factor in demand growth and the impact of a trillion dollars in capital spending cuts  and they did not pay attention to the changing political and economic dynamics in the OPEC Cartel 
The Energy Information Administration reported that total liquid fuels in the United States and OECD countries have returned to the five year average  The EIA says that global petroleum inventories declined through 2017 and the first quarter of 2018  marking the end of an extended period of oversupply in global petroleum markets that began before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  November 2016 agreement to cut production  OPEC plans to reconvene on June 22  and markets now appear more in balance  but uncertainty remains going forward 
Because of the November 2016 OPEC supply agreement  which took effect in January 2017  OPEC member countries agreed to reduce crude oil production by 1 2 million barrels per day  b d  compared with October 2016 levels and to limit total OPEC production to 32 5 million b d  In addition  Russia agreed to reduce its crude oil production  OPEC extended the agreement in November 2017  with the production cuts remaining in place until the end of 2018 
The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude Inventories were up  1 001 million barrels  Gasoline was down 1 682 million barrels and distillates were up 1 466 million barrels while Cushing saw a drop of 132 000 barrels  The trade is awaiting the EIA version before getting too excited  Because of the holiday  we also get the natural gas number today and we should see an injection of 101 bcf ",2018-05-31,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/russia-balks-and-the-italians-talk-200320838,200320838
5659,227174,ENGIE,U S  Sanctions Will Not Stop Nord Stream 2,opinion,"Summary

US may sanction Gazprom  MCX GAZP  s partners over Nord Stream 2 
Those threats are empty as Gazprom has options 
Nord Stream 2 s political importance make it a major bargaining chip 
Italy could torpedo Russian sanctions in July 

 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community  Stocks  Shocks   Rocks  
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has created a massive amount of controversy  The US vehemently opposes the project on the basis of  European energy security  as it will further bind Europe s future energy needs to Russia s Gazprom 
Through proxies  such as Poland and the Baltic states  primarily Latvia  the US has worked tirelessly to stop the project  But the most recent statements by the US State Department make it clear that stopping Nord Stream 2 is a high priority for US policy makers 
Per a report from RT recently 

 Everything is on the table  The administration is taking a whole of government approach to stopping the Nord Stream project   the source said  as cited by the media 
Last summer  Congress approved the so called Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  CAATSA   The legislation allows the White House to introduce punitive measures against the participants of the energy project  investing over  5 million in those enterprises 
 We have been clear that firms working in the Russian energy export pipeline sector are engaging in a line of business that carries sanctions risk   a State Department spokeswoman told the media 

Since 2014 s imposition of sanctions on Russia over the reunification of Crimea  the US and European Union have played power politics over Europe s future natural gas supplies  Nord Stream 2 is Gazprom s attempt to circumvent problems with Ukraine and its miserable relationship with Natfogaz 
I don t want to go into a detailed history of the situation  because it has been very well covered  To make a long story short  Gazprom has overcome every hurdle placed in front of it to not only resolve lingering issues with the EU s ever changing energy market rules  like the recent settlement of the anti trust suit  but also opposition to Nord Stream 2  And since the project has cleared legal challenges and has been issued all the necessary permits for construction  the only avenue left to its opponents is the naked application of political and economic pressure on its EU partners 
They are five European oil and gas majors   Royal Dutch Shell  OMV  Engie  Wintershall and Uniper  Each of them are potentially exposed to new sanctions imposed by the US for continuing to do business with Gazprom on Nord Stream 2 
Empty Threats
So  why do I believe all of this is simply nothing more than the big bad US huffing and puffing  Because Russia s fiscal situation is such that today it is a brick house rather than a straw one  Unemployment is low  inflation is tamed  GDP is growing  albeit slowly  and loan growth is good  as evidenced by Sberbank s recent earnings report as well as a recent press release from the Bank of Russia 
Mortgage loan growth  year over year  is 20 2  with NPL rates of just 1 3   And there is plenty of room for those numbers to improve  This type of loan growth is impressive despite the Bank of Russia being at least 50 basis points behind the curve 
So  to turn on the heat a little in Russia  another 50 basis point cut would be welcome and accelerate capital inflow by allowing foreign investment at lower costs of capital  The Bank of Russia has been too conservative in its handling of the recovery from 2014 15 s ruble crisis  in my opinion 
And it has hampered Russia s economic recovery  Russian banks are already cut out of US dollar markets  so sanctions on them really do not matter  Any dollars they need they can get through the central bank  which still has  100 billion in US treasury holdings according to the latest Treasury International Capital report or relationships with Chinese banks whom the US dare not sanction 
In the worst case scenario  the five companies listed above all pull out of their deal with Gazprom  it would leave the company needing to re issue the loans locally  Currently  these are loans payable in euros  Converting those loans to Rubles issued through currently stable Russian banks would be trivial with the Bank of Russia providing the needed euro liquidity  We re only talking  4 9 billion here 
Gazprom s latest earnings report was stellar with solid expansion across all verticals  Financially  the company is well positioned to complete each of the three major projects currently under construction   Turkish Stream  Nord Stream 2  and Power of Siberia 
Politics Cuts Both Ways
Nord Stream 2 is too important politically to future Russian European Union relations for it to fall apart at the last minute like South Stream did after US pressure on Bulgaria forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull the project and reroute it through Turkey  resurrected as Turkish Stream 
That miscalculation cost eastern Europe gas supplies it needed for growth as well as billions in transit fees for Bulgaria  That decision cost the Bulgarian government its rule and today s leadership is openly lobbying for a new version of South Stream which Gazprom has not committed to yet  This time  it could be German Chancellor Angela Merkel who would feel the wrath of voters  Germany needs Nord Stream 2  and  if Gazprom s Chairman of the Board Alexander Medvedev is to be taken seriously  Nord Stream 3 as well 
So  if she folds here to Trump s pressure it will likely spell the end of her government within the year  Local anger over her immigration policy as well as serving the EU rather than Germany first puts her chancellorship on shaky ground  And that s before the new government in Italy even makes its first official move 
Speaking of the Italians  the new Prime Minister Guiseppi Conte spooked markets with his inaugural remarks stating bluntly that current EU sanctions on Russia over Crimea need to be lifted  Will he instruct his Foreign Minister to veto their extension in July 
It s very possible  It s also possible that getting another six month extension of those sanctions will be a very serious bargaining chip between Italy  Germany and the US
Merkel has an out here  as I described in a blog post a couple of weeks ago  that could win her a ton of political capital domestically  And given what we just heard from Conte  this is now a very likely course of action 
As investors  if Italy ends the sanctions this will be very positive for Russian assets  It will open up investor floodgates fleeing the uncertainty of both Italian debt restructuring talks  Spain is now waiting in the wings thanks to Mariano Rajoy s ouster from power 
Expect Merkel and Putin to begin seeing eye to eye on ending the conflict in Ukraine again and pushing for commitments from Gazprom to guarantee gas transit through those pipelines after the current contract expires in 2019  Gazprom is a steal at RUB146 per share  or  4 62  It s trading at well below multiples of other oil and gas majors  heavily discounted for perceived political risk 
For US investors  however  a rising dollar will impact the upside in dollar terms as will a drop in oil prices  The markets are anticipating upwards of 1 million barrels to come off the market once new sanctions go on Iran and Trump now wants lower oil prices heading into the midterm elections  So  currency effects could shave five percent off the price  But  all the other positives  both near and long term should outweigh those concerns 
Look at Gazprom over a three to five year investment horizon and layer in a position accordingly  Remember  the firm pays its annual dividend in July so this is always a good time to begin building your stake

5699,227214,ENGIE,Exclusive  India plans new law to protect foreign investment   sources,news,"By Aditi Shah and Aftab Ahmed NEW DELHI  Reuters    India is planning a new law to safeguard foreign investment by speeding up dispute resolution  aiming to attract more capital from overseas to boost stuttering domestic growth  two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  In a 40 page initial draft  India s finance ministry has proposed appointing a mediator and setting up fast track courts to settle disputes between investors and the government  one of the sources said   The idea is to attract and promote foreign investment  but a major issue for investors is enforcement of contracts and speedy dispute resolution   said the official  The draft proposal is aimed at diffusing investor mistrust around the sanctity of agreements  which has worsened recently after some state governments decided to review approved projects  or threatened to cancel contracts  Both officials declined to be named as the proposal is not public  and is still being assessed by different ministries and regulators   A spokesman for the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment  Foreign investors have highlighted the enforcement of contracts as one of their biggest concerns  said the second official  adding that improving on this front would also reduce litigation for the government  While investors can still rely on the existing legal system to settle disputes  it often takes several years for cases to be decided or settled   Investors previously had an option to take India to international arbitration courts under bilateral investment treaties  BITs  the government had agreed with dozens of nations  But  after suffering setbacks in overseas arbitration matters  India has allowed most of its treaties to lapse  giving investors little to fall back on in case of major disputes   BITs are agreements between two countries that give foreign investors protections  and among other things  legal recourse via international arbitration in disputes with a government  India is entangled in more than 20 such overseas arbitration cases   the most against any country   brought by companies including  Vodafone   L VOD   Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and Nissan Motor Co  T 7201  for disputes over retrospective tax claims and breach of contracts   If India loses these cases  brought before most of its BITs lapsed  it could end up paying billions of dollars in damages  The government s thinking is that India may not need to sign investment treaties with other nations if the new law  which is modeled on a BIT  can give confidence to investors  said the first source   A domestic law  however  cannot be a substitute for a BIT as its scope cannot allow investors to take their case to international arbitration  the sources said  CONTRACT WRANGLES  Though India s overall ranking in the World Bank s ease of doing business report has improved to 63 from 142 in 2014  it still ranks poorly   163 out of 190   when it comes to enforcement of contracts  The latest example of a contract wrangle is a dispute between the Andhra Pradesh state government in southern India and renewable energy companies  The state has been curtailing power procurement from the companies  citing high prices  and has pushed to renegotiate its supply contracts with them   Investors including Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Japan s SoftBank Group  T 9984   Singapore s GIC Holdings  the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and France s Engie  PA ENGIE  have invested in renewable projects in the state  The draft proposal for the new law includes a plan to set up an investment tribunal in state high courts that will take up cases as a matter of priority  or will see if the National Company Law Tribunal  NCLT   which also handles insolvency and corporate matters  can handle it   We are yet to evaluate what the risks of bringing such a law are and if it would do more harm than good   said the second source  adding that discussions were at an early stage  The finance ministry has held several meetings with other ministries to discuss the draft law  said the official  The most recent meeting in December was attended by officials from the ministries of commerce  external affairs and law  as well as the banking and stock market regulators  all of whom have been asked to submit their comments  said the first source  It was not immediately clear when the deadline to submit comments is  or when the next meeting will be held  The ministries and regulators did not respond to requests for comment  Pratibha Jain  a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates who advises foreign investors  welcomed the government plans  
 The idea is good and the government should consider broadening the scope to private disputes between foreign investors and domestic companies  as well as arbitrary rule changes by regulators  central bank decisions  and white collar crime cases that impact overseas investment   she added ",2020-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-india-plans-new-law-to-protect-foreign-investment--sources-2059765,2059765

5994,227509,ENGIE,European shares snap three day rally ,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 ends down 1 2 pct
   Pulls back after Tuesday s biggest 1 day gain in 16 mths
   Market seeks clarity over debt crisis

 By Simon Jessop	
 LONDON  Sept 28  Reuters    European shares snapped a
three day winning streak on Wednesday as hopes for imminent
political action to contain the region s debt crisis were capped
by a lack of detail  leaving equities on course to rack up a
fifth straight month of losses 	
 Given the scale of recent gains  however    more than 7
percent    the pullback was relatively muted and in low volume
that showed a lack of willingness among some investors to take
aggressive positions ahead of quarter end  traders said 	
 Financial services led fallers across the region after hedge
fund Man Group   down 25 percent in heavy volume more
than four and a half times its 90 day average  reported large
outflows over the summer  	
 Adding to the sector s woes were proposals for a financial
transaction tax from the European Commission  whose plan for a
0 1 percent tax on stock and bond trades hit exchanges such as
Deutsche Boerse   	
 Elsewhere  the downwards move was led by a fresh slide in
commodities and commodity stocks such as Antofagasta  
down 5 9 percent  and BHP Billiton   down 4 1 percent  on
persistent concern about the growth outlook  	
 For the broader market the focus remains firmly on the twin
macroeconomic headwinds of slowing economic growth and the euro
zone debt crisis 	
 International auditors returned to Greece as Athens looks to
secure the funds needed to avoid a near term default  which
Germany said is needed before any fresh talks over Greece s
second bailout package  	
  The uncertainty is huge in the complex political process
we re seeing played out   said Peter Sullivan  head of equity
strategy for the United States and Europe at HSBC  who
recommends a focus on high yield stocks to counter that
uncertainty 	
 Key to the recent gains has been a belief politicians will
boost the region s bailout fund past the 440 billion euros level
agreed in July    even though this has yet to be signed off by
national parliaments  including in Germany  	
 While there was no simple  smooth path out of the crisis 
 the debate has now moved to  how big does a rescue fund have to
be    where the week before it wasn t even being discussed  So
although we have no concrete news  I think the debate has moved
to a more optimistic outlook   Sullivan said 	
 A London based portfolio trader at a U S  investment bank
said the market had started to  discount away the potential for
a downwards 10 to 15 percent move because of  any  default of
Greece 	
 
 LESS LIKELY	
  The  political  rhetoric coming out seems to have appeased
concerns about that potential outcome  People are less nervous 
Not to say it can t happen  but people believe it as a less
likely outcome   the trader added 	
 By the close  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading
European shares was down 1 2 percent at 927 28 points  after
adding 4 5 percent in the previous session  It remains down 4 1
percent in September and 17 3 percent in 2011 	
 Volumes were low  however  at 84 percent of their 90 day
daily average 	
 In yet another choppy session  defensive sectors and
 quality  stocks were the main winners  along with some
periphery exposed banking stocks that have been heavily sold off
recently 	
 Best off in the broad market retreat from risk were
defensive sectors including healthcare   telecoms 
and utilities   all of which outperformed 	
  The interesting thing is the continuous purchase of
quality  Throughout this move up and move down  quality stocks
continue to outperform  and a lot of defensive stocks actually
screen well for quality  whether it s earnings quality  dividend
yield etc   the portfolio trader said 	
 Alternatively  a short term tactical trade based on earnings
revisions was another good option  said HSBC s Sullivan  as
 earnings downgrades are like the cockroach theory  in that
there s never just one     	
 Didier Duret  global chief investment officer of ABN AMRO
Private Banking  which manages 170 billion euros  was more
optimistic  	
  We are one of the rare birds to have equities on an slight
 overweight  since mid August  The rationale is grounded on the
fact that the risk of global recession is overstated by the
financial markets   he said 
 One key bet is the materials sector  which has been heavily
sold off on the recession fears  but which could bounce sharply 
while Duret also liked consumer staples for their cashflow
qualities  along with high dividend stocks such as GDF Suez
   Vodafone and Sanofi

5996,227511,ENGIE,European shares extend rally on U S  rate pledge ,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 index rises 0 8 percent
   Standard Life leads insurers higher
   Italian banks fall
   Adecco down on margin squeeze

 By Brian Gorman	
 LONDON  Aug 10 Reuters    European shares rose on Wednesday 
boosted by the U S  Federal Reserve promising to keep interest
rates near zero for at least two more years  though some
strategists cautioned that this move indicated a lack of
optimism on economic growth 	
 Shares extended a rally into a second day following a steep
drop that had taken equities into a  bear market   	
 The U S  Federal Reserve on Tuesday took the unprecedented
step of promising to keep interest rates near zero until 2013 
at the earliest  and said it would consider further steps to
help growth  sparking a rebound in stocks  	
  On the one hand it s a good thing as it provides liquidity
and may be a precursor to QE3  The other side is that they are
anticipating the long term underperformance of the economy  
said Ian King head of international equities at Legal   General 
which has 356 billion pounds under management 	
 At 1106 GMT  the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 
index of top shares was up 0 8 percent at 955 88 points  adding
to a 1 2 percent gain on Tuesday  A losing streak in the
previous seven sessions had taken more than 14 percent off the
index  	
  Investors have cut their exposure to risky assets such as
stocks following an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis  the
United States losing its triple A credit rating and weak
economic data from major economies that have sparked concern
they may go back into recession  	
 The index is still down more than 19 percent from its 2011
peak of mid February  Earlier this week  it was down more than
20 percent from this high  which qualifies as a bear market 	
 The fall has made some stocks look cheap  even though
earnings forecasts are being cut  Equity valuations on Thomson
Reuters Datastream showed the STOXX Europe 600 carrying
a one year forward price to earnings of 9 6 against a 10 year
average of more than 13  	
  Yes  markets do look cheap  However  we could have years
and years of low growth to pay back our debts   Louise Cooper 
markets analyst at BGC Partners  said  	
 Positive earnings news also boosted the market on Wednesday 
  British insurer Standard Life surged 12 8 percent after
reporting a bigger than expected 44 percent jump in first half
profit  and said an investment programme that has been
criticised by some analysts and investors was paying off  
 	
 Other insurers to gain included Aviva   and Legal  
General   up 3 5 and 3 4 percent respectively  	
 GDF Suez rose 2 8 percent after the French utility
unveiled first half earnings that beat forecasts 
 	
 Across Europe  Germany s DAX rose 2 2 percent  and
Britain s FTSE 100 and France s CAC40 rose 1 1
and 0 6 percent respectively 	
	
 GROWTH OUTLOOK	
 The Bank of England added to investors  concerns about
growth  cutting its forecasts  By the fourth quarter of 2011 
the BoE now sees an annual rate of growth of 2 0 percent  down
from 2 5 percent in May  	
 L G s Ian King said he expected growth to be  anaemic  but
did not believe there would be a return to recession  though he
said more investors were now pricing in a recession  	
  We were much more optimistic earlier in the year on the
basis that we would see concerted action from policymakers  but
we just haven t seen it  	
 But he pointed to  a successful bond auction in Italy  with
quite a low yield  that s given people some heart  	
 Italy sold 6 5 billion euros of one year T bills on
Wednesday in a sale which analysts said went well after the
European Central Bank s buying of the country s debt earlier
this week brought borrowing costs significantly lower 
 	
 However  Italian banks fell as traders said investors could
be swapping their bank shares into Italian bonds 	
 UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo fell 4
percent and 4 4 percent respectively 	
  Also on the downside  world No  1 staffing company Adecco
 fell 7 3 percent after suffering a margin squeeze in
the first half of 2011 as firms postponed new IT projects 
particularly in the United States

5997,227512,ENGIE,UPDATE 1 Veolia affiliate to quit Moroccan transport deal,news,"  Rabat mayor  financial loss forces Veolia affiliate out
   15 year contract was won in 2009
   Anti Veolia protests planned on Thursday
 
  Adds protest organizer  background 
 By Souhail Karam
 RABAT  April 13  Reuters    Financial losses are forcing
Stareo  an affiliate of French Veolia Environnement  to quit a
contract to operate the bus system in Morocco s capital Rabat 
the city s mayor told Reuters on Wednesday 
 Formed by Veolia Transport and Moroccan groups Bouzid and
Hakam  the Stareo consortium won the contract in 2009  It is
among Veolia affiliates that have been coming under greater
public scrutiny amid a wave of protests in the former French
protectorate 
  Stareo have considered that they are making financial
losses from the operation and they are preparing to leave and we
for our part are getting ready to find a replacement   Fathallah
Oualalou said 
 He was commenting on a report that was first published by
Moroccan news portal Lakome com citing unnamed sources 
 Oualalou noted  however  that Stareo s decision to abandon
the 15 year contract had nothing to do with a planned protest
called by a youth led movement demanding the cancellation of
contracts awarded to Veolia s affiliates in Rabat and the
northern cities of Tangier and Tetouan 
  As far as Stareo is concerned  the firm had to deal with a
legacy of 20 to 30 years of problems that affected public
transportation and those problems could not be brought under
control     They have not been able to respond to the needs of
the sector   said Oualalou 
 Veolia Environnement also has affiliates that have won three
concession contracts to provide water  wastewater and
electricity services managed by Redal for the cities of Rabat
and its twin city Sale and by Amendis for the cities of Tangiers
and Tetouan 
 In a rare occurence  protesters attacked premises linked to
French firms in the Moroccan city of Tangier in February in a
dispute over Amendis management  
 Lydec  affiliated to GDF Suez  provides water and
electricity services in Casablanca  Morocco s biggest city 
Moroccan newspapers have recently been extensively reporting on
a political storm involving the city s council s perceived
silence over poor services provided by the company 
 February 20 Movement  a youth protest movement spearheading
calls for deep political and economic reform in the country  on
Monday announced plans for protests to demand that Stareo  Redal
and Amendis contracts be cancelled for allegedly short changing
the final users 
  Redal and Amendis  tarriffs are the highest in Morocco yet
whenever it rains we end up with floods  They also don t clean
the poor districts of Rabat and Sale  Children there play in the
middle of garbage   said Najib Chawki  a member of the February
20 movement 
  We are protesting against all Veolia s affiliates in
Morocco  When we look at those firms and Lydec  we can t help
but wonder if there is some form of economic corruption going
on   Chawki said 
 The February 20 Movement is  not against the presence of
French firms in the country 
  We want any relations to be based on transparency and not
on the basis of privileges and the extorsion of our country in
exchange for political support  The French tutorship over
Morocco must end   he added

6016,227531,ENGIE,EDF  rivals have not agreed nuclear price  producers,news,"PARIS  Oct 22  Reuters    The French electricity producers 
Association  UFE  denied a press report that state owned 
utility EDF had agreed with its rivals on prices at which it
would supply them with nuclear electricity to bolster
competition 
The economic daily Les Echos newspaper said on Thursday that
the parties had agreed that  as of 2010  EDF s rivals could buy
electricity from the former monopoly s nuclear power plants at
about 34 euros   50 90  per megawatt hour  a price that would
gradually increase to 55 60 euros until 2020 
  The UFE denies the information of Les Echos newspaper which
says that an agreement had taken place in the sector on a price
level   the Union Francaise de l Electricite said in a
statement 
 The government last month announced it wanted to reform the
French market to foster more competition  in line with European
Union demands  
 The market has been fully liberalised since July 2007 but
EDF still owns all of France s 58 nuclear reactor  which provide
an 80 percent share in overall electricity consumption 
 Competitors such as Poweo or GDF Suez are struggling to
attract clients because they do not have access to baseload
electricity output 
 The government reform plan includes ending state set
electricity tariffs for industries by 2015 and allowing rival
power suppliers to buy nuclear generated nuclear power at
production cost 
 A UFE spokeswoman said it was not part of the body s remit
to decide on a price level but up to the government 
  We are discussing a general industrial framework but it is
absolutely not up to us to decide on a price level   she said

   French utilities drop on price restrictions
   Siemens falls after warning second half may be slower
 By Brian Gorman
 LONDON  April 5  Reuters    European shares edged up to
their highest close in nearly four weeks on Tuesday  with energy
firms gaining after further unrest in the Middle East pushed
crude prices to a two and a half year high 
  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0 2
percent to 1 143 94 points  the highest close since March 9 
Volumes were 94 percent of the index s 90 day average 
 Brent crude topped  122  and hit its highest in two and a
half years  as the prospect of a stalemate prolonging the loss
of 1 3 million barrels a day of exports from Libya loomed  amid
unsuccessful efforts to end the war and as clashes over the oil
town of Brega intensified 
 Energy firms to gain included Total  BP and BG  up between
0 4 percent and 1 2 percent 
 The pan European index is up 7 2 percent from a mid March
low  as investors focus more on the strength of the economic
recovery  confident it will not be significantly affected by
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa  or Japan s nuclear
crisis  
 Analysts said shares could gain further  even as monetary
policy tightens  including an expected rise in European Central
Bank interest rates this week  China s central bank raised
interest rates for the second time this year on Tuesday 
redoubling efforts to cool stubborn price pressures 
  Equities will be the preferred choice   the price bubble in
bonds is about to burst   yields are not going to stay as low as
they are   said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research  in
Frankfurt 
 He added that he expected construction related stocks to be
among those outperforming  as they look to help with rebuilding
projects in Japan 
 Growth in the vast U S  services sector slowed last month
and price pressures eased slightly  according to an industry
report released on Tuesday  but overall activity expanded for a
16th straight month 
 But Ruland noted the continued growth in the employment
component  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in the previous
month  
 Tech shares firmed  after Texas Instruments late on
Monday offered to buy National Semiconductor in a deal worth
 6 5 billion  a premium of 78 percent 
 Infineon Technologies rose 3 9 percent  while
STMicroelectronics added 2 9 percent 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 fell 0 2 percent 
Germany s DAX and France s CAC40 were flat 
 Portugal s benchmark fell 1 percent and Spain s IBEX fell
0 7 percent  
 Euro zone peripheral issues persisted  pushing bond yields
in certain countries higher  
 Portuguese bond yields hit fresh euro lifetime highs on
Tuesday and were expected to top 10 percent in the next few days
as a new credit rating downgrade added to pressure on the
country to seek aid 
 
 FRENCH UTILITIES FALL       
 French utilities EDF and GDF Suez fell 3 7 and 1 9 percent
respectively after France cancelled a planned increase in gas
prices and cut the size of electricity price hikes to appease
public discontent with rising energy costs 
 Among other individual shares  German conglomerate Siemens
 fell 1 3 percent after it said it expected business to slow in
the coming months 
 Bayer fell 3 6 percent after a late stage trial showed its
anti blood clotting Xarelto pill failed to benefit patients bed
ridden due to acute illness 
   The Euro STOXX 50  the euro zone s blue chip index  fell
0 2 percent to 2 950 96  
 Analysts said while the short term technical picture for the
STOXX 50 index had improved following gains in the previous
sessions  the index was looking relatively overbought 
  The latest price action shows that it could be encountering
resistance in the form of its 50 day moving average  It is
possible that selling pressures could develop at these levels  
said Bill McNamara  technical analyst at Charles Stanley 
 Some caution prevailed ahead of the release of the Federal
Open Market Committee s minutes from its March 15 meeting  due
at 1800 GMT  for insight on the outlook for U S  interest rates

 By Brian Gorman
 LONDON  Aug 26  Reuters    European shares slipped back from
a 10 month closing high on Wednesday  as investors took profits 
even as German and U S  economic data continued to point to
recovery 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares fell
0 5 percent to close at 973 92 points  breaking a four day
winning streak  and having hit its highest close since early
October on Tuesday 
 The European benchmark index is still up 50 9 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9  as investors have become more
confident on the prospects of recovery  
  The market has come a long way  and the economics are still
supportive   said Georgina Taylor  equity strategist  Legal

  We re just seeing a little profit taking  Nothing has been
derailed  Housing data is improving  The only area of concern is

 BG Group  BP  Repsol and Total were between 0 9 and 2 3
percent lower 
 UK based oil explorer Tullow Oil fell 3 9 percent after it
said interim profits dropped 83 percent on lower oil prices and

 Other economics news was mostly upbeat  Sales of newly built
U S  single family homes rose in July to their fastest pace in
10 months  while orders for long lasting manufactured goods
surged  hinting a modest economic recovery was taking shape 
 However  some investors chose to focus on orders excluding
transportation climbing slightly less than forecast 
 Back in Europe  the business climate index of Germany s Ifo 
a Munich based think tank  rose to 90 5 from an upwardly revised
87 4 in July 
  The Ifo figures did not have a momentum effect  despite
them being very good  But one also has to acknowledge that the
markets are moving on high levels and that people may be
following the strategy of  selling on good news     said Joerg
Rahn  chief investment officer at wealth management company

 PARIS  Aug 26  Reuters    Suez Environnement cut its 2009
sales and core earnings targets but shares rallied as the French
utility group reported forecast topping first half profit
despite a sharp drop in waste business 
 The world s second biggest water and waste management group
behind Veolia said on Wednesday it now expected overall
stability in 2009 sales and earnings before interest  tax 
depreciation and amortisation  EBITDA  at constant exchange
rates 
 Suez Environnement  suffering from reduced demand for waste
treatment as industrial and commercial clients cut production 
had previously forecast slightly higher sales and core earnings 
 The stock was up 8 6 percent to a nine month peak of 14 16
euros at 0952 GMT as analysts welcomed the results and said the
outlook downgrade was expected given that the group had
previously based its forecasts on a drop of only 2 percent in
gross domestic product in mature economies  The International
Monetary Fund has forecast a 3 8 percent GDP fall in advanced
economies in 2009 
  We think these results are marginally better than bearish
expectations  It supports our view that Suez Environnement is a
more stable company than Veolia   said analyst Per Lekander 
 Earlier this month  Veolia reported a bigger than expected
drop in half year profit but kept its financial targets for the
full year 
 Suez Environnement reported half year EBITDA of 951 million
euros   1 36 billion   down 4 2 percent at constant exchange
rates  on sales down 1 2 percent at 5 87 billion  while net
profit reached 175 million against 201 million a year earlier 
 This beat average forecasts for EBITDA of 934 million euros
and net profit of 144 million from a Reuters poll of analysts as
strong performances in European water business and international
division helped make up for a poor results in European waste 
 Chief Executive Jean Louis Chaussade said a better
second half performance and increased cost cutting efforts would
help the group  cope with a difficult economic environment  
 In the first half of 2009  Suez Environnement  which was
spun off from GDF Suez in July 2008  achieved 49 million euros
of the 180 million of cost savings it is targeting for 2008
through 2010  Chaussade said  adding he expected the group to
meet the 180 million euro goal  sooner than expected  
 
 LOWER WASTE MANAGEMENT
 Core earnings at Suez Environnement s European water unit
were up 10 4 percent at 420 million euros after new contracts in
Spain and France  while the international business generated
profit of 197 million euros  up 4 6 percent year on year 
 But EBITDA at its European waste unit were down 17 8 percent
at 368 million euros as the economic downturn led many
industrial clients to cut production and sometimes close plants 
reducing their waste volumes 
 Despite the worse economic environment  the waste sector
remains attractive in the long term thanks to stricter
environmental regulation and new waste recovery technologies 
Suez Environnement said 
 Analysts have said that a lack of recovery in the waste
industry has hindered share gains for sector leaders Veolia and
Suez Environnement  whose stocks have underperformed the
European utility index since the start of the year 
 Chaussade ruled out making acquisitions in 2009 but said he
expected new opportunities for deals to arise as soon as the
economic crisis ended 
  We ll try to build on where we are already strong and in
businesses were we are already present  Since 80 percent of our
business is in Europe and that we are strong in water in Britain
and Australia  you can see where our priorities are   Chaussade
said

   Power demand down  revs up from acquisitions
   Chairman says no change to div policy
 
  releads with chairman comments on EDF Enel deal 
 MILAN  Aug 6  Reuters    Italy s A2A SpA was  upset  by a
deal on nuclear business between rival Enel and EDF  its French
partner in Edison  the utility s chairman said on Thursday 
  The deal between Enel and EDF took us by surprise and upset
us a bit   Giuliano Zuccoli told a conference call with analysts
after the company turned in an 18 9 percent drop in first half
net profit 
  Our relationship with EDF is positive  but we are in the
situation today to watch closely the need for some key
interventions on Edison itself   he said 
 A2A and EDF jointly control Edison  which is Italy s
second biggest power producer behind Enel 
 Earlier this week  EDF and Enel set up a joint venture to
develop nuclear power in Italy 
 There has been media speculation in recent months that A2A
would like a change in the Edison ownership structure in order
to get more synergies from its ownership of Edison 
 First half results for A2A  Italy s biggest
municipally owned utility  reflected falling demand  triggered
by Italy s worst economic downturn since World War II 
 Other European utilities have also felt the impact of the
global downturn on power consumption 
 Spain s Iberdrola said it expected domestic power demand to
recover in the fourth quarter when it reported a 23 percent fall
in first half net profit last month 
 Germany s E ON and RWE will report in August  as will
France s GDF Suez 
 A2A reported an 8 1 percent downturn in power sales while
overall revenues were up 2 7 percent  boosted by the purchase of
French district heating company Coriance and Aspem  a Varese
power company 
 Net profit was 129 million euros but excluding the effect of
a tax repayment for state aid  net profit was 185 million euros 
up 16 4 percent from the same period last year 
 Zuccoli said he expected a full year result in line with
previous forecasts made at the start of the year 
 On dividend policy  he said this was tailored for a
 reasonable  scenario and  going forward we don t believe the
scenario will worsen  There is still the crisis but we don t see
it worsening any more   he said 
 A2A shares closed down 5 38 percent at 1 231 euros  The DJ
Stoxx utilities gauge was down 0 66 percent

6048,227563,ENGIE,EU s Kroes to target pharma  energy  tech breaches,news,"BRUSSELS  July 17  Reuters    European Union authorities 
which recently imposed hefty fines on chipmaker Intel and
utilities E ON and GDF Suez  intend to increase pressure on
these sectors  the EU s antitrust chief said on Friday 
 The European Commission  tasked with ensuring fair play in
the 27 country European Union  will also target erring
drugmakers and transport companies that breach EU antitrust
rules  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said 
  You will see us continuing to look deeply at key sectors
such as pharmaceuticals  energy  transport and technology   she
said in the text of a speech to be delivered at an Irish think
tank in Dublin 
 Kroes levied a total of 1 1 billion euros   1 55 billion  in
fines on E ON and GDF Suez last week  the first antitrust
penalties on European utilities  for secretly carving up
national gas markets 
 This followed a 1 06 billion euro penalty on Intel in May
for illegal efforts to squeeze out archrival AMD  marking the
biggest antitrust fine on a single company 
 Kroes last week signalled her determination to crack down on
drugmakers suspected of fixing deals with generics producers to
hold back cheap medicines  saying probes were under way 
 The Commission is investigating privately owned French
drugmaker Servier and a number of generics firms over the issue 
  We would do no favours to the economy by going soft on
enforcement  If anything  anti competitive activities  such as
cartels  hurt consumers and the economy more in the bad times

 We will not hesitate to take action where there is clear
evidence of a problem   she said

6050,227565,ENGIE,PREVIEW Eni dividend policy under scrutiny at Q2  analysts,news,"MILAN  July 24  Reuters    Eni s dividend policy will be
under scrutiny along with second quarter results on Thursday as
divestment risks have heightened concerns over the Italian oil
group s balance sheet  analysts said 
 On Tuesday  Eni affiliate Snam Rete Gas said GDF Suez would
not go ahead with plans to buy Rome gas grid Romana Gas  valued
at around 1 1 billion euros  placing a question mark over the
sale of the asset 
  Our  sell  rating on Eni is based on our view that the
group s balance sheet is stretched and that as such it will be
difficult for the company to deliver both growth and a
meaningful yield at the same time   Societe Generale said in a
note dated July 22 
 The broker added that GDF Suez pulling out of the Romana Gas
deal has put the issue firmly back on the agenda 
 Eni  which fully consolidates Snam s results  sought to sell
the grid to GDF Suez as part of a 2008 deal to acquire Belgian
gas company Distrigas 
  GDF Suez s decision to pull out     is likely  in our view 
to resurrect concerns over Eni s dividend   Barclays Capital
said in a note on Thursday 
 However the broker said dividend concerns were overdone and
forecast the group would pay a flat dividend on the year of 1 3
euros even if the divestment does not occur 
 The broker said a failed divestment of Romana Gas would
directly impact Eni s gearing by about 2 percentage points to
bring it to 37 percent by year end  adding it expects an interim
dividend of 0 65 euros per share 
 A Reuters consensus of nine analysts  which sees Eni s
adjusted second quarter net profit at an average of 938 million
euros   1 33 billion   pegged the interim dividend for 2009 at
0 65 euros per share  in line with the previous year 
 But Barclays noted the European dividend swap option market
is pricing Eni s 2009 dividend at 1 0 euros per share  which
could suggest an interim dividend of just 0 35 0 45 
  A lot depends on the oil price   a Milan analyst said 
  A priority for Eni is to maintain a strong credit rating 
The Romana Gas development raises a question  A lot depends on
how far they want to stick to their target of a debt to equity
gearing of below 0 40   he said 
 In its statement on Tuesday  Snam Rete Gas said it reserves
the right to take measures to protect its interests with regard
to the Romana Gas deal 
 Eni s dividend policy is based on a relative yield 
Management has said the 2009 dividend will offer a superior
yield defined as the highest or second highest of the oil
majors 
 Eni will present second quarter and first half results on
Thursday  followed by a conference call with management

  Adds shares  earnings abroad 
 By Peter Dinkloh
 FRANKFURT  Aug 12  Reuters    E ON  the world s largest
utility  on Wednesday reported earnings that beat market
forecasts  helped by higher profits from household customers in
the United States and its pan European energy trading unit 
 The German power provider joined major European peers such
as France s EDF  Italy s Enel and Britain s International Power
 in surprising investors with better than expected results 
 A number of European utilities have benefited from strong
earnings abroad while lower demand due to the economic crisis
and higher fuel costs has pressured margins in their home
markets 
 E ON also tweaked its 2009 outlook higher  saying it now
sees net income falling 5 to 10 percent rather than 10 percent
as interest payments and taxes will be lower than expected 
 The German utility s adjusted earnings before interest and
taxes  EBIT  dropped 1 percent to 5 7 billion euros   8 1
billion  in the first six months of the year  beating a 5 5
billion euro average of estimates from 14 analysts in a Reuters
poll  It said its still sees 2009 EBIT unchanged from 2008 
 Shares in the nine year old utility rose 3 5 percent to
26 70 euros at 0808 GMT  the strongest riser on a DJ Stoxx
utilities index that gained 1 1 percent and on a little changed
German benchmark DAX

 E ON is trying to catch up with competitors as it struggles
to earn money from 18 billion euros worth of acquisitions made

of its peers and improve the performance of its shares 
 Its stock has dropped 33 percent in the past 12 months 
while the DJ Stoxx utilities dropped 30 percent and DAX 17

per share for the coming 12 months  the seventh lowest valuation
among 33 European peers according to Thomson Reuters StarMine

 FRANKFURT  Aug 12  Reuters    Germany s E ON  the world s
largest utility  said it saw signs that demand for energy was
stabilising after a prolonged slump  and tweaked its 2009
outlook higher after first half profits beat forecasts 
 The recession has cut power consumption rates  notably among
industrial users  and several European utilities have said in
recent weeks they expect the downtrend to continue 
 But E ON said on Wednesday it saw  the first signs that
power demand contraction is abating  especially in North West
Europe   echoing a rare positive prediction from Spain s
Iberdrola  which said last month it expected domestic usage
rates to recover in the fourth quarter 
  E ON seems to be benefiting from the strength of its
industrial customer base   said Matthias Wilpert  who helps
manage 62 billion euros at Commerzbank s Cominvest fund
management unit 
 The energy provider  Germany s second largest company by
market capitalisation  said better profits from domestic
customers in the United States and higher margins at its
pan European energy trading unit also gave a boost to earnings 
 It now sees full year net income falling 5 10 percent rather
than 10 percent as interest payments and taxes will be lower
than expected 
 Shares in the nine year old utility rose 4 7 percent to
27 01 euros at 1221 GMT  the strongest riser on a DJ Stoxx
utilities index that gained 1 6 percent and the German benchmark
DAX  which was up 0 8 percent 
 
 DOWNTURN TO CONTINUE 
 Other large power firms in Europe  including Edison  are
bracing investors for the downturn to continue  Italy s Enel has
predicted the hard slog will last through next year 
 Utilities remain pessimistic even though many    including
France s EDF  Enel and Britain s International Power    have
surprised investors with better than expected results 
 E ON s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT 
dropped 1 percent to 5 7 billion euros   8 1 billion   beating a
5 5 billion euro average of estimates from 14 analysts in a
Reuters poll  It said its still sees 2009 EBIT flat versus 2008 
 
 PLAYING CATCH UP
 E ON also said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell its Thuega
unit  which groups minority stakes in German utilities  to a
consortium of local firms for around 2 9 billion euros in cash 
though Germany s antitrust watchdog said it expected the deal to
be subject to an extended review 
 Reuters had reported last week that E ON was set to divest
the unit

after first half profits beat forecasts 
  For the reminder of this year  this kind of profitability
story is the main driver for people to revise next year s
earnings forecasts higher and that s positive for the market  
said Franz Wenzel  strategist at AXA Investment Managers 
  Equity markets could easily go higher by about 5 percent in
the short term   he added 
 The DJ STOXX European Utilities Index was among the top
sectoral gainers  up 2 6 percent  GDF SUEZ  Centrica  RWE and
Severn Trent advanced between 1 percent and 4 3 percent 
 Financial stocks were also among significant gainers ahead
of the outcome of the U S  Federal Reserve s policy setting
committee meeting at 1815 GMT  which is expected to hold its
benchmark overnight rate in a range of zero to 0 25 percent 
 The DJ STOXX banking index was up 1 3 percent  while
Barclays  Royal Bank of Scotland  BNP Paribas and Natixis rose
between 2 1 and 5 4 percent 
  I don t think you are going to get anything negative out of
the Fed today  What you want to see is a central bank that is
not going to take any risks on the deflationary side and
withdraw policy earlier   said Bernard McAlinden  a strategist
at NCB Stockbrokers 
 UBS AG gained 3 1 percent after news that the Swiss bank and
the U S  government have agreed to settle a long running dispute

sell the bulk of its Insight Investment unit to Bank of New York

 EUPHORIA
 Investors digested a slew of economic news  The Bank of
England said Britain s worst recession in decades would end
early next year  but it would take time for the gross domestic
product  GDP  to return to pre crisis levels  pushing
unemployment up from the current 13 year high 
  There is a kind of euphoria starting to build in  The
markets are ignoring negative news and much more focusing on
positive news   Wenzel said 
 The U S  trade deficit widened in June to  27 billion  as
goods imports rose for the first time in 11 months  and euro
zone industrial output fell in June against May  defying
expectations of a small rise 
 Commodity shares were in demand as crude and metals prices

 LONDON  Aug 25  Reuzters    European shares fell on Tuesday

profits  while miners came under pressure after metals fell on
worries that prices may have risen too high 
 At 1111 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was 0 3 percent lower at 972 19 points after hitting its
highest close since early October on Monday  The index  which

 Natixis asked for trading in its shares to be suspended
after a newspaper reported its owner  French retail bank Groupe
BPCE  would guarantee billions of euros of toxic assets at the
bank 
 Analysts remained positive about the near term trend 
especially because of the improving macroeconomic picture  Data
showed Germany s economy exited recession in the second quarter
and grew by 0 3 percent 
  If a sustained recovery is a genuine belief  pullbacks will
be bought into as opposed to it being an opportunity for the
bears to cash in   said Brian Myers  analyst at ODL Securities 
 Equity markets ignored U S  President Barak Obama s
reappointment of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for a
second term to steer the world s largest economy out of its
deepest downturn since the Great Depression 
 But analysts said that the news had removed an element of
uncertainty in the market 
 Utilities shares also lost ground  with Hera  E ON  GDF Suez

  People should be cautious in selecting sectors and
companies  They need to go back to fundamentals  they need to go
back to appraise valuations and make sure that they have a well

  There is still potential in the stock market  A lot of cash

winning run on Wednesday 
 The index is up 16 7 percent this year  and has surged more
than 50 percent from a lifetime trough set in March and analysts
are confident that further gains are in store 
  The trend of the last few weeks looks set to continue  if
not at the same pace   said Lars Kreckel  equity strategist at
Exane BNP Paribas 
  A lot of people are still under invested in equities and
are looking to push back into them which should ensure shares
won t see any downside     as long as data stays positive

 But Dexia  bailed out by several European governments last
year  shed 6 4 percent after saying late on Wednesday that its
restructuring was proceeding well as it posted its second
consecutive quarterly profit  HSBC and Barclays also fell 
 
 MIXED SIGNALS
 However  while equities were steady  other signals pointed
to a return to concern about the state of the global economy 
 Japan s yen  which tends to gain at times of economic
adversity  strengthened to its highest level in more than a
month against the dollar and sterling while Japan s Nikkei fell
1 6 percent 
 Analysts said that investors fretted that a rally in risk
assets since March may have run ahead of a recovery in the
global economy and on worries about the outlook for Chinese
shares  which eased 0 7 percent 
 But in Europe the outlook seems to be brighter  
 German consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in 15
months heading into September  the GfK market research group
said  as lower prices and a stable labour market left consumers
more willing to spend 
  Investors will watch U S  Q2 GDP data and jobless claims

 By Joanne Frearson
 LONDON  Aug 27  Reuters    European shares closed lower for
the second consecutive day on Thursday  after a choppy session
in which banking stocks retreated from earlier gains and
chemical makers slipped 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 0 5 percent at 968 67 points after being up as much as
976 79 points earlier in a session that saw the index jump
around after U S  gross domestic product  GDP  and jobless
claims data were released 
 The U S  GDP figures were not as bad as expected   said
Peter Dixon  an economist at Commerzbank   Markets have
demonstrated a lot of volatility in recent days and I think
markets will see saw on the back of good and bad news  
  U S  jobless figures were a little bit worse than expected 
but still were an improvement on the previous week  These
numbers are volatile and I would not want to base any kind of
assessment on these numbers   Dixon said 
 U S  jobless claims fell last week to 570 000  slightly
above the 565 000 predicted by analysts 
 Data also showed that the U S  economy contracted at an
annualised rate of 1 0 percent in the second quarter  the same
as its initial reading  Analysts had predicted a downwardly
revised reading of  1 5 percent 
 Banks reversed from earlier gains to feature among the worst
performers  HSBC  Deutsche Bank  Dexia  Lloyds Banking Group and
Royal Bank of Scotland were down 0 8 to 7 8 percent 
 However  Credit Agricole gained 3 7 percent after it posted
better than expected  second quarter profit and said  its
businesses were well placed despite the tough economic
environment 
 
 BAYER FALLS
 Chemical stocks were lower  German drugmaker Bayer fell 4 1

Ingelheim may report strong data about its rival drug to Bayer s
anti blood clotting pill Xarelto 
  Some people are getting worried  that Boehringer Ingelheim 
will report data on a drug that is the most serious competitor
to Xarelto   a local Frankfurt based trader said 
 Mining stocks slipped as copper lost 0 1 percent 
Antofagasta  Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation  Rio Tinto
and Xstrata were 0 4 to 4 1 lower 
 Beverages were among the big losers on the index  Diageo was
down 4 1 percent after it warned recovery would come in 2010 at
the earliest  prompting it to cut its growth target after it met
forecasts with a 10 percent rise in annual earnings 
 On the upside  utilities were the top performers  French
power and gas group GDF Suez gained 2 percent after it said it
was confident it would meet its earnings targets despite the
weaker economy that has reduced demand for energy as it
predicted better trading by year end 
 A Reuters poll has shown leading investors have kept their
portfolios steady in August  as the northern summer doldrums and
caution about how far the global equity market rally can go led
many to sit back and wait     Across Europe  the FTSE 100 index

 By Tyler Sitte
 FRANKFURT  June 17  Reuters    Stock markets will likely
correct by year end as they retreat slightly from recent gains
and investors should favour defensive stocks  higher cash
positions and bonds  experts from Sal  Oppenheim said on
Wednesday 
 The investment bank  which has total assets of around 41
billion euros   56 83 billion  and is one of Europe s largest
independent banking groups  said its new outlook for the second
half of the year broke from its early forecast and it was now
more conservative than the market consensus 
  The lion s share of the world economy is still in a
recession  The mid term term growth outlook is moderate at best
as it will likely take several years to work off imbalances  
said Dieter Pfundt  personally liable partner and head of
investment banking at Sal  Oppenheim 
 Matthias Joerss  head of the bank s equity strategy team 
said the  spring fairy tale   which supported equity markets
earlier this year would likely lose momentum by summer 
  The second half of the year will be characterised by a
period of volatile corrections and lateral movement   Joerss
said  pointing to likely further downward revisions in company
earnings estimates and continued overcapacity 
 While Germany s blue chip DAX index may temporarily move as
high as 5 300 5 500 points in 2009  Joerss sees the index ending
the year in a band of 4 500 4 800 points 
 The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 index of the top 50 European large
caps will likely move between 2 100 and 2 700 points throughout
the second half of the year and close out 2009 in a range
between 2 250 2 400 points  Joerss added 
 
 TRANSPARENCY IMPORTANT IN PICKS
  The rebound seen by banking stocks  cyclicals  and capital
goods will likely run its course and there will be a return to
defensive stocks  including healthcare  consumer goods 
telecoms  food stuffs and utilities   Joerss said 
 Among European large caps  Sal  Oppenheim s recommendations
include Allianz  Bayer  Credit Agricole  GDF Suez  RWE and
Philips as part of a defensive portfolio 
 The bank views a highly visible business model and high
dividend payout as important factors for equity picks 
 For German small and mid caps  the bank prefers Aareal Bank
  drug supplier Celesio  retail bank Deutsche Postbank 
technology group Gea  biotech testing specialist Qiagen and
internet service provider United Internet 
 
 INVESTORS SETTLE FOR LOWER RETURNS
 The bank also suggested that at least in the mid term
investors might have to remain content with lower returns 
  Our clients used to ask how they could achieve  returns on
investment  of 10 percent plus  These days investors are asking 
 How can I keep the value of my investment stable   Under these
conditions an investor who sees a return of 5 percent is
satisfied   Pfundt said 
 The bank recommends higher cash allocations and investments
in liquid government bonds to help weather difficult markets 
 Corporate bonds might also be enticing for investors 
  The corporate bond market is a main competitor to the
equity market and as long as spreads remain where they are this
will continue   Pfundt said 
 A commonly held view that stocks are undervalued was not
entirely accurate  the bank contends 
  Valuations might look attractive  but estimates for 2010
are still much too high   Joerss said 
  On the other hand  we can t really say the market is
overvalued  because that would mean using company earnings
during a recession as a yardstick to determine value  
 Instead  Sal Oppenheim sees a gradual return to historical
profit levels which are somewhere between these two extremes

6070,227585,ENGIE,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 GDF Suez wind unit slams France  looks abroad,news,"  Sees diversification abroad in face of French standstill
   Says turbine prices down 25 30 percent from 2008 highs
   Sees GDF Suez increasing 57 percent stake via rights
issues
 
  Adds details  background 
 By Marie Maitre and Benjamin Mallet
 PARIS  June 25  Reuters    France s Compagnie du Vent may
look abroad to develop its wind power business as political
barriers make projects difficult to push through in its domestic
market  the head of the GDF Suez subsidiary said 
  Despite positive statements  on wind power  from the
president  Nicolas Sarkozy  and members of Parliament    on the
ground it doesn t work at all   said Chief Executive Jean Michel
Germa  who founded Compagnie du Vent in 1989  told Reuters at a
small and mid cap energy forum in Paris 
  The French wind power industry has been completely
decimated by a de facto moratorium on the ground as local
authorities deliver close to no building permits and lobbies are
attacking these permits   he said  also citing a draft law that
could classify wind parks as polluting equipment 
 said Germa who founded Compagnie du Vent in 1989 
 He also said that the banks would not finance equipment with
a building permit that could be annulled by a court 
  The situation is completely blocked and there is no
recognition by the government of the importance of developing
wind power   he said 
 French utility GDF Suez owns 57 percent of Compagnie du Vent
and Germa holds the rest  Compagnie du Vent  which competes with
EDF Energies Nouvelles  operates 15 wind parks in France 
representing a production of 175 megawatts  MW   and has built
60 MW for third parties in Morocco 
 Compagnie du Vent  which is based in Montpellier  southern
France  and had sales of 16 8 million euros   23 64 million  in
2008  targets installed wind power capacity of 2 000 MW by 2015 
 
 GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION
 Faced with a difficult situation that could compromise
France s efforts to ensure that 20 percent of its power
consumption comes from renewable energies by 2020  Germa said
Compagnie du Vent could decide to stop investing in France 
  We either stand like soldiers on the navigation bridge
looking at the ship sinking or    we redeploy in the rest of the
world   Germa said   What the French administration doesn t want
for France  many other countries are eager to get it  
 Germa declined to say which countries he was targeting  but
he said the company was looking at  the whole world  and could
rely on the international presence of GDF Suez for its
development abroad 
  This diversification will be made organically   he said 
 The cost of developing wind farms has decreased thanks to a
fall in turbine prices  which Germa estimated are 25 percent to
30 percent cheaper than they were in 2008 
 Germa also said that financing needs to develop Compagnie du
Vent s wind power portfolio and reach its 2015 capacity target
would lead to changes in the company s shareholding structure 
  If we build 2 000 MW  we roughly need 2 to 2 5 billion
euros  And you know that about 15 to 20 percent of the financing
of wind power projects is made on equity  meaning we need 400
million to 500 million euros in capital to build new projects  
he said 
  What will likely happen is that the company s capital will
be increased depending on funding needs and GDF Suez will follow
it but not Germa   Germa said  saying rights issues will be made
when needed but giving no details on a timing ",2009-06-25,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/equities-news/interview-update-1-gdf-suez-wind-unit-slams-france,-looks-abroad-66115",66115

6074,227589,ENGIE,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 GDF Suez rules out M A  eyes organic growth,news,"  Has raised around 10 bln euros in debt since Oct
   2008 10 capex plan of 30 bln euros unchanged
   Confirms seeking land in Britain for 2 nuclear reactors
 
 AIX EN PROVENCE  France  July 3  Reuters    GDF Suez will
not use the billions of euros it has raised in the debt market
since October to fund acquisitions and will continue to focus on
organic growth  its chief said on Friday 
 Asked by Reuters if GDF Suez was looking for acquisitions 
Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet said 
  No  We haven t changed  We are keeping the same strategy 
We have not increased our level of investment  It is 30 billion
euros and this programme is fundamentally based on organic
growth  
 Mestrallet was talking on the sidelines of an economic forum
in southern France 
 Asked if GDF Suez could change its mind should an attractive
opportunity arise  Mestrallet said   This is not in our
projects  We are very relaxed on that  
 GDF Suez  born of the merger of Gaz de France and Suez a
year ago  has raised nearly 10 billion euros in several bond
issues since October  fuelling speculation it may be ready to
pounce on a target 
 Mestrallet also confirmed that GDF Suez aimed to build two
new generation nuclear reactors in Britain 
  We are looking for land that could welcome two EPR
reactors   he said 
 A consortium of GDF Suez  Iberdrola and Scottish   Southern
Energy made no purchases at an auction of nuclear power sites
run by Britain s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in April 
after being outbid by other European utilities 
 In May  Iberdrola said it was interested in buying land
owned by EDF Energy that could be used to build new nuclear
plants 
 Mestrallet said GDF Suez was not currently in talks with EDF
over the land that EDF wants to sell back 
  There are no negotiations  I am not even sure that the
process has been formally launched   Mestrallet said

 By Peter Starck
FRANKFURT  July 3  Reuters    European stocks fell on
Friday  recording their third straight week of losses  led by
utilities  oil   gas and basic resources while banks and media
pulled in the opposite direction 
 Volumes were thin in the absence of U S  market participants
due to the extended Fourth of July weekend 
  With U S  markets closed today for the Independence Day
holidays we have seen the major indexes lack direction   CMC
Markets said in a note 
  Major stock specific stories have also been hard to come by
today   CMC Markets added 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0 1 percent
lower at 842 52 points  It lost 0 2 percent over the week and
has fallen 5 1 percent since its five month high close on June
11 
 Utilities shaved most points off the index on Friday  EDF
fell 4 5 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating to
 equal weight  from  overweight   UBS and Citigroup trimmed
their price target on the EDF stock 
 Also in the sector  E ON dropped 1 2 percent and GDF Suez
lost 0 6 percent 
 Weaker oil and copper prices weighed on oil   gas and basic
resources stocks amid renewed doubts about the outlook for
economic growth triggered by weaker than expected U S  June jobs
data on Thursday 
 Banks added the most points  with Barclays up 2 8 percent 
Banco Santander gaining 2 2 percent  BNP Paribas adding 2
percent  HSBC rising 1 7 percent and Deutsche Bank putting on
1 7 percent 
 Media stocks advanced after Credit Suisse upgraded the
European sector to  overweight  from  underweight   The DJ Stoxx
media index rose 0 5 percent 
 Wolters Kluwer jumped 4 3 percent and Reed Elsevier climbed
3 9 percent 
 The DJ EuroSTOXX 50 index of European blue chips squeezed in
a gain of 0 3 percent to 2 376 48 points 
 BayernLB chartists saw support at 2 350 points  saying in a
technical analysis note that a break below that level would
spark a clear  sell  signal 
 
 WEEK AHEAD
 Europe s top 300 index rose 35 percent between March 9 and
June 11  as improving sentiment indicators buoyed economic
recovery hopes  but has traded choppily in a narrow range since 
 Strategists said that picture was unlikely to change much in
the week ahead 
  Next week brings too little quantitative or qualitative
data to give stock markets any decisive direction   said LBBW
investment analyst Michael Kohler 
 Ad van Tiggelen  senior strategist at ING Investment
Management  said  the road ahead will be bumpy for risky assets 
such as equities  and LandesBank Berlin said stock market
fundamentals remained fragile 
  We don t want to rule out further setbacks  Nonetheless  we
assume that many investors will exploit an eventual temporary
weakness on the market and that as a result some liquidity which
has not yet been invested will flow back into the equity market
again   Raiffeisen Research said 
 Stefan Scheurer  capital markets analyst at Allianz Global
Investors  spun on the same theme  saying investors with big
cash allocations might use phases of stock market weakness to
shift some money into equities 
 Valuations could also lend some support  According to
consensus data compiled by Goldman Sachs  European shares trade
at on average 11 4 times 12 month forward earnings compared with
a 10 year average of around 13 5 
 The U S  corporate earnings reporting season gets under way
next week with aluminium group Alcoa on July 8 and oil major
Chevron on July 9 
  Alcoa will be a signal  Its second quarter numbers are
probably not good but a positive outlook could lift stock
markets   said Joerg Rahn  head of investment at Bankhaus
Marcard  Stein   Co 
 London s FTSE 100 index and the French CAC 40 both edged up
0 1 percent on Friday while the German DAX lost 0 2 percent and
Zurich s SMI fell 0 3 percent

   Utilities slip  energy shares track weaker crude
   Financials  miners advance 
 By Atul Prakash
 LONDON  July 7  Reuters    European equities ended down for
a fourth straight session on Tuesday  led lower by utilities and
energy shares  as investors remained nervous ahead of earnings
figures and worries about the pace of global economic recovery 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares finished
0 8 percent lower at 826 36 points after rising to a high of
840 27  But the index  which fell 45 percent in 2008  is still
up 28 percent since hitting a record low in early March 
 Utilities shares were among top decliners  with GDF Suez 
E ON  National Grid and Centrica slipping 1 6 3 8 percent 
 Energy shares tracked crude oil prices  which fell 2 percent
to trade below  63 a barrel  Royal Dutch Shell  Total and Cairn
Energy fell 1 1 1 6 percent 
 Elsewhere in the sector  Repsol fell 1 6 percent  in line
with broader market  Sources said on Tuesday that China National
Petroleum Corp   CNPC   the country s largest oil company  could
pay up to  14 5 billion for 75 percent of Spanish oil major s
Argentine unit YPF 
  The markets are in a consolidation mode   said Andrew Bell 
head of research at Rensburg Sheppards   To propel the markets
higher  we have got to see evidence of the turning point in
earnings and of the recovery and economic growth moving from
less bad to a little bit better  
  I think that so much stimulus has been thrown at these
economies that the risk of a significant downside disappointment
is quite limited   he added 
 The OECD said that governments risk killing economic
recovery if they withdraw stimulus spending too fast  and added
that the name of the game was to move from policy driven
recovery to a self sustaining growth 
 However  Germany provided a glimmer of hope for a global
recovery  reporting an upturn in manufacturing orders 
 Pharmaceutical stocks  generally seen as defensive shares 
also slipped  GlaxoSmithKline  Novartis and Roche fell 0 5 1 1
percent 
  We are bouncing around on very low volumes   said Howard
Wheeldon  strategist at BGC Partners  in London   We may
continue moving sideways for many months  The worst of the
crisis may be over  but we re not seeing recovery  
 
 DRUGMAKERS  BANKS GAIN
 Financial stocks gained ground  however  Standard Chartered
  Barclays  BNP Paribas  Natixis and Commerzbank rose 0 9 2 9
percent 
 The banking sector was the second biggest loser in 2008
following a financial crisis  the worst since the Great
Depression of the 1930s  but has recovered this year 
 The sector has gained 17 percent in 2009 and European Union
finance ministers agreed in principle on Tuesday to make capital
rules for banks more flexible to reduce their likelihood of
worsening boom and bust cycles in the economy 
 Miners also advanced  BHP Billiton  Antofagasta  Rio Tinto 
Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources rose 0 7 2 percent 
 Building materials group CRH Plc warned pretax profit
nosedived in the first half and said trading would remain
extremely difficult  but investors bet the worst was behind the
Irish group  sending its shares 5 percent higher 
 Among automobile shares  BMW fell 0 6 percent after group
vehicles sales fell 12 7 percent in June to 127 546 units 
bringing the first half decline to 19 5 percent amid a sharp
economic slump 
 Across Europe  UK s FTSE 100 index  Germany s DAX and

 LONDON  July 16  Reuters    European shares fell in early
trade on Thursday  after three days of gains ahead of key
earnings reports from major U S  firms JP Morgan  and
Google  
 At 0820 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0 3 percent at 861 13 points  having

more than 33 percent from the lifetime low it hit on March 9 
  So far  we re getting indications of a better than expected
Q2 earnings season  though it s very early   said Bernard
McAlinden  investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers  in Dublin 
 We re in a range  and we have been going up to the upper
end of it  But the market needs to see that recovery is there 
and that earnings have bottomed  
 A 33 percent surge in quarterly earnings at Goldman Sachs
 sparked optimism this week that the banking sector was
recovering 
 Banks were mostly lower on Thursday  with the DJ STOXX
European banking  index having gained 8 7 percent in the
previous three sessions 
 Banco Santander   Deutsche Bank   HSBC
 and UBS  were down between 0 9 and 2 2

6084,227599,ENGIE,SCENARIOS Possible successors for EDF head  timing uncertain,news,"By Marie Maitre
 PARIS  Sept 3  Reuters    Pierre Gadonneix s position as
chief executive of French state owned group EDF has been seen
under threat since running foul of the government this summer
over his calls for bumper rises in electricity tariffs 
 Here are scenarios on possible successors and the timing of
an appointment to replace him at EDF  the world s biggest
utility group with a market capitalisation of 66 billion euros 
 
 REPLACEMENT NOW OR LATER 
 French daily newspaper Les Echos reported on Wednesday that
EDF could hold a board meeting on Sept  23 to decide on a
successor to Gadonneix  66  whose mandate ends in November 
 Under EDF s statutes  Gadonneix could seek another mandate
that would end on the eve of his 69th birthday in January 2012 
 The names of several candidates from industry and political
circles have circulated  but there is no clear contender  which
may lead the government to renew Gadonneix for six to 12 months 
 But one source close to the situation said French President
Nicolas Sarkozy  who will have the final say in appointing EDF s
new head  was unlikely to further delay the decison 
 
 INDUSTRY OR POLITICAL APPOINTEE 
 Sarkozy wants an industry leader to take over EDF  two
sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters 
 The names of politicians have also been rumoured  including
Sarkozy s speech writer Henri Guaino and former Prime Minister
Alain Juppe  but appointing someone with no industrial
background would not go down well with investors  analysts said 
 
 ALSTOM CEO PATRICK KRON
  Kron would be a dream scenario  He s a proper manager and
has political connections  but let s say he would not go to EDF
for the money  one analyst said of the 55 year old man who has
turned around a nearly bankrupt Alstom 
 Kron  who spent 15 years at aluminium group Pechiney after
five years at the French Industry Ministry  has declined
Sarkozy s offer to head EDF  two sources close to the situation
said 
  Kron has told Sarkozy he doesn t want to work in a
state owned group   one of the sources said  adding   Leaving
Alstom would also mean giving up on a lot of money  
 Alstom s 2008 09 annual report showed that Kron  earned 3 9
million euros including 1 04 million in fixed salary  while
Gadonneix  who has no stock option plans  earned 766 000 euros
in fixed salary  EDF has not yet published his variable income 
 
 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT CEO HENRI PROGLIO
 The Veolia CEO  who industry sources say is close to
Sarkozy  is seen as another  credible  option  but they doubt he
will leave the world s biggest water group in which he has made
his entire career  Proglio  60  already turned down the EDF job
in 2004 
 
 GDF SUEZ DEPUTY CEO JEAN FRANCOIS CIRELLI
  He is the ideal candidate as he is the only one who does
not really have a proper job   a second analyst said of Cirelli 
51  who headed Gaz de France before it merged with Suez in 2008 
 A source close to the issue said Cirelli was  happy being
No 2  at GDF Suez  but would accept the EDF job if offered it 
 
 AREVA CEO ANNE LAUVERGEON
 Lauvergeon has long been rumoured as an option  but industry
sources said she would not leave the nuclear group she built 
 Other observers said the EDF job would offer Lauvergeon  50 
a fresh start after a tough year at Areva where she had to bow
to Sarkozy s demand to sell a prized unit to bridge a funding
gap  and faced delays and cost overruns in a landmark
nuclear reactor project in Finland

permission from the European Commission on Wednesday to acquire
two power plants and certain drawing rights from Belgium s
Electrabel 
 The Commission  executive arm of the 27 nation European
Union  said in a statement that the transaction would not impede
effective competition in the European common market 
  The Commission s examination of the deal showed that the
horizontal overlaps between the activities of E ON and the
acquired assets are limited and that the transaction would not
raise competition concerns   the EU executive said 
 The transaction is linked to GDF Suez unit Electrabel s
acquisition from E ON of power generation assets and drawing
rights to electricity capacity in Germany  the statement said 
 This is a result of undertakings given by E ON to divest
power generation assets and electricity drawing rights to
resolve competition problems in Germany  it added

   GDF ready to reach accord with Eni over Rome gas grid
 
  Adds comments on Rome gas grid 
 ROME  Oct 14  Reuters    French utility GDF Suez SA is ready
to reach a broad accord with Rome s Acea SpA but the Italian
company has to set the outline  GDF Suez
Chairman Gerard Mestrallet said on Wednesday 
 The French utility is also ready to reach an agreement with
Eni over the Rome distribution gas grid Romana Gas  he added  
 Eni sought to sell Romana Gas  valued at around 1 1 billion
euros   1 64 billion   to GDF in 2008 as part of the deal that
saw Eni buy Belgian gas company Distrigas from GDF  
 In July Eni subsidiary Snam Rete Gas said GDF had decided
not to proceed with the acquisition  
  We are big groups  we have good relations with Eni and I
have a good personal relationship with the CEO Paolo Scaroni  We
can find an accord and find alternatives for compensation  
Mestrallet told a news conference on GDF Suez services 
 GDF Suez wants to expand its electricity joint venture with
the Rome controlled utility to include natural gas activities 
The French company holds 9 98 percent of Acea 
  We are ready to reach quite a wide accord with Acea  but
it s up to Acea to decide on the perimeter   Mestrallet said 
  I have said of our ambitions in Italy that we would be
happy to go forward with Acea wholly or in part   he added 
 Discussions on closer ties hit a barrier in March when
Acea s key negotiator  then Chief Executive Andrea Mangoni 
resigned after a strategy dispute 
 In a newspaper interview on Saturday with Corriere della
Sera newspaper  Acea Chaiman Giancarlo Cremonesi said he hoped
relations with GDF Suez would be clarified in a month 
 The city of Rome controls 51 percent of Acea

6088,227603,ENGIE,UPDATE 1 RWE will not bid for utility Enea  Polish treasury,news,"  Polish treasury says RWE will not bid for 67 percent of Enea
   Wants to relaunch the sale before year end

   Adds more detail  RWE comment 
 WARSAW  Oct 14  Reuters    German utility RWE will not make a binding offer
for Polish peer ENEA  the Polish treasury ministry said in a statement on
Wednesday  adding it still wanted to relaunch the sale this year 
 RWE was the sole bidder interested in acquiring a 67 percent stake in Enea 
worth almost 7 billion zlotys   2 5 billion  based on the current market price 
put up for sale by the Polish government  It had been expected to file a final
bid on Thursday 
  Following careful analysis  RWE concluded that its potential offer would
not match current market expectations   the German utility said in a separate
statement 
 The news came after Enea said on Monday that France s GDF Suez had asked to
take a look at Enea s books 
 Earlier this month the treasury told Reuters that Poland was counting on
other investors to counter a possible RWE bid 
 Sweden s Vattenfall bought a nearly 19 percent stake in Enea during its
initial public offering in 2008 for  560 million but decided to pass on the
opportunity to grab a controlling stake

6091,227606,ENGIE,Europe builders seen up  defence down if Obama wins,news,"LONDON  Nov 4  Reuters    European building materials and
construction stocks could be big gainers from a Barack Obama win
in Tuesday s U S  presidential election  while defence companies
would get a boost if rival John McCain won  analysts said 
 Democrat Obama led Republican McCain in five of eight key
battleground states  according to a series of Reuters Zogby
polls as the two candidates face the verdict of U S  voters
following a long and bitter campaign 
  Obama would spend a lot of money on the public sector 
which would be good for road builders  A landslide Obama win
would also be good for retailers because it would come with a
feel good factor that would boost consumer spending   said Mark
Bon  fund manager at Canada Life 
 Analysts said the concrete details of Obama s plans for the
economy would have a big bearing on which stocks would benefit 
  A lot hinges on the flavour of what the stimulus is  If
it s going to be just tax cuts  in which case people are going
to look at some of the discretionary end of the consumer spend 
Potentially leisure and retail could do well   said Philip
Lawlor  chief portfolio strategist at Nomura 
  My read is that it s going to be a big package of  150
billion but it s much more skewed towards infrastructure  in
which case once the legislation starts to come through people
will realise this has to be beneficial for the construction
stocks and material stocks  
 Societe Generale said in a note late last month that it
expected European commercial banking  construction  healthcare
equipment and insurance to benefit from an Obama win 
 It picked CRH  Holcim and Lafarge as potential winners among
the construction companies  while BBVA and Santander would be
gainers among the banks as opportunities arose to buy U S 
regional banks 
  A new president with a clear mandate would also be good for
the dollar  and that would boost European exporters   Bon said 
 Aerospace and defense  pharma  investment banking and asset
management  luxury goods  oil  chemicals and nuclear energy
could gain from a McCain win 
 SocGen picked defence groups BAE Systems  Cobham  drugmakers
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline and Credit Suisse and UBS in the
investment banking and asset management universe 
 It said luxury goods group LVMH  oil producers BP and Royal
Dutch Shell  industrial gases group Air Liquide and nuclear
energy players Areva  EDF and GDF Suez would also be likely
winners under McCain 
 Whatever the outcome  analysts said that the progress of a
 700 billion financial stimulus programme agreed under outgoing
President George W  Bush would be key 
  We do think it opens the way as well  more fundamentally
and more relevantly for equity markets at this juncture  for a
speed up in the fiscal stimulus programme  That is what we will
really be looking at   said Ian Richards  strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland

  Adds close of European markets 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 9  Reuters    An equities rally stumbled on
Thursday as investors cast doubt on a coordinated global effort
to stem a worsening worldwide credit crisis by cutting interest
rates  and even safe haven assets fell as uncertainty ruled the
day 
 Demand for government bonds  gold and low yielding
currencies    all recent beneficiaries of a scramble for
relative safety as global equity markets tanked    fell 
 Expectations that energy demand will fall sharply if the
credit crisis pushes the global economy into a prolonged
recession pushed crude oil lower to around  87 a barrel 
 The yen fell broadly and higher yielding currencies bounced
as extreme risk aversion receded in jittery financial markets 
 Key central banks around the world cut rates on Wednesday
in a coordinated response to halt the worst financial crisis to
sweep the world in almost 80 years 
 Rallies in both European and U S  stocks proved to be
short lived  with a downturn on Wall Street quickly echoed in
Europe  Financial and energy shares sold off on both sides of
the Atlantic 
 U S  stocks initially rose as investors snapped up
beaten down shares and took heart from strong earnings from
technology bellwether IBM after a six day slide on Wall Street
that has pushed the Dow by more than a third a record peak hit
exactly one year ago  By mid morning  however  the
bargain hunting bounce fizzled and the Dow and S P 500 were
lower  although the Nasdaq was slightly higher 
  There s still a significant amount of nervousness that the
credit crisis has not seen its end and there are still more
problems that lie ahead   said Michael James  senior trader at
regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles 
  People are scared about what they don t know and the fear
of the unknown is what s causing people to sell stocks and ask
questions later  
 Before 1 p m   the Dow Jones industrial average  was
down 120 18 points  or 1 30 percent  at 9 137 92  The Standard
  Poor s 500 Index  was down 14 71 points  or 1 49
percent  at 970 23  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down
4 36 points  or 0 25 percent  at 1 735 97 
 Shares in Morgan Stanley  plunged as much as 25
percent on ongoing concern about the status of a planned  9
billion investment by Japan s top bank  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group  8306 T   in the U S  investment bank 
 Energy shares fell on concerns over the economy s effect on
demand  with Exxon Mobil  and Chevron  both down
around 5 percent 
  The market is definitely trading on rumors  not news  
said Matt McCormick  a portfolio manager at Bahl   Gaynor
Investment Counsel in Cincinnati 
 The tech rich Nasdaq rose after International Business
Machines Corp  posted solid profit  lifting its shares
about 1 5 percent  Microsoft  led the Nasdaq higher
with a 2 5 percent gain 
 European stocks fell  extending a slide to four days  after
trading higher earlier in the session 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
fell 2 05 percent to 921 46 
 The biggest drag on the European index were utilities
  which fell on expecations declining oil prices  a
barometer for commodity prices  will lead to a cut in
electricity prices 
 GDF Suez  lost 13 1 percent  EDF  slipped
10 5 percent and E ON  dropped 10 7 percent 
 Oil and banking shares also were big drags on the index 
with Barclays  falling 13 2 percent  Royal Dutch Shell
 fell 3 2 percent and BP  shed 1 8 percent 
 The cost of interbank borrowing overnight cash fell in
response to the move by financial authorities to restore calm
to jittery markets  The cost of dollar  euro and sterling funds
for the overnight rate all fell substantially  although by less
than one half percentage point 
 The rate cuts were aimed at unclogging the credit markets
and to keep business activity humming 
 But the cost of borrowing dollars for any period beyond the
overnight rate rocketed  Three month dollar Libor hit its
highest rate this year as banks scrambled for greenbacks to
cover U S  currency positions and to fund dollar assets 
  We re not seeing any relief in term Libor fixings which
tells us that the rate cut has exclusively impacted on the
overnight market but it hasn t touched the Libor market at
all   said BNP Paribas rate strategist Alessandro Tentori in
London   And that s not a very good sign   he said 
 Euro zone government bonds fell sharply  suggesting that
some risk appetite emerged after the coordinated rate cuts 
 The December Bund future  traded down 81 ticks at
116 04  but up from a near one week low of 115 46 earlier in
the session 
 Although debt yields were higher across all maturities 
shorter dated paper outperformed longer dated peers 
underpinned by expectations for more rate cuts and driving the
2 10 year yield curve to its steepest level since February 
 U S  Treasuries fell for a third straight day as debt
supply issues weighed on investor sentiment 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
33 32 in price to yield 3 78 percent  The 2 year U S  Treasury
note  slipped 8 32 in price to yield 1 69 percent 
 The low yielding yen fell from a three year high against
the euro and a six month peak versus the dollar that it hit the
previous day  although it later pared some losses 
 The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies  with
the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 38 percent at 81 222  Against
the yen  the dollar  was up 1 10 percent at 100 34

 NEW YORK  Oct 9  Reuters    A wave of panic selling swept
U S  stocks on Thursday  driving the blue chip Dow index down
more than 7 percent  and oil prices dived  as widening fears of
a global recession were unchecked by moves by authorities
worldwide to thaw frozen credit markets 
 Oil fell below  85 for the first time in almost 12 months
on fears over world demand for energy  As the economic picture
darkened traders ignored calls by some OPEC members to cut
output to prop up prices 
 Even gold  a traditional safe haven  fell as investors
opted for cash as global stocks slid 
 Energy shares on both sides of the Atlantic fell with crude
prices  Financial shares were also top losers in U S  and
European markets as measures to contain the credit crisis
failed to instill confidence 
 Investors were shaken when overnight interbank borrowing
costs fell in the wake of deep rate cuts by central banks on
Wednesday  but longer term lending rates remained high 
 The high rates cast doubts that money would flow into other
parts of the money markets  such as commercial paper  and free
up the clogged markets to all businesses to keep humming 
  The market is in show me mode  There s a crisis of
confidence   said Bruce Zaro  chief technical strategist at
Delta Global Advisors Inc in Plymouth  Massachusetts 
 An avalanche of selling in late U S  trade drove the Dow

levels  a source close to the Rome company said on Friday 
 Acea said in a statement on Thursday that it had adjourned
