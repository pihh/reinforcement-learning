Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  and thank you for standing by  Welcome to today s International Paper fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call   Operator instructions  I d now like to turn today s conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez  vice president  investor relations  Please go ahead Guillermo Gutierrez    Vice President  Investor Relations Thank you  Christie  Good morning  and thank you for joining International Paper s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call  Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton  chairman and chief executive officer  and Tim Nicholls  senior vice president and chief financial officer  There is information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2  including certain legal disclaimers  For example  during this call  we will make forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  We will also present certain non U S  GAAP financial information  A reconciliation of those figures to U S GAAP financial measures is available on our website  Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter 2019 earnings press release and today s presentation slides  Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments on Slide 2  we also provide context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities  I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton  Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Guillermo  and good morning  everyone  Thank you for joining our call  We ll begin our discussion on Slide 3  International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2019  Our performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation and the flexibility of the company to navigate well even in challenging environments  While the U S  economy remains healthy  we managed through significant inventory headwinds and broader trade tensions that impacted our exports  Against this backdrop  we focused on optimizing our full value chain  We grew with customers who are market leaders in their respective segments  We ran our manufacturing system well  and we leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting system  all of which allowed us to continue to grow value for our shareowners with an ROIC of nearly 11   which is well above our cost of capital  On capital allocation  we re making choices consistent with our framework  In 2019  we returned  1 3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  We also increased our dividend for the tenth consecutive year  reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable payout of 40  to 50  of free cash flow  And we repaid  1 billion of debt to maintain a strong balance sheet  We continue to invest strategically to strengthen our Industrial Packaging business  In 2019  we made targeted investments in our U S  box business to enhance our capabilities and reinforce our strong position in the fastest growing segments  We also made selective acquisitions in our European packaging business to expand the converting network around our Madrid mill  I also want to share some context around our decision to start monetizing our investment in Graphic Packaging  which we announced earlier this week  The thinking around the original structure was to maximize the value of our North American Consumer Packaging business by combining it with Graphic Packaging  The investment provided us time to evaluate the role of Consumer Packaging for IP  while participating in the benefits of the combined business in a tax efficient structure  Ultimately  we determined that a significant addition to our portfolio in the North America Consumer Packaging space is not a strategic priority  So it makes sense to start monetizing our investment and deploy that capital consistent with our capital allocation framework  Turning to Slide 4 and full year results  We delivered EBITDA of  3 9 billion and outstanding free cash flow of  2 3 billion  Revenue did decrease about 4  due to lower average pricing and the impact of lower export containerboard and pulp volumes  Our equity earnings were  250 million  including  207 million from our Ilim joint venture  which was also impacted by challenging pulp markets  Despite a less favorable commercial environment in 2019  we delivered healthy margins of about 17  by taking advantage of our manufacturing and supply chain expertise and managing our costs well in our three businesses  Now let s turn to the next slide and take a closer look at free cash flow  As you can see on Slide 5  International Paper generated  2 3 billion in free cash flow in 2019  which puts our five year average at  1 9 billion  reflecting our strong and sustainable cash generation  We proactively managed cash levers across the company to mitigate the impact of lower earnings and to exceed our full year free cash flow commitment  Cash from operations was  3 6 billion compared to  3 2 billion in 2018 and includes a  300 million improvement in working capital  Capital expenditures were  1 3 billion or about  300 million lower than in 2018  We ve often discussed IP s strong and resilient free cash flow  I think 2019  once again demonstrates our ability to deliver outstanding cash generation  even as we manage through more difficult market conditions  So now turning to Slide 6  We delivered another solid year of return on invested capital with a five year average return of 11   Our performance reflects the strength of our portfolio  We are making the right investment choices and delivering on those commitments  I ll now turn it over to Tim  who will cover the performance across our business segments  as well as our outlook  Tim Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Mark  Good morning  everyone  I m on Slide 7  which shows our year over year operating earnings bridge  Operating earnings decreased by  0 89 to  4 43 per share in 2019 in what was clearly a challenging environment  especially outside the U S  Our results  as Mark said  reflect our ability to optimize our mill and converting systems and manage marginal costs as we matched our production to our customers  needs  Looking at the bridge  price and mix were a headwind  mostly due to significant price pressure in export pulp and containerboard markets  as well as the price impact of index movements in our North American packaging business  Volume was a drag on earnings largely due to challenging export markets  Export containerboard was impacted by unusually high customer inventories as we enter 2019  and it took about three quarters to normalize  Operations and costs were impacted by significant economic downtime  especially in the first half of the year as export shipments slowed and we reduced inventories across our North American packaging system on improved supply chain velocity and reliability  Input costs were favorable for the full year  driven mostly by lower recovered fiber and energy costs  And even though wood cost moderated in the second half of the year  they were actually a significant drag on earnings in 2019  All in  corporate items were favorable  with lower corporate and interest expense partly offset by higher tax expense in 2019  Equity earnings decreased due to lower Ilim earnings  Turning to Slide 8 and our fourth quarter results  EBITDA was  1 billion with margins of 18   The year over year revenue decline is mostly driven by lower pricing and packaging in Global Cellulose Fibers  as well as the impact of the India divestment earlier in the fourth quarter  Free cash flow in the quarter was again strong as we continue to proactively manage capital spending and working capital  During the fourth quarter  we reduced debt by nearly  600 million  Moving to the quarter over quarter earnings bridge on Slide 9  Operating earnings were unchanged at  1 09  Price or mix was a headwind due to the prior index movements in Global Cellulose Fibers and North American packaging  as well as the lower prices in export containerboard  Volume improved in the quarter due to stronger containerboard exports as expected  as well as higher seasonal demand in Latin American papers and European packaging  Operations and costs were offset in the quarter by favorable maintenance outage costs and input costs improved due to lower wood and chemical costs  Corporate items were also favorable and equity earnings were essentially flat  So we ll turn to the segments  and I ll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 10  Our business performed well  The North America business earned  584 million with margins of nearly 25  and a light maintenance outage quarter  Across the segment  price and mix was unfavorable due to the impact of prior index movement in North America  as well as the mix impact of higher containerboard exports in the fourth quarter as we expected  Staying with containerboard exports  demand is healthy and customer inventory levels have normalized across most regions  It may even be on the low side in select areas as we enter this year  Volume improved sequentially  driven by containerboard exports  as well as stronger seasonal demand in our European packaging business  In North America  we had strong double digit growth in e commerce  And the protein segment continued to perform well in the fourth quarter  while processed foods and durables continue to lag the broader strength of the U S  economy  Demand in January is off to a pretty good start for us at a plus 1  to 2   The growth trend we discussed last quarter is coming through as expected as we ramp up our recent business wins  Operational performance was favorable  Economic downtime decreased significantly in the fourth quarter as we increase production to meet stronger demand  Operations and costs also benefited by about  40 million of onetime items  including a favorable LIFO inventory adjustment  Input costs were also favorable across the segment  driven by lower cost for wood and chemicals  Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 11  Fourth quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions and a very challenging supply demand condition  The near term headwinds we have faced in the business have been material due to the severity of the commodity pulp cycle  It has resulted in more supply of fluff pulp and a higher mix of market pulp in our business  In light of the current performance and our outlook  we have impaired the full amount of the goodwill in the business of  52 million  which is a special item in the quarter  We expect very challenging earnings in the first half of 2020 due to the flow through of prices from 2019 and the impact of higher maintenance outage expenses  We do see better fundamentals as we enter 2020  Customer fluff inventories have normalized and underlying demand is improving  Looking beyond the improving supply demand conditions  our strategy is to grow profitably in fluff pulp to reduce our market pulp mix  We continue to feel good about the 2  to 3  structural demand growth with fluff pulp  which is our focus  We had a successful contract season and are on pace to bring fluff and specialty mix to 75  of total volume in 2020  All of this positions us for an improvement in the second half of the year  Looking to Printing Papers on Slide 12  The business delivered earnings of  109 million in the quarter  Across the segment  price and mix decreased mostly due to lower pricing for exports from our North America and Latin American paper business  as well as the mix impact of higher export volume from North America  Volume improved sequentially across all regions  Demand in Brazil was seasonally stronger as expected  but was partially offset by weaker demand in Latin American countries due to the geopolitical environment  In our North American business  we had strong performance in cut size with new customer business  However  the roll business was weak due to challenging conditions in commercial printing  Mill performance was solid across the segment  Operations and cost was impacted by a noncash LIFO inventory charge of about  15 million  mostly related to the hardwood inventory adjustments at Riverdale as we execute the conversion and some other onetime charges  Input costs improved across the sector on lower purchase pulp prices in Brazil and lower hardwood cost in North America  Staying with Printing Papers  uncoated free sheet shipments in North America were volatile in 2019 due to the influence of trade flows through the year  Fundamentally  though  we continue to see long term secular decline of about 4   in line going forward with the two year industry average over the past few years at 3 7   Looking at Ilim results on Slide 13  The joint venture delivered  21 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter  Volume improved as expected  with no planned maintenance outages in the quarter  and was offset by negative price flow through  Equity earnings include a foreign exchange gain on Ilim s U S  dollar denominated net debt of which IP s after tax portion was  8 million or  0 02 per share  For the full year  adjusted EBITDA was  706 million  which represents a 32  margin  Full year equity earnings were  207 million  And although 2019 was a challenging year across global pulp markets  Ilim s strong operational performance and low cost system make it a powerful cash generator  and we expect to receive about  120 million in dividends from Ilim in 2020  On Slide 14  I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2019 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper in 2020  Starting with the balance sheet  Our commitment is unchanged  We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating with a target debt to EBITDA of 2 5 to 2 8 times on a Moody s basis  In 2019  we repaid  1 billion of debt and our pension gap decreased by  200 million  Our pension plan is sufficiently funded  and we feel really good about the actions we ve taken to derisk the plan  All in  we closed 2019 at 2 8 times leverage  which was flat with prior year  Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework  In 2019  we returned  1 3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  And over the past five years  we ve returned nearly  5 6 billion to shareholders or about 60  of free cash flow  As Mark said earlier  in 2019  we increased our dividend for a tenth consecutive year  reinforcing our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40  to 50  of free cash flow  Looking ahead to 2020  free cash flow after dividends will continue to be directed to debt reduction and share repurchases  Looking at investments  we continue to proactively manage capital spending as we invest to maintain our world class systems and strengthen our packaging business  The types of M A we would be interested in are targeted smaller scale opportunities that would round out our capabilities and create value  And with regard to the Graphic Packaging transaction we announced earlier this week  we received  250 million in cash from Graphic Packaging  which is the maximum amount permitted in each period under the agreement  We do not expect to pay taxes on this initial transaction  Our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging is now approximately 18 3   This transaction puts us on a monetization path  Moving to our full year outlook on Slide 15  We re projecting full year EBITDA for the company of  3 0 billion to  3 2 billion  This is driven by the full year impact of price carryover from 2019 as well as the January containerboard index movement  We also plan about  70 million of higher maintenance outage expense in 2020  as we execute a high cold outage cycle  To put this in context  we completed two cold outages across our system in 2019 compared to eight cold outages planned for this year  And lastly  we anticipate about  80 million of cost related to the Riverdale conversion in 2020  including the impact of unabsorbed fixed cost  Free cash flow is expected to be at  1 7 billion  and we will proactively manage capital spending with a cap of  1 billion  Proceeds from the Graphic Packaging monetization  like all of our cash  will be put through our capital allocation framework  Turning to Slide 16 and our first quarter outlook  I ll start with Industrial Packaging  We expect price and mix to be down  30 million on the flow through of prior index movements in North America  Volume is expected to be down  20 million on lower seasonal demand in North America  Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by  85 million  partly due to the nonrepeat of favorable LIFO adjustments in the fourth quarter  Included in this  85 million is  20 million of unabsorbed fixed costs related to the Riverdale mill conversion  And staying with Industrial Packaging  maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by  93 million  and input costs are expected to be seasonally higher by about  15 million  In Global Cellulose Fibers  we expect price and mix to be down  15 million on the impact of prior index movement  Volume is expected to improve by  5 million on improved fluff volume  Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by  15 million  Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by  20 million and inputs are expected to remain stable  Moving to Printing Papers  Price flow through was offset by improved geographic mix  Volume is expected to be down  50 million  mostly on lower seasonal demand in Brazil  Operations and costs are expected to improve by  40 million  mostly due to the nonrepeat of LIFO charges in the fourth quarter and improved fixed cost absorption in North America  Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by  17 million  and input costs are expected to remain stable  As noted in the segment details I just shared  maintenance outages all in are expected to increase by  130 million in the first quarter  Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix  And lastly  under equity earnings  you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture  With that  let me turn it back over to Mark Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Tim  I m on Slide 17  As I reflect on our performance this past year  it reaffirms my confidence in International Paper  I ve often commented on these quarterly calls about our ability to succeed and generate strong cash flow through practically any set of conditions  And I think that s exactly how 2019 played out  As we enter 2020  we are delivering commercial wins and we ll continue to tightly manage our cost  capital spending and working capital to generate strong free cash flow despite earnings headwinds that we look at as cyclical  And most of these earnings headwinds that are price related are due to flow through from actions that have already occurred in 2019  The fundamentals of our packaging and fluff pulp business are solid  Our commercial and operational levers position us for positive momentum as we navigate through the year  International Paper has the best customers  the best people  the best system and a strong financial position  and we ll continue to make the choice as consistent with our capital allocation framework in order to drive long term value creation  With that  I think we ll open it up for questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup Anthony Pettinari    Citi    Analyst Hi  We saw some signs of improvement in China and the pulp market at the end of last year  kind of beginning of this year  The coronavirus has obviously kind of shaken things up  I was wondering if you could talk about what impact you re maybe seeing to your customers  I guess  on the pulp side in China  understanding the situation is unfolding Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It s a great question  Anthony  I think the coronavirus  we see what you just mentioned  improving conditions  both on the demand and on the economics  The virus issue is obviously a fluid situation and it s kind of early to tell  There are inventories in the system  The kind of products that our pulp goes into from GCF  from our cellulose fibers business  is an absorbent pulp  The type of products that tend to be a little less discretionary  On our Ilim joint venture  it s more market pulp for packaging and other softwood market uses  And they have seen some improvements as well  I think we re all watching very closely and looking at different contingencies based on the virus  which I think they ll get through  But the question is  how long does it take Anthony Pettinari    Citi    Analyst OK  that s helpful  And then your 2020 guidance suggests capex could be below  1 billion  And I don t think IP s capex has been below  1 billion for maybe a decade  I m just wondering what the split there is between maintenance and discretionary  Maybe what kind of investments maybe you re pulling back on  And then just how you would frame that capex level versus a normalized level versus where we might be in the cycle Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That s a great question because it is a number you haven t seen  Well  let me just make a high level comment  I ll ask Tim to talk about the categories  Over these periods of time that you mentioned  we re not the same company  obviously  in terms of asset quality  the amount of strategic investment  which we ve done a lot organic strategic investment in the last few years  And as we said earlier  last year on  I think  would be the third quarter call  we don t have those type of large projects every period  So the combination of all that allows us to have periods where we ll have less  Our guidance has always been about  1 4 billion over time  But it wouldn t be that every year  And Tim  if you want to add a little clarity to the category Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  I think you covered it well in terms of talking about the ramp down and the strategic projects  It s roughly 60  that we have targeted for maintenance and regulatory and then the balance being discretionary  But you re right   1 billion is on the high side  it could be lower than that  It could be closer to  900 million for the year OperatorNext question is from Steve Chercover of D A  Davidson Steven Chercover    D A  Davidson    Analyst First quick question  If I m not mistaken  your free cash flow was  300 million above your  2 billion guidance  So was that surplus due to mainly the working capital  Or can you elaborate  Tim Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  that was a big piece of it  There are several factors  One  there was some timing on some items  We had lower capital spending than what we had earlier estimated in the year  And then working capital  We picked up some things  Part of it is timing  We ll keep it  Part of it is just from one year to the next and so it will probably come back in 2020 Steven Chercover    D A  Davidson    Analyst OK  And then to quote you on Graphic Packaging  you re on a monetization path  So is it a bold assumption to say that you get another  250 000 that will be put toward the repo and or debt reduction Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  I mean  we ll put it through the capital allocation framework  And that s the primary focus that we have right now  So I don t assume any difference  And just to clarify  a maximum of  250 million every six months that we have  under the contract  the ability to monetize Steven Chercover    D A  Davidson    Analyst Can I just ask one other question  You ve got some flexibility  Obviously  it should be share price dependent  right  I guess the valuation of GPK will have some influence on your timing Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It will  I would say  modestly  but we re not    we don t think of ourselves as investors in equity shares  So we re not trying to time the market in an undue way  We re trying to just make sure we re smart about how we think through our right some of the contracts to monetize the stake that we have OperatorOur next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America George Staphos    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hi everyone  Good morning  Thanks for all the details  I wanted to talk about the maintenance spending that you re doing this year  And you ve said that there are eight cold outages this year versus two last year  Away from those numbers  when you re done with the projects this year  Mark  what will be further enabled either within Industrial Packaging or GCF that you don t have already from the maintenance  Or will it be obviously  much of it is going to be related to normal maintenance  but what will be the different capabilities out of the systems on either side when we re done with this Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George  I think one key point on maintenance is we talk about the capital  and that s a portion of maintenance  but a much bigger portion is just on the expense side and how we do precision maintenance  how we make repairs  how well trained our technical staffs are  And they re just getting better every year  So we have less failures  We expect better reliability  which ends up resulting in needing less capital for major replacements  And that s just been a continuing story for IP  So we spend the money on the expense side in education  training  techniques  and we save the money on the capital side  That s one point  What we ve been trying to do is make sure that in containerboard and in the new cellulose fibers business that we combined with the former Weyerhaeuser business that we have flexibility in the system so that we can make multiple products at multiple facilities  that s a strong value proposition for our customers  It s great in terms of managing marginal cost for wood or transportation  So what you ll see out of this is less variability between the worst facility we have in terms of reliability and capability and the best  So both systems are going to be more flexible and less variation  There s much more work to do  but we have made a lot of progress  And so it s kind of normal that we would have a period where we can enjoy some of the kind of fruits of the investments we ve made  So capability and consistency across those mill systems  In one case  feeding box plants  largely our own box plants  In the other case  going directly to customers who convert into absorbent products George Staphos    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst So tying a bow on that  so part of what you ll get also is an ability to further make your cost variable as opposed to fixed  depending on the system that you re in or the environment that you re in  Would that be fair Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That s fair  George  And you saw that  Again  we don t want to get too good at this because it usually only gets to show up when we re taking economic downtime  and markets are slower  but you saw a kind of a sort of a step change in 2019  containerboard LLO experience and our marginal cost management versus prior periods a few years earlier  And we would expect that to continue  So variabilizing our cost and getting better at marginal cost management is definitely part of it  There are some structural cost issues in some of our mills  especially on the GCF side that are not related to reliability  Just related to configuration and there s things there that we can address and will address in the future as our resources and priorities allow us to George Staphos    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  Second question  I ll try to make it quick  You mentioned that 60  of your free cash flow over the last five years has been dedicated to value return to the shareholder and your performance on cash flow and your performance returning value back to the shareholders has been impressive  Given the target of 40  to 50  over time  would it suggest that maybe that ratio necessarily has to come down as you delever  Or we shouldn t draw that conclusion  And what kind of circumstances would we need to see where the dividend  which looks to be amply supported now  might be something that is a little bit more at risk  Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well  the approach we take to the dividend  George  and thanks for the question  is that it s both competitive and sustainable  And so when we make these decisions  when we put forth recommendations to our Board and they decide dividend policy  we are trough testing and providing ample outlook for how we think the business is going to perform  So I don t see a need for the first part of your question and taking the action there  I think we re in a bit of a trough year  We re still on the high end  but within the range  And I think we have the flexibility to do what we need to do across our capital allocation choices Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think also just an additional point on Tim s comment  is when you think about the combination of near term capital return via the dividend and the share repurchase  we have reduced our shares outstanding and the actual outlay for the dividend is    even though we ve raised the dividend  as you can figure out for yourself  not growing in terms of pure cash outlay  So we re committed to the dividend  We think 40  to 50  has got the right balance of getting cash to shareholders  but not doing it in a way that s not sustainable  And I mean  that s what we re focused on in the company is generating the cash that s in trough  testing our recommendations to make sure that we are  in any case  talking about the dividend not being sustainable OperatorNext question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Chip Dillon    Vertical Research    Analyst Good morning and thanks for all the help  If you could talk a little bit about the South American business  I think  firstly  in corrugated  I know that s something I think you re looking to exit  And I just wanted to know  a  how that s going  And b  you mentioned some targeted M A possibilities  I don t know if there is a chance that you might actually want to keep a presence in Brazil and if that would be a possibility Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer On packaging Chip Dillon    Vertical Research    Analyst Yes Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No  no  We ve talked about strategic options  The process has taken a little bit longer than we thought  But we don t want this to go on forever  But I think it started slower based on just some timing and holidays and gearing up  We have made progress  I think we ll be in a position in the not too distant future to talk to you about the outcome  But in terms of an acquisition on packaging in Brazil  as we re still looking at options for how we exit that business  there s nothing that we re looking at Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer When Tim was talking in his remarks about capital allocation and we made a comment about investments and targeted small acquisitions  if there are any  those are primarily for our North American Industrial Packaging business and for our European packaging business  like we did a few  we bought a few box plants right near the Madrid mill  That s what he was referring to on targeted M A for packaging  not anything else Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And just to put some brackets around it in terms of size and the targeted nature of it and how it improves the business that we have  like packaging Chip Dillon    Vertical Research    Analyst OK  That s super helpful  And then just a quick follow up  When you look at the capex level going down to like  900 million to  1 billion  which certainly makes a lot of sense given the very immediate environment and certainly keeps your flexibility as high as it s been  Is that sort of a level    I mean  that should include  I assume some Riverdale expense    capex  So what should we kind of guess capex will be or would you expect capex to be in the  21   22   23 period  Let s say  things get that better  is there a reason that capex would rise up again  given your current footprint Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Should that be situational  I think from a strategic investment type  the bigger capital there  those get identified over time  We don t act on all of them  The cost reduction side of it is where I think you could see an increase over time  But like I said  it depends on the circumstances  the market conditions and how the business is performing  So we don t forecast publicly that far out in time  But situationally  I think we re in a spot where we can maintain around the level we have  If conditions warrant  we can take advantage of some high return cost reduction type projects to improve the business Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I think  Chip  the way we re thinking about this  if you go back all the way to 2014  where we started investing in our North American containerboard system for lots of reasons to replace the purchase board we were doing post the Temple acquisition to improve all the things I talked about in the prior answer  there s been a steady demand for large projects in our mill system and containerboard  Then we built the Madrid mill  and now we re doing Riverdale  We ve got the capacity we need and the capability we need largely for the foreseeable future  not only in that business but also in cellulose fibers  And so structural cost reduction in our system probably hasn t gotten the same level of attention  and that will be a focus going forward  But it s not as large as individual projects  It s smaller projects across more facilities  So depending on what the environment looks like  how much product we need based on our order book  we can time those structural cost reduction projects a little bit better than the strategic projects where you re trying to bring something on to market  So that will be the focus going forward  We don t have an exact number past 2020  but it ll be a different mix of projects because we ve made the investments we need to make for the foreseeable future Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That s very helpful  Thank you OperatorNext question is from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets Mark Wilde    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning Mark  thank you  I think you owe the Industrial Packaging crew lunch today Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That happens often Mark Wilde    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst OK  Well  that s a very good performance  Listen  the question I had  the recovery in pulp performance  it sounds like there are a couple of moving pieces we need to be conscious of as we go through  20  One is kind of a lag in kind of pricing and the other is kind of the shift in mix  So Tim  I wondered if you could just help us with a little more color on that Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well  I ll help you with as much as I can give  I mean  you see the price follow on  We do think that markets have begun stabilizing  And so the question will be recovery and how fast it comes on the pricing front  But inventory levels after some weak market conditions based on individual country economies  region economies  as well as the tariff situation  we think  had a fairly dramatic impact on price as we went through 2019 that we carry into this year  But we think that we are in a place where fundamentals have shifted and look like they re beginning to improve  On the mix side  because of the lower growth for fluff overall  based on those factors  we had a higher percent of commodity market pulp in our mix  for certain types of grades on    certainly on Southern soft bleach  we have a higher cost structure  We have a very good cost structure in our mill in Canada for Northern bleach  But for Southern  we have a higher cost structure and prices were impacted more  So that weighed on the business as well  Going forward  it s about intelligently restoring the fluff and absorbent specialty percent of our mix based on the commercial loss that we talked about last year  but doing it in a way that maximizes profit over time  So we re not just simply focused on volume  We re focused on how do we improve the earnings performance of the business and working through these macro challenges in the moment Mark Wilde    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst OK  And for a follow on  I just wondered  Mark  can you update us on sort of where the Ilim capital plans are  I know that they ve had some big projects talked about over time  but I don t know whether there s been any commitment to those  So if you could update us Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  The Ilim Board approved some projects involving some containerboard production  primarily for China  And so that s under way and additional softwood pulp at one of the existing facilities  debottlenecking one of the facilities  So both of those projects are approved and are beginning to get under way and will come online later in next year  So right now  the focus for Ilim is  as anybody in the softwood pulp business  is looking at getting the inventory stabilized and getting the market pricing  hopefully  back to a more normalized level  As Tim mentioned in the Ilim results  even at these lower cyclical price levels for commodity pulp  the Ilim cost structure is so far out ahead of everything else in the world that it s still a very  very powerful cash generator  And that s really what we want to do in our GCF business  which is really absorbent pulp focused  We are still 10 percentage points away from the mix  We really target to have 85  of our capacity  which is essentially all of our North American mills  on absorbent pulp  and only the Canadian northern bleached softwood mill on nonabsorbent pulp  And with a demand step back in the China economy  it just takes longer to get that mix up  as Tim said  intelligently  where we re doing it at a profitable level  So it s a setback in terms of the path we were on  but it s still the right path  And the business and the end use and the customer book is all very solid  OK OperatorYour next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Adam Josephson    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning  Thanks so much for taking my questions  Tim  just one on pulp  On Slide 11  you talk about a successful contract season accelerating your recovery this year  Can you just help me with what your pricing visibility is on contracts that you successfully renewed or secured  I m just wondering if you know what pricing on that business will be throughout the year  Or it s similar to market pulp in that regard  And then just you mentioned fluff is growing at a lower rate than market  I was just wondering just intuitively  why that would be the case Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  On the growth  I think we ve had some unusual challenges  We ve had certain countries in the Middle East  which are big fluff pulp consumers  their economies have underperformed  their currencies have underperformed against the dollar  There has been some  for a moment  demand destruction  There s been the tariff issue in China  which had to be sorted through and caused a lot of uncertainty  And so I think there s been the combination of some demand destruction in the moment  We don t think it s structural  And there s also the fact that we had inflated inventories around the world last year for a big part of the year that had to be rebalanced on fluff pulp  On the contracts on pricing  you can appreciate why I can t go into a whole lot of detail here  but it s really across the gamut  There s different customer types that we have  And some of those work on annual contracts with price negotiations that happen as you go through the year  Some of them are annual in the nature of the amount of volume they re going to take  And then there s openers along the way  And then we have parts of the market that it s month to month or quarter to quarter Adam Josephson    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst And then  Mark  just one on U S  box demand  at least through November  it was about flat last year after having been up quite a bit from  16 to  18  Over the past decade  it s flat or so  So what do you think  just  I guess  forget about longer term  but what are you expecting this year  Do you have any reason to think this year  Mark  will be much different than the flattish we saw last year for any particular reason Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  We look at a lot of economic leading indicators that correlate very nicely with box demand  We built our own internal International Paper model and it was reasonably accurate for last year  We see a little bit of growth this year  But I think when you look at what came out today on the GDP number and you think about box demand occasionally  it ll track GDP  but largely in the way the U S  economy is configured  it ll always lag that a little bit  So a 2  year  roughly  is what it looks like 2019 was and you ll end up with a box demand that for the inventory issues we talked about that occurred at the end of  18 in our customers  world  you end up with a little bit of a disconnect from GDP  I think without that inventory issue  I think you probably saw 1 3  to 1 5  box demand in  19 against a 2  GDP  And I think the reason that didn t happen is some of the  18 kind of stronger demand was really  19  We made boxes in  18 for our customers who didn t ship the product to well into  19 OperatorYour next question is from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global    Analyst First  on the outlook  You noted that it includes the impact of 2019 price carryover in January containerboard index adjustment  Does that mean that it doesn t include any other potential changes  and so pricing is effectively kept flat from where it is  Or is that not necessarily a conclusion to draw Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well  the challenge is we don t talk about pricing on a go forward basis  So we have carried in all of the carryover from last year to where we currently are  We have included the  10 published down for a containerboard that just happened  And within that range is our view on how we think about price over the course of 2020 Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global    Analyst OK  I understand  Also  the inventory valuation impact in packaging and paper  could you specify those for us Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  both of them are to do with LIFO  And as you know  we go through the year looking at how a number of factors are going to play out over the course of the year  and we re making estimates about what the LIFO charge is  As you get to the end of the year  you re truing up all of those  In the case of papers  we had overestimated our benefit  where we thought we were going to be earlier in the third quarter  and it actually ended up in a worse position  So we had to make that true up and just the opposite on the containerboard side  As you go through the year  it s not a precise science  and we re putting our best estimates based on business conditions  And as forecast factors change  then we have to make sure that we ve  Inaudible  it up to the appropriate amount at the end of the year Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global    Analyst Understood  And can you share with us what the adjustments in the fourth quarter were in the segments Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  I think we did  It was  15 million in papers  and it was around  40 million in Industrial Packaging Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global    Analyst Great  And then lastly  on the box shipments  So it sounds    is the win that we should get from not having  hopefully  any inventory destocking this year  in the 0 5  to 1  range  would you say  And also  could you let us know how January had played out Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  I know there s a lot of calls today  Mark  Right now  January looks like it s somewhere between 1  and 2   We re late in the month and you say  well  shouldn t you know better  But we don t really have a final number until we go through the close process and see how shipments actually came in  But we re seeing some of the wins that we talked about in the third quarter actually coming through in our North American container business  So we feel good about that  On the export containerboard side  we referenced inventory levels having returned to normalized levels late last year  But in some places  in some markets  our view is that inventory levels are low  Demand is very good right now  And so in the export markets  we think it s normal to skew on the lower side for inventory levels OperatorYour next question is from Mark Connelly of Stephens Inc Mark Connelly    Stephens Inc     Analyst Thanks  We ve obviously seen you take quite a lot of downtime without the sort of cost drags that would have been evident in the past  So clearly  all the work on the supply chain is working  I m curious if your experience over the past year is leading to more changes  And if  in effect  you re getting more efficient at taking that downtime Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  it s a great question  Mark  And I would say the short answer is yes  We took a level of downtime in containerboard last year that we haven t taken before  So we were able to do it a little more efficiently  primarily because of some of the investments we made in the  14   15   16 time frame  We also learned a little bit more about how to better manage the transportation component when we know we re going to take downtime and the wood fiber component  So I think we re actively learning how to manage our output to meet our customer demand across multiple facilities a little bit better each year   18  we ran everything wide open  and there was none of that work being done because we almost couldn t make enough product for all channels that we serve  And we actually added costs in some cases to make that incremental amount  So I think last year afforded us an opportunity to really try to use the benefits of all the investments we made  both capital and noncapital in systems and so forth in the supply chain  So I would say  yes  we are continuing to learn how to do that better Mark Connelly    Stephens Inc     Analyst That s helpful  And one more question on pulp  and I m sorry to keep bugging on this question  but fluff markets have been tracking commodity markets a lot more closely in the last couple of years  and that s not normal  So what has to happen  say  in the medium term  Sometimes when markets get soft  contract terms get squishy  and you start to increase that volatility  Is it going to take longer to get back to that normal because we ve got a cleanup contract messiness Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think  Mark  that s a great question  I think two main things going on with the connection between fluff pulp and the broader commodity markets  One is the shape of the curves on pricing  for example  are similar  but there s still a pretty healthy differential between the two  as there should be  There s a level of capacity in the market because fluff is still a relatively small market in terms of the other markets  It s about six million tons  There s about 15  capacity that can move in or out of the lower ends of fluff  based on what s happening in commodity pulp  The same producer has a choice  We don t have any of that capacity  but others do  And so it s a meaningful flex capacity that just needs to be absorbed as the market grows  Over time  I think that will buffet things a little bit better  And then  of course  any time you have these kind of conditions  you end up with contract terms and agreements that s probably not sustainable long term  So there is some of that  that has to be done  But this flexible capacity that can make softwood market or softwood absorbent is meaningful enough that in soft demand for market pulp or lower  lower price environments for market pulp  it ends up showing up just in enough at the margins to create some issues on the absorbent side OperatorYour next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs Brian Maguire    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Just a couple around capital reallocation  Obviously  with the recent cellulose fiber acquisition  they re writing off the goodwill and the challenges in the pulp market  Just wondering  in aggregate  does that make you less likely or a little bit more gun shy about doing large M A  I think some of your comments sort of alluded to really just focusing on smaller bolt on deals  And then just sort of related to that  it seems like the leverage is set to move higher with the lower EBITDA guidance in 2020  So should we assume that kind of the focus  the priority for the near term is more on preserving the balance sheet as opposed to share repurchase and things like that Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think on the first part of your question  Brian  the large M A is not a focus right now because it s not necessary for International Paper  We ve got a great company  We ve got the ability to improve the businesses we have  We ve done a lot of large M A in the past  and it s now time for us to optimize this and to profitably grow the target businesses  which don t require large M A  So the second part of your question  I think we ll see how the year plays out  But the combination  I think we put it on our chart  of debt repayment and share repurchase is a constant discussion in the company about which channel through our capital allocation framework to flow that cash  We have an outlook  We re sitting here in January  but we really don t know how the year is going to turn out  And it could be better or it could be not as good  and we ll make the decisions  But obviously  maintaining that balance sheet  investment grade  as Tim said  is an absolute priority  and we ll make the cash flow adjustments we need to make sure that happens Tim Nicholls    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  And the only thing I would add is we have been very clear about our commitment to the balance sheet and how we would manage that  We ve been very clear about our approach to returning cash to shareowners  I think Mark s right  It s dynamic  So we have to see how markets and results play out  We never viewed that we would be within the 2 5 to 2 8 times 100  of the time  We always thought that there could be reasons  But we don t want to be extremely wide of those  and we don t want to be there for long  And so we have a very strong commitment to support the credit rating that we have  We also are looking at share repurchase and making sure that we are returning value to shareowners  It ll be dynamic Brian Maguire    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  And then my last question is just more of a longer term  a bit of an open ended question  Obviously  2020 EBITDA is a bit cyclically depressed  You re cutting back on capex a bit  some of the growth in productivity projects  I guess the question is  beyond 2020  where should we think about earnings growth coming from beyond price increases  In other words  if we don t get any movement higher in pricing beyond 2020  where would be the drivers of earnings growth from there Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think the earnings growth will come from beyond any market pricing moves is the commercial investments we ve made on new products  better mix and growing our business in the segments that are growing the most  And that s a true statement for our box business as well as our cellulose fibers business  And then there s a healthy dose of constantly looking at our cost structure and improving that over time OperatorOur final question for today comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank Debbie Jones    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Just two questions  I m going to ask them together  Are you happy with your current European footprint  I know you aren t targeting any major M A as you outlined earlier  but I m just curious of your overall position there and how you feel about it  And then secondly  could you characterize any major differences that you re seeing with the way that your customers in Europe versus the U S  have needs as they relate to their sustainability efforts Mark Sutton    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I think the first answer is  yes  we are happy with our footprint  There are some issues that we re trying to sort out around whether they re structural or cyclical  like the market in Turkey  for example  which has been good and not so good over time  But we do like the business format we have  which is now that we have a large high performance mill in the mix  And so we re continuing to look to improve that business from its core  And then on sustainability  I just think Europe tends to be a year or two ahead of this market in sustainability initiatives  and it s largely partly due to regulation and partly due to just the consumer and the mindfulness of the consumer  But I think Europe is a good leading indicator for a lot of things that we learn there  we are able to prepare for here  but it might be a year or two later  But I think that the role fiber packaging is playing in helping customers in various market segments with their sustainability story    the fact that we ve got renewable natural resources  recyclable products and our energy is generated from carbon neutral biomass is playing very  very heavily and well with our customers  So before we sign off  I just want to wrap up a couple of key points that we talked about  Our focus for this year and beyond is delivering on the commercial wins  We ve made a lot of investments in talent  approaches  equipment  innovation  and that s what we re focused on  on the commercial side  We re looking at the levers we discussed today to generate free cash flow  We ll get to a strong free cash flow year by year by year  slightly different ways but what you can count on from IP is to deliver it  We believe our core businesses have solid long term fundamentals  There ll always be some cyclicality  We re seeing some of that now  But the fundamentals of what we make in boxes and what we make in our fluff pulp and the role that our paper business plays are solid and we believe in them for the future  And I think some of the things we talked about today  commercially  operationally  give us momentum as we navigate through the year of 2020  And I feel good about where we are as a company  strong balance sheet  as I said outstanding customers and outstanding people  And the ability for a year like 2019 to still show us that we can generate strong free cash flow  share it with our investors  make smart investments and the company gets stronger every year  So with that Guillermo  I ll turn it back over to you Guillermo Gutierrez    Vice President  Investor Relations Thank you  again  for joining International Paper s fourth quarter earnings call  As always  Michelle and I will be available for your follow up questions  Thank you Operator Operator

176586,398102,IP,Here s Why International Paper Stock Fell 11 6  in January,news,"What happened
Shares of International Paper  NYSE IP  fell more than 11  last month  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  The paper based packaging leader reported full year 2019 operating results on Jan  30  While adjusted earnings per share  EPS  beat Wall Street estimates  revenue fell just short of the consensus among analysts 
In reality  investors tend to give a little too much value to Wall Street estimates  What really matters is the long term trajectory of a business  In this instance  International Paper is clearly on a solid path  but persistent headwinds in the pulp and paper industry  or perhaps more accurately  the overreaction to the headwinds  continue to weigh on the dividend stock 

So what
International Paper reported full year 2019 revenue of  5 5 billion and adjusted EPS of  1 09  Analysts were expecting revenue of  5 576 billion and adjusted EPS of  1 02  The difference is relatively meaningless  which likely explains why shares rebounded in early February  The stock has now posted a year to date loss of only 5 4   
More importantly  the business appears to be in solid shape  It reported a full year 2019 margin on earnings before income taxes and equity earnings of 7 3   compared with 6 4  in the year ago period  The pulp and paper leader generated  3 6 billion in operating cash flow last year  an increase of 12  year over year  The business also generated a record  2 3 billion in free cash flow for the year and paid down  973 million in debt  
Now what
Despite the progress delivered in 2019  International Paper can never seem to outrun the headwinds facing the global pulp and paper industry  Demand for paper based packaging solutions remains strong  as do selling prices  but analysts remain bearish on the market nonetheless 
While that makes the stock s five year loss of 20  all the more frustrating for investors  the business is a solid cash cow trading at a reasonable price  If and when the bearish sentiment subsides  then shares should finally be able to put together a winning streak ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psn88,2079753

176684,398200,IP,Earnings Preview  International Paper  IP  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when International Paper  IP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This global paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  38 2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 58 billion  down 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Paper 
For International Paper  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Paper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that International Paper would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  9  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
International Paper doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-international-paper-ip-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200501122,200501122

176712,398228,IP,Earnings Preview  International Paper  IP  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects International Paper  IP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This global paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  35 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 61 billion  down 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 43  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Paper 
For International Paper  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Paper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that International Paper would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of  13 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
International Paper doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-international-paper-ip-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200477662,200477662

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-international-paper-ip-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200439830,200439830
176744,398260,IP,International Paper  IP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when International Paper  IP  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This global paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 82 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 94  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Paper 
For International Paper  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 98  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that International Paper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that International Paper would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  21 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

176769,398285,IP,WestRock To Gain From Favorable Demand Amid Higher Costs,opinion,On Mar 20  we issued an updated research report on WestRock Company   NYSE WRK    The company is benefiting from favorable demand  price and mix trends across its paper and packaging businesses  Execution of its capital allocation strategy and the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation will also aid growth  However  cost inflation and higher maintenance downtime remain near term headwinds Demand to Buoy Fiscal 2019 Results  Maintenance Downtime AilsFor second quarter fiscal 2019  WestRock projects adjusted segment EBITDA at  700  735 million  compared with  733 million reported in first quarter fiscal 2019  Benefits from the KapStone acquisition and pricing will be offset by higher maintenance downtime in both the Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging segment in the current quarter Further  in the Corrugated Packaging segment  the company ended up with approximately 100 000 tons of excess containerboard inventory following the KapStone acquisition  In the second quarter of fiscal 2019  the company plans to reduce inventories and match its production with demand  This is likely to impact earnings for the second quarter fiscal 2019  Further  higher wages and related taxes and other input costs primarily owing to rising virgin fiber costs on account of the wet weather will dent earnings  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter of fiscal 2019 is currently pegged at 64 cents  projecting a year over year decline of 23  WestRock lowered adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2019 from  3 6 billion to  3 5 billion  It projects an improvement of 21  from the adjusted EBITDA of  2 89 billion in fiscal 2018  WestRock will benefit from favorable demand  price and mix trends across its paper and packaging businesses  However  these gains will be somewhat negated by cost inflation and higher maintenance downtime In the Consumer Packaging segment  the company expects to install a new curtain coater at Cottonton  AL mill in March 2019  upgrade one of three paper machines at Covington  VA mill in April 2019 and replace a headbox at its Demopolis  AL mill in June 2019  The downtime associated with these three projects will adversely impact earnings in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019  Overall for the segment  maintenance downtime will be 121 000 tons in fiscal 2019  much higher than 47 000 tons in fiscal 2018 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 is  4 07  0 5  year over year decline  on the back of revenues of  18 94 billion  16 3  year over year growth   KapStone Acquisition  A Key CatalystIn November  WestRock completed the acquisition of rival KapStone Paper and Packaging Corp  The integration is on track and the company anticipates around  200 million of cost synergies and performance improvements by the end of fiscal 2021  KapStone s corrugated packaging operations will enhance the company s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products in geographical locations that will enable WestRock to better serve customers across the system  The buyout will help the company strengthen presence in western United States and enable it to compete better in the growing agricultural markets in the region It also fast tracks its target to improve margins of its North American corrugated packaging business  WestRock will also be able broaden portfolio of paper grades  allowing it to tap into the kraft bag market with the inclusion of KapStone s complementary specialty kraft paper offerings  Further  the deal will augment WestRock s portfolio of virgin fiber based paper from 65  to 67  as KapStone s 3 million tons of paper is made of 78  virgin fiber and only 22  paper is made from recovered fiber Capital Allocation Strategy Right on TrackDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2019  WestRock deployed  4 9 billion for the KapStone acquisition  including debt assumed  The company also invested  322 million in capital expenditures  paid  116 million in dividends and returned  44 million to stockholders through stock repurchases  As of Dec 31  2018  the company had approximately 20 3 million shares of its common stock available for repurchase under the program  Further share repurchases will be accretive to earnings Meanwhile  the company plans to invest approximately  1 4 billion of capital in its business in fiscal 2019  With the completion of many of its strategic capital projects in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020  the company projects capital expenditure target of  1 billion in fiscal 2021 In October 2018  WestRock also announced an increase of 5 8  or 10 cents per share  in annual dividend to an annualized rate of  1 82 per share   Notably  since its inception  the company has increased dividend by 21   The company s net leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter fiscal 2019 was 2 89  WestRock retains its target to lower net

176772,398288,IP,Is International Paper Company  IP  A Solid Pick For Value Investors   Revised ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put International Paper Company   NYSE IP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  International Paper Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 93  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 06  If we focus on the long term PE trend  International Paper Company  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 28 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Material sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that International Paper Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 06  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  International Paper Company has a P S ratio of 0 83  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  International Paper Company currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes International Paper Company a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for International Paper Company is just 0 95  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 75  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 40  which is better than the industry average of 5 59  Clearly  IP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though International Paper Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of B  This gives IP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision compared to two downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 10 78  in the past two months  while the full year estimate declined by 2 99   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below International Paper Company Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineInternational Paper Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 12  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall Moreover  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake  The original article  issued earlier today  should no longer be relied upon  ,2019-04-03,Zacks Investment

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Paper 
For International Paper  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55

So  this combination indicates that International Paper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

wood chips and old corrugated containers  OCC   and certain chemicals  including caustic soda and starch  and energy sources  principally natural gas  coal and fuel oil  Elevated input costs are likely to limit margins in the near term  Further  distribution costs have been on the rise of late due to very tight truck and rail availability  and higher diesel fuel costs  This is likely to affect margins in the near term  Moreover  the company is set to incur elevated operational costs in the Printing Papers  primarily because of unfavorable foreign currency translation  The Zacks

176798,398314,IP,IP  WRK Earnings Due On Jan 31  Here Are The Key Predictions,opinion,Per the latest   the  sector s earnings are expected to rise 0 5  in the fourth quarter of 2018 while sales are projected to increase 4 3   as on Jan 25   The  industry falls under the Basic Material sector and comprises an array of companies that manufacture and sell paper and paper products  The industry is highly diversified in terms of products which range from graphic paper  packaging paper to absorbent hygiene products  Although the players in the industry are gaining from rising demand from packaging  their margins will likely bear the brunt of the recent uptrend in raw material costs  transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs in the to be reported quarter  Growing consumer awareness regarding sustainable packaging  preference over plastic  skyrocketing e commerce activities and increasing demand for hygiene products are some of the factors favoring market growth for the paper and related product stocks  Moreover  improving disposable incomes of people  especially in the developing countries is one of the primary catalysts  Notably  the paper and related products industry will be spurred by packaging demand  going forward  The global paper   paperboard packaging market  which was at  175 billion in 2017  is expected to reach  267 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 4 8   However  the transition to digital media is an ever looming threat to the graphic paper segment which has been suffering declines over the past few years  Paperless communication  increased use of email  less print advertising  more electronic billing and fewer catalogs has taken a toll on graphic paper demand  Consequently  the industry is resorting to machine conversions into packaging and specialty papers  Apart from high raw material costs  the industry has been affected by rising transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs lately  The companies in the industry are focused on cost reduction programs and are resorting to digital manufacturing in order to reduce costs further  Let s take a sneak peek at how two major paper and related products stocks  International Paper Company   NYSE IP   and WestRock Company   NYSE WRK   scheduled to report December end quarter earnings before the opening bell on Jan 31  are likely to fare  Predictions for International Paper International Paper delivered an improvement of 54  and 7  in earnings and revenues  respectively  in the third quarter of 2018  Further  both the top and bottom line beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Investors are keen to know whether the company can repeat the feat in fourth quarter 2018  Notably  the company trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  recording average surprise of 6 91   International Paper Company Price and EPS Surprise    Hurricane Florence had a negative impact of  36 million on International Paper s third quarter results  which included  8 million in volume and  28 million in operations  Notably  three mills and three box plants were impacted  The company expects a  15 million impact in the fourth quarter  primarily in the Global Cellulose Fibers business  Distribution costs are trending upwards lately owing to a very tight truck and rail availability as well as higher diesel fuel cost  This along with elevated input costs  fiber  chemicals  energy  and freight  will suppress margins in the to be reported quarter  However  its segments are expected to report growth in both revenues and profits   International Paper s North American Industrial Packaging business has consistently outperformed industry shipments in the first three quarters of 2018  The company is witnessing strong demand across all channels  In the Global Cellulose Fibers business  the company delivered record fluff pulp shipments during the third quarter  despite the impact of Hurricane Florence  Global pulp demand remains strong and demand in the fluff segment continues to grow at 4 5  annually  In the Printing Papers segment  improved global demand will bolster segment revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales for International Paper is currently pegged at  5 856 million for the to be reported quarter  which indicates an increase of 2 5  from the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  1 61  reflecting year over year growth of around 27    Read more    Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for International Paper this earnings season as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   You can see   International Paper has an Earnings ESP of  2 48  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which makes surprise prediction inconclusive  As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Predictions for WestRock WestRock is set to report first quarter fiscal 2019 results  In the trailing four quarters  the company recorded average positive surprise of 5 96   In the last reported quarter  the company s top line showed a 4  improvement and its bottom line surged 48  year over year  Earnings and revenues also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate WestRock Company Price and EPS Surprise    WestRock is likely to benefit from favorable demand  price and mix trends across its paper and packaging businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at  4 6 billion in the fiscal first quarter  projecting year over year growth of 18   WestRock is likely to witness sales growth in its major segments   Consumer Packaging and Corrugated Packaging  Pricing will be higher in both segments as a result of previously announced price increases  However  volumes will be lower owing to seasonality in the consumer business  WestRock projects adjusted segment EBITDA in the to be reported quarter to be between  737 million and  767 million  lower than the  802 million reported in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  EBITDA performance will be aided by the KapStone acquisition  productivity and performance improvement programs along with cost saving actions  However  a scheduled maintenance downtime across corrugated and consumer mills of 60 000 tons  two fewer shipping days in the box business  higher group insurance cost and decline in non cash pension income will impact EBITDA in the to be reported quarter  Further  lost production resulting from the Hurricane Michael will also dent EBITDA  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 81 cents  indicating a year over year decline of 7    Read more    WestRock has a Zacks Rank  3 which combined with a ESP of  0 49  makes earnings

International Paper shares have added about 17 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for International Paper 
While International Paper has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for International Paper was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

176825,398341,IP,Growth   Income Buys   Johnson   Johnson And International Paper ,opinion,"This week s video covers two companies where management has made key decisions for the future of their respective companies  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   and International Paper  IP  
Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   has the largest market capitalization for any U S  healthcare company at just under  330 billion   The company s Q1 earnings report beat both top and bottom line expectations with earnings and revenues improving by  12 6  year over year   Most importantly the Pharma segment  which accounts for almost half of the company s total revenues had sales improve by  19   
But after the earnings report  the stock price began to fall as worries about increasing competition from generic drugs would negatively impact Pharma sales   While JNJ has a nice pipeline of new drugs  and high expectations for its cancer and stroke prevention medications the segment was susceptible to encroachment by generic competitors   To counter this threat  management announced that it has about  50 billion available for acquisitions   Further  management commented that they were not looking to make one big  50 billion splash  rather they were looking to make many smaller acquisitions   These acquisitions are expected to bolster its drug pipeline for the next several years  
To add to this good news  JNJ recently announced that they accepted Platinum Equity s  2 1 billion offer to sell the LifeScan business  diabetes treatments    This deal is expected to close in late 2018   Moreover  management revealed that Fortive Corp made a  2 8 billion offer to purchase the Advanced Sterilization Products Business  which if accepted would close in early 2019  
These proceeds from the sale of these units are expected to go into its acquisition pool  share repurchase program  and to be used for an increased dividend payment   Currently  JNJ is in a very unique group called Dividend Kings  a company that has increased dividend payments each year for the past 50 consecutive years   The company has a current annual dividend yield of  2 94  
Price and Earnings Consensus Graph
As you can see in the graph below  the stock price had been on a steady upwards trend since the third quarter 2015   When the markets peaked in January of 2018  the stock price then fell for the next several months due to generic competition worries Johnson   Johnson Price and Consensus   
Many analysts have stated that JNJ s current stock price provides a great buying opportunity with plenty of upside growth potential   This is due to the sale of underperforming assets  its acquisition power  and strong dividend payment   Overall  the long term outlook for the company is very strong 
International Paper   NYSE IP   has been doing very well for the past several quarters   In its most recent earnings report the company beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates with earnings growing by  59  while revenues improved by about  2    While revenues beat expectations they were not overly impressive  
To improve revenues management announced an increase in pricing for all three of the company s primary products  printing papers  cellulose fibers  and containerboard   This move is expected to accelerate both cash flows and earnings over the next several quarters   Further  in the first four months the company has seen box shipments improve by  1 9    This indicates that the upswing in pricing has not impacted demand and subsequent sales  
The new cash flows are expected to be funneled into a share repurchase initiative and or an increase in the company s dividend   Currently  the company has a  3 3  annual dividend yield  
The new pricing power has caused analyst estimates to increase for the next two quarters  and for FY 18   FY 19  As you can see in the table below  this was not a one time increase in target prices  but estimates have been repeatedly increased over the past 90 days 

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a VGM score of A   Therefore the near and long term outlook for the company is very solid

176849,398365,IP,International Paper s Revised Bid Rejected By Smurfit Kappa,opinion,International Paper Company   NYSE IP   was spurned yet again when its sweetened bid to take over Ireland based Smurfit Kappa was rejected by the European rival  This is the second unsolicited offer within a month by International Paper  indicating its urgency to expand operations beyond North America to capitalize on increasing demand for packaging materials for online shopping The latest proposal included a cash and stock offer of  25 25 in cash  up from the previous offer of  22  along with 0 3 new shares of International Paper for each share of Smurfit  However  Smurfit management summarily rejected the bid citing gross undervaluation On the other hand  International Paper believed that the proposed transaction would have created annual synergies worth at least  450 million  The company reportedly accounts for one in three cardboard boxes manufactured in the United States and the acquisition of Smurfit would have made it a leader in Europe  The combined entity would have gained an unrivalled competitive advantage  benefiting from the rise in demand for packaging materials from the e commerce industry Smurfit has operations in 35 countries across Europe  The company believes that its exposure in varied European markets makes it an enviable candidate for acquisition by other companies if its deal with International Paper fails to materialize Mergers and acquisitions remain a key strategy for International Paper to strengthen its long term business proposition  In North America  the company envisions a large opportunity within its industrial packaging business  which continues to generate the best margins in the industry  It is further taking initiatives to drive margin expansion across the business through inorganic growth At the same time  International Paper is divesting its non core businesses to focus more resources on high return capital projects in its core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth  The company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U S  operations  It believes that it could cater to the markets in China and Asia more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and through exports from the United States and other parts of the world However  International Paper has underperformed the  in the last three months with an average decline of 9 5  against 1 8  gain for the latter  The company has huge pension obligations for substantially all U S  salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1  2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date  Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments  Fluctuations in actual equity market returns  changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow  thereby limiting the positives from its acquisition spree  a primary growth driver  Nevertheless  we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Better ranked stocks in the industry include Fibria Celulose S A    NYSE FBR    Verso Corporation   NYSE VRS   and Veritiv Corporation   NYSE VRTV    each sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Fibria Celulose is currently trading at a forward P E of 12 4x Verso is currently trading at a forward P E of 6 4x Veritiv has a long term earnings growth expectation of 6   It has beaten earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 34 7  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/international-papers-revised-bid-rejected-by-smurfit-kappa-200301070,200301070
176850,398366,IP,Should Value Investors Choose International Paper  IP  Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put International Paper Company   NYSE IP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  International Paper has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  International Paper s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 6 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that International Paper has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 0  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for International Paper stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  International Paper has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  International Paper currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes International Paper a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for International Paper is just 1 2  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 6  which is better than the industry average of 8 0  Clearly  IP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though International Paper might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives IP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below International Paper Company Price and Consensus    Further  the company with long term earnings growth rate of 9 5  sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineInternational Paper is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 17  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past two years  the industry has surpassed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12 months  They re now bigger than Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and even Visa  The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved Zacks  has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which after tying up the second quarter and heading into the Fourth of July Holiday Weekend  sees equities have held up well  but with a first crack in the armor for the QQQ 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate sideways while Crude Oil continues higher short term  The US Dollar Index is weak and looks to continue lower while US Treasuries are also biased lower after a reversal  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk that Emerging Markets may continue to consolidate in the short run 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and QQQ  Their charts are more mixed than they have been with the QQQ showing some signs of weakness on both timeframes while the SPY and IWM are still strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

And that s the rub  Following consolidation  the price can either break to the up or downside  And you never know which it will be  But you can look at other indicators and build a mosaic as to which path might be easier to navigate  That comes from looking at the chart and options flow and open interest 

The chart above shows International Paper s consolidation at the Measured Move  It also shows that momentum is positive  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is positive    both support more upward movement  That s good news  The Bollinger  Bands are pointing higher and all of the SMA s are rising and below the price  More good news  Options Expiry for September next week shows the biggest open interest at the 50 Strike on the Call side  That could drive the price higher 
Questions creep in  though  when you examine the strength of momentum  The RSI is currently pulling back and the MACD is about to cross down  That shows waning momentum  which could be a short term issue as all the other pieces support more upward price action

177034,398550,IP,Will The  Fed Signal Dovish In The Week Ahead ,opinion,"Stocks managed a mid day rebound from a 566 point decline in the DJIA  Among the suggested reasons was more help from central bankers  With a light economic calendar  I expect Fed speculation to compete with earnings in the week ahead  Everyone will be wondering 
Will the Fed signal a dovish tilt  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that everyone would be watching earnings reports carefully  wondering if they could provide a floor for stocks  There was indeed a lot of attention to earnings  but that news did not seem to support the stock market  The stock rebound coincided with a mysterious rally in oil   Could some really have been confused by the shift from the expiring front month contract  Really    You can see the mixed story for stocks from Doug Short s weekly S P 500    With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his full post for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
There is a fairly light economic calendar this week  featuring the FOMC decision on Wednesday  Despite the continuing flow of earnings reports  speculation about the Fed will dominate market discussion until after the meeting  Everyone will be wondering  
Will the Fed signal a dovish tilt  
No one expects a change in rates at this Fed meeting  but the language in the statement will be carefully parsed for signs that the path of future increases will be less aggressive  Here are the key viewpoints 
The Fed is out of touch with the economy  increasing rates at the wrong time  What is needed is more QE 
The Fed must reduce the implied four rate hikes to one or two  in line with market expectations 
Higher U S  interest rates  just as other countries are reducing theirs  will strengthen the dollar  This will hurt the U S  economy as well as provide more pressure on commodities 
Fed policy matters little right now  It is all about oil prices 
The Fed sees a stronger economy than do market participants  There will be no hint of a more dovish policy 
You will see vigorous proponents for each of these viewpoints 
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
On balance the news was pretty good last week 
People are driving more   This is good news since it provides more satisfaction without additional cost   that gas prices are down about seventy four cents per gallon while miles are up 4 3  

ATA truck tonnage improved by 1  over last year  The organization s chief economist    cautioned that the overall results for the year were not that strong  He cited high inventories in the supply chain 

Existing home sales were very strong   the positive effect of changes in regulations  as well as the needed and likely increase in inventory 
High frequency indicators have improved   has an excellent weekly report that includes many items you might otherwise miss  I always read it  and you should  too 
The earnings news has been pretty good   reports the data  Long time earnings expert Brian Gilmartin notes that reports often improve as the season continues 

The Bad
Some of the economic data was disappointing 
Initial jobless claims increased again  this time to 293K  The less volatile four week moving average also moved higher  I watch this closely  It remains at encouraging levels  but the move bears watching 
Housing starts and building permits declined    our go to source on all things housing has the full story  great charts and analysis   that next year will see a reduction in the ratio of multi family starts   was a bit more positive 
Sea container counts remain weaker than last year  Steven Hansen    reports 

The Ugly 
A weakened European Union  Just as the economic issues were looking better  there is a new issue   immigration and open borders     
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  but perhaps someone will identify the errors in   which was widely publicized early in the week 
Please take a look at our   I think you will find the summary fun to read  and the lessons still quite timely 
A Little Fun  
I hope that our annual  will bring a smile to your face  It also might stimulate a few investing ideas  as you recognize how much trends have changed in the last year 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the ten year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of   whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am using our new model  While it is in the same tradition as Oscar and Felix it has a stronger emphasis on asset protection  We have found that the overall market indication is very helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
The new approach improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  It is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short  We have decided that  Oscar  does not fit the new approach  so my marketing department is working on a different name   perhaps a dog breed  a symbol  or a famous fictional character 
The new method is intelligent and careful about new opportunities and quick to exit when there is danger  What fits these characteristics  Suggestions welcome

  A variety of strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis  While we feature the recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting systems  These include approaches helpful in both economic and market timing  He has been very accurate in helping people to stay on the right side of the market 
This week Dwaine published a  helping to identify the probability of future new lows by using the number of times the market broke support  There was a further decline after publication  but history still suggests about a 90  chance that we have seen the worst of it  Dwaine carefully notes that we are moving into the part of history where we have fewer past cases 

The pseudo experts are at it again  with plenty of ill informed recession forecasts  I explain how to find real experts in this post 
I am delighted to note that Bill McBride of Calculated Risk also   He cites his own  very accurate  history on the economy  He has a modest and carefully reasoned argument with a conclusion I strongly endorse 

So right now I expect further growth for the next few years  all the austerity in 2013 concerns me  especially over the next couple of quarters as people adjust to higher payroll taxes  but I think we will avoid contraction    CR 2015 Update  We avoided contraction in 2013   I think the most likely cause of the next recession will be Fed tightening to combat inflation sometime in the future   and residential investment  housing starts  new home sales  will probably turn down well in advance of the recession  In other words  I expect the next recession to be a more normal economic downturn   and I don t expect a recession for a few years 

 refutes those worrying about economic weakness like 2008  Here is a key quote and an interesting chart 

Bottom line  the underpinnings of financial markets look reasonably solid  and that offers the promise that the turmoil in the oil patch will be resolved without plunging the world into another 2008 style crisis 


The Week Ahead
We have a relatively quiet week for economic data  While I highlight the most important items  you can get an excellent comprehensive listing at Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
FOMC rate decision  W   No policy changes or a press conference so the focus will be on language 
Q4 GDP  F   Will it have a  one handle  
New home sales  W   Important read on construction and the economy 
Consumer confidence  T   The Conference Board version has been strong 
Michigan sentiment  F   Will the final read for January maintain the preliminary strength 
Initial Claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends  with emphasis on job losses 
The  B List  includes the following 
Chicago PMI  F   More widely followed when it comes a weekend before the national ISM report  Recent weakness worrisome for many 
Pending home sales  Th   Not as important as new construction  but still a good overall read on the housing market 
Crude oil inventories  W   Attracting a lot more attention these days 
Durable goods orders  Th   Volatile December data  but still important 
No FedSpeak until after the meeting  and then not much  Corporate earnings reports will remain in the spotlight  News from around the world is a continuing wild card  with U S  stock futures often showing big moves in pre market trading 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
We continue both the neutral market forecast  and the bearish lean  We stepped up to about 50  invested in trading programs on Wednesday   not catching the bounce perfectly  but close  There are often plenty of good investments  even in an expected flat market  but the cash has provided a nice cushion for both Oscar and Felix in the last few weeks  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix and Oscar s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com  They appear almost every day at Scutify  follow

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important source  it would be Chuck Carnevale s  on how to avoid  value traps   As he notes  this term is often used quite carelessly  applied to any stock that is cheap on a P E basis but is currently out of favor  Here is a key quote 

The value opportunity occurs when price drops farther than temporary or cyclical fundamental deterioration warrants  In other words  the market overacts to normal cyclicality  This is where focusing on the dividend can identify a value opportunity rather than a value trap  If the dividend continues to rise in spite of cyclicality in earnings  attractive value is created representing opportunity  not a trap 

As always  Chuck provides some great examples

Final Thoughts
Last week I said   Traders may still need some fancy footwork in the next few weeks   That was an understatement  Our trading models were all more aggressive at mid week  but with reduced size  That caution seems reasonable 
Stock traders are taking cues from oil prices  Oil traders are watching stocks  There is plenty of guesswork involved 
Turning to investors  I want to modify last week s two questions 
Is this the start of something big  as so many are warning  The reason for our quant corner is to evaluate the risk of stock declines beyond the  normal  correction of 15 20   We look at fundamental valuation  recession odds  financial risk  and technical concerns  When something is threatening but does not fit these categories  I provide a human element  as I did at the time of the threatened  fiscal cliff   
None of our risk indicators signal danger  

Can we expect mid week help from the Fed 
I doubt it  The Fed world view is quite different from that of most market participants 
More confidence in actual economic data as opposed to market prices 
Much less emphasis on  supporting markets  than most believe 
Little concern about a recession and more concern about tightening labor markets 
Less perceived responsibility for worldwide events  Two mandates are enough ",2016-01-24,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-a-dovish-tilt-from-the-fed-381326,381326

blue line  to Industrial Production Durable Goods  red line One final look at the Durable Goods data in our search for a slowing economy is for inventory buildup  Although this series is noisy  it appears inventory levels have remained relatively constant since the beginning of 2010   however their seems to a general trend towards higher inventory levels in the last 12 months Unadjusted Inventory to Sales RatioCaveat on the Use of Durable GoodsThe data when first released is subject to several months of revision  The revisions currently have been minor   making the initial headline data reasonably accurate in real time The data in this series is not inflation adjusted   and Econintersect adjusts using the appropriate BLS Producer Price Index for durable goods or uses Industrial Production  IP    durable goods sub index which is a non monetary index As in most US Census reports  Econintersect does not agree with the seasonal adjustment methodology used and provides an alternate analysis  The issue is that the exceptionally large recession and subsequent economic roller coaster has caused data distortions that become exaggerated when the seasonal adjustment methodology uses several years of data  Further  Econintersect believes there is a New Normal seasonality and using data prior to the end of the recession for seasonal analysis could provide the wrong conclusion Econintersect determines the month over month change by subtracting the current month s year over year change from the previous month s year over year change  This is the best of the bad options available to determine month over month trends   as the preferred methodology would be to use multi year data  but the New Normal effects and the Great Recession distort historical data  Durable goods expenditure is a major element of GDP  Therefore may pundits look for enlightenment within the durable goods data for economic direction  To illustrate how durable goods new orders and backlog fits into a recession watch  the Fred graph below  produced based on August 2011 data  shows clearly that data trends down preceding a recession  Unfortunately  there are several false indications of recessions More importantly  durable goods as discussed in this post is not the durable goods of the consumer   as it includes business and government consumption while excluding imports  For a better understanding of consumer demand for durable goods  the BEA s Personal Consumption Expenditure s Durable Goods data series should be used Durable goods is not a good economic forecasting tool as it contains too many false warnings of economic contraction ,2013-04-25,Steven

177050,398566,IP,3 Under The Radar Value Stocks,opinion,"It s hard to find good value stocks in today s market  After years of almost uninterrupted bull market  valuations are looking stretched    making them 63 9  higher than their long term average and implying annual returns over the next eight years of just 0 3  

To give you a point of reference  U S  stocks are more expensive today than they were in 2007 and nearly as expensive as they were in 1929 right before two of the biggest bear markets in history 

In order for stocks to grow into their valuations  we d need to see a massive acceleration of earnings growth  But given that today s earnings numbers are already inflated by years of massive share repurchases  I can t say I consider that scenario likely 

Yet value investors need not despair  Here are three solid under radar value stocks that I expect to do well even in a world of overpriced stocks 

Madison Square Garden

I ll start with the Madison Square Garden Company  NASDAQ MSG   the owner of the New York Knicks basketball and New York Rangers hockey franchises  This is a relative value play  sports franchises in general are very much in a bubble  But MSG is vastly underpriced relative to its peers  and I intend to profit as its value  catches up  

The values of premier sports franchises continue to explode  regardless of sport  The New York Yankees and LA Dodgers are estimated by Forbes to be worth  2 5 billion and  2 billion  respectively  and this despite the declining popularity of baseball and its aging viewership  In football  my hometown Dallas Cowboys are estimated to be worth  3 2 billion  though I can t imagine Jerry Jones ever selling  The New England Patriots are worth  2 6 billion  and the Washington Redskins are worth   And these values are for a sport with only 16 regular season games 

I broke out MSG s biggest identifiable assets and businesses and gave my best estimate of their current value  The New York Knicks franchise is probably worth something in the ballpark of  2 billion to  3 billion based on the recent sales price of the LA Clippers  Forbes puts the value at  1 4 billion  but this estimate was made before the Clippers sale  

The New York Rangers are estimated to be worth  1 1 billion  and the value of the Madison Square Garden arena is worth at least the  1 billion recently spent on its renovation  These assets alone put MSG s value at  4 5 billion    5 5 billion or close to its current  5 75 billion market cap  At current prices  you re essentially getting MSG s other businesses including its massive and profitable media empire for free  And using industry comps  MSG s media business is worth close to  2 billion 

Taken together  MSG s major assets and businesses total  6 5 billion    7 5 billion  Based on this very conservative estimate  MSG is worth anywhere from 13  to 30  more than its current market price  And let me stress  these are conservative estimates  It could easily be worth significantly more 

International Paper

Next up is paper and packaging company International Paper Company  NYSE IP   In an age of green awareness  there aren t too many more politically incorrect stocks to own than a paper company  But like it or not  packaging is an important part of the modern economy  particular in the age of internet commerce and home delivery  And paper is a lot greener than some of the alternatives  like Styrofoam 

International Paper trades for just 13 times expected 2015 earnings and 0 77 times sales  That s not half bad in today s market  But International Paper also pays a respectable 2 7  dividend and has been aggressively raising its dividend since 2010  International Paper briefly cut its dividend by 90  during the 2008 2009 meltdown   International Paper has grown its dividend at a 46 2  clip over the past three years  That pace of growth isn t sustainable over the long term  but I still expect solid double digit dividend growth for a long time to come 

But there is one major catalyst that could cause International Paper to soar by 50  100  within the next 12 months    Management has openly considered the idea  and tax experts expect any such planned conversion to be approved by the IRS 

Converting to an MLP structure would allow International Paper to avoid paying federal income tax  would free up plenty of cash flow for tax advantaged cash distributions and share repurchases 

I would never recommend a stock purely because it might reorganize itself as an MLP  That s lazy research and not likely to generate viable returns over time  But in International Paper s case  the stock is an attractive  dividend paying value stock assuming no change of status  Any benefit from an MLP conversion would be icing on the cake 

Lar Espa a

And finally  I ll leave you with one value stock completely off the radar of most investors  Spanish REIT Lar Espa a  Madrid  LRE  

After raising about  400 million in its IPO last year  Lar has invested about  318 million of the proceeds thus far in a collection of high quality Spanish real estate assets  As Spain s economy has modestly recovered over the past year  it s reasonable to assume that Lar s assets are worth at least as much as what it paid  meaning that at a bare minimum Lar should be trading at its IPO price of  10  Yet shares currently trade hands at just  9 18 

It s hard to complain about buying  1 worth of assets for 92 cents  But that is exactly the situation we have today in Lar 

Buying shares of Lar can be tricky and expensive for American investors  so make sure you chat with your broker before placing an order  In my experience  I ve found that Interactive Brokers charges very reasonable commissions for trades in the Spanish market  and in the interest of full disclosure  this is the broker I use both personally and in client accounts to buy shares

177091,398607,IP,Three Research Groups  Views Of China s Manufacturing PMI,opinion,China s manufacturing PMI  flash  unexpectedly increased in July  Production and new orders showed improvement  Is it possible that China s slowdown has ended and manufacturing growth is beginning to re accelerate  Here are views from three research groups that focus heavily on China  1  Goldman is quite bullish  pointing out that this will translate into a strong industrial production number  GS  We see this as a very strong reading  Unlike the official PMI  the HSBC Markit PMI does not have obvious seasonality problems  The index still rose by 1 3 ppt after making a standard x12 seasonal adjustment  This magnitude of rise in one month is significant   Contrary to popular interpretation  the fact that the level of the index was below the 50  threshold does NOT mean manufacturing activities were experiencing negative growth contraction  Conceptually  a sub 50  reading means  there was a larger number of respondents who said their production was down from the month before than those who replied production was up   This is not necessarily the same as  the level of production of all the companies surveyed fell  While the relationship is not totally stable  historically  when the HSBC Markit PMI is at the 50  levels  yoy and mom industrial production  IP  growth tends to be in the low 10  levels  which is a very long way off from a contraction  interestingly  the PMI is more closely correlated with yoy IP despite the fact the survey asks companies about changes compared with the previous month  which should correspond with mom IP   When sequential IP falls to sub zero levels  the PMI would be at around 45    2  HSBC views this as a stimulus driven improvement  pointing to continued weak demand and employment  But they believe that low inflation will allow China to push through more easing and materially improve growth  HSBC   July s headline PMI picked up modestly to a five month high of 49 5  suggesting that the earlier easing measures are starting to work  That said  the below 50 July reading implied demand still remains weak and employment remains under increasing pressure  This calls for more easing efforts to support growth and jobs  We believe the fast falling inflation allows Beijing to do so and a more meaningful improvement of growth is expected in the coming months when these measures fully filter through   3  The ISI Group is not ready to say that the slowdown is over  They also attribute this PMI jump to China s recent easing measures and expect more stimulus to come because of weak demand and employment  But they don t anticipate a material improvement in growth  ISI Group  Finally an uptick but we are not ready to call this the turn   According to HSBC  July s Flash PMI picked up modestly to hit a five month high of 49 5  suggesting that the earlier easing measures are starting to work  However  the below 50 reading implies weak demand and employment pressures  More easing is necessary  This still soft PMI reading is consistent with our below consensus GDP forecast  It is not consistent with a hard landing  We expect the PMI to move roughly sideways in 2012  China s economy is still growing  but no return to the sustained 9 10  growth rates of the past ,2012-07-25,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-research-groups'-views-of-china's-manufacturing-pmi-130808,130808
