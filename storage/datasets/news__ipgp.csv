8707,230222,IPGP,5 Better Tech Picks If You Don t Like Facebook Now,opinion,Spooked by the data breach news  social media giant Facebook   NASDAQ FB   was one of the worst performing stocks on Wall Street in Monday s trading session  This has sparked concerns over increased regulation for large tech companies  triggering a selloff in the hot and soaring technology corner of the broad stock market Both the S P technology index and tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the worst one day fall since the selloff in early February  declining 2 1  and 2 5   respectively What Happened The steep decline came following reports from New York Times and London s Observer  which revealed that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica  which had ties to the Trump campaign  gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million Facebook users  This has sparked broader concerns about data privacy and security  and will likely lead to increased scrutiny over data security and a relatively heavy regulatory pressure As such  shares of Facebook tumbled 6 8  in Monday s trading session  representing the worst one day drop in nearly four years  and wiped out  36 4 billion from the company s market value  With the slide  the stock is down 11 6  from the latest peak  signaling that it has entered correction territory Facebook currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Growth Score of B

media companies including Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Snap   NYSE SNAP   dipped 1 7  and 3 5   respectively Solid Sector OutlookDespite the slide  the outlook for the sector is promising  This is especially true as the tech sector appears fully emerged from the burst of the dot com bubble  The emergence of cutting edge technology such as cloud computing  big data  Internet of Things  wearables  VR headsets  drones  virtual reality  and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts Additionally  the twin tailwinds of Trump s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher  Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology  which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle  With the global economy gathering momentum  technology companies are likely to outperform and less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation Top PicksGiven this  we have highlighted five stocks that are unfazed by the latest tech rout and poised to outperform in the weeks ahead Qualys Inc    NASDAQ QLYS   is

Lasers in particular are displacing conventional technologies because they can do many jobs faster  better and more economically  Finding ways to make products more efficiently is an absolute must for today s manufacturers  That s why I strongly believe photonics and lasers are a must own sector for you and all my other readers 
One sector where photonics has become crucial is communications  Coherent light beams  lasers  have a high bandwidth and can carry far more information than radio or microwave frequencies  Fiber optics allow light carrying data to be piped through cables  replacing old copper cables  an absolute necessity in today s world of big data  cloud computing and video streaming 
Another way photonics has entered our everyday lives is solid state lighting  Light emitting diodes  LEDs  are a high performance  low cost  green alternative to incandescent light bulbs 
Then there is LiDAR  laser radar systems   which is used in the aerospace industry and is crucial for the future success of autonomous vehicles  those self driving cars that are frequently in the news these days 
Photonics technology has become ubiquitous 
Photonics has also become a key component in many manufacturing processes  Think laser welding  drilling and cutting as well as all the precision measurements needed by manufacturers that is provided by lasers 
Lasers Evolution That leads directly to my recommendation   IPG Photonics Corporation  NASDAQ IPGP   a leading developer and manufacturer of high performance fiber   diode lasers and amplifiers for a vast range of industries and applications  Its products are used in industries such as materials processing  communications  medical and biotechnology  science and entertainment  IPG Photonics has been in my  portfolio since late last summer and it s up 44  for us and has a wide path in front of it 
The evolution of lasers in manufacturing is a journey of over half a century  Its ready adoption by manufacturers is largely due to the fact that lasers convert common sources of energy into concentrated  directed beams of energy  To do this  a laser must have an energy source  a way of coupling that energy into the laser cavity  and a method of delivering the resulting laser beam to the workpiece 
The new fiber lasers developed by IPG are vastly superior to the old legacy industrial lasers in every facet of the process 

Energy Source  Instead of using energy sources like lamps or even chemical reactions  fiber lasers use long lived semiconductor diode lasers that efficiently convert electricity into light  Not only is the energy conversion efficiency raised  but frequent servicing and sometimes environmentally unfriendly consumables are eliminated 
Energy Coupling  Conventional laser optical cavities have bulky air or gas filled spaces  Large cavities are necessary due to the inefficiency of gas lasing or the need to insert bulk optical elements within the cavity  Fiber lasers are very compact because they convert semiconductor diode energy into useful laser beams within a fiber no thicker than a human hair 
Laser Beam Delivery  Legacy lasers utilize complex optics to extract the laser beam and deliver it to the workpiece  External steering optics are often needed to deflect the laser output onto its target  In contrast  flexible optical fiber provides a built in  ideal beam delivery system 
Mass Production Possible  Both key fiber laser elements   semiconductor diodes and optical fiber   can easily be mass produced  Quite a contrast from legacy lasers with their bulky hermetic laser cavities  their need for precision optical alignments and ultra flat optical surfaces 

The change is  as the company says  akin to the replacement of vacuum tubes by transistors 
IPG offers  I believe  the best in class laser based systems for high precision welding  cutting  marking  drilling  cladding  and other processing of metal  ceramic  semiconductor and thin films for customers in automotive  aerospace  railway  energy  electronics  consumer and other industries 
Its range of laser products includes ytterbium  erbium  thulium as well as Raman and hybrid fiber crystal lasers  All wattage ranges are there too  low  1 to 99 watts   medium  100 to 999 watts  and high  1 000  watts  output power lasers in wavelengths from 0 3 to 4 5 microns  The lasers can be continuous wave  CW   quasi continuous wave  QCW  or pulsed  The pulsed lasers are available in nanosecond  picosecond and femtosecond ranges 
Among the well known companies using IPG products are  Boeing  NYSE BA   Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC   Toyota Motor Corporation ADR  NYSE TM   BMW  DE BMWG  and Mitsubishi Electric Corp ADR  OTC MIELY  
Additionally  the company recently purchased Innovative Laser Technologies  ILT   This firm has a proven track record producing leading edge systems for medical device manufacturers  one of the fastest growing markets for fine welding and cutting applications  This will greatly aid IPG in its effort to penetrate the market for medical device applications 
Last May  IPG bought Menara Networks  which is an innovator in optical transmission modules and systems  This allows IPG to offer more integrated solutions for the telecommunications industry  In the first quarter of 2017  sales of its telecom products soared by 221  thanks to Menara 
IPG Growing Rapidly Although both North American and European sales grew 20  in the quarter year over year fully 64  of IPG Photonics revenues come from the Asia Pacific region  with another 25  coming from Europe  including Russia  Only 10 5  of its revenues come from North America 
China continues to be a driver of growth with year over year sales growth of 47  for the region and representing nearly 44  of total sales for the firm 
IPG Photonics Corporation reported Q4 2017 adjusted earnings of  1 86 per share beating the top end of estimates by  0 06  The figure was better than the guided range of  1 55  1 80 
Management expects sales to come in a range of  330 to  355 million for the first quarter  Earnings are estimated for  1 62 to  1 87 
IPG s Laser Bright Future Thanks to innovative product portfolio   last summer IPG unveiled the first 120 kilowatt industrial fiber laser   and large patent portfolio  I expect IPG Photonics to continue to outpace the other companies in the laser systems and components sector 
Another huge advantage over the competition is its vertically integrated business model  which allows it to control each and every part of its business from research and development to sales to after sales service  In this type of business  I want the company to continue to innovate 
So a purchase like that of OptiGrate  which help IPG develop new ultra fast pulsed lasers  is what I want to see  I like the fact that IPG is moving into new end markets connected to 3D printing  defense electronics and micro materials processing in addition to the aforementioned communications and medical sectors  This will only add to the momentum from trends such as the miniaturization of electronics and the move of the global auto industry toward the widespread adoption of fiber lasers

8796,230311,IPGP,5 Momentum Stocks To Conquer The Market ,opinion,It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that

million Management expects an increase in operating expenses related to sales and marketing in the fourth quarter VeriSign also raised its domain name base growth rate guidance for 2017  The company now anticipates the same to grow between 2 8  and 3 1   up from its earlier forecast of 2  to 2 75  Going ahead  for the fourth quarter  VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 0 4 million to 0 9 million Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated  com and  net domain industry  The company continues to benefit from strong demand for domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets Rise in bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is also contributing to an increase in domain name registrations  which is a tailwind for the company  Furthermore  the agreement with ICANN  under which the annual fee for a  net domain name registration will be increased from  8 20 to  9 02  effective Feb  1  2018  will drive the company s top line going ahead Moreover  VeriSign s focus to utilize its robust cash flows to return value to investors through share buybacks is a positive However  the negative impact of

international markets Additionally  VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service  DDoS  security market  VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space  Strong demand for VeriSign s cyber security products  following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver  Also an increase in annual fee for a  net domain name registration will drive the company s top line results from next year onward However  the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing

8828,230343,IPGP,Brightcove  BCOV  Q2 Earnings  Is A Surprise In The Cards ,opinion,"Brightcove Inc    NASDAQ BCOV   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 after the closing bell  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 44 44   Moreover  it has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 81 94  
Furthermore  we note that shares of Brightcove have fallen 31 1  in the last one year  substantially underperforming the  s growth of 38 2  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Brightcove is a well known provider of cloud solutions for delivering and monetizing video across connected devices  The company exhibited strong year over year bookings performance in the last reported quarter  despite a significant decrease in its revenue retention rate  primarily among media customers  Back then  the company had stated that it expects this to be a headwind over the next few quarters 
However  we are optimistic that its robust product portfolio and new product enhancements will drive bookings momentum  going forward 
Notably in April  the company launched Brightcove Live   an API driven scalable  cost effective solution to deliver and monetize live broadcasts  events and 24 7 channels  In May  it unveiled a broad set of innovative technologies  including Context Aware Encoding and Dynamic Delivery  Management believes these newly introduced features will continue to garner more customer interest and value for media customers  while purpose built solutions like Social  Audience and Gallery will cater to the needs of enterprises and digital marketers 
We also note that last month  TV Tokyo  one of Japan s leading broadcast networks  selected Brightcove Live for live stream of the Liebherr 2017 World Table Tennis Championships 
For the second quarter  the company expects revenue of  37  37 8 million  with non GAAP loss from operations anticipated to be in the range of  4 2  5 million  Non GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in a range of  0 13  0 15 Brightcove Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Brightcove is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Brightcove currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 19 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Brightcove carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Cypress Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ CY   has an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

emphasize that revenues will be negatively impacted by the business model transition from  upfront  to  ratably  as well as lower initial purchase price of new offerings Improvement in average revenue

8837,230352,IPGP,What s In The Cards For Netgear  NTGR  On Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Netgear  Inc    NASDAQ NTGR   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5 77   Additionally  it has an average positive earnings surprise of 12 72  in the trailing four quarters 
However  we note that shares of networking equipment maker Netgear have decreased 9 7  in the last year  underperforming the  s advance of 4 4  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Netgear designs technologically advanced  branded networking products that address the specific needs of small businesses and home users  We expect the company s strong product portfolio  comprising offerings like its Nighthawk WiFi routers and Arlo home security products  to boost the top line 
In particular  we are positive about the company s launch of the Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitoring Camera  ABC1000   in Jan 2017  Netgear s Arlo segment revenues jumped 150  year over year  driven by Arlo Pro in first quarter 2017 
We believe that Netgear s strength of Arlo and Orbi sales in the retail channel will primarily drive results  Region wise  North America continues to contribute the lion s share  65  of 1Q17 net revenue  
However  the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment  In the first quarter  the company reported a  28 3 million year over year decline in sales to service providers 
For the second quarter  the company expects net revenue of  315  330 million  with GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 5 3 6 3  and non GAAP operating margin in the range of 8 9  NETGEAR  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Netgear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Netgear currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 44 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Netgear carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Cypress Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ CY   has an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see 
IPG Photonics Corp    NASDAQ IPGP   has an Earnings ESP of  3 07  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 33  and a Zacks Rank  1

8845,230360,IPGP,Intel  INTC  To Post Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In Cards ,opinion,Intel Corp   NASDAQ INTC   is set to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 27  Notably  the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 6 95  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 54   Non GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share surged 22  from the year ago quarter but declined 16 5  sequentially Strong year over year earnings growth was driven by 7 2  increase in revenues  which totaled  14 80 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 81 billion  Revenues decreased 9 6  sequentially Intel guided second quarter 2017 revenues of around  14 4 billion      500 million   almost flat sequentially and up 6  year over year  Excluding Intel Security Group business  revenues are projected to grow 11  on a year on year basis The non GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63      2    flat sequentially  R D and MG A expenses are anticipated to amount at around  5 2 billion  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Operating income is projected to be approximately  3 9 billion  while EPS is anticipated to be 68 cents      5 cents   up 15  on a year over year basis Despite the positive guidance  Intel s shares have underperformed the S P 500 on a year to date basis primarily due to rising competition in most of the markets  While the index gained 10 7   the stock has returned a negative 4 2  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayWe note that Intel s growing focus into areas with better growth prospects  such as the artificial intelligence  AI   autonomous car and Internet of Things  IoT  businesses are key catalysts  In this regard  the acquisition of Mobileye  NYSE MBLY  is a significant development that will boost its presence in the autonomous vehicle market However  increasing competition in the data center market is a headwind  Reportedly  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  is collaborating with ARM chip makers  Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   and Cavium  to design ARM based servers  The server will run a major part of the company cloud services going ahead  Additionally  increasing competition from AMD s recently launched EPYC server chip is also a threat   Market research firm  Gartner  stated that worldwide server shipments decreased 4 2  year over year to 2 60 million units in the first quarter of 2017  Moreover  worldwide server revenues declined 4 5   Data from another market research firm  IDC  showed that although server shipments increased 1 4  year over year to 2 21 million units  worldwide server revenues declined 4 6  Sluggish high end  sales affected results  IDC noted that   server market growth continues to slow down with most hyperscale service providers waiting until the second half of the year for deployment of Intel s new Skylake processors  The data center business now comprises a major part of Intel s overall business  29  of 2016 revenues   Hence  a decline in the server shipment and revenues amid intense competition is a major concern for the company Notably  Intel recently launched its Xeon  formerly Skylake  scalable  Purley   a next generation server processor platform  However  it is unlikely to have much positive impact on top line growth in the going to be reported quarter We also note that the top PC makers like HP  Lenovo  and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm s ARM based Snapdragon processor  which intensifies competition for Intel  Moreover  declining  is a major concern for the company Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Intel will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Intel s Earnings ESP is currently  1 47   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 67 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Intel carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks

8865,230380,IPGP,5 Fast Growing Small Caps To Watch,opinion,This is a continuation of filtering through   I love to get ideas and learn about new companies from this list  Although Forbes magazine is well circulated across the country  people are lazy and will not take the effort to go through the companies so here s your chance to go one up on most people  First off  here is a spreadsheet of the top 50 stocks I compiled a couple of months back  Download this   As a quick recap  here is the method Forbes used to compile this list strong sales and earnings growthpublicly traded for at least a yeargenerate annual revenue between  5 million and  1 billionstock price no lower than  5 a shareexcluded financial institutions  REIT s  utilities and limited partnerships5 stocks ranked 11 15 will be looked at today  11 IPG Photonics  IPGP IPG Photonics is a maker of fiber lasers which are used in a wide variety of industries for welding  cutting  drilling and etching  It is used across all industries which gives IPGP the potential to continue capitalizing on its market Here are some video demonstrations that will immediately help you understand what fiber lasers do Last time around   HighlightsContinues to increase gross margins  It s in the 54  range compared to 49  the year before as a result of reducing cost of goods sold Plenty of cash on balance sheet with big decreased in debt  Current ratio of 5 3 High ROE of 19  and CROIC of 45 LowlightsShare count increases every yearFundamentally  IPGP doesnt  have many weaknesses  It is solid  The only concern is the valuation CEO is 73 years old  owns more than 40  and the business depends on himLaser prices are going down which could lead to drop in marginsValuation Valuing IPGP is difficult because the company has never been at a consistent level  From 2005 to 2009  IPGP was in growth and investing mode  It wasn t until 2010 when the company started to really reap rewards and the growth has been huge since then  Thus the difficulty in trying to come up with a fair value  Discounted Cash Flow FCF isn t a good metric to use for IPGP because of the heavy investment during its growing phase  Capex in 2005  2006 and 2007 was  16m   20m and  34m respectively  Those are some big jumps  For IPGP  owner earnings is the better number to use as it eliminates working capital and adds back items such as depreciation and deferred taxes that should not be included  IPGP has also performed extremely well over the past 5 years compared to its history  It has achieved an organic 15 4  ROE coming from healthy margin increases  See the  to see how it is calculated and download the spreadsheet too  Using a discount rate of 12  and a growth rate of 16   I get a value of  70  Graham Valuation Analysts are predicting an EPS of  3 16  Using the Ben Graham formula  I get a value of  83  Katsenelson PE Valuation The current PE of 23 assumes that IPGP has an expected growth rate of 25   I believe this is too high so I ve made an adjustment by entering the starting PE to equal 20  earnings growth which has been the historical growth rate  This gives a fair value of  70  If this is confusing to you  don t worry  I ve written a detailed step by step tutorial on the   This gives a valuation range of between  70 and  83 based on the assumption that IPGP can continue its growth of at least 16  going forward  If the company is unable to achieve such growth  then expect a hair cut on the stock price  which is what I will wait for     12 United Therapeutics  UTHR United Therapeutics is a biotech company that focuses on developing drugs for small niches with unmet needs  Their main drug targets a high blood pressure disease between the heart and lungs  The disease occurs in young woman with an estimated 30 000 being treated in the United States It s a small market and because of the unfulfilled needs  the pricing power is astronomically high HighlightsAverage revenue growth of 37  for the past 10 years but slowed down to 23  the past two years100  recession proofReduction in SG ALowlightsR D investment is decreasingIncreased long term debt despite strong financial positionLots of gains in the  non cash items  lineRepurchased a big chunk of stock at its highest stock priceValuationI am going to admit that I don t know how to value UTHR The company has experienced huge growth but there are some signs of slowing down  What s more  for the growth  the finance ratios also fall into value territory Check out some of these numbers EV EBITDA of 6P FCF of 13P B of 2 5ROE of 18 CROIC of 21 Strong Piostroski score of 7  13 Air Methods  AIRM Air Methods is the largest provider in the air medical transportation industry  It s a good business  People need emergency transport services and if you live in a rural area  you need air transport to quickly get you to a hospital The business is not easy to replicate either  You need a fleet or helicopters  national network of bases and pilots and trained medical staff Like United Therapeutics  you can see why Air Methods business is consistent and recession proof Some numbers to get you interested  HighlightsRecession proof business  Posted increases in revenue during recessions Gross profit at all time highs of 42 Operating profit at all time highs of 20 CROIC of 12 LowlightsBig debt increase from 2011 increased from 97 7 in 2010 to 118 in 2012Valuation ratios no longer show anything on the value sideROE of 30   more on this below and why a high ROE is included in the lowlights Some RatiosPE of 22EV EBITDA of 25Price to tangible book value of 19Piotroski score of 8ROE of 30  due to increases in debtFor most solid companies  ROE and CROIC come out similar  For AIRM however  ROE is much higher than CROIC  Upon looking at it further via the DuPont analysis  it shows that a major source of AIRM s ROE comes from its debt increase  ROE is increasing due to debt If I adjust the equity multiplier in 2010 from 3 73 to a normal value of 2 6  the ROE drops to 21 6   Still good  but it is much lower than 31  showing that ROE is likely inflated at the moment    14 Allegiant Travel  ALGT   Allegiant Travel is the only airline I would be willing to own  ALGT operates a low cost passenger airline marketed to leisure travelers in small cities  For now  I will chalk it up as another investment miss   back in early 2012 and the business has continued to operate superbly  I highly recommend you to read the article to get a better understanding of how they are different to other airlines  Highlights40 profitable quarters  Unbelievable for an airline but true Revenue growth every year even during recession and 9 11Strong financial position   low debt and plenty of assets for an airlinePiotroski score of 7No signs of earnings manipulation according to the Altman and LowlightsPriced at a premium to all its competitorsHigh and fixed capexCash conversion cycle is higher than competition  Currently at 6 but LUV is at  17 as airlines get paid upfront for tickets  across the financial statementsDownload the PDF dashboard for AIRM  Valuation Although ALGT is profitable  cash flows are still inconsistent which means a DCF is going to be difficult  With a projected EPS of  5 18 and growth rate of 11   the Graham valuation shows a fair value of  121  With ALGT trading at a premium  the absolute PE valuation model shows that ALGT can go as high up as  110 with a fair value PE of 27  Here is another range of values using utilizing an   Looks like the current price points towards a slight over valuation and nearing towards the aggressive assumptions   15 Syntel  SYNT Finding Syntel is a pleasant surprise  The business centers on outsourcing their skills to global companies as opposed to outsourcing staff to companies which is a much lower margin business In a nutshell  Syntel will develop custom software applications according to a customers specifications related to their business There are plenty of these companies all around the world  but it is surprising to see how Syntel has achieved such success in such a competitive field HighlightsSurprised to see Syntel posting increases in revenue for the past 10 years even during the recessionStrong gross margins averaging 43  over past 5 years and net margin averaging 23 Has grown book value for 7 years without any debtA big cash flow generatorExcellent ROE of 32  and CROIC of 100  Strongest among competitors INFY  IGTE  CTSH and WITLowlightsLots of accruals in the balance sheet and cash flow statement  A high balance sheet accrual also leads to a high ROE Low Piotroski score of 5Dividend yield is a tiny 0 36 Highly dependent on a small number of customersJust by looking at the company quickly  the numbers can look too good to be trueValuationWith such strong fundamentals and exponential growth to date  how do you go about valuing a company like SYNT It obviously has excellent numbers but would I confident in assigning a growth rate of around 20  going forward If I m going to assume an aggressive case of 20  growth  then the valuation I get is around  130 using the DCF method   136 using the Graham formula and  100 with the Absolute PE method That s about a 80   100  upside from current prices Other competitors are of lower quality but priced higher  so if you do a relative valuation  the fair value is around  80 Doing an EBIT valuation which only looks at a maximum of one year going forward  the valuation range is between  32 to  72 That s a wide valuation range  and at this point  I d rather keep an eye on it to see what a normal operating business level is as opposed to riding the wave up not knowing when it is going to end That goes for the rest of the stocks mentioned here  High flying companies that are operating at its peak so there could be a chance that it will come down at which point it would be a very compelling investment opportunity Disclosure  No positions,2013-03-27,Jae

8866,230381,IPGP,Performance Of The Best Small Companies Updated  BRLI  IPGP  SYNA,opinion,"Because by the time you get to  B   you re already burned out and probably sick of investing 
Buffett s advice in theory is excellent 
But you can t ask a man to run a marathon from day one 
Before you can even think about tackling every company from A Z  there are steps  processes and small victories you need to accomplish before you can take on the monster 
That s why the Forbes Best 100 Small Companies list and other stock ideas sites are wonderful places to get ideas and training yourself getting into the habit of going through lots of companies 
If you re fairly new to old school value  here s a rundown of what the Forbes stocks are 
Here s  when the 2013 list came out 
Forbes Stock Picking Methodology
The methodology used to pick the stocks that make the list is quite simple 
annual revenue between  5 million and  1 billion
stock price no lower than  5 a share
excluded financial institutions  REITs  utilities and limited partnerships
rankings are based on earnings growth  sales growth and return on equity in the past 12 months and over five years
dropped thinly traded names and those with fuzzy accounting or major legal troubles
factored in stock performance versus each company s peer group during the last year as of Oct  1
financial data is pulled from Reuters
fundamentals via FactSet

The reason I always tell people that this is a good list to start with is because the people at Forbes did a lot of work for you 
Ranking stocks based on sales  ROE etc is easy 
But look at points 5 and 6 

dropped thinly traded names and those with fuzzy accounting or major legal troubles
factored in stock performance versus each company s peer group during the last year as of Oct  1

They just saved you over 20 hours of work right there 
Performance of the Best Small Stocks
 
Performance Update of the Best Small Companies
Although I keep repeating  small stocks   all of these companies are liquid and large enough for regular investors to buy 
There are plenty of stocks in the billion dollar market cap range 
The small company on the list is RF Industries  NASDAQ RFIL  at  41m market cap  But then again  I laid out a plan on  
Getting back to the stats  out of 100 stocks  57 are showing positive returns and 43 are negative 
That s a 57  winning percentage 
Not bad 
Here s a look at the top and bottom 10 

The main takeaway I see from the top 10 and bottom 10 is that the rankings really don t matter 
Only 2 of the top 10 are ranked higher than 10  And none of the stocks in the bottom 10 are lower than rank 90  Just goes to show that you need to do the work in filtering out the good and the bad 
Keep in mind that these results are based on only 9 months of performance  But seeing how the list is refreshed each year  if the majority of stocks are winning by October  then it s another successful year for this stock list

8877,230392,IPGP,5 GARP Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"Growth at a reasonable price  or GARP  provides an excellent opportunity for investors who are interested in deriving healthy returns  Investors following GARP seek to acquire stocks that have solid growth prospects but are available at discounted prices  Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 
GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
Growth Metrics
Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  they choose stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 
Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flows get precedence in GARP investing 
Value Metrics 
GARP investing gives precedence to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style chooses stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  they avoid picking companies with extremely high P E ratios 
Moreover  price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered in GARP investing 
Using GARP principles  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer good returns in the near term 
Screening Parameters
Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only five 
Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen 
Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO   provides analytical instruments  equipment  reagents and consumables  software  and services for research  manufacturing  analysis  discovery  and diagnostics  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 2 1  
Arch Capital Group Ltd    NASDAQ ACGL   is a diversified financial services holding company  with an emphasis on the insurance sector  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 3

8891,230406,IPGP,Stocks   S P 500 Closes Higher Amid Trade Optimism  Tech Rebound,news,"Investing com   The S P 500 closed higher as investors cheered a report that the U S  and China were in talks to avert full blown trade war 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0 43   The S P 500 rose 0 49   while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0 55  
Bloomberg reported  citing sources  the U S  and China are trying to restart talks on trade to avert a full blown trade war between the world s two largest economies 
The prospect of the U S  and China returning to the negotiation table to reconcile their differences on trade sent trade sensitive stocks sharply higher  helping the broader market snap a three day losing streak 
3M  NYSE MMM    Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and Boeing  NYSE BA  stocks   notable names most sensitive to escalating trade conflagrations   closed sharply higher 
Investor optimism on the trade war front comes as the next wave of tariffs on imported goods from China is expected to come into effect Wednesday  with China vowing to retaliate in kind 
The broader averages were also supported by a rise in tech for the first time in at least two sessions as a cluster of closely watched tech stocks rebounded   Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  stocks posted gains for the day 
Energy stocks kept a lid on gains  however  as oil prices settled sharply lower  posting their biggest monthly loss since 2016 amid easing expectations for steep losses of Iranian crude from the market 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September fell 1 9  to settle at  68 80 a barrel 
Ahead of the Federal Reserve s decision on interest rates due Wednesday  market participants digested a raft of economic data showing inflation remained close to the Fed s 2  target and upbeat consumer confidence 
The Federal Reserve s preferred inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index excluding food and energy  rose 0 1  in June and rose 1 9  in the 12 months through June 
That did little to alter investor expectations for an unchanged decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool
