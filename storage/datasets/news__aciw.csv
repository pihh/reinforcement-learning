and Select Interior Concepts Inc    NASDAQ SIC   5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength to Maximize Your Gains In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of

111018,332533,ACIW,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Marcus  SkyWest  Acme And ACI,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 1  2019   Stocks in this week s article The Marcus Corp    NYSE MCS    SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    Acme United Corp    NYSE ACU   and ACI Worldwide Inc    NASDAQ ACIW   Look Beyond Earnings  Bet on 4 Stocks with Rising Cash FlowsWe are in the busiest week of this reporting cycle  and putting your hard earned money in stocks with high profits and earnings surprises is trendy  But looking beyond profits and figuring out whether they are being efficiently channeled to the company s reserves can be a lot more rewarding  This is because  even though profit is a company s goal  cash is its lifeblood for existence and a measure of resiliency In fact  a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flow and might go bankrupt while meeting its obligations  But a company with a healthy cash level not only enjoys the flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine  but also weathers any market mayhem  Therefore  looking at a company s ability to produce cash is important in terms of protecting your money in addition to multiplying it To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the

111039,332554,ACIW,Look Beyond Earnings  Bet On 4 Stocks With Rising Cash Flows,opinion,We are in the busiest week of this reporting cycle  and putting your hard earned money in stocks with high profits and earnings surprises is trendy  But looking beyond profits and figuring out whether they are being efficiently channeled to the company s reserves can be a lot more rewarding  This is because  even though profit is a company s goal  cash is its lifeblood for existence and a measure of resiliency In fact  a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flow and might go bankrupt while meeting its obligations  But a company with a healthy cash level not only enjoys the flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine  but also weathers any market mayhem  Therefore  looking at a company s ability to produce cash is important in terms of protecting your money in addition to multiplying it To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time In addition to this we chose Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company s future performance Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This sieves out low priced stocks  of B or better  This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks  Importantly  this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry categories Here are four out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening The Marcus Corporation   NYSE MCS    headquartered in Milwaukee  WI

nearly 5 1  year over year  The figure was within management s guided range of  460  480 million Moreover  deferred revenue increased 18  to  1 80 billion in the quarter  which reflects growing strength of the business model  Autodesk  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Management continues to emphasize that revenues  in the near term  will be impacted by the business model transition as revenues are now recognized  ratably  as against realized  upfront  earlier on Total recurring revenue was 90  in the reported quarter a significant increase from 72  reported in the year ago quarter  Moreover  Autodesk continues to make meaningful progress in converting non paying users into subscribers  The company s 30  discount promotional offer added 26K product subscriptions during the quarter We believe that the development is positive as it improves revenue visibility and growth trajectory in the long haul  Further  improving average revenue per subscriptions  ARPS  owing to price increases as well as lesser discounts related to shift from legacy maintenance plans to product subscriptions will drive growth in second half fiscal 2018 Shares were up almost 10  in after hour trading  We note that shares of Autodesk have outperformed the S P 500 on a year to date basis  While the stock gained 37 8   the index returned 5 5   Top line DetailsRevenues were impacted by a 65 7  year over year decline in License revenues  10  of total revenue   which were  48 7 million in the quarter Maintenance revenues  54 3  of total revenue  also declined 7 3  from the year ago quarter to  263 6 million  primarily due to lower subscriptions  However  the decline was better than management s anticipation  At the end of the first quarter  the company had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers However  subscription revenues soared 102 8  year over year to  173 4 million  The company stated that demand for the core engineering product was strong as evident from 170  year over year growth in product subscriptions Total subscriptions increased approximately 186K from the prior quarter to 3 29 million in the quarter  Subscription plan  product  end of life and cloud subscriptions  increased approximately 233K from the last quarter to 1 32 million New customers represented about a third of the company s new product subscriptions in the quarter  New enterprise customers  growth was also strong as evident from the 44K subscription additions in the quarter  10  more from the prior year quarter Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth  improving more than four times from the year ago quarter driven by robust performance from BIM 360 and Fusion tools Total annualized recurring revenue  ARR  was  1 74 billion  up 18  from the

declined 6  to  190 million  while the same in APAC decreased 6  from the year ago quarter to  86 million Operating ResultsGross margin contracted 40 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter to 85 8   primarily due to massive contraction in license gross margins Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased 570 bps to 105 1   primarily due to higher marketing   sales  up 560 bps  and research   development  up 80 bps  expenses  partially offset by lower general   administrative expense  down 70 bps  Operating loss widened to  98 5 million as compared with  78 6 million reported in

Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of  1 38 on revenues of  2 03 billion Autodesk projects subscription additions to be between 600K and 650K  Total ARR is still expected to be 24  to 26   The company expects to keep non GAAP spend unchanged on a year over year basis Management expects maintenance plan subscriptions to continue to decline going forward  The rate of decline will vary and will depend on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal  the renewal rate at the time and the company s ability to shift maintenance planned customers to product subscriptions Our TakeAutodesk s business transition from licenses to cloud based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting subscriptions and deferred revenues  We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets However  in the near term  the company s financials may also be affected by increasing investments in cloud based

million at the end of the fiscal second quarter Management is optimistic about Creative Cloud adoption and expects to build a strong pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through

driving higher ARPU through cloud services like Adobe Stock  Also  Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new customer traffic and strong customer adoption Within the Digital Marketing segment  Adobe Marketing Cloud revenues were up 18  year over year to  385 million  The improvement came on the back of an increase in the size of transactions  number of solutions per customer  international expansion and growth in partner driven business  Moreover  multi solution adoption is increasing the size of customer engagements  Bookings in this segment also increased on a year over year basis MarginsGross margin was 85 6   down 9 basis points  bps  sequentially but up 149 bps year over year  Gross margin is typical of a software company and variations are generally related to the mix of revenues between categories Adobe incurred adjusted operating expenses of  820 3 million  down 2 5  sequentially but up 10 4  year over year  As a percentage of sales  research   development  general

 5 8 billion for revenues   2 for GAAP EPS and  2 80 for non GAAP EPS Our RecommendationAdobe reported strong fiscal second quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate We remain positive about Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  including CS cloud initiative and digital media products   continued innovation and strong balance sheet We believe that the company is being driven by continuous innovation in its Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses After the successful transition from traditional license to subscription based services  Adobe wants to establish its presence in cloud related software areas like documents and marketing  In this regard  the company has been introducing significant features and a number of updates to its Document Cloud In addition  we believe that constant adoption of the Adobe marketing could serves as a potential catalyst  Moreover  the solid adoption of Document Cloud  a new subscription package to enable users to sign documents on the cloud  will boost revenues Adobe carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the technology sector are CommVault Systems

111127,332642,ACIW,In Depth Look At ACI Worldwide,opinion,"Acquisitions can boost accounting earnings while destroying shareholder value  a fact illustrated by the high low fallacy  This week s Danger Zone pick began a large acquisition spree in 2012  which continued through 2015  On the surface  everything seems on the up and up  However  when we peer below the surface  we find that the fundamentals of the business are headed in the wrong direction  For this reason and more  ACI Worldwide  NASDAQ ACIW  not only landed on June s Most Dangerous Stocks list  but is this week s Danger Zone pick 
Acquisitions Have Destroyed Shareholder Value
Since 2012  ACI Worldwide has completed eight separate acquisitions at a cumulative cost of  1 4 billion  These acquisitions stoked revenue  which grew 22  compounded annually from 2011 2015  However  these acquisitions came at the expense of economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  which declined from  10 million in 2011 to   26 million in 2015  Economic earnings have fallen even further  to   48 million  over the trailing twelve months  TTM   Figure 1 shows the divergence of revenue and economic earnings  See the reconciliation of ACI Worldwide s GAAP net income to economic earnings  
Figure 1  Disconnect Between Revenue and Economic Earnings

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
These acquisitions have been an inefficient use of capital  ACI Worldwide s return on invested capital  ROIC  has fallen from 11  in 2011 to a bottom quintile 4  over the last twelve months 
Worse yet  ACI Worldwide s total debt  which includes off balance sheet operating leases  has grown from  128 million in 2011 to  825 million  34  of market cap  TTM  Over the same time  ACIW s shares outstanding have increased from 39 million to 116 million  ACIW funded its acquisition based growth at the expense of shareholders and has no profits to show for these actions 
Non GAAP Earnings Overstate Business Operations
Investors must be aware of the dangers of non GAAP earnings as they routinely remove standard costs of doing business  thereby creating a more positive picture of business operations  Here are expenses ACIW has removed when calculating its non GAAP metrics  including non GAAP revenue  non GAAP operating income  adjusted EBITDA  and non GAAP net income 
Employee related actions
Facility closure expenses
Professional fees
Data center move expenses
Transition and technology costs
By removing these costs  ACIW is able to report non GAAP results that are better than the company s true profits  While non GAAP and GAAP net income grew in 2015 year over year  ACIW s after tax profit  NOPAT   the normal  after tax cash flow  declined 17  to  96 million  TTM NOPAT has fallen even further  to  78 million 
Longer term  ACIW s non GAAP net income has grown from  50 million in 2011 to  95 million in 2015  In contrast  economic earnings have declined from  10 million in 2011 to   26 million in 2015  per Figure 2

The payment and banking market is highly competitive and ACIW identifies several competitors across each of its business segments  As noted in the company s 10 K  competition comes from First Data Corp  NYSE FDC   Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV   Jack Henry   Associates  NASDAQ JKHY   Nelnet  NYSE NNI  and Western Union  NYSE WU   among others  These competitors are in addition to private service providers and in house technology departments of potential customers  Per Figure 3  it is clear that much of the competition ACIW faces have higher margins and ROICs  ACIW recognizes that competitive factors in the market include price and commitment to continued R D  However  having a lower margin and ROIC than most of its competition means that ACIW has less price flexibility and could also mean the firm has less ability to invest in R D to improve its offerings

Bull Hopes Rest On Optimistic Assumptions Regarding Backlog Value
As revenue growth has slowed since 2014  as can be seen in Figure 1  bulls are left with few options  rely on ACIW s ability to grow without acquisition and or believe that the acquisitions will start adding economic value in the near future  Unfortunately for investors  growth without acquisition has been hard to come by  as the company s TTM revenue is only marginally higher than 2014 revenue and organic revenue growth has been in the low single digits or  worse yet negative  as it was in 2014  Consensus estimates for revenue do not point to much of an improvement 
Buying into the potential profits windfalls from the recent acquisitions requires large assumptions  ones that are no sure bet  Specifically  we re talking about ACIW s 60 month backlog  which is essentially ACIW s expected revenue over the next 60 months from existing contracts  We previously saw a backlog valuation prop up SolarCity s  NASDAQ SCTY  stock s valuation when analyzing its  retained value  metric  Though the business models are different  both backlogs require optimistic assumptions to justify their value 
Specifically  the key assumptions for ACIW s 60 month backlog include 
Maintenance fees are assumed to exist for duration of license term  even if committed maintenance term is less than license term 
Non recurring license agreements are assumed to renew as recurring revenue streams 
Foreign currency exchange rates are assumed to remain constant over the 60 month period
Pricing policies and practices are assumed to remain constant
License  facilities management and software hosting are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term at a rate consistent with historical experiences 
While on their own  each assumption may not be hard to trust  But  bulls are taking a lot of risk that all assumptions will hold true over such an extended time  If the backlog is overstated  the future profitability of ACIW could be viewed much lower  which likely hurt the stock  As we ll show below  the current valuation implies revenue and profit growth much faster than what has occurred in the past and well above consensus expectations 
Acquisition Hopes Rest On Overpayment
The biggest risk to our thesis is that a larger competitor acquires ACIW at a value at or above today s price  As we ll show below  unless a competitor is willing to destroy shareholder value  an acquisition at current prices would be unwise 
We don t think ACIW is an attractive acquisition target at its current price  To begin  ACIW has liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 
 72 million in off balance sheet operating leases  3  of market cap 
 39 million in outstanding employee stock options  1  of market cap 
After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Unfortunately for investors  only in the most optimistic of scenarios is ACIW worth more than the current share price 
Figures 4 and 5 show what we think Fiserv should pay for ACIW to ensure the deal is truly accretive to ACIW s shareholder value  Fiserv could be a potential acquirer of ACI Worldwide to jump start its software as a service offerings and boost its cross selling opportunities within the financial services and payments market  However  there are limits on how much FISV would pay for ACIW to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired 
Each implied price is based on a  goal ROIC  assuming different levels of revenue growth  4   7   and 10   These revenue levels are equal to or higher than the consensus estimate for 2017  4    In each scenario  we conservatively assume that Fiserv can grow ACIW s revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  We also assume ACIW achieves a 14  NOPAT margin  This margin is nearly double ACIW s current margin and slightly below FISV s NOPAT margin  which is boosted by its Financials segment  ACIW s current NOPAT margin is 7 5 
Figure 4  Implied Acquisition Prices For FISV To Achieve 7  ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 4 shows the  goal ROIC  for FISV as its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  or 7   Only if ACI Worldwide can grow revenue 10  compounded annually with a 14  NOPAT margin for the next five years is the firm worth more than its current price of  21 share  For reference  consensus estimates expect ACI Worldwide s revenue to decline in 2016 and grow by 4  in 2017  We include the 10  scenario to provide a best case view  Note that any deal that only achieves a 7  ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive  as the return on the deal would equal FISV s WACC 
Figure 5  Implied Acquisition Prices For FISV To Achieve 12  ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 5 shows the next  goal ROIC  of 12   which is Fiserv s current ROIC  Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to FISV shareholders  Even in the best case growth scenario  the most FISV should pay for ACIW is  10 share  52  downside   Any deal above  10 share would lower FISV s ROIC 
Optimism Remains Baked Into Stock Price Without Acquisition
As we show above  significant optimism is priced into ACIW  Without acquisitions  the profit growth expectations in the current stock look unrealistically high  Specifically  to justify the current price  ACIW must maintain its TTM NOPAT margin of 7 5  and grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the next 12 years to justify its current price of  21 share  For reference  ACIW s NOPAT fell 17  year over year in 2015 to  96 million  Over the trailing twelve months  NOPAT has fallen even further to  78 million  Also in this scenario  ACIW would be growing revenue 12  compounded annually  despite ACIW management guiding for 4 7  organic revenue growth in 2016  achieving only 3  organic revenue growth in 2015  and a  2  organic revenue decline in 2014 
Even if we assume ACIW can grow revenue at the top end of 2016 guidance indefinitely  the stock is still overvalued  If ACIW can maintain TTM NOPAT margins and grow NOPAT by 5  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  9 share today   a 57  downside  Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  an assumption that is unlikely  but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario  For reference  since 2010  ACIW s invested capital has grown on average  282 million  27  of 2015 revenue  per year  Long term  over the past decade  ACIW s invested capital has grown on average by  159 million  15  of 2015 revenue  per year 
Catalyst  Backlog Falls Short  Investors Tire Of Dilution
Over the past five years  ACIW is up nearly 100   as investors have largely ignored the destructive nature of ACIW s acquisitions  Over this same time though  revenue has been growing at a fast pace  and GAAP net income has steadily increased  However  the tides may be turning  as ACIW has made no acquisitions in 2016  and revenue will rely on organic growth moving forward  If ACIW is unable to meet market expectations  we could see the stock fall sharply considering the high expectations embedded in the current price 
Additionally  as alluded to earlier  if ACIW s 60 month backlog fails to increase  or fails to actually convert into tangible revenues  and profits   investors will be forced to re evaluate ACIW s valuation  As shown in Figure 1  the economics of the business are in decline  and if top line growth or backlog growth can no longer mask that  we may see ACIW fall to more rational levels 
Lastly  in an effort to spur further top line growth  ACIW may turn to another acquisition  In this case  investors may be unwilling to accept further shareholder dilution  which has failed  to this point  to create any additional shareholder value  In this case  investors could jump ship and find better investments in companies focused on creating shareholder value 
Insider Sales and Short Interest Remains Low
Over the past 12 months 222 thousand shares have been purchased and 317 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 95 thousand insider shares sold  These sales represent  1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 5 9 million shares sold short  or just over 5  of shares outstanding 
Executives Are Held Accountable  Albeit To Poor Metrics
ACI Worldwide executives receive annual cash bonuses for achieving operating income and new sales bookings  net of term extension  SNET  goals  In 2015  executives failed to meet these goals and as such  no payout was made under the cash incentive program  On the surface this would appear a positive development in executive compensation 
However  it must be noted that  in order to enhance retention of MIC plan participants and incent continued shareholder value creation   the compensation committee granted retention awards  worth 49  of the value that would have been paid if ACIW met its operating income and SNET goals 
Additionally  in order to  recognize the increase in shareholder value   the committee awarded performance based shares to replace the 2013 and 2014 long term incentive program that would not meet its goals  These shares now vest based on 2015 and 2016 EBITDA targets 
Both short term and long term bonuses are given based on metrics that don t directly equate to profits or shareholder value creation  The best way to create shareholder value  and align executives with the best interest of shareholders  is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC  The reason for using ROIC as the target metric is that there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to ACI Worldwide s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  83 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  11 million in non operating expenses  1  of revenue   We removed  47 million related to non operating expenses and  36 million related to non operating income  See all adjustments made to ACIW s income statement  
Balance Sheet  we made  717 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  97 million  The most notable adjustment was  169 million  11  of net assets  related to midyear acquisitions  See all adjustments to ACIW s balance sheet  
Valuation  we made  906 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  822 million  One of the largest adjustments  was the removal of  825 million  34  of market cap  due to total debt  which includes  72 million in off balance sheet debt

111158,332673,ACIW, New Stocks Make Most Attractive Dangerous Lists For August,opinion,"Our Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks for August were made available to the public at midnight on Monday  July saw some strong performances from our picks  Most Attractive Large Cap stock PetSmart  NASDAQ PETM  gained 14   and  Neustar  NYSE NSR  was up 6  
Our Most Dangerous Stocks   5 9   fell by more than the S P 500   2 2   and outperformed as a short portfolio  Most Dangerous Small Cap stock Real Page  NASDAQ RP  fell by 29   In total  12 out of the 40 Most Dangerous stocks last month fell by over 10  
These successes underscore the benefit of our diligence  Being a true value investor is an increasingly difficult  if not impossible  task  By scrupulously analyzing every word in annual reports  our research protects investors  portfolios and allows our clients to execute value investing strategies with more confidence and integrity 
10 new stocks make our Most Attractive list and 7 new stocks fall onto the Most Dangerous list this month 
Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising return on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios  Most Dangerous stocks have misleading earnings and long growth appreciation periods implied in their market valuations 
Most Attractive Stock Feature For July  NetApp  NTAP    39 share 
NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for August  Investors have soured on this stock over the past year as revenue growth has slowed  In its focus on the top line  the market seems to have missed the excellent cash flows and cheap valuation of this data storage provider 
NTAP has done something really impressive over the past couple years  It has increased after tax profit  NOPAT  while significantly reducing its invested capital  Figure 1 has the details 
Last year  NTAP earned an ROIC of 43   the highest of any data storage company we cover  NTAP s significantly improved gross margin up from 59  to 62  allowed it to grow NOPAT significantly even though revenue was flat for the year 
Since NTAP increased profits while decreasing invested capital in 2014  it also earned its highest free cash flow in the history of our model  which dates back to 1998  Figure 1 has the details 
Figure 1   Record Free Cash Flow

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
NTAP generated nearly  1 billion in free cash flow  which allowed it to pay down over half of its debt and repurchase over 10  of its shares  which leaves existing shareholders with much greater equity 
Even after using all that cash  NTAP still has  4 7 billion in excess cash against only  1 2 billion in debt  NTAP s cash position gives it the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities or continue to buyback its undervalued stock 
Despite its improving profitability  the market seems to be focused on NTAP s lack of revenue growth  At its current valuation of   39 share  NTAP has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of just 1 1  This ratio implies that the market expects NTAP to grow NOPAT by no more than 10  from its current level for the remainder of its corporate life 
Those expectations seem too low  NTAP has grown NOPAT by 27  compounded annually over the past five years  and while I don t expect that rapid profit growth to continue long term  it also seems unlikely that profits will suddenly stagnate forever 
In a market as expensive as this one  it s rare to find a company with a high and growing ROIC that trades as cheaply as NTAP 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature For July  ACI Worldwid  ACIW   19 share 
ACI Worldwide  NASDAQ ACIW  is one of the additions to the Most Dangerous list this month  Acquisition driven earnings growth disguises the lack of true profitability of this business 
In six out of the past seven years  ACIW has earned negative economic earnings  which means its ROIC has been lower than its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  
Large acquisitions in 2012 and 2013 have increased reported earnings significantly  and sent the stock up over 100    but economic earnings tell a different story  ACIW s  600 million acquisition of S1 Corporation in 2012 helped it to achieve significant revenue and earnings growth  but ROIC actually fell from 11  to 7   ACIW s acquisitions may have been  earnings accretive   but in reality they destroyed value for shareholders 
These acquisitions also have taken a toll on ACIW s balance sheet  In 2011  the company had a positive net cash position  but now it has very little excess cash and over  800 million in debt  39  of market cap   It will be much more difficult for ACIW to fund any further growth opportunities  especially value destroying acquisitions 
Unfortunately  ACIW needs to grow profits rapidly if it is going to maintain its lofty valuation  In order to justify its current valuation of   19 share  ACIW must grow NOPAT by 16  compounded annually for 14 years  Before ACIW s big acquisitions in 2012 and 2013  it had only grown NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for the prior 8 years  It seems unlikely that ACIW will be able to double its long term rate of profit growth going forward 
While NTAP offers investors positive and increasing economic earnings  ACIW only offers growth in accounting earnings  Investors who focus only on accounting earnings cannot assess the true profitability of these businesses

111159,332674,ACIW,Top 4 Technology Value Stocks To Put In Your Portfolio,opinion,"Often times  young and middle aged investors tend to focus on growth stocks  or stocks that focus on capital appreciation and tend to have low dividends  This is due to the logical reasoning that prevails in the minds of many that despite the fact that most growth stocks are  overvalued   and usually do not pay dividends  the stock s earnings are to grow faster relative to market indices like the S P 500  or the DJIA 
This makes a lot of sense  and I agree with the idea behind investing in growth stocks  however when it comes to diversifying one s portfolio  value stocks should not be overlooked  Most technology and computer companies are growth stocks  however  we are going to examine four small companies in that sector  or industry  and we are going to look at their prospects  financials  and outlook for the upcoming year 
The stocks we are going to examine include  ACI Worldwide Inc  NASDAQ ACIW   Advent Software Inc  NASDAQ ADVS    Aspen Technology Inc  NASDAQ AZPN   and finally  Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP   These companies are all relatively small  but they could be interesting choices for investors looking for a bit more diversity in their technology holdings with a slightly more of a value approach   ACI Worldwide ACIW develops a line of software products and services  mostly zeroed in on facilitating electronic payments  In addition to its own products  it distributes  or acts as a sales agent for software developed by third parties  These products and services are used principally by financial institutions  retailers  and electronic payment processors  both in domestic and international markets  Its products are sold and supported through distribution networks covering three geographic regions  the Americas  Europe Middle East Africa  EMEA   and Asia Pacific ACIW Financials ACIW maintains a solid growing financial track record as can be seen from the charts below  and it currently retains an enterprise value that is a lot higher than the company s market capitalization  ACIW s forward P E ratio is also lower than the industry s average of 36 40  and the company s PEG ratio is also far lower than the industry s average of 2 29  These figures demonstrate why ACIW is a great value stock to hold onto  as ACIW s stock holds more value than many others in the industry  while also giving the investor the most bang for his or her buck  at least on a growth basis  Revenue  gross margins  profit  and EPS have all slowly increased  and ACIW just reported its earnings on October 30th before the market opened  and the company beat the Zacks EPS Consensus Estimate by  0 05  as well as revenue estimates  which were up 16 7  on a year year basis  A graph showing how the company has been faring against Zacks EPS Consensus Estimates has also been provided below  and we can see how the company has sometimes beat EPS estimates 
  
 Advent Software  ADVS offers software and services  which automate work flows  and data across investment management organizations  as well as the information flows between an investment management organization and external parties  Its business derives revenues from the development and sale software products  hosting services  data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate and supports mission critical functions of investment management organizations globally  Its Software as a Service based product offerings include Advent OnDemand  which includes its product offerings delivered over the web and hosted either by Advent or by a third party  and Black Diamond  which is available only over the web and hosted by Advent ADVS Financials ADVS also maintains a solid growing financial record as can be seen from the charts below  and it currently retains an enterprise value slightly higher than the company s market capitalization  ACIW s forward P E ratio is also lower than the industry s average of 36 40  Revenues and gross margins have considerably increased  however  ADVS is ostensibly struggling to increase its profit and annual EPS  On the bright side  ADVS is the only stock out of these 4 value stocks to issue and pay dividends regularly   0 13 share to be exact  This may not be a lot  but a yield of 1 5  isn t too shabby  A graph showing how the company has been faring against Zacks EPS Consensus Estimates has also been provided below  and we can see how the company has been beating the EPS estimates   It is also worth mentioning that ADVS will be reporting earnings  expected  on the 2nd of February  2015 
 
 
Aspen Technology AZPN is a global provider of process optimization software solutions  which are designed to manage and optimize plant and process design  operational performance  and supply chain planning  The company s AspenONE software and related services have been developed specifically for companies in the process industries  including the energy  chemicals  and engineering  and construction industries  The company has also developed its applications to design and optimize processes across the principal business areas  engineering  manufacturing  and supply chain  AZPN maintains three operating segments  license  software maintenance and support  SMS   training  and other professional services AZPN Financials AZPN is also in a strong financial position  as can be seen from the charts below  and it currently retains an enterprise value slightly lower than the company s market capitalization  indicating that it may be a little bit overvalued  However  AZPN s forward P E ratio is also lower than the industry s average of 36 40  Revenues and gross margins have considerably increased  and AZPN is showing no struggle to increase its profit and annual EPS  A graph showing how the company has been faring against Zacks EPS Consensus Estimates has also been provided below  and we can see how the company has somewhat been beating the EPS estimates with ease  while having an average positive surprise rate of  46 95   It is also worth mentioning that AZPN will be reporting earnings  expected  on the 29th of January  2015 

 Check Point Software Technologies CHKP is an Israeli company that develops technologies to communications and transactions over the internet by enterprises and consumers  CHKP develops  markets  and supports a range of software  as well as combined hardware and software products and services for information technology  IT  security  The firm offers its customers a portfolio of network and gateway security solutions  data and endpoint security solutions  and management solutions  Its solutions operate under unified security architecture  In 2011  CHKP introduced software blades  such as Application Control  URL Filtering  and an anti bot software blade  CHKP derives its revenues mainly from products  licenses  combined hardware and software products  software updates and maintenance  and subscriptions CHKP Financials CHKP maintains a solid growing financial record as can be seen from the charts below  and it currently retains an enterprise value a lot lower than the company s market capitalization  which like AZPN  may be a sign of overvaluation  CHKP s forward P E ratio is where the company really shines  It is so much lower than the industry s average of 36 40  while revenues  gross margins  profits  and EPS have considerably increased  A graph showing how the company has been faring against Zacks EPS Consensus Estimates has also been provided below  and we can see how the company has managed to beat EPS estimates  CHKP will be expected to report its earnings on the 27th of January  2015 
 
Bottom Line It is hard to tell which one is the ultimate value stock  however CHKP seems to be carrying the lowest forward price to earnings ratio despite the fact that it is the only company out of all four to be sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   whilst all others are ranked  1  Strong Buy   It also seems that CHKP is far larger than the other companies in terms of size and output  so it might be a safer choice  Still  it is always up to the investor to choose which one to stock up on  or if he chooses to diversify and stock on all four  however for dividend focused investors  ADVS seems like a solid choice from a yield look  Below is a comparison between how these stocks stack up against one another and against the S P 500 index  as well  Looking at the comparison  it seems that ADVS has had very strong growth  and the stock looks to be ripping higher heading in to 2015  while CHKP looks the most stable  and without too many fluctuations it is likely to continue its slow rise  AZPN and ACIW have seen lots of fluctuations  and perhaps it would be wise to stay away from them  and opt for ADVS  given the dividends   or CHKP as a true value stock for long term value growth ",2014-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-4-technology-value-stocks-to-put-in-your-portfolio-231222,231222
111160,332675,ACIW,CenturyLink  CTL  Q1 Earnings  What s Ahead For The Stock ,opinion,"CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   Inc    NYSE T   is slated to release its first quarter 2016 results after the market closes on May 4 
Last quarter  CenturyLink delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23 08   Moreover  the company s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four quarters  with an average beat of 7 06   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Factors to Influence This Quarter
CenturyLink plans to monetize its collocation assets through the wholesale mode to other providers and enterprises  Given the bleak future of collocation revenues  CenturyLink is looking for ways to avoid investment in the segment  Persistently sub par performance at the segment has resulted in investors calling for a sale of these assets 
Recently  CenturyLink s rival  AT T Inc    NYSE T   decided to divest its data center business to IBM Corporation   NYSE IBM    On the back of its focus on other core revenue generating activities  we believe that CenturyLink will be able to deploy its resources optimally for value creation  going forward 
CenturyLink recently inked an agreement with leading cybersecurity analytics firm  WISeKey  to offer cybersecurity services for Internet of Things  IoT  providers  The companies hope to leverage each other s capabilities to provide seamless managed services for the IoT businesses  Recognizing the need to provide security services for IoT s data transmission purposes  we believe that CenturyLink s tie up with WISeKey will give the company an opportunity to generate healthy revenues  going forward 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that CenturyLink is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 68 cents 
Zacks Rank  CenturyLink has a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions       
A Stock to Consider
Here is a company you may want to consider as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
ACI Worldwide  Inc    NASDAQ ACIW   has an ESP of 12 50  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/centurylink-(ctl)-q1-earnings:-what's-ahead-for-the-stock-200127389,200127389
111161,332676,ACIW,Copa Holdings  CPA   A Beat In Store This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Copa Holdings SA   NYSE CPA   is scheduled to release first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after market close 
In the last quarter  the company posted a positive 10 61  earnings surprise 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that Copa Holdings is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP   for the company stand at  8 7  because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 50 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at  1 38  This serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  
Zacks Rank  Copa Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Copa Holdings  Zacks Rank  3 and  8 7  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Despite the softness in the Brazilian economy and the weakening of real against the strong U S  dollar  the carrier is set to gain from the increase in air travel demand  Moreover  Rio Olympic Games  scheduled to start this August  is likely to boost pre bookings of tickets for the carrier 
Copa Holdings recently reported a healthy increase in traffic for March  Load factor    of seats filled by passengers  declined in the month as capacity contracted while traffic imcreased  The carrier also reported an increase in February traffic  We expect the trend to continue when the carrier reports its first quarter results
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter
