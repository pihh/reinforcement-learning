is a market leader in the front  and back end semiconductor industry  However  the company has been fortifying its presence in other end markets as well  such as Research   Defense  Industrial

Sciences market Innovation  MKS Instruments believes elevated demand for its innovative products and solutions will stoke its top line growth  In 2017  the company made research   development investments worth more than  130 million  State of the art offerings such as laser products  3D NAND memory and the latest cloud applications  within semiconductor manufacturing process  are expected to secure sturdier market response in the quarters ahead Top Line Prospects  MKS Instruments expects that elevated sales from the semiconductor  industrial and other advanced end markets will bolster

111480,332995,ENTG,Entegris  ENTG  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Entegris  Inc    NASDAQ ENTG    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7 7  over the past month  ENTG hit a new 52 week high of  37 13 in the previous session  Entegris has gained 19 1  since the start of the year compared to the 6  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 14 7  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 6  2018  Entegris reported EPS of  0 42  versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 37 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 9  
For the current fiscal year  Entegris is expected to post earnings of  1 75 per share on  1 46 billion in revenues  This represents a 21 53  change in EPS on an 8 86  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 99 per share on  1 56 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 13 53  and 6 45   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Entegris may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for ENTG  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Entegris has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 20 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 5X versus its peer group s average of 15 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 84  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Entegris  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Entegris currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Entegris meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though ENTG shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does EntegrisStack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Entegrishave been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including     and   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 46 42  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ENTG  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entegris-entg-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200299703,200299703

currently and have the potential to gain further  we have opted for one tried and tested technique   picking stocks near their 52 week highs Making the Right Choice                The 52 week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing and is one of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook  The basic idea is  buy high and sell higher  since once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  In other words  stocks that are growing will continue to grow The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects   Major developments may also send stocks soaring  On the flipside  stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued  But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks Still  to be on the safer side  why not bet on stocks that besides trading near their 52 week highs and have a positive earnings history  The stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have a  of A or B  Notably  back tested results show that this favorable combination handily outperforms other

111500,333015,ENTG,Zacks com Highlights  AppFolio  AdvanSix  Entegris And LendingTree,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 15  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  AppFolio  Inc    NASDAQ APPF    AdvanSix Inc    NYSE ASIX    Entegris  Inc    NASDAQ ENTG   and LendingTree  Inc    NASDAQ TREE   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Play the Momentum with These 4 Hot StocksIn basketball  when a player hits a few shots in a row  he is said to have a  hot hand   In finance  we call it  momentum  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift At the core  momentum investing works on the principle of  Buy High  Sell Higher  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for the momentum strategy to work  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  many investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things gain clarity  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Also  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s  This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes Obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play  Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which will reflect some profit taking in the stock And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting

111512,333027,ENTG,5 Stocks In Limelight On Explosive Relative Price Strength,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative

research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Here are the 5 of the 8 stocks that made it through the screen

identify such stocks is to pick those whose price is fluctuating within a specific band  In case a stock falls below the floor of this band  it may be time to offload it from your portfolio  However  a stock breaking above this channel carries the promise of delivering strong gains Spotting Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  the demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a bona fide breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater

111538,333053,ENTG,Focus On These 5 Profitable Stocks For Attractive Returns,opinion,"Profitability analysis is one of the most effective methods to assess the potential of a stock  Using profitability analysis  we can figure out whether a company can generate enough sales revenue not only to meet all its cost and expenses but also to pass on strong returns to its investors  However  if a profitable company has weak fundamentals  it may not be able to give a satisfying stock performance 
Several studies have indicated that a company with high profitability normally offers healthy returns to its investors 
So  in order to determine the exact profitability of a company  we have used the most effective profitability metric  net income ratio 
Net Income Ratio
Profitability ratios in general are classified into gross income ratio  operating income ratio  pretax profit margin and net income ratio  Here  we have selected net income ratio in order to assess the exact level of profitability of a company 
Net income ratio is measured by dividing net income by total sales revenue  The higher the net income ratio  the better is the company s profitability  This is because it showcases how effectively the company shells out all its business related expenses and generates funds 
Screening Parameters
Net income ratio is not the only indicator of future winners  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy   
Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy stocks are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start off 
12 Month Trailing Net Income Ratio Higher than X Industry  A higher net income ratio indicates a company s solid profitability 
12 Month Trailing Sales and Net Income Growth Higher than X Industry  Stocks that have displayed higher sales and net income growth in the last 12 months give a better financial performance 
  Rating Strong Buy greater than 70   This indicates that 70  of the analysts covering these stocks are optimistic 
Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening 
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AMPH   is a specialty pharmaceutical company  This company has an average four quarter earnings surprise of more than 100  
Parsley Energy  Inc    NYSE PE   is an independent oil and natural gas company  It has an average four quarter earnings surprise of 97 9  
Entegris  Inc    NASDAQ ENTG   is a leading provider of materials management solutions to the high technology industries  including microelectronics  The company has an average four quarter earnings surprise of 20 7  
State Bank Financial Corporation   NASDAQ STBZ    through its subsidiary  provides community banking services to individuals and businesses in the middle Georgia and metropolitan Atlanta markets  It has an average four quarter earnings surprise of 10 4  
HollySys Automation Technologies  Ltd    NASDAQ HOLI   is one of the leading automation systems providers in the People s Republic of China  The company has an average four quarter earnings surprise of 6 1  
While backtesting over a two year timeframe  August 08  2014 to August 05  2016   a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 13 8  compared with the S P 500 s return of 9 3   Thus  this strategy may prove profitable for those looking to beat the markets
