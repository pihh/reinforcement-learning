25197,246712,ANIK,Pacira s Exparel Spurs Growth  Exclusive Reliance A Concern,opinion,"On December 13  we issued an updated research report on Pacira BioSciences  Inc    NASDAQ PCRX    The company s top line mainly comprises contribution from its sole marketed product Exparel  other product sales and royalty revenues 
Shares of Pacira have increased 6 2  so far this year compared with the  rally of 10 8  

Exparel is a liposome injection of bupivacaine  which is indicated for single dose administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia 
Exparel revenues grew 23  year over year during the first nine months of 2019  Continued adoption of the drug for transversus abdominis plane  TAP   infiltration procedures for abdominal and genitourinary surgeries  should boost sales going forward  The company is currently looking for partners to expand its geographical footprint for Exparel 
In June 2019  the European Medicines Agency accepted the marketing authorization application for Exparel as a medicine to treat postsurgical analgesia  An opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is expected in the second half of 2020 
Meanwhile  Pacira is working to expand Exparel s label  which should drive demand  In September 2019  the company completed enrollment in the phase III study on Exparel for treating pediatric patients aged from six to less than 17 years  Results from this study will support a supplemental new drug application for the medicine in the United States regarding its label expansion to include children aged six years and above  There are currently no approved alternatives to opioids for managing severe post surgical pain in pediatric patients 
Notably  Pacira has partnership with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   wherein the latter continues to support the uptake of Exparel through its world class educational programs and orthopedic procedural solutions for the former 
We would like to remind investors that in April 2019  Pacira acquired the privately held MyoScience  Inc  following which the former added the latter s iovera system to its portfolio  which is highly complementary to Exparel as a non opioid therapy  Moreover  upon completing the acquisition  Pacira changed its corporate name to Pacira BioSciences  Inc 
Notably  the company is heavily dependent on Exparel for growth  which is a concern  Therefore  a decline in the drug s sales will affect the company s top line and weigh heavily on the stock

Shares of Vertex have surged 32 9  so far this year compared with the  increase of 6 1  
We would like to remind investors that Kalydeco along with Vertex s two other CF medicines  namely Orkambi and Symdeko  known as Symkevi in Europe  are collectively approved for treating a good number of CF patients in North America  Europe and Australia  Total CF product revenues in the first nine months of 2019 were  2 7 billion  reflecting a rise of approximately 23  year over year 
Meanwhile  in October 2019  Vertex gained FDA approval for its fourth medicine Trikafta to treat CF  The drug is a triple combination regimen  elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor   With this approval  the company can address a significantly larger CF patient population   almost 90  patients   ahead  With the nod to Trikafta  approximately 45 000 patients worldwide are now eligible to be treated with one of Vertex s four CF medicines 
Several companies like AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Eloxx Pharmaceuticals  ProQR Therapeutics   NASDAQ PRQR   and Proteostasis Therapeutics are developing medicines to treat CF  Even though Vertex enjoys a strong position in this market  stiff competition due to entry of additional products would erode its revenues

year  continued their forward march in the first month of the final quarter  Wall Street ended October  generally known as a tough month for investors  with an impressive rally All three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    advanced 0 5   2  and 3 7   respectively  last month  Moreover  the broad market S P 500 Index achieved a new all time high  Additionally  the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are currently 1 2  and 0 5  away from their all time highs Three Major Drivers of OctoberFirst  third quarter earnings results so far are not as disappointing as estimated at the starting of the reporting cycle  Moreover  overall guidance is not as weak till now as was feared  As of Oct 31  341 S P 500 members reported third quarter results  Total earnings for these

Office of the U S  Trade Representative stated that both the United States and China are moving closer to finalizing parts of a phase one trade deal  Possibility of at least an interim trade deal between the largest trading countries of the world for more than a year old tariff war boosted investors  confidence on risky assets like equities Third  market participants were widely expecting a third rate cut in October owing to a slowdown in job growth rate and muted inflation along with global economic downturn  Finally  the Fed reduced the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 1 5 1 75  on Oct 30 and decided to adopt a stable monetary policy hereafter  which was largely appreciated by investors Future CatalystsOn Oct 29  the Conference Board reported that U S  consumer confidence in October came in at a reading of 125 9  slightly below the revised reading of 126 3 in September  initially 125 1 reported   Despite a minor decline  Americans overall remain highly optimistic about the economy  As per Lynn Franco  director of economic indicators of the Conference Board   Confidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending  Moreover  the fourth quarter of any year includes the holiday sales season  U S  consumer spending  which accounts for nearly 70  of the GDP  maintained its momentum after it bounced back in the second quarter  U S  GDP grew 1 9  in the third quarter  surpassing the consensus estimate of 1 6  primarily buoyed by a 2 9  annualized rate growth of personal consumption expenditure Additionally  even a temporary trade truce between the United States and China will bolster business confidence and stabilize overall U S  economic growth  This in turn will

25717,247232,ANIK,Vertex  VRTX  Q3 Earnings Beat  Revenues Lag Estimates,opinion,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   delivered third quarter 2019 earnings per share of  1 23  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 14  Moreover  earnings rose 13  year over year  Strong cystic fibrosis  CF  product revenues led to higher profits in the reported quarter However  Vertex s revenues of  949 8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  952 million  But the company s sales increased 21 1  year over year  driven by the rapid uptake of its newest CF medicine Symdeko in the United States  Symdeko is marketed under the trade name Symkevi in the EU Shares of Vertex have rallied 20 2  so far this year against the  decline of 0 9  Quarter in DetailVertex s third quarter top line comprised only CF product revenues of  949 8 million  The company markets three CF medicines  namely Kalydeco  ivacaftor   Orkambi  lumacaftor ivacaftor  and Symdeko  a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor   The company did not record any collaborative and royalty revenues during the reported quarter Symdeko  Symkevi generated sales of  404 million in the reported quarter  reflecting a surge of 58 4  year over year  Symdeko sales growth was mainly driven by strong demand trends and the drug s U S  label expansion approval to treat pediatric CF patients Notably  in June  the FDA approved Symdeko to treat children with CF aged from six to 11 years with certain mutations in the CFTR gene  Vertex plans to submit a marketing application in Europe in the second half of 2019 to get a nod for the given patient population Meanwhile  Kalydeco  Vertex s first CF medicine  generated sales of  249 million in the reported quarter  reflecting an increase of 1 2  year over year Vertex s second CF medicine Orkambi generated sales of  297 million in the reported quarter  reflecting an increase of 5 3  year over year  The company also received a reimbursement approval for Orkambi in England  Spain  Australia and Scotland Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses rose 5 8  to  290 million in the third quarter Adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses escalated 20 9  to  127 million in the reported quarter 2019 Revenue GuidanceVertex maintained its 2019 outlook for sales from CF products and the combined operating costs The company expects total revenues for CF products in the range of  3 70 3 75 billion  unchanged from prior expectations We remind investors that last week  when Trikafta received the FDA approval  the company updated and provided CF revenue guidance of  3 70 3 75 billion compared with  3 60 3 70 billion issued during the second quarter of 2019 Moreover  combined adjusted research and development  R D  plus selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses in 2019 are anticipated in the band of  1 65  1 70 billion  unchanged from the previous view Recent DevelopmentsIn October 2019  the FDA approved Vertex s tripel combo regimen Trikafta  elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor  for the treatment of CF in patients aged12 years and above with at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene  The FDA approval came five months ahead of the scheduled PDUFA date in March 2020  With the approval of the triple combo regime  Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population   almost 90  of patients with CF   in the future  Trikafta is Vertex s fourth medicine to be approved by the FDA to treat the underlying cause of CF A regulatory application in the EU seeking approval of elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor combination regimen was filed in the quarter  On Oct 31  2019  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  validated the marketing authorization for the same application On third quarter conference call  management stated that the first patient was already prescribed Trikafta by the physicians  Notably  a large proportion of patients currently on Kalydeco  Orkambi or Symdeko will switch to Trikafta over time  underscoring a strong interest in the medicine Meanwhile  phase III studies are underway to evaluate VX 445 triple combination regimens in six to 11 yearold children with CF for F508del Min as well as to address F508del homozygous patients In October 2019  Vertex acquired the privately held biotech Semma Therapeutics for an all cash deal worth  950 million  This acquisition added pre clinical cell based treatment candidates for type I diabetes to Vertex s pipeline Other Pipeline UpdatesVertex s non CF pipeline  though in early stage  looks interesting with treatments being developed for beta thalassemia  sickle cell disease  alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  AAT   APOL1 mediated kidney diseases and pain Notably  Vertex has a partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP   to evaluate an investigational gene editing treatment  CTX001  for the two devastating diseases  namely sickle cell disease and thalassemia  Enrollment is currently ongoing in phase I II studies on CTX001 for beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease  Both companies plan to provide the first clinical data from these studies in the fourth quarter of 2019 Vertex plans to begin a phase II proof of concept study on its first oral small molecule corrector VX 814 for the treatment of alpha 1 antitrypsin  AAT  deficiency  The study will enroll around 50 patients with AAT deficiency  who have two Z mutations  The company plans to announce data from the same in 2020  The company also has a second AAT corrector  VX 864  currently in phase I development for the treatment of AAT deficiency Vertex is conducting a phase I study on VX 961  a NaV1 8 inhibitor  to address various pain indications Another phase I study is evaluating Vertex s investigational candidate VX 147 in healthy volunteers for the treatment of APOL1 mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  FSGS  and other serious kidney diseases  If successful  the company plans to initiate a

The revenues were  13 million million in the first quarter  up from  1 million in the year ago quarter  Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 million  The increase in revenues is mainly owing to the recognition of  10 6 million as revenues from Genentech  a member of the Roche Group   OTC RHHBY   collaboration  in the first quarter of 2019

Quarter in Detail
Research and development  R D  expenses were  8 0 million in the quarter compared with  6 4 million in the year ago quarter  The increase can be primarily attributed to higher expenses related to clinical study startup activities for the AFM13 registration study in PTCL  and early stage development and discovery activities 
General and administrative  G A  expenses were  2 4 million compared with  2 0 million in the first quarter of 2018  The increase was primarily related to higher personnel expenses

26098,247613,ANIK,6 Stocks That Popped Last Week,opinion,"There s been a lot of rhetoric the last few days about the President s slapping extra tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  But the talks haven t had much of an impact on the investment spirit  by and large  other than a few tremors at around the time the media starts talking about it 
It s more or less well known that the U S  sells fewer goods to China than it imports from the country  making counter tariffs a less effective strategy for China 
Of course  there are other levers China could pull  such as ignoring U S  sanctions on Iranian oil purchase  But since it isn t in anyone s interest to promote another nuclear nation  especially one that hasn t proved its ability to exercise restraint  this may not be in China s long term interest either  China s Belt   Road initiative  a direct route to the sea through Pakistan may also see other challenges  as Pakistan secures funding from Saudi Arabia  potentially reducing its dependence on the Chinese    
So as far as the U S  is concerned  the strong jobs report  other positive economic data and the Fed s independence are positives for investors  So growth and employment remain at record levels  driving strong earnings reports reflected in soaring share prices 
Here are a few stocks that prove the point 
Sunworks  Inc    NASDAQ SUNW  
Solar power system design  installation and management provider Sunworks caters to commercial  agricultural and residential customers  Formerly known as Solar3D  the company is based in Roseville  United States 
Solar is one of the hottest markets right now because of multiple tailwinds not only in the U S  but also internationally  particularly China  
One of the biggest drivers in the U S  is the solar investment tax credit for solar system installations on residential and commercial properties  The credit was extended in 2015  with the goal of phasing it out gradually  30  in 2019  26  in 2020  22  in 2021 and 10   only commercial  in 2022  So there s something of a rush to build out 
Second  the California Energy Commission has mandated solar installations on all new homes being built from 2020 onward  Other states may follow suit especially considering the fact that most  barring Texas and Florida  have moved beyond the initial adoption phase 
Third  supporting tools and mechanics for things like storage and integration with the existing grid are now more easily available and the industry is working on smoothing out the permitting and inspection processes 
Fourth  Section 201 solar tariffs implemented in Feb 2018 caused some utilities  accounting for 58  of all domestic installations  to reassess project timelines  pushing out fulfillment dates to 2019 
China  which cut back on solar installations in the second quarter of 2018 by imposing disincentives like installation caps and reduced feed in tariff  FiT  for solar projects  also did a reassessment by the end of the year  China recognizes the importance of continuing installations  but a huge subsidy backlog forced the state to slow down  But with energy demand being so high  it was finally decided that government support would be accelerated in 2019 
Sunworks is naturally a beneficiary of these positive industry developments  evident from the numbers given below

The company licenses its knowhow in food  beverages and other consumer products and services  It also generates income from magazine subscriptions  publishing and third party advertising in publications 
The positive price action was driven by the company s ability to better align cost with a weak top line as well as better than expected new subscriptions  This helped it beat the Zacks Consensus on both revenue and earnings  The raised guidance also helped 
An overall positive for the long term that didn t  however  help just reported results was the rebranding and reconceptualization of the company as a wellness brand rather than one focused solely on weight loss 
Another positive was the growing engagement with its app for digital and studio plus digital members  WW is working on this experience as well as the notably weaker studio business  but because of significant seasonality  around 40  subscriptions are in the first quarter   a slower start to the year will have a lasting impact

The recently reported revenue was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Materion saw strength in defense  energy and telecom infrastructure end markets  which were however partially offset by weakness in consumer electronics 
The huge beat on the bottom line came from a favorable mix  by focusing on higher value added sales in the defense  energy  telecommunications infrastructure and commercial aerospace end markets and by trimming some lower margin business in the Asia Pacific  as well as operational efficiencies  which therefore also benefited the gross and operating margins  Margin expansion has been consistent over the last few years and management s goal is to continue along that path

The primary endpoint was a comparison of the pain reduction of Cingal compared with TH alone at 26 weeks  While Cingal achieved greater pain reduction numerically at every time point in the study  the difference at 26 weeks did not reach statistical significance 
Year to date  share price of the company decreased 16 3  compared with the  s decline of 5 7  

The study showed a strong safety profile which matched with the previous clinical studies  13 01 phase III study   The duration of pain reduction was also similar to the previous study as patient improvement after Cingal injection was maintained near peak levels throughout the 26 week duration of the study 
Though the company expected Cingal to perform like it did in the other study  the difference in pain reduction seen in this study did not reach statistically significant levels at six months  Anika is currently following up with the patients in a prospectively designed extension phase of the trial  which will collect data through 39 weeks 
Cingal is the first and only commercially available combination viscosupplement  and it is currently being used successfully by physicians to provide rapid and long lasting relief from pain and discomfort caused by OA for patients in a growing number of countries

26103,247618,ANIK,Why Abeona Therapeutics  ABEO  Could Be Positioned For A Slump,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Abeona Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ ABEO    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in ABEO A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from a loss of 88 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 98 cents Also  for the current quarter  Abeona Therapeutics has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 29 cents a share from a loss of 22 cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 13 6  in the past month Abeona Therapeutics Inc  Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Anika Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ ANIK    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-12-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-abeona-therapeutics-abeo-could-be-positioned-for-a-slump-200366628,200366628
26104,247619,ANIK,Anika Therapeutics Enters Oversold Territory,opinion,Anika Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ ANIK   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at ANIK given that  according to its RSI reading of 29 30  it is now in oversold territory What is RSI RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present Other FactorsYet  ANIK s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Anika Therapeutics  earnings consensus Over the past two months  investors have seen 3 earnings estimate revisions move higher  compared with none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for ANIK has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen by 3 2  over the last two months If this wasn t enough  Anika Therapeutics also has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long  You can see  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2018-12-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/anika-therapeutics-enters-oversold-territory-200368105,200368105
26105,247620,ANIK,5 Biotech Stocks Set To Bounce Back In  19 After A Rough Ride,opinion,The Zacks industry has underperformed the S P 500 this year so far  declining 17 8  compared with the S P 500 s decline of 0 9    Please note that this industry includes large as well as small biotech companies that are much riskier than drug companies  which make specialty medicines  Pipeline setbacks faced by the companies in this industry have been responsible for the industry s disappointing performance this year so far Though this industry includes big biotechs like Amgen  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Gilead  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   Regeneron among others  it mostly comprises small biotech companies that have a small portfolio of marketed drugs or even no commercial stage drugs at all  Some of these clinical stage drugmakers are dependent on just one pipeline candidate  Thus  the success or failure of their key pipeline candidates in clinical studies can significantly drive the stock s price and also the entire industry s stock market performance Also  a partnership deal with a popular drug maker is a good sign about the potential of small pharma companies  especially when there is an equity investment included in the deal These smaller innovative companies  in general  had a rather weak 2018  the principle reason being pivotal study failures involving key pipeline candidates  Other than that  regulatory and pipeline delays are adding to their woes  Also  M A activity and collaboration deals have relatively dried up lately after a frenzy of announcements earlier in the year The larger players like Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Gilead   NASDAQ GILD    Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and Biogen have handily outperformed the industry as the factors driving these large cap companies are quite different  We believe that strong quarterly results  consistent increases in full year sales and earnings guidance  new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line extensions  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals have helped these big biotech giants to consistently do well this year despite broader macro issues as well as the industry s own challenges Coming back to the smaller biotechs  there are several of them which have seen their share price drop significantly this year  However  these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   which leads us to believe they have the potential to bounce back in 2019  You can see  Importantly  the Zacks Medical Biomedical and Genetics industry features among the top 24  of the 255 Zacks ranked industriesWe discuss five such stocks here  A chart showing the share price movement of all the five stocks is given below    Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY  Shares of Incyte are down 29  this year so far  primarily due to the failure of the phase III ECHO 301 study  evaluating its key immunotherapy candidate  epacadostat in combination with Merck s Keytruda in patients with metastatic melanoma  Further  the approval of the 4mg dose of Olumiant  also a JAK inhibitor  is doubtful  Olumiant is marketed in the EU and the United States  only the lower 2 mg dose  for rheumatoid arthritis  RA  Incyte  however  has a Zacks Rank  2 currently  Incyte boasts a strong oncology portfolio  Its key marketed product  Jakafi  a JAK inhibitor approved for treating polycythemia vera  PV  and myelofibrosis   MF    two rare blood cancers  is seeing strong sales performance driven by rising patient demand for both indications In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug  the company is working on expanding its label further  Incyte s regulatory application seeking a label expansion of Jakafi for the treatment of steroid refractory acute GVHD  has been accepted for priority review by the FDA   The agency has set a target action date of Feb 24  2019  An approval will boost sales in 2019 Meanwhile  Incyte s pipeline boasts interesting targeted therapies like pemigatinib  itacitinib and capmatinib among others Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL  Exelixis  shares are down 30  this year so far  Exelixis  kidney cancer drug Cabometyx  cabozantinib  was approved in the first line setting in December last year  However  Bristol Myers cancer drug combination Opdivo Yervoy was approved for first line kidney cancer in April this year  This has increased competitive pressure on Cabometyx and it is being widely speculated that Opdivo Yervoy may squeeze Exelixis  share of the lucrative first line kidney cancer space  This has been the key reason behind the stock s drop this year However  Cabometyx continues to perform well amid stiff competition from Sutent  Votrient  Inlyta  among others   A potential approval for Cabometyx for previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   a kind of liver cancer  early in January 2019 should further boost demand and diversify the franchise  given the huge market for liver cancer  Also  Exelixis has initiated the next wave of cabozantinib pivotal trials and expects additional pivotal studies in 2019 including studies evaluating cabozantinib in combination with leading immunotherapies  All these positive factors explain the company s Zacks Rank of 2 AVEO Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AVEO  AVEO Pharmaceuticals  stock is down 28 7  this year so far  The stock crashed after the announcement of the third quarter results in early November as the company said that its cash position was sufficient to fund operations only till the second quarter of 2019  However  the share price picked up thereafter The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  AVEO s only marketed drug Fotivda was approved in Europe in 2017 for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  and has been launched in Germany by partner EUSA Pharma  Fotivda is not yet approved in the United States  In early November  AVEO announced that Fotivda s late stage study TIVO 3 for third  and fourth line kidney cancer met its primary endpoint  paving the way for a regulatory filing in the United States next year  Anika Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ ANIK  Anika Therapeutics  stock is down 42 2  this year so far  The stock was hit by disappointing data announced in June from a late stage study evaluating Cingal in treating patients with osteoarthritis  OA  in the knee  Cingal is Anika s third generation visco supplement approved to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee in some international countries  Cingal is not approved for use in the United States The study  which was being conducted to support registration of Cingal in the United States  failed to demonstrate that using Cingal led to a statistically significant reduction in pain  This raised investor scepticism about the drug s potential approval in the United States  Meanwhile  a voluntary recall of Hyalofast  Hyalograft C and Hyalomatrix  in May also hit the stock this yearNonetheless  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  Cingal is doing well  seeing strong demand trends in Europe and Canada  Production and shipments of Hyalofast  Hyalograft C and Hyalomatrix resumed earlier this month  which should boost revenues in the New Year  Also  management will meet with the FDA in first quarter of 2019 to discuss the path forward for Cingal VIVUS  Inc    NASDAQ VVUS  VIVUS  stock is down 44 7  this year so far due to inconsistent sales of its weight management drug  QsymiaVIVUS  however  enjoys a Zacks Rank  2  Importantly  VIVUS is focusing on building a cash flow positive portfolio of commercial products  The acquisition of Pancreaze in May boosted sales significantly  VIVUS is also working on boosting Qsymia sales through expanding reimbursement and promotional initiatives In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 top tickers to buy and hold for the entirety of 2019 These 10 are

26329,247844,ANIK,Bristol Myers  Opdivo Gets EU Approval For Label Expansion,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that the European Commission has approved its immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  for an additional indication  Opdivo has been approved for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma  cHL  after autologous stem cell transplant  ASCT  and treatment with Adcetris  brentuximab vedotin  
This makes Opdivo the first and only PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematologic malignancy in the EU  The approval was based on the overall response rate established by data from an integrated analysis of two studies   CheckMate  205  phase II  and CheckMate  039  phase I  
The EU approval was not surprising as the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had issued a favorable opinion this October 
BRISTOL MYERS Price
    We are encouraged by the latest label expansion of Opdivo  Per Bristol Myers  press release  cHL is the most common type of Hodgkin lymphoma and accounts for 95  of all cases  Hence  the drug will now cater to the previously unmet needs of patients who relapse or become refractory to the currently available treatments 
We note that Opdivo gained accelerated approval in the U S  in May 2016 for the treatment of cHL in patients who have relapsed or progressed after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and post transplantation Adcetris treatment 
Moreover  Opdivo is approved in both the U S  and the EU for several cancer indications  Bristol Myers is working on further expanding its label  Opdivo is currently under priority review in the U S  for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  mUC  in patients who have progressed on or after platinum containing therapy  A response from the FDA is expected by Mar 2  2017  The product is also under review in the EU for the mUC indication 
We note that Opdivo gained FDA approval a couple of weeks back for intravenous use to treat patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy  The drug is also under review in the EU for the same indication 
Opdivo has recorded worldwide sales of  2 5 billion in the first nine months of 2016  Label expansion in additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly

26393,247908,ANIK,Lily s Jardiance Effective In Lowering Cardiovascular Death,opinion,"Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   announced that new data presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2016 from long term cardiovascular  CV  outcomes study of its diabetes medicine Jardiance showed that the drug was effective in reducing the risk for cardiovascular death 
The results  which are part of the landmark EMPA REG OUTCOME trial  showed that irrespective of the type of cardiovascular disease at baseline  Jardiance tablets reduced the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type II diabetes and established cardiovascular disease compared to placebo when added to standard of care 
Cardiovascular disease is very common in adults with type II diabetes  Approximately two out of three deaths in people with type II diabetes in the U S  are caused by cardiovascular diseases  These include a number of different vascular outcomes like heart attack  heart failure  peripheral vascular disease and stroke 
EMPA REG OUTCOME trial was carried out on more than 7 000 patients  from 42 countries  with type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease  It is regarded as the first long term trial of a diabetes medication to show a reduction in cardiovascular death in adults with type II diabetes and established cardiovascular disease  This study is supported by Boehringer Ingelheim  a leading research driven pharmaceutical company and Lilly 
Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim are currently seeking FDA approval for the addition of cardiovascular  CV  risk reduction data from the EMPA REG OUTCOME study on Jardiance  In June  The FDA s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee met to review the data and voted 12 11 that enough evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces CV death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established CV disease  An FDA decision is expected in early December 
The addition of this data to Jardiance s label can lead to a major surge in sales 
Last month the company reported its third quarter 2016 results wherein Jardiance sales were reported to be  47 5 million up from  15 4 reported in the year ago quarter 
Other than Jardiance  Lilly s diabetes portfolio includes other newly launched drugs like Tradjenta  Trulicity  Synjardy and Glyxambi which is a fixed dose combination of Jardiance metformin  Lately  these drugs have been driving the company s topline growth LILLY ELI   CO Price

Intrexon reported a loss of 24 cents per share in third quarter 2016  which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

However  adjusted loss per share was 17 cents compared to 4 cents in the prior year quarter  Adjusted loss excudes among other items  shares issued as compensation for services  bad debt expense and noncash research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Intrexon s license agreement with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 
Total revenue came in at  48 9 million in the quarter  down 8 2  year over year  The decline was driven mostly by a drop in product and service sales from Trans Ova subsidiary  Reported revenues were  however  slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  50 million 
Quarter in Detail
Intrexon s revenues primarily consist of collaboration and licensing revenues as well as product revenues and service revenues 
Collaboration and licensing revenues declined 11 9  to  30 6 million 
Product revenues came in at  9 2 million  down 2  from the year ago period  Service revenues came in at  8 7 million  down 2 8  year over year 
R D expenses increased 34  to  29 million due to higher personnel costs  along with rise in lab supplies and consulting expenses  Selling  general and administrative expenses escalated 47  to  33 8 million 
Intrexon follows a business model under which it commercializes its technologies through exclusive channel collaborations  ECC   licensing agreements and joint ventures with collaborators that have market and product development expertise  as well as sales and marketing capabilities to bring new and improved products and processes to market  Such agreements provide the company with funds in the form of technology access fees  and milestones and other payments 
Moreover  Intrexon has been very active on striking new ECCs and expanding its partnership with the existing ones  In Sep 2016  the company entered into an ECC with two startup companies   Genten Therapeutics  Inc  and CRS Bio  Inc 
Intrexon is also developing several candidates in partnership with other companies 
Meanwhile  the company is working with both governmental and non governmental organizations for the potential use of Oxitec s OX513A to reduce or eradicate populations of the Aedes aegypti mosquito  the primary vector for dengue  chikungunya and the Zika virus

Since Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio  the company earns revenues in the form of royalties  license and milestone payments  and research and development  R D  support fees paid by its partners 
Infinity did not record any revenue during third quarter 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was  8 8 million  The company had recorded collaboration revenue of  90 7 million in the  year ago quarter 
Quarter in Detail
In the reported quarter  R D expenses plummeted 66  to  12 8 million  The decrease in R D expense was primarily due to a fall in activities for duvelisib and a decrease in compensation as a result of the restructuring announced earlier this year 
General and administrative  G A  expense was  7 1 million for the reported quarter  down 27  year over year  The decrease in G A expense was mainly due to a fall in commercial readiness activities for duvelisib 
In Nov 2016  Infinity and Verastem  Inc    NASDAQ VSTM   announced that the companies have entered into a license agreement for exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize duvelisib  Under the agreement  Infinity is eligible to receive up to  28 million across two milestone payments    6 million upon positive data from the phase III DUO study in patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and  22 million upon the first regulatory approval of duvelisib inside or outside of the U S 
Verastem is also obligated to pay Infinity tiered mid to high single digit royalties on net sales of duvelisib 
Following the license agreement with Verastem and further restructuring activities  Infinity provided an update on its projections for year end cash and investments balance 
The company expects to end the year with a year end cash and investments balance  in the range of  70  80 million  which was previously expected to be within  45  55 million

The company s updated financial guidance is in the absence of additional funding or business development activities and has expenses related to duvelisib beyond November 1  2016  capped at  4 5 million  Additionally  Infinity s updated cash runway expectation excludes any potential milestone payments from Verastem related to duvelisib

Consumer Healthcare  Consumer Healthcare net sales in the third quarter of 2016 came in at  669 million  down 1  due to the sale of the VMS business  which had contributed to segmental sales in the prior year 
Adjusted net sales in the segment came in at  634 million  up 2   3  on a constant currency basis  from the year ago quarter  Growth was driven by new product sales of  33 million  which included the store brand launches of fluticasone nasal spray and a couple of products in the guaifenesin family  as well as increased sales in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories  These were offset partially by a decrease of  12 million in sales of existing products primarily due to price erosion in the analgesics  cough and cold  and animal health categories  lower sales in the antacids category  and discontinued products of  6 million

26690,248205,ANIK,Endo  ENDP  Q3 Earnings   Revenues Beat  View Intact,opinion,"Endo International plc s   NASDAQ ENDP   third quarter 2016 earnings of  1 01 per share were significantly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents  However  reported earnings slipped 1  from the year ago figure  The company s shares were up around 7  in the pre market trading 
Revenues came in at  884 3 million in the third quarter of 2016  up 19  year over year mainly driven by contributions from the Sep 2015 Par Pharmaceutical acquisition  Revenues were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  867 million 
Quarterly Highlights
The company reports results through three segments   Branded Pharmaceuticals  U S    Generic Pharmaceuticals  U S   and International Pharmaceuticals 
U S  Branded Pharmaceuticals sales were down 8  to  280 million  reflecting generic entry for Voltaren Gel in Mar 2016 and reduction in volume across its established pain products 
Voltaren Gel sales plunged 61  year over year to approximately  19 million  Sales of pain products Lidoderm and Opana ER were down 34  and 13   respectively 
However  Xiaflex sales increased 19  year over year reflecting high single digit demand growth for the product 
U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals recorded sales of  534 million in the quarter  up 45  from the year ago period  Addition of products through the Par Pharma acquisition led to the increase in segmental sales  Segment revenues also benefited from the robust performance of sterile injectables 
However  Generics base business revenues declined approximately 20  sequentially due to deepening consortium pricing pressures  and additional competitive entrants and product discontinuations as well as discrete factors  including destocking and shifts in purchase timing due to market conditions  The company expects these discrete factors and a steeper decline to continue into 2017 
The International Pharmaceuticals division garnered sales of  71 million  down 3  year over year and approximately 6  sequentially 
Paladin revenues increased 10  to  28 million reflecting strong performance across the base business and the Canadian launch of Nucynta among other factors  Revenues of Litha and Somar in the emerging markets declined 4  from the year ago period to  38 million  The decrease was mainly due to the decline in Litha revenues which resulted from the recent divestiture of non core assets and the integration of a new portfolio of products and pipeline programs acquired from Aspen 
2016 Outlook ReiteratedEndo has reiterated its outlook for 2016  The company continues to expect revenues in the range of  3 87 billion to  4 03 billion  It still expects earnings in the range of  4 50 to  4 80 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings is pegged at  4 55 on revenues of  3 91 billion

26692,248207,ANIK,On The Lookout For Earnings Beat  5 Top Picks,opinion,"Picking up estimate beating stocks is any investor s dream  After all  this is the time when investors get to know which stock to settle on and which ones to walk out on  based on a company s earnings scorecard  
While appraising earnings performance  there are various factors investors normally take a look at  But among them  earnings beat seems to be the most intriguing driver of stock movement other than factors like earnings growth or acceleration 
Inside Earnings Beat
Investors normally look to position themselves ahead of time and hunt for stocks that are likely to spring up an astounding performance  After much brainstorming  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  These estimates act as investment leads 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
What Makes Earnings Beat Superior to Earnings Growth
A 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts combine their understanding and a company s guidance when formulating an earnings estimate  So  if a company s earnings outperform that estimate  it will be almost equivalent to surpassing its own expectation as well as market perception  Of course  this gives you a clear picture of the company s bottom line 
How to Find Those Star Performers 
Now  since it is tough to foresee if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings release  investors can review the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings next time 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks that delivered a positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see  
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 16 
Here are five out of the 16 stocks 
McDermott International Inc    NYSE MDR    The company is into energy services business and has a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 29  
NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    The company offers digital media processors and related software for a wide range of visual computing platforms and has a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 6

26741,248256,ANIK,Exelixis  EXEL  Q3 Loss Narrower Than Expected  Sales Beat,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc   NASDAQ EXEL   posted third quarter 2016 loss of 4 cents  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents and the year ago loss of 21 cents 

Higher revenues and lower R D costs led to the narrower loss in the quarter 
Net revenue came in at  62 million  considerably up from  9 9 million in the prior year quarter  Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  47 million 
Quarter in Detail
The California based biopharmaceutical company is focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer 
Of the total revenue   42 7 million came from product sales much higher than  6 9 million in the prior year quarter  The higher product sales reflect higher sales from Cometriq  Exelixis  lead marketed product  as well as the commercial launch of Cabometyx in late April 2016 
While Cometriq  the capsule form of cabozantinib  is approved for the treatment of progressive metatstaic  medullary thyroid cancer  MTC   Cabometyx  a tablet formulation of cabozantinib is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses decreased 22 2  to  20 3 million due to lower share based compensation  clinical trial costs and allocation of general corporate costs 
Selling  general and administrative expenses were  32 5 million  up 83  from  17 8 million a year ago  This was due to higher personnel related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount  which in turn  was due to sales force expansion in the U S  for supporting the launch of Cabometyx 
Pipeline Update
In Sep 2016  Exelixis declared that the European Commission  EC  has approved Cabometyx tablets for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  targeted therapy  The approval of Cabometyx by the EC triggered a milestone payment of  60 million to Exelixis 
In Oct 2016  the company announced positive results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib against sunitinib in formerly untreated advanced RCC  which was presented at ESMO 2016 
Based on the CABOSUN results  the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for cabozantinib for treating advanced RCC  Exelixis is working with The Alliance to transfer the complete CABOSUN clinical database to Exelixis and will facilitate an independent radiological review of the CABOSUN imaging data in preparation for the filing 
We remind investors that Exelixis has an exclusive licensing agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib  Per the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will enjoy exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future indications of the drug outside the U S   Canada and Japan  The companies will jointly work for the development of cabozantinib in the current and future potential indications

26891,248406,ANIK,Intra Cellular Reports Poor Phase III Schizophrenia Data,opinion,"Intra Cellular Therapies  Inc    NASDAQ ITCI   announced disappointing top line data from the second phase III study  Study  302  on its lead pipeline candidate  ITI 007  for the treatment of schizophrenia  We expect investors to react negatively to the news 
The randomized  double blind  fixed dose  placebo  and active controlled inpatient study was conducted in 696 patients who were randomized to receive ITI 007  60 mg or 20 mg   or Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   Risperdal  risperidone   4 mg  as the active control  or placebo  Data revealed that  none of the doses of ITI 007 showed treatment effect in patients than those on placebo  on the primary endpoint   change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale  measures the ability of a drug to reduce schizophrenia symptom severity  total score  However  Risperdal showed improvement when compared to placebo 
Intra Cellular attributed such results  in part to an unusually high placebo response at certain sites  which disproportionately affected the study results 
However  ITI 007 was found to be statistically significant than Risperdal on key safety and tolerability parameters  and demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo  The company plans to continue with the development of ITI 007 for the treatment of schizophrenia  and intends to request a meeting with the FDA s Division of Psychiatry Products  to discuss the regulatory path forward for the candidate 
Meanwhile  Intra Cellular remains dedicated with its plans to develop ITI 007 for the treatment of bipolar depression  agitation associated with dementia  including Alzheimer s disease and other neuropsychiatric indications 
INTRA CELLULAR Price   With no approved product in Intra Cellular s portfolio at the moment and ITI 007 being the company s most advanced candidate  the reported study results are concerning 
Considering that currently available treatments for schizophrenia carry side effects including movement disorders  weight gain  metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disorders  there remains significant unmet medical need for new treatment options 
We note that  quite a few companies have faced setbacks in their efforts when developing drugs for antipsychotic disorders  including depression and schizophrenia  Earlier this year  Alkermes plc   NASDAQ ALKS   announced disappointing preliminary top line results from the first two of its three phase III efficacy studies on ALKS 5461  No treatment effect was observed in patients who received ALKS 546 while placebo response was observed to be greater

The contract comprises a five year base period of performance valued at about  200 million to develop NuThrax for post exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease  The contract requires the company to deliver to the Strategic National Stockpile  SNS   initially two million doses subsequent to Emergency Use Authorization pre approval by the FDA 
In addition  the contract includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7 5 million to 50 million doses of the candidate to the SNS  valued from approximately  255 million to up to  1 4 billion  respectively along with options for an additional clinical study and post marketing commitments valued at  48 million  If both options are exercised in full  the total contract value would increase and total up to  1 6 billion 
Emergent expects that the FDA could approve NuThrax for emergency use as early as 2018  thereby resulting in deliveries to the SNS beginning in 2019  NuThrax with an enhanced product profile is expected to require fewer doses leading to faster immune response 
We note that Emergent has received five grants and contracts funded by BARDA and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases worth about  127 million since 2008  for the early stage and advanced development of NuThrax  including development of a dry formulation for the vaccine candidate 
EMERGENT BIOSOL Price   CDC to Procure Remaining Doses of BioThrax
In a separate press release  Emergent also announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  has exercised an option to procure all the remaining doses of BioThrax  anthrax vaccine adsorbed  under the procurement contract that was announced on Oct 3  2011 and expired on Sep 30  2016  With the exercise of this option  CDC has granted a no cost extension to facilitate delivery of the remaining doses to be completed by Nov 30  2016 
We note that BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine to be approved by the FDA for both pre exposure prophylaxis and post exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease 
Meanwhile  Emergent continues to negotiate with the CDC regarding the Sole Source Notification that was issued in Jun 2016  The notification contains the CDC s intention to award the company a follow on contract for the purchase of 29 4 million doses of BioThrax over a period of five years  The company intends to provide further update once the contract is finalized

27070,248585,ANIK,Regeneron  Teva Collaborate To Develop Chronic Pain Drug,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   announced a global agreement for the development and commercialization of the former s experimental nerve growth factor  NGF  antibody  fasinumab 
Fasinumab is in phase III development for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain and in phase II development for the treatment of chronic low back pain 
Terms of the Deal
The deal with Teva will see Regeneron receiving an upfront payment of  250 million along with development and regulatory milestone payments  plus additional payments based on net sales  Both companies have agreed to share equally in the ongoing research and development costs of about  1 billion  and the global commercial value of fasinumab 
Under the deal  Regeneron will be responsible for the global development and commercialization of fasinumab in the U S  Also  both companies will share U S  commercialization efforts by using sales teams and marketing expertise from both companies  thereby splitting the profit equally 
Further  Teva will be responsible for the candidate s development and commercialization outside the U S   in countries covered by the agreement  and pay Regeneron a purchase price which allows both companies to retain approximately equal shares of fasinumab s global commercial value over the course of time 
We remind investors that Regeneron has granted Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma the exclusive development and commercial rights to fasinumab in Japan  Korea and nine other Asian countries  under a collaboration agreement that was entered into Sep 2015 Per the companies  press release  an estimated 30 million people suffer from osteoarthritis and a similar number with chronic low back pain in the U S  alone  with both populations expected to grow in the low single digit percentages annually  Current analgesic therapies including opioids and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  NSAIDs  pose toxicity and tolerability challenges  especially opioids  which carry risks of abuse and misuse 
REGENERON PHARM Price   Considering that NGF antibody holds the potential to provide an alternative treatment option for pain  and address limitations of NSAIDs and opioid therapies  we are positive on the latest agreement  We note that both Regeneron and Teva are looking to bring new drugs to the market  Particularly  addition of fasinumab will expand Teva s growing pipeline of pain candidates 
Note that NGF is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of pain signaling  Successful development of anti NGF treatments has been challenging and quite a few companies have faced setbacks in earlier efforts  given the safety concerns associated with such classes of treatments  A successfully developed product could bring in significant sales  given the commercial potential of this class of treatments

The randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ASP0113 in CMV seronegative kidney transplant recipients  receiving an organ from a CMV seropositive donor  Data showed that the study failed to meet the primary endpoint  which was the proportion of patients having CMV viremia through one year after first injection of the vaccine 
In addition  the secondary endpoints including CMV associated disease and CMV specific antiviral therapy were found to be similar in both treatment groups  as evaluated by an independent  blinded Adjudication Committee 
Although the safety profiles were found to be similar among treatment groups  local injection site reactions were more common in the ASP0113 arm  Additional detailed data from the study is expected to be revealed at an upcoming scientific congress 
Considering that there exists a significant unmet need for treatments addressing CMV  a herpes virus infection  the phase II study results fails to impress

27182,248697,ANIK,Spectrum  SPPI  Down  Qapzola Fails To Impress FDA Panel,opinion,"Spectrum Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ SPPI   announced that the FDA s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC  has voted against the approval of the company s bladder cancer treatment Qapzola  apaziquone   Spectrum is looking to get Qapzola approved for the immediate intravesical instillation  post transurethral resection of bladder tumors  post TURBT  in patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer  NMIBC   The company s shares fell 8 2  on the news 
The ODAC voted that Qapzola failed to demonstrate a substantial evidence of a treatment effect in comparison to placebo  While the FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of the advisory panels  it usually takes the same into consideration before finally approving a candidate  The regulatory agency is expected to render a final decision by Dec 11  2016 
Spectrum had submitted a new drug application for Qapzola in Dec 2015 which included data from two randomized controlled studies that were conducted on a single dose of Qapzola compared to placebo following resection of NMIBC 
Both studies had failed to show a reduction in disease recurrence with Qapzola at 2 years  In both studies  the percentage of patients with recurrent disease in the Qapzola arm was numerically lower than that of placebo  6 6  and 6 2    However  Spectrum identified in post hoc analyses that the timing of intravesical therapy compared to resection could enhance the effect of Qapzola  The company is currently evaluating this analysis  and the administration of a second dose of Qapzola  in a phase III study in the same patient population under the FDA s Special Protocol Assessment agreement 
SPECTRUM PHARMA Price   The unfavorable recommendation from the FDA s advisory panel is disappointing  Although Spectrum s product portfolio currently comprises six marketed products  the company has been unable to generate substantial revenues for most of its products  Therefore  approval of pipeline candidates is crucial for the company 
Considering the lack of FDA approved treatments for post TURBT instillation in patients with NMIBC  there exists significant unmet for new treatment options  If approved  Qapzola could cater to the targeted patient population and potentially reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of NMIBC 
Investor focus is expected to remain on the approval status of Qapzola

27184,248699,ANIK,Novavax Tanks  RSV F Vaccine Disappoints In Two Studies,opinion,"Gaithersburg  MD based biotech company  Novavax  Inc  s   NASDAQ NVAX   shares plunged 82  in the pre market trading after the company announced disappointing top line data from a couple of studies on its experimental respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  F protein recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate  RSV F Vaccine  in older adults 
Phase III Study Fails to Hit Efficacy Goals
The randomized  observer blinded  placebo controlled phase III Resolve study on RSV F Vaccine that was conducted in 11 856 older adults aged 60 years and above  failed to meet the pre specified primary or the secondary efficacy objectives  Also  the vaccine candidate failed to show efficacy  However  it was found to be well tolerated 
We note that the primary objective of the study was to establish efficacy in the prevention of moderate severe RSV associated lower respiratory tract disease  as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms  The attack rate for the phase III primary objective was about 25  of that observed in the phase II study 
Novavax said that initial analyses and review of the key aspects of the study do not raise concerns related to the execution of the study and data collection  among other things  The company expects preliminary immunogenicity data over the upcoming weeks and expects to analyze the study data in further detail 
Phase II Study Also Shows Lack of Efficacy
Novavax also reported top line data from the phase II rollover study on RSV F Vaccine in older adults  The study enrolled 1 329 older adults from the previous phase II study  The primary objectives of the study evaluated safety and serum anti F IgG antibody concentrations in response to immunization with the RSV F Vaccine 
Data revealed that this study showed immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients  and there was a 6 fold increase in anti F IgG in the placebo vaccine arm  which was found to be consistent with the phase II efficacy study  However  the low attack rates and the absence of efficacy of a single immunization observed in this study were also seen in the Resolve study 
The company anticipates improved vaccine efficacy from the second year of dosing  Complete evaluation of immune responses will help further analyze these data  Novavax expects to provide a detailed update at the company s investor and analyst meeting scheduled for next month 
Target Market
Per the company s press release  the spread of RSV  which occurs annually  has an incidence rate of 2 5 million infections per year in the U S  This respiratory infectious disease is increasingly being accepted as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of 64 million older adults  Moreover  RSV is accountable for nearly 207 000 hospitalizations and 16 000 deaths among adults older than 65 each year 
Given that there are no vaccines available to prevent RSV  there exists significant unmet need for treatments options as well as healthcare costs associated with the treatment for this disease 
NOVAVAX INC Price   Considering that RSV F Vaccine is a key candidate for Novavax  results from these studies fail to impress  On the second quarter 2016 conference call  the company had noted that results from Resolve and rollover would support discussions with regulatory agencies  The company had even said that positive Resolve study results would allow the company to file for FDA approval in 2017 
Novavax has projected RSV F Vaccine to generate peak revenues of  6  8 billion worldwide  subject to approval 
In addition to older adults  the company is evaluating RSV F Vaccine for two other susceptible target populations   infants via maternal immunization and children six months to five years of age  pediatrics  
With no approved product in the company s portfolio at the moment  and RSV F Vaccine being its most advanced pipeline candidate  investor focus is expected to remain on updates pertaining to its development

27204,248719,ANIK,Lexicon Hits 52 Week High On Positive Type I Diabetes Data,opinion,"Lexicon Pharmaceuticals  Inc  s   NASDAQ LXRX   shares have been on an upswing after the company reported positive top line data from a pivotal phase III study  inTandem1  on one of its most advanced pipeline candidate  sotagliflozin  The candidate is being studied for the treatment of patients suffering from type I diabetes on a background of optimized insulin 
Shares of the company touched a new 52 week high of  19 19 on Sep 9  eventually closing a little lower at  17 85  Overall  the stock has gained 16 6  on the news 
Sotagliflozin Hits Phase III Primary Endpoint
The double blind  placebo controlled phase III study  which enrolled 793 patients  evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin   200 mg and 400 mg   each taken once daily before the first meal of the day  in comparison to placebo  Results demonstrated that patients  when treated with 200 mg once daily sotagliflozin dose  witnessed a statistically significant mean A1C reduction from baseline of 0 43  and a reduction of 0 49  when on 400 mg once daily sotagliflozin dose  as compared to a 0 08  reduction on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment  thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the study 
Improvement in A1C for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe hypoglycemia  though a small risk of diabetic ketoacidosis  DKA  was observed  We note that both severe hypoglycemia and DKA are the two primary safety concerns associated with patients with type I diabetes  On the safety front  sotagliflozin was found to be well tolerated with no deaths reported in the study 
We are encouraged by the phase III study results  Per Lexicon s press release  the inTandem1 study is part of the largest phase III program on an oral anti diabetic agent for type I diabetes so far 
Note that sotagliflozin is a first in class  oral dual inhibitor of both SGLT1 and SGLT2  Sotagliflozin is expected to help patients achieve improved A1C levels without increasing  and in fact  reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia  Also  sotagliflozin could be a significant addition to the current standard of care and possibly allow type I diabetic patients better manage their diabetes while on insulin  subject to approval 
Meanwhile  another pivotal phase III study   inTandem2   is being conducted by Lexicon  primarily in Europe  Top line data is anticipated by year end  A third type I diabetes phase III study   inTandem3   is ongoing globally  This study is evaluating patients on sotagliflozin  400 mg once daily  or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy  but without insulin optimization prior to randomization 
We note that Lexicon is collaborating with Sanofi   NYSE SNY   for sotagliflozin  Lexicon had entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in Nov 2015 under which the former granted the latter an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing right and license to develop  manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin  While Lexicon is responsible for clinical development activities related to type I diabetes  Sanofi is responsible for clinical development activities for type II diabetes 
Per the terms of the agreement  Sanofi is expected to commence phase III studies on sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients with type II diabetes by the end of 2016 
Lexicon s other pipeline candidate  telotristat etiprate  is currently under priority review in the U S  for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome  A response from the FDA is expected by Nov 30  2016  It is also under review in the EU 
Investor focus is expected to remain on pipeline updates from the company

27208,248723,ANIK,Horizon  HZNP  To Acquire Raptor For  800M  Stock Soars,opinion,"Ireland domiciled Horizon Pharma plc   NASDAQ HZNP   announced its intention of acquiring California based biopharmaceutical company Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp    NASDAQ RPTP     focused on the development and commercialization of treatments targeting rare and debilitating diseases   in an all cash transaction valued at about  800 million or 9 00 per share  The offer price represents a significant premium  21   over Raptor s Sep 9 closing price 
While Raptor s shares jumped 20 5  on the news  Horizon s shares gained 9 4  
Horizon intends to fund the transaction using  675 million of external debt as well as with cash on hand 
RAPTOR PHARMACT Price   How Will Horizon Benefit 
With the proposed Raptor acquisition  Horizon will gain global rights to two orphan drugs Procysbi and Quinsair  Procysbi is approved in both the U S  and EU for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis  rare and life threatening metabolic disorder  in adults and children aged 2 years and above  Horizon expects Procysbi  which has long patent life running until 2034  to generate peak sales of more than  300 million 
Quinsair  inhaled formulation of levofloxacin   on the other hand  is approved in the EU and Canada for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis  rare  life threatening  genetic disease  
The acquisition of Procysbi and Quinsair is expected to expand and diversify Horizon s rare disease portfolio from the currently marketed 9 products to 11 products across the company s three business units   Orphan  Rheumatology and Primary Care  In addition  the Raptor acquisition is expected to strengthen Horizon s U S  orphan business  and expand its footprint in Europe and other key international markets 
The acquisition  which is slated to close in the fourth quarter of 2016  is expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in 2017  The acquisition is also anticipated to boost revenue growth  Horizon expects to provide 2017 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance in the first quarter of 2017 
Our Take
We believe the Raptor acquisition is in line with Horizon s strategy of strengthening rare disease portfolio  Horizon s rare disease portfolio currently consists of Actimmune  Ravicti  Buphenyl and Krystexxa  Post closing of the acquisition  more than half of Horizon s products will treat orphan diseases  6 of 11 products   Note that Quinsair is not approved in the U S  and a regulatory nod would be a positive for Horizon 
Horizon has been actively pursuing acquisitions to expand and diversify its portfolio  Earlier this year  Jan 2016   Horizon acquired Crealta Holdings and added Migergot and Krystexxa to its portfolio  While Ravicti and Buphenyl became part of company s portfolio through the May 2015 Hyperion Therapeutics acquisition 
Mergers and acquisitions in the health care space show no signs of slowing down and we expect to see even more buyouts through the remainder of the year

We note that ALXN1007 is an anti inflammatory monoclonal antibody targeting complement protein C5a  currently in a phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract  GI GVHD  
The European Commission usually grants orphan medicinal product status in order to provide incentives to candidates that are being developed to treat  prevent or diagnose diseases or conditions affecting no more than 5 in 10 000 people in the region  In addition to providing Alexion with certain benefits and incentives  this status will allow ALXN1007 to enjoy a period of market exclusivity in the EU  if approved  for the treatment of acute GI GVHD

    Considering that there are currently limited treatment options for GI GVHD  there exists significant unmet need for treatments targeting this severe and life threatening rare autoimmune disease  If successfully developed and subsequently approved  ALXN1007 could improve response rates in patients suffering from this disorder

27367,248882,ANIK,Get Nice Earnings Surprise With These 5 Stocks,opinion,"What pushes up or pulls down shares when a company reports earnings  It s not exactly how well a company performed in the recently concluded quarter or exhibited strong growth  it is an earnings beat or miss which drives the market post release 
What is Earnings Beat 
Investors always try to prepare themselves ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with a stellar performance  After much brainstorming  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  These estimates act as investment leads 
A positive earnings surprise or an earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if this growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into the play sometimes  If any company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact put together their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is not an easy task  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  Earnings surprise history indicates the company s consistency in beating market estimates  And investors also normally have confidence in such companies and expect them to apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only companies with a Strong Buy rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around 10 
Here are five out of the 10 stocks 
SodaStream International Ltd    NASDAQ SODA    This is a manufacturer of home beverage carbonation systems  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 8   at the time of writing

27369,248884,ANIK,Illumina Keen On Genome Network Growth   Global Expansion,opinion,"On Aug 25  2016  we issued an updated research report on San Diego  CA based Illumina Inc    NASDAQ ILMN    a company that provides tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
After a promising second quarter performance  Illumina is currently keeping in line with its earlier stated goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi billion gene sequencing market with some highly competitive products in its existing portfolio and pipeline 
For its market expansion  the company s primary focus is on reproductive and genetic health space  for which Illumina seeks to increase its portfolio by providing the verified laboratory developed non invasive prenatal test  NIPT   In the U S   currently 26  of covered lives can undergo NIPT  indicating further potential for this market space s expansion  Additionally the Dutch Health Council has recently approved NIPT for all pregnancies  which in turn is expected to boost the demand for NIPT  particularly in the international market 
We are also looking forward to GRAIL  Illumina s recently developed company focused on the cancer screening market  Currently  Illumina is working on transferring its ctDNA programs  MSK partnership to GRAIL  Besides  it has begun work on the detailed planning necessary to embark on a large scale clinical trial in 2017 with the goal of exhibiting a stage shift in diagnosis  We believe  GRAIL is anticipated to significantly expand Illumina s share in the multi billion dollar oncology market 
In terms of geographic expansion  in the second quarter  Illumina observed better than expected double digit growth in the Americas  while its business in Asia Pacific also witnessed a double digit growth contrary to the poor performance that was delivered in the prior quarter in the region 
Nevertheless  the company s prediction of a slow paced recovery in its EMEA business  in 2016  indicates its sluggish performance in Europe to prevail at least for some time  Besides  intense competition continues to be a major challenge for Illumina in the sequencing  SNP genotyping  gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several large players already enjoying considerable market share  intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise 
Moreover  Illumina faces high expenses related to the development of new products  their launch in various markets and investments in partnerships  Consequently  in recent times  Illumina has been witnessing a substantial rise in operating expenses on account of a higher head count  investments in GRAIL and Helix  as well as development projects like Project Firefly

27479,248994,ANIK,FDA Approves Edwards Lifesciences  Intuity Elite Heart Valve,opinion,"Renowned heart valve manufacturer Edwards Lifesciences Corp   NYSE EW   recently got the FDA approval for its next generation pericardial heart valve   the Intuity Elite System  two years after securing a CE Mark for this device  Subsequently  the company has commercially launched this rapid deployment device in the U S  market 
In last few decades  coronary artery disease has become a very common medical condition affecting millions worldwide  with a rapid increase observed in patients suffering from aortic stenosis  In fact  in the U S   heart disease has become the leading cause of death for both men and women  Aortic valve replacement is a standard procedure followed to treat such patients  typically involving an open heart surgery 
With the advancement of medical technology  a minimally invasive surgery for such a valve replacement is in vogue now a days  as it involves less complications associated with the procedure  Edwards  Intuity Elite Valve system is one such valve that facilitates minimally invasive aortic valve replacement in patients suffering from heart disease 
Notably  as per the one year results from the company s Transform Clinical trial  patients implanted with Edwards  Intuity Elite valves have exhibited procedural benefits like decreased mortality and morbidity  less time in an intensive care unit as well as reduced total hospital stay  In fact it is these trial outcomes  which successfully demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Edwards  Intuity Elite system and in turn  encouraged FDA to offer marketing approval for this device 
Post its launch in the European nations  a strong demand growth has been observed for the Intuity Elite valve system in the past two years  This demand buoys optimism about the system generating higher revenues for Edwards in the international market as well   Evidently in the last reported second quarter results  Intuity Elite drove strong sales growth for Edwards in Europe 
We expect the company to observe similar sales growth in the U S   on account of the recent launch of the Intuity Elite system  Management also anticipates a meaningful contribution to Edwards  overall sales growth in 2016  from the Intuity Elite launch in the U S 
With the global prosthetic heart valve market expected to reach a value worth  4 8 billion by 2020  we are optimistic about Edwards to capture larger shares in this market space on the back of its Intuity Elite system  recent launch in the U S  as well as persistently solid adoption of the company s other valves globally

27480,248995,ANIK,Align Technology s Invisalign Dependence  Boon Or Curse ,opinion,"On Aug 16  2016  we issued an updated research report on California based Align Technology Inc    NASDAQ ALGN    a developer of aligner therapy  intra oral scanners and CAD CAM  computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing  digital services  Currently  Align carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Align Technology ended the second quarter 2016 on a promising note  squarely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Persistent strong Invisalign volume growth across the company s entire customer base  primarily drove the encouraging results 
Geographically  the company was successful in delivering double digit sales growth in North America as well as overseas  In the North America  the company witnessed continued increase in utilization among its orthodontist customers  which reached record levels in both ortho and GP channels 
In the international space also  the company delivered a strong performance across all countries In the EMEA region  growth was led by Spain  France and the Netherlands  In Asia Pacific  strong expansion was observed in China  Japan  South Asia and Taiwan 
However  a vast majority of Align s total net revenues is highly dependent on the sale of its Invisalign System and the same trend is expected to continue at least in the near future Management fears that if somehow consumer demand for Align s orthodontic services declines or consumers become averse to adopt Invisalign as rapidly as management expects it  then that might affect the company s business severely 
We are concerned about the ongoing economic uncertainty too  which casts a gloom on Align s dental procedures as well  the competitive landscape also remains a major headwind

The company s revenues came in at  300 1 million in the quarter  up 20  from the year ago quarter  driven by strong sales of Vimizim and Kuvan  Revenues also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  280 5 million 
Vimizim and Kuvan Drive Revenues

Kuvan revenues soared 50 1  to  90 2 million driven by patient increases in North America and strong sales in international territories 
Naglazyme sales plunged 29 4  year over year to  78 4 million primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America in 2015 
BioMarin received Aldurazyme royalties   totalling  18 7 million  down 7 4     from Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   Genzyme

Our Take
BioMarin s second quarter performance was impressive  with the company reporting a narrower than expected loss and revenues surpassing expectations  Vimizim and Kuvan drove top line growth  which is encouraging  The company s raised outlook for revenues for 2016 is also encouraging  The geographical expansion of Vimizim and growth in the number of patients on Kuvan should boost BioMarin s performance  BioMarin expects to achieve break even or better results in 2017  Meanwhile  the company has several pipeline updates and data readouts lined up for the upcoming quarters  which could act as catalysts BIOMARIN PHARMA Price and EPS Surprise   BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A couple of better ranked stocks in the health care sector are Geron Corporation   NASDAQ GERN   and Anika Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ ANIK    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/biomarin-(bmrn)-posts-narrower-q2-loss,-sales-view-upped-200146410",200146410

The first quarter s solid revenue growth was primarily driven by strength observed in the Regenerative product portfolios of both the company s Specialty Surgical Solutions and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments  Besides  strength observed in both the U S  and international sales also contributed to the quarter s topline growth 
In terms of product categories  revenues from the company s Specialty Surgical Solutions rose 7 7   up 7 2  organically  to  158 2 million  aided by a strong performance in the dural repair franchise  which grew in mid teens in the reported quarter largely due to bovine growth arising from an expanded customer base and border acceptance of DuroGen secure and bovine pericardium  Further  management witnessed consistent  strong momentum in Integra s Precision Tools and Instruments franchise  which increased by mid single digits in the second quarter  Tissue Ablation and NeuroCritical Care registered modest year over year growth in the reported quarter

Our Take
Integra Lifesciences reported another impressive quarter with earnings and revenues both ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Strong year over year improvement on the revenue front  in particular  is indicative of the company s healthy growth via organic and inorganic means across all its segments  However  company s escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on margin 
We  also remain concerned about the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations that can considerably hamper Integra s financial performance in the coming quarters  Nonetheless  we believe the company will successfully overcome these hurdles soon  backed by new product launches and an efficient management team

With no approved product in Conatus  portfolio at the moment  the company does not generate revenues yet In the second quarter of 2016  research and development expenses were  4 2 million  up 4 3  from the year ago quarter  reflecting higher external clinical trial and manufacturing costs related to emricasan  General and administrative were  2 2 million  up 12 2  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher personnel costs and consulting fees Focus on EmricasanConatus  lead candidate  emricasan  a first in class  orally active pan caspase protease inhibitor  is being developed for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic liver disease During the second quarter  Conatus announced positive top line results from the three month  open label  second stage phase II liver cirrhosis  LC  study on emricasan  evaluating potential improvements in model for end stage liver disease  MELD  score and Child Pugh Turcotte status in patients with LC and baseline MELD scores of 11 to 18 
Meanwhile  two phase IIb studies on emricasan are currently underway  This includes the POLT HCV SVR study evaluating potential improvements in Ishak fibrosis score in post orthotropic liver transplant  POLT  recipients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post transplant caused by recurrent hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection in those who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response  SVR  following HCV antiviral therapy  Data following two years of twice daily treatment with emricasan or placebo are expected in the first half of 2018 
The other is the ENCORE NF study  initiated in Jan 2016  evaluating potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with fibrosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   Results following 18 months of twice daily treatment with emricasan or placebo are anticipated in 2018 
ENCORE NF is the first phase IIb study to be initiated under the ENCORE program  The company also plans to initiate additional studies  ENCORE PH  ENCORE LF and ENCORE XT  on emricasan under the ENCORE program through early 2017 as resources permit  Top line data from these studies are expected to be out periodically beginning 2018  While the ENCORE PH study is expected to commence in the second half of 2016  the ENCORE LF study is anticipated to start in the first half of 2017 
Meanwhile  the company expects that its current financial resources will be sufficient to maintain operations and ongoing development activities associated with emricasan for at least the next 12 months  However  the company would need additional capital to fully implement its development plans  It expects to achieve this through opportunistic financings  strategic partnerships or a combination of both CONATUS PHARMA Price and EPS Surprise   We are encouraged by the company s progress with emricasan  Investor focus should remain on updates pertaining to its development
