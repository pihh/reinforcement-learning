This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1 28   A quarter ago  it was expected that this data center operator would post FFO of  5 57 per share when it actually produced FFO of  5 87  delivering a surprise of 5 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times 
Equinix  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Retail industry  posted revenues of  1 40 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 73   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 28 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Equinix shares have added about 61  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for Equinix 
While Equinix has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Equinix was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  5 45 on  1 43 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  22 78 on  5 58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

31141,252656,EQIX,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Equinix  EQIX  Now,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this data center operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Equinix is 18 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 10 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Equinix is 23 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 9 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Equinix have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Equinix a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Equinix well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-11-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-equinix-eqix-now-200481892,200481892

31239,252754,EQIX,Factors Setting The Tone For Equinix  EQIX  In Q2 Earnings,opinion,Equinix  Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   is likely to report second quarter 2019 earnings results around Jul 31  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this global connectivity leader delivered a positive surprise of 6 25  in terms of adjusted FFO per share  This upside primarily stemmed from robust top line growth and solid operating performance  partially offset by an elevated cost of revenues The company witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates  over the last four quarters  In fact  Equinix beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average positive beat being 4 47  Equinix  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayAccording to a market study published by Equinix  the capacity for private data exchange is projected to be around 10 times faster than public Internet traffic by 2021  Hence  the company is aimed at fortifying its inter connection services and networks In fact  during the quarter under review  the company strengthened its global inter connection platform   Platform Equinix   by expanding connectivity service delivered via Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric  ECX Fabric   This will facilitate connections among all of its 37 ECX Fabric markets  spanning across five continents Accordingly  Equinix s second quarter recurring revenues from its inter connection business are projected to be up 10 6  year over year to  219 million  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for recurring revenues from colocation business is pinned at  1 003 million  depicting 9 7  growth from the prior year quarter In the second quarter  Equinix continued expanding its international footprint in strategic markets and strengthening the company s global inter connection platform  Specifically  in April  the company completed the acquisition of Switch Datacenters  AMS1 data center business in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  in an all cash transaction of  34 million The purchase is a strategic fit as the facility will cater to the growing demand for digital infrastructure connectivity in the region as well as the broader European markets Additionally  in April  Equinix announced the collaboration of HFW with the company s global interconnection platform   Platform Equinix   to gain scale and make HFW digital ready  Further  by banking on Equinix for its data center needs  HFW has unlocked valuable internal resources that can be used for development of value added services on top of its platform  Through these disciplined expansion efforts  the company is well poised to witness growth in its geographical revenues  Equinix s revenues from its European operations are expected to improve around 15  year over year to  440 million  Furthermore  revenues from the Asia Pacific and the United States are pinned at  293 million and  653 million  calling for year over year improvement of 12 3  and 5 7   respectively However  fierce competition from established Internet data center operators and hyperscale providers might depress the company s margins and revenues  In fact  the weighted average price per cabinet  MMR per cabinet  in Europe is estimated to be  1 374  down from the prior quarter s reported tally of  1 395 Moreover  prior to the second quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review has been revised marginally downward to  5 57 over the past month  reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments  Nonetheless  it represents year over year growth of 3 7  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because

levels with most of the stocks and ETFs reaching new highs The outperformance was powered by the Fed s first rate cut in more than a decade and the prospect of lowering the rates further this year  The low interest rate environment has bolstered the lure of rate sensitive sectors like real estate  read    REITs own and operate income producing real estate  They are required to distribute at least 90  of taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends and  in turn  can deduct those dividends paid from their corporate taxable income  Thus  REITs offer juicy dividend yields  Further  REITs have low correlation with other stocks and bonds  thereby providing huge diversification benefits to the portfolio Also  the collapse in yields has added to the strength  When yields drop  mortgage rates fall  making buying of real estate or refinancing mortgages more affordable  Affordability of real estate boosts activity in the market and lifts real estate stocks Further  web

Real Estate is among the best performing sectors this year with a return of almost 30   outpacing the S P 500 s nearly 19  return 
In 2016  S P Dow Jones and MSCI had separated REITs and other real estate companies from the Financials Sector and elevated them to a new sector under the GICS classification  Equity REITs make up about 98  of the Real Estate sector  Mortgage REITs remain in the Financials sector 
REITs own and operate income producing real estate  They have done very well this year as they have low exposure to trade tensions  And Income focused investors find them attractive in the low rate environment as they pay out juicy dividends 
REITs have stable cash flows so they hold up relatively better during uncertain markets  They also add diversification benefits to the portfolio 
Some specialized REITs have posted much better returns than the broader sector 
The Pacer Benchmark Data   Infrastructure Real Estate SCTR ETF  invests in companies that generate revenue from real estate operations in the data and infrastructure sector  These are mainly the builders of 5G and cloud computing infrastructure 
SRVR is up about 40  this year   Equinix   NASDAQ EQIX    American Tower   NYSE AMT   and Crown Castle International   NYSE CCI   are its top holdings

31362,252877,EQIX,5 Top Stocks With Robust Sales Growth Worth Betting On Now,opinion,With the ever changing market dynamics  investors are often tempted to undertake complex investment strategies  But this sometimes may not yield the desired results  So  using conventional strategies  which are based on key fundamentals to select stocks  is always a safe approach to earn sustainable return Among several rational and down to earth investment strategies  sales growth is one of the most favored A steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business in today s highly competitive environment  Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company  which will limit scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period  but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  This is because top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance  Therefore  the Price to Sales  P S

sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales

metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  Lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1

With the ever changing market dynamics  investors are often tempted to undertake complex investment strategies  But this sometimes may not yield the desired results  So  using conventional strategies  which are based on key fundamentals to select stocks  is always a safe approach to earn sustainable return 
Among several rational and down to earth investment strategies  sales growth is one of the most favored 
A steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business in today s highly competitive environment  Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company  which will limit scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period  but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors 
Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  This is because top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance 
Therefore  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues  unlike earnings 
Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not a wise thing to do  A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  VZ   Abbott  ABT  and Illinois Tool Works  ITW   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have gained  22 1  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  10 2  during the same period  Verizon started 2019 on a promising note with solid performance in the first quarter  primarily backed by the wireless business  
The company recorded modest top line growth and remains well poised to benefit from the impending 5G boom  The Zacks analyst thinks focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising are likely to stoke further growth  Management also raised its earlier guidance on underlying strength of its business model  
However  Verizon continues to struggle in a competitive and saturated U S  wireless market  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue  The wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers and aggressive triple play offerings by cable firms  Verizon is also spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers  which is also weighing on margins 
 You can   
Shares of Abbott have gained  29 5  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has increased  5 9  over the same period  Abbott exited first quarter 2019 with better than expected earnings and revenues figures  
The Zacks analyst likes the strong and consistent performance by the company s EPD and Medical Devices segments on an organic basis  The company has been hogging the limelight within Diabetic Care on growth with FreeStyle Libre  Within Structural Heart  worldwide strong uptake of MitraClip has improved further following the FDA approval of its upgraded version  
This apart  synergies from Alere consolidation in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics have been driving growth  Abbott s emerging market performance has been promising  On the flip side  sluggish Rhythm Management arm in the United States continues to dent growth  Increasing currency headwinds to some extent dented Abbott s international performance in the last reported quarter 
 You can   
Illinois Tool Works  shares have outperformed the Zacks Industrial Machinery industry over the past six months  gaining  14 4  over the period versus the industry s  10 3  increase  The Zacks analyst thinks Illinois Tool will gain from a diversified business structure  policy of rewarding shareholders handsomely  enterprise initiatives and skilled management team 
In first quarter 2019  the company s earnings surpassed estimates but declined year over year due to weak sales  higher taxes  forex woes and restructuring costs  For 2019  it anticipates earnings per share to increase 4 8  year over year  Enterprise Strategy is anticipated to boost margins by 100 basis points  bps   Share buybacks are likely to amount to  1 5 billion 
However  organic sales are predicted to increase 0 5 2 5   down from previously mentioned 1 3   Also  high tax rate and unfavorable foreign exchange  that will lower earnings by 6 cents in the second quarter  remain concerns  Earnings estimates for 2019 have declined in the past 30 days

31410,252925,EQIX,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Synopsys  Progressive  Equinix  AMETEK And Carlisle,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 21  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Synopsys  Inc    NASDAQ SNPS    The Progressive Corp    NYSE PGR    Equinix  Inc   REIT    NASDAQ EQIX    AMETEK  Inc    NYSE AME   and Carlisle Companies Inc    NYSE CSL   Buy These 5 Stocks with Attractive Sales Growth Right NowSteady sales growth is vital to the survival of any business  Sales growth not only offers an insight into product demand and pricing power  it also is important for growth projections and strategic decision making Nonetheless  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum But investors must look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise  This is because in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance Further  investors should make sure that sales are not only increasing but the growth rate is rising as well  Sales growth rate for the current year should exceed the prior year s growth Therefore  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues  unlike earnings However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please

31434,252949,EQIX,3 Reasons Why Equinix  EQIX  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this data center operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Equinix is 20 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Equinix is 23 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 2 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 9 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Equinix  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Equinix a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

31448,252963,EQIX,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Equinix  EQIX  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this data center operator a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Equinix is 20 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 4  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Equinix is 23 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 4 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 9 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Equinix  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Equinix a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

The Zacks analyst thinks its strong biosimilars pipeline could be an important long term growth driver  Amgen s restructuring plan is making more cost efficient  Lower taxes and share buybacks should provide some bottom line support  However  Amgen faces challenges related to its more mature products such as launch of competing biosimilar versions of Neulasta and Epogen  further sales erosion of Neupogen and Aranesp and increasing competitive pressures on Enbrel 
Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  Nonetheless  estimates have gone up ahead of the Q4 earnings release  Amgen has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters

Further  Broadcom is a leading player in the semiconductor market based on its multiple target markets  accretive acquisitions and strong cash flow  Nonetheless  the company faces intensifying competition and integration risks due to frequent acquisitions  The company s leveraged balance sheet and customer concentration continue to be headwinds

31470,252985,EQIX,Will Lower Cross Connects Hurt Equinix s  EQIX  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Equinix  Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   is set to report fourth quarter 2018 earnings results on Feb 13  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share 
In the last reported quarter  this global connectivity leader delivered a positive surprise of 1 21  in terms of adjusted FFO per share  Results reflected robust top line growth and strong operating performance  partially muted by elevated cost of revenues 
The company witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous four reports  In fact  Equinix surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with average positive beat of 3 3  
Equinix  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Banking on strong customer demand and encouraging trend in inventory utilization  Equinix announced a number of new expansions in the fourth quarter  This likely helped the company strengthen its global platform in quarter and attract customers with businesses across different geographies 
These efforts included expansions in London  Helsinki and Singapore  While these portfolio fortification moves are a strategic fit  Equinix is expected to bear higher integration costs stemming from these acquisitions  In fact  management anticipates integration costs of  15 million in the Dec end quarter  This will likely hurt the company s bottom line performance  
While Equinix enjoys a solid global presence  the negative impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements cannot be bypassed  Hence  widespread volatility in the global markets during the Oct Dec quarter is anticipated to affect the company s liquidity and top line performance  
Amid these  the fourth quarter EBITDA  Non GAAP  from its Asia  Pacific operations are expected to be down 7 3  sequentially to  127 million 
Additionally  sequential revenue growth from the United States will likely be limited to 0 7   amounting to  631 million  Similarly  revenues from the company s operations in Europe are anticipated to witness moderate sequential growth of 2  to  405 million 
Further  an uptick in interest rates during the quarter under review is expected to have curbed the company s bottom line results  In fact  to expand its global footprint and initiate new projects  the company is dependent on external borrowings as well  In addition  significant debt outstanding is expected to flare up its interest expense 
Furthermore  fierce competition from established Internet data center operators  such as AT T   NYSE T   and Verizon  NYSE VZ  is expected to depress the company s margins and revenues  Additionally  with the emergence of software defined network enabled fabrics  demand for Equinix s physical fiber cross connects   appears to witness a decline  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for cross connects across United States is expected to be down 18 3  to 117 199  
The company s activities during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of  4 92 for the quarter remained unchanged  over the past month  Nonetheless  the figure denotes year over year growth of 2 07  from the prior year quarter  Equinix anticipates full year 2018 AFFO to be in the  1 619  1 639 billion band 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

31473,252988,EQIX,Buy These 5 Stocks With Attractive Sales Growth Right Now,opinion,Steady sales growth is vital to the survival of any business  Sales growth not only offers an insight into product demand and pricing power  it also is important for growth projections and strategic decision making Nonetheless  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum But investors must look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise  This is because in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future performance Further  investors should make sure that sales are not only increasing but the growth rate is rising as well  Sales growth rate for the current year should exceed the prior year s growth Therefore  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues  unlike earnings However  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening     Synopsys  Inc

31493,253008,EQIX,This Proven Buy Signal Will Send REITs Soaring Up To 226 ,opinion,"This market wipeout has one big silver lining for income investors like you and me  dividend yields are soaring and today we re going to tap four of my favorite stocks for payouts all the way up to 8 9  
First  though  to see just how incredible this buying opportunity is  look no further than the Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ   the benchmark ETF for real estate investment trusts  REITs  
If you logged into your investment account now and simply bought VNQ  you d kick start a nice 4 8  income stream  The ETF has only shelled out a payout that big on two other occasions and only very briefly in the last 10 years 
A Rare Third Shot at Massive Cash Payouts
As you can see  VNQ s yield typically spends very little time above 4 5  and I expect its stay there to be cut short this time  too  as the herd catches a whiff of this gaudy payout and drives the share price up  and the yield down  
How do I know 
Because that s exactly what happened a decade ago  savvy folks who pounced in July 2009  the last time VNQ s yield was over 4 5   banked a fat 226  gain with nearly half of that gain in cash  thanks to VNQ s healthy dividends 
Powerful Buy Signal Delivers 226  Gain
And with VNQ s yield sitting above 4 5  again  history is about to repeat 
We need to act now 
But we can do way better than simply buying this overhyped ETF  Instead  we ll set ourselves up for bigger gains  higher yields and faster growing payouts by going one step further and snapping up REITs individually 
I ve got three top buys waiting for you just below  I ll also give you a bargain basement closed end fund  CEF  that combines the best REITs in the business to hand you an incredible 8 9  dividend paid monthly  to boot 
So let s dive in  starting with my first two picks 
35  Payout Growth From 2 Superstar REITs
Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  and Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  are worth picking up as a set because they re both standing square in the path of the biggest tech megatrends you can name tectonic shifts like artificial intelligence and the rollout of ultra fast 5G cellular networks 
Equinix owns data centers  basically warehouses of computer hardware leased to corporations  in 52 cities across five continents  Crown Castle has 40 000 cell towers and 65 000 miles of fiber optic cable stretched across the US 
If you ve skipped ahead and checked the yields on these two  you re probably wondering why I m bothering to mention them in an article about high yield REITs   EQIX pays 2 6  and CCI yields 4 3   both well short of VNQ s payout  
But these lower yields are there for a great reason  these companies are serial payout hikers  and investors keep bidding up their prices with each dividend raise  That soaring price action keeps the yield which you calculate by dividing the annualized dividend payout into the current share price static 
And when I say they re serial dividend hikers  I m not kidding around  CCI and EQIX have boosted their payouts by more than a third in just the last four years  with EQIX tossing in a nice special dividend  too  
Megatrend Powered Dividend Growth
The bottom line is that if you d bought these two in 2014  the yield on your original investment would have already jumped to 4 1  for Equinix and a gaudy 5 6  for Crown Castle 
And these two dividends will keep growing  and driving up these REITs  share prices  for decades  Equinix pays an ultra safe 45  of funds from operations  FFO  a better measure of REIT performance than earnings  as dividends  while Crown Castle pays a miniscule 25  of the midpoint of its forecast 2019 FFO 
So go ahead and grab these two now  while the selloff has them trading at the lowest prices we ve seen in months 
REIT Pick No  3  A Recession Proof 6  Payout
Now let s add a trust that s shown its mettle in the latest pullback  Physicians Realty Trust  DOC  
Let s face it  pretty well everything is down since the market tantrum started in late September  but DOC has still smoked the S P 500  giving shareholders much needed ballast while slipping just enough to give us a nice  cheap entry point 
Your Prescription for Market Mayhem
DOC boasts a portfolio of 249 medical office buildings across 30 states  97  of which are rented 
Its diversification doesn t stop there  the REIT gives you an extra layer of safety by spreading its properties across a long tenant list  with no single occupant chipping in more than 6  of annualized base rent 
Which brings me to the dividend  which clocks in at an outsized 6   And there s plenty of room for growth here  too  because DOC s FFO is on a tear  skyrocketing 27  since the first quarter of 2016 
And I m sure I don t have to tell you that healthcare spending is exploding  That alone will push up demand for DOC s properties and rental rates  and by extension FFO and dividends  even more 

Meantime  this payout is safe  at 84  of trailing 12 month FFO  easily manageable for a steady Eddie like DOC 
And get this  its relatively minor decline in the latest downturn means you can buy at just 14 4 times FFO  That s an amazing deal  given the REIT s safety and its upside potential  in both the share price and the dividend 
Now let s wrap up with  
REIT Pick No  4  A One Stop Shop for a Monthly 8 9  Dividend
The best way to squeeze the highest payouts from REITs is to buy them through a CEF like the Cohen   Steers Total Return Realty Fund  RFI  
A big bonus of CEFs is that they often trade at a discount to their NAV  or net asset value  This really just means you can grab the shares for less than the combined value of the stocks in the fund s portfolio 
This is basically free money  In RFI s case  you can buy its holdings  which include Equinix and Crown Castle  by the way  for 7 5  off or 92 5 cents on the dollar 
And since RFI has traded at a 3 5  markdown  on average  in the last year  and broke into premium territory as recently as last April   we ve got some nice  baked in  upside here as that discount floats back to a normal level 
One of the things I like most about RFI is the management team  the three person trio running the show boasts 72 years of experience between them  and they ve demolished VNQ since the 2009 market bottom 
Big Gains and a 9  Dividend in One Buy
Nonetheless  thanks to the selloff triggered drop in the fund s market price  RFI s yield now stands at an amazing 8 9  
The kicker is that this outsized payout comes your way monthly  which lines up perfectly with your bills if you re leaning on your portfolio for income  And if you re reinvesting your payouts  monthly dividends let you do so faster  giving your profits a nice extra boost 
Revealed  My No  1 REIT Pick for 2019
My favorite REIT for 2019 boasts an eye popping 7 5  yield now  thanks to the massive spike in REIT yields I just told you about 
So even if my No  1 pick were to simply move sideways this year  you d still bag an easy 7 5  in cash alone  crushing the 7  average gain the market regularly turns in 
But I expect it to do far better than that  now trading at a totally bizarre discount to cash flow  this unsung cash machine is set for 25  or more price upside in the coming year 
My top pick is a well connected commercial real estate lender that does all the work for us building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multi family units 
Management then collects the monthly payments  deposits the checks and sends most of the profits our way as dividends 
This REIT s mammoth 7 5  payout is easily covered by FFO  and its loan growth is skyrocketing  setting us up for serious dividend hikes  too 
Triple Digit Loan Growth Today Tees Up Big Dividend Growth Tomorrow
I m ready to share the name of my top REIT with you now when you click here  And that s not all   I ll also give you a second bonus pick  This little known company s management team is begging us to take cash off their hands  paying an incredible 7  dividend that s growing like a weed  setting us up for massive income growth and double digit price upside before the year is out 
All you have to do is go right here to get the full story  including the names  tickers and buy under prices on these 2 incredible 7   paying REITs now

31530,253045,EQIX,3 Great Retirement Investments   And 2 Ticking Time Bombs To Avoid,opinion,"Today we re going to talk about the single biggest risk you face in your golden years 
But don t worry I ll also show you how to clobber that risk and set yourself up for an easy  40 000 in cash in every year of your retirement  More on that below 
First  the risk I m talking about is the very real chance you ll outlive your nest egg  Because a sweeping study says you could be very wrong about the length of your retirement 
A Hidden Danger
Here s what the numbers say  in 1992  the University of Michigan asked 26 000 Americans 50 years of age and older how long they thought they d live  The results  collected 25 years later  are staggering 
When first asked  7  of participants said they had zero chance of making it to 75  But despite their pessimism  49 2  did just that  Of the folks who gave themselves a 50 50 shot  75  went on to do so 
So now might be a good time to rethink your expectation of how long you ll live because you ll likely be around a lot longer 
Don t Buy Wall Street s Retirement  Solution 
Here s where Wall Street comes in  with a  solution  only it could cook up 
It s called the 4  withdrawal rule  and it recommends supplementing your dividend income by withdrawing 4  from your capital every year in retirement 
Trouble is  every few years you get a situation like this 
The 4  Plan s Fatal Flaw
In fact  we re seeing one right now due to the market s sharp selloff  Any retirees holding Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in late  08 or  18 are withdrawing money at exactly the wrong time  Microsoft s dividend is fine  but if you need income  you must sell even more shares with the price low 
Remember dollar cost averaging  which you may have used to build your nest egg  This is the same phenomenon but in reverse  In this scenario  you re selling more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high 
It s a straight path to prematurely running down your savings  And it pains me that so many folks take it as gospel 
But don t despair  because there s an easy solution  build a retirement portfolio with an outsized dividend yield  I m talking an 8  average payout or better  That s enough to live on dividends alone with as little as  500 000 saved up 
I ll show you the two asset classes  and three specific buys  that can get you there just a little further on 
But bear with me  because before we build our high yield retirement portfolio  we need to purge our nest egg of the  sacred cows  that look safe but actually drain your returns including these two 
Fixed Income
As I write  10 year Treasuries yield 3   You could get a similar rate from a CD   if you lock away your cash for five years 
That s a lot to ask for 3   And this is the definition of  dead money   because you ll get no capital gains  just your cash back after the five years is up 
This may sound safe  but inflation will eat most of that 3   leaving you right back where you started  And if you did try to retire on it  you d need to invest  1 5 million to drive a  40 000 yearly income stream  That s just not realistic for most folks 
Dividend Aristocrats
You ve probably heard of these 50 companies  which have raised their dividends annually for 25 years  Some of America s best known firms make the cut  like Walmart  NYSE WMT   3M  NYSE MMM  and McDonald s  MCD  
And the truth is  there are some solid picks among the so called aristocracy  But the average Dividend Aristocrat  as measured by the ProShares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF  NOBL   pays even less than the 10 Year  just 2 5   So you d need north of  1 6 million to get our theoretical  40 000 income stream 
Worse  your average Aristocrat hasn t even beaten the S P 500 over the 4 years since NOBL was launched even when you include dividends 
Aristocrats Humbled
Sure  a 72  return in five years isn t bad  but it s still disappointing  because dividend growth is the No  1 driver of share prices  so these companies should have a built in edge over your typical S P 500 name 
A big reason why the Aristocrats don t gain from their dividend growth edge is that too many  like Colgate Palmolive  NYSE CL   churn out meager one  or two cent yearly hikes just to stay in the club  and that s not enough to tempt income starved investors 
We need to do better  Which brings me to 
Your 3 Retirement Lifeboats
The good news is that topping the popular choices is easy  We just need to go where first level investors aren t  starting with 
Closed End Funds  1 Buy 
Here s something most folks don t know  you can double your dividend payouts  or better  by switching from the average S P 500 stock to a closed end fund  CEF    If you re not familiar with these wonderful income plays  many of which pay 8   dividends  click here for a quick primer  
And you can often shift from stocks to CEFs without even switching investments 
Here s what I mean  if you own  say  MasterCard  MA  or Honeywell International  NYSE HON   you can  trade in  their payouts  0 7  and 2 6   respectively  for a 7 8  dividend from the Gabelli Dividend   Income Trust  GDV   which has both stocks in its top 10 holdings 
Better still  GDV trades at a totally unusual 11 4  discount to net asset value  NAV  or what its underlying portfolio is actually worth   That bakes in some nice price upside and makes the dividend safer  because fund manager Mario Gabelli only has to earn 6 8  of GDV s NAV not the 7 8  yield on market price to keep its payouts humming along and that s a much easier return to get  especially for a seasoned vet like him 
Real Estate Investment Trusts  2 Buys 
REITs owners of properties ranging from apartments to self storage units don t pay income taxes so long as they hand over most of their earnings to shareholders 
That means bigger dividend checks for us 
REIT Buy No  1  A Growing 5 5  Dividend From Aging Boomers
For a high yield REIT  look to healthcare landlord Ventas  NYSE VTR   it pays a market busting 5 5  dividend yield now and that dividend is safe  thanks to Ventas s low  for a REIT  payout ratio of 75  of funds from operations  FFO  the REIT equivalent of earnings per share  
Better yet  due to overdone interest rate fears  which are now much less of a concern than they were a few weeks ago   Ventas is cheap today  at just 15 times FFO 
REIT Buy No  2  A One Stop Shop for 9 7  Dividends Paid Monthly
Finally  you can get the best of both REITs and CEFs by picking up a closed end fund that owns REITs  like the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  NYSE RQI  
RQI holds some of the top REITs in the space  including apartment landlord Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS   cell tower owner Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  and data center operator Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  
As you can see  its portfolio is nicely diversified across the space  so you ve got some protection if one particular segment runs into difficulty 
Source  Cohen   Steers September 30  2018  fact sheet
Management firm Cohen   Steers has been around since 1986  and its team takes the outsized dividends REITs already pay  adds in these stocks  price gains and tops things off with a conservative amount of leverage  around 24  of the portfolio  to hand us a huge 9 7  dividend that rolls in every month like clockwork 
A Predictable 9 7  Payout Source  CEFConnect com
And in case you re wondering  this team knows how to spot bargains in REIT land  check out how RQI dominated the go to REIT benchmark Vanguard Real Estate ETF  VNQ  in the last decade 
A Proven Performer
The best time to buy is right now  as I write  RQI trades at a ridiculous 11 8  discount to NAV  and it s traded at an almost nonexistent 0 5  discount in the past year  That sets the table for 12 9  price upside as RQI s discount moves back to that level 
So what s the bottom line on these three rock solid income plays  Throw them all together in their own little  mini portfolio  and you ve got an average yield of 7 6  enough to hand you  40 000 of yearly income on a  525 000 upfront investment 
But we re not stopping there  Because the safest strategy is to take just one more step and  
Make a  500 000 Nest Egg Last Forever
What if I told you that you could kick start that same  40 000 income stream with much less cash  100 000 less  to be exact 
That s right   40 000 of income every year on just a  500 000 nest egg 
And you ll be getting a lot more diversification  too  because what I m about to show you will spread your cash out over six rock solid investments instead of just three  and yes  this dynamic  six pack  includes CEFs and REITs  plus other too often ignored income plays  like preferred shares  
The key is my 8   No Withdrawal  retirement portfolio  which I ve custom built to protect your nest egg in a downturn and deliver an 8  average dividend all the time  easily enough to hand us  40 000 a year on just  500 000 in savings 
Best of all  you won t have to worry about outliving your cash  because unlike Wall Street s deadly 4  plan  you won t have to draw a single penny of your capital in retirement

31557,253072,EQIX,2 Top Dividend Funds  8   Yields   To Buy Now,opinion,"Pity the poor landlord  stuck with a boatload of hassles  late rent payments  missed payments  tenants who disappear  tenants who trash the place before they leave 
The list of risks with owning rental property goes on and on  All just to  hopefully  collect a rent check at the end of the month 
But there s a much easier way to rake in steady income from real estate without the hassle of dealing with tenants and other risks of owning property outright 
The best part 
You ll get an 8  return on your money in cash every single year  And we re going to do it straight from our brokerage accounts  just as if we re buying shares of a company like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  but without the pathetic 1 4  dividend Tim Cook s firm pays 
I m talking about real estate investment trusts  REITs   companies that own everything from seniors  homes to warehouses and must by law hand out 90  of their earnings as dividends 
That results in dividends that are twice as high  on average  as those of your typical S P 500 stock so around 3 5  on average   My colleague Brett Owens recently named 3 high yield REITs set to rise with interest rates  Click here to read that article  
Your Own REIT  Dividend Magnifier 
Of course  buying REITs on their own is a great way to boost your income stream 
But what few folks know is there s a simple trick that doubles your REIT dividends  and more   buying REITs through closed end funds  CEF   a special group of funds that also trades on the stock market and regularly pays 8   yields 
And two of these 8  paying funds are on sale right now  including one that s so small and off the radar that Wall Street has ignored it for now giving us a one time opportunity to buy cheap  
Before I get to those  though  let s talk for just a second about how REITs work 
REITs 101
In a nutshell  REITs pool cash from investors and use it to buy a bunch of properties  which they then rent out to tenants  REITs have a board of directors that manages those properties  takes care of cash flow and pays out dividends to shareholders 
It s a simple enough business model  and it works very well  In fact  it works better than betting on the broader market over the long haul 
Just compare the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR   an index fund that owns the largest US REITs  and the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  over the last couple decades 
REITs a Clear Winner 
RWR clearly won on a total return basis because of its higher dividend yield  which boosts its overall returns to more than double those of the S P 500 
Which is where CEFs come in  because while RWR s 3  income stream is nice  CEFs help us make the leap all the way up to those 8   payouts I mentioned earlier 
2 Great REIT CEFs to Buy Now
While there are dozens of REIT CEFs out there  two are standouts with tremendous price upside ahead  on top of their massive income streams 
The first is the Cohen   Steers REIT   Preferred Income Fund Inc  NYSE RNP   an 8 1  yielder that invests in many of the REITs that are also in RWR  That also means RNP is well diversified across the US and holds a wide range of properties 
A Variety of Holdings  Source  Cohen   Steers
And RNP s well balanced approach works 
Massive Returns for the Long Term 
RNP is up over 260  since its IPO 15 years ago  making it a particularly potent REIT play  But there s one other great thing about this CEF  it s on sale 
Since RNP is a CEF  its market price differs from its net asset value  or the liquidation value of all of its REIT holdings   That difference has gotten quite big in recent months  the fund now trades at a 10 4  discount to NAV  near the biggest markdown in the last year 
A Sale Appears 
That discount has started to close  and I expect to narrow more later in 2018  pushing RNP s share price higher  which is why this fund should be on your radar now 
Another Fire Sale Fund for 8  Dividends
The second REIT fund to consider is the Principal Real Estate Income Closed Fund  NYSE PGZ   which trades for a whopping 14 1  discount to NAV one of the biggest discounts of any real estate CEF 
That s just one reason to like this fund 
The other is its portfolio  which holds many of the largest and best performing REITs  such as Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  and ProLogis Inc  NYSE PLD   and is well diversified across different property types and throughout the United States 
That gives you an extra level of safety  and there s another reason to consider this 8  yielding REIT fund  it s a hidden secret most of Wall Street doesn t know about  but I suspect more folks will discover it soon 
To put in perspective how small PGZ is  let me first tell you that the index fund for REITs  RWR  holds  2 5 billion of assets  And RNP has  1 4 billion in assets under management 
PGZ  Just  137 5 million 
This is by design  PGZ began with just about  120 million in assets  and the fund s managers clearly want to keep it small  PGZ s assets haven t grown as much as its total return in the last half decade because it focuses on returning as much profit to shareholders as possible in the form of cash dividends  That s partly why it s such a reliable passive income machine 
And here s the other upshot of that small size  because of PGZ s tiny market cap  big investors who know about it and its potential can t earn enough of a profit from the fund to bother buying  And small investors simply lack the research acumen or market knowledge to discover PGZ and its potential 
That makes it a rare overlooked gem that gives you a high income stream with capital gain potential and that s why you should consider snapping it up now  before the rest of the market discovers it and that big discount to NAV disappears 
Bonus  My No  1 CEF Pick Now  8 1  Dividends and Quick 20   Gains 
Smaller funds like PGZ are the key to big profits in CEFs  and many of these unsung cash machines fly below the radar  not only because of their size but because big fund companies like Vanguard pour all of their marketing cash into overhyped ETFs 
That s a huge disservice to investors  because it draws their attention away from winners like my No  1 CEF pick now  which pays an 8 1  dividend and has demolished the market in the last decade 
High Yields and Massive Gains 
So why isn t this top performing fund  which is run by some of the smartest minds in the pharmaceutical business  a household name 
For one  this low key CEF is tiny  with just a  391 million market cap  so like PGZ  it gets zero attention from Wall Street or the financial media 
For another  if you strip out the dividend and look at the fund on a price basis alone  the blue line below   my No  1 pick looks like a terrible loser 
The Herd s Looking at the Wrong Chart  
It s only when you add this fund s monstrous dividend back in that you get that huge 282  GAIN  which was almost entirely in CASH 
Yet as I write  this fund trades at a 4  discount to NAV  That may not sound like much  but it s traded at fat premiums to NAV many times in the past 5 years 
When it does so again  we ll be locked in for fast 20   upside from here  on top of that massive dividend 
My No  1 pick is just one of 5 funds I ve uncovered with SAFE dividends up to 10   plus 20   price gains ahead in the next 12 months 
The best news  The details on all of them are just a click away  Just go right here and I ll give you full details on these 5 income  and growth  plays  names  ticker symbols  buy under prices and more

31710,253225,EQIX,Nobel Economist Thaler Sees Big Market Risks,opinion,"Wednesday  October 11  2017Fresh off his Nobel Prize for Economics  University of Chicago Professor Richard Thaler has admitted to being puzzled and worried about the current market exuberance   We seem to be living in the riskiest moment of our lives  and yet the stock market seems to be napping   Thaler says he doesn t understand it  anyone paying attention to global risks today surely would have made some investment adjustments by now  Yet stock indexes remain near all time highs Thaler proved that human beings are  predictably irrational   helping shed light on how sound investment strategies can go awry   Economic agents are human  and  economic models have to incorporate that   Thaler was quoted as saying about his award winning work  So what is it Thaler is so worried about now In an interview with Bloomberg  Thaler explains his is puxzzled by not only record highs in the main indexes  but extremely low volatility as well  Outside forces have not been able to correct for potential headwinds or roadblocks  from a massive data breach at Equifax   NASDAQ EQIX   to saber rattling between President Trump and North Korea s Kim Jong un regarding nuclear annihilation  nothing has been able to move the needle deeply to the negative  nor for long  Failures of major policy shifts in Congress   including repealing and replacing Obamacare  as well as sound immigration reform   have added to this perceived wall of worry On top of this  we ve seen an extraordinary amount of natural disasters in the Western Hemisphere in just the past 60 days   hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico  earthquakes outside Mexico City  and now devastating wildfires in Northern California   which are costing lives and livelihoods  and will require extraordinary capital outlays to make these regions whole again  And finally  the looming shadow of the investigation into Russia s involvement with the Trump administration in affecting last November s U S  General Election has yet to be brought to light So what does Thaler see as the biggest risk the stock market is avoiding currently  the one that is most likely to set a correction into play from our current lofty levels   Surely  the markets  record highs  can t be based on the certitude that there will be a massive tax cut  given the seeming inability of the Republican Congress to get their act together   Meaning Thaler thinks that  as with healthcare and immigration reform previously this year  Congress will again be unable to bring forth meaningful change on tax reform  And if this results in no windfall corporate tax cut   this year  next year  or ever   chances are this reality will set in and manifest as a new downward trend President Trump will give an address this evening regarding his tax reform proposals  including how many Americans will stand to receive  4000 as a result of new tax policy  But deficit hawks on the right will not see much benefit in putting an additional  1 2 trillion back onto the books just to score a near term cash windfall  And this is before even discussing whether anyone on the left side of the congressional aisle will have any interest in providing fiscal benefits to multi billion dollar corporations Mark VickerySenior EditorToday s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies
   It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7  and  90 2   respectively 
   And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2017-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nobel-economist-thaler-sees-big-market-risks-200218248,200218248
31711,253226,EQIX,Forget Rate Tantrums  Bet On REIT ETFs ,opinion,"Dependence of REITs on debt for their business makes investors skeptical about their performance in a rising rate environment  Also  the investment world treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend paying nature make them susceptible to rising rates  This is why their price performance tends to fluctuate when the Federal Reserve is optimistic about raising rates 
 
Though the benchmark interest rate was kept unchanged in the range of 1 to 1 25  in the Fed s September meeting  the central bank sounded super hawkish  announcing its plans of winding down the huge  4 5 trillion balance sheet of Treasury securities and mortgage backed assets  This will begin with a decrease of up to  10 billion a month and reach  50 billion a month  starting in October 2018  Particularly  investors were surprised to find  the central bank s intention to go ahead with this year and three more in 2018  
 
Of course  higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows  Therefore  asset valuation  including bond coupons and stock dividends  experiences a decline  However  barring short term hiccups  this special hybrid asset class has proven time and again that rate hikes do not necessarily impact its long term returns 
 
Rather  in most cases  the REIT stocks have rallied and outperformed the broader market when the rate has eventually moved north  This is because  for REITs  a rise in rates also ushers in scope for increasing future cash flows 
 
In fact  per a S P Global   there have been six periods during which the 10 Year U S  Treasury Bond yields increased substantially since the early 1970s  In half of those six periods  U S  REITs outperformed the S P 500  matched in another and missed in the remaining two  Further  U S  REITs generated positive returns in four of those six periods  This implies that REITs actually gather more steam amid rising rates 
 
In fact  any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy  rising inflation and the Fed s confidence in the recovery  And when the economy expands  there is growth in jobs and consumer spending  This in turn drives the prospects of the real estate sector because growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate  higher occupancy levels and landlord s greater power to ask for higher rents 
 
And why not  Everything is not possible virtually and one will eventually need  real space  for economic activities  Therefore  a REIT s earnings  cash flow and dividend get a boost as rate increases amid economic growth 
 
REIT Returns Through August
 
The latest trend of returns for a number of REIT classes too suggests that the focus has now shifted to the fundamentals of the individual asset category to which the REITs cater to  rather than interest rate movements 
 
In fact  amid macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States and the consequent sloth in trading activity  the REIT industry underperformed the broader market in the first eight months of 2017  as indicated by the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index s  of 7 4  compared with the S P 500 s 11 9  gain 
 
Despite this  a number of REIT categories showed strength and posted stellar returns  Among these are infrastructure REITs that gained 34 1  through August this year  and data center REITs which returned 31 8   Moreover  industrial REITs delivered returns of 19 3   handily outpacing the broader market  However  retail REITs bore the brunt with the sector incurring negative returns of 11 4  
 
Obviously  growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies  but is also driving demand for data center REITs  Moreover  the industrial asset category hogged attention for experiencing high demand  with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery  ecommerce gaining strength and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy  However  shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  clearly suggesting that demand supply dynamics and the performance of tenants played a key role in shaping up REIT returns  rather than interest rate movements 
 
REITs  Dividends Still Stand TallAlso  the U S  law requires REITs to distribute 90  of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders  This unique feature made the industry stand out and gain a solid footing over the past 15 20 years 
 
In fact  dividends are by far the biggest enticement to invest in REIT stocks  and income seeking investors still continue to prefer them  This is because  as of Aug 31  2017  the  of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 4 1   which handily outpaced the 2  dividend yield offered by the S P 500 
 
Among the REIT market components  the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index enjoyed a dividend yield of 3 8  while the FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs Index had a dividend yield of 9 6   Over long periods  REITs have  the broader indexes with respect to dividend yields 
 
Robust Capital Access
 
Moreover  REITs have been proactive in the capital market in recent years  They have opportunistically used the low rate environment to make their financials more flexible  which is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies 
 
Further  investors  faith in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it is increasing  The stock exchange listed REITs   69 6 billion in capital offerings in 2016 and raised  62 8 billion of  in the first eight months of 2017   well ahead of the  52 3 billion generated in the comparable prior year period  
 
Growing Importance of REIT industry
 
In addition  the growing importance of the REIT industry over the years is quite evident with the creation of the exclusive headline sector for real estate under the GICS last year  Indeed  the REIT market has continued to expand with the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index  comprising 227 REITs  had a combined equity market capitalization of  1 126 trillion   This is ahead of 219 REITs and  972 billion in equity market capitalization

31712,253227,EQIX,Factors To Look For Ahead Of Equinix s  EQIX  Q3 Earnings,opinion,Equinix Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 1 We believe expansion in important markets and growing demand for data centers along with synergies from acquisition are likely to drive the company s overall third quarter results Let s discuss them one by one Expansion StrategiesExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are crucial parts of Equinix s core strategy  Further  the companyremains positive on growing demand for data centers  To meet the rising demand for cloud services  this global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally  and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management In doing so the company recently announced that it has opened the 13th International Business Exchange  IBX  data center   SV10   in the Silicon Valley  The new center will enable itto meet the growing demand for data center services in theregion  We believe that expanding its facility in the Silicon Valley will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix s data center services  in turn  boosting the revenues Going forward  the company also has plans to build the its fifth IBX in Hong Kong  The new IBX infrastructure will be known as HK5  With an area of over 48 000

company is slated to open five IBX data centers this year  one each at Sao Paulo  Frankfurt  Amsterdam  Silicon Valley and Washington D C  Apart from this  it also intends to make expansion at 14 of its existing data centers In the last reported quarter  Equinix witnessed strong demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks  The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals  Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms gave a boost to the top line We expect the momentum to continue in the to

been a major contributor to growth at Equinix  Worldwide  itowns 180 IBX data centers across 44 countries  The company hascompleted acquisition of Verizon Communications s   NYSE VZ   29 data centers

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Facebook  NASDAQ FB   FB   Celgene  CELG  and BlackRock  BLK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Facebook s shares have outperformed the S P 500 index over the last year  gaining  46 5  vs   21 3   Facebook reported strong third quarter 2017 results as mobile and live video efforts continue to pay off in a big way  Instagram remains another important revenue stream 
Apart from mobile and video  the monetization opportunities of the company s other subsidiaries   Messenger  WhatsApp and Oculus   and a huge user base higher engagement levels are expected to drive growth going ahead  Facebook is also dabbling in AR VR and AI technologies  which bodes well for long term growth  
However  due to the recent uproar caused by apparent usage of the platform by Russian elements for interfering in the election process has put Facebook in a spot  As a result  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that it will make sizable investments to tighten security on the platform which along with continued investments in video  AR VR and AI  will dent operating margins going ahead 
 You can 
Shares of Celgene have underperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the year so far  losing  13 6  vs  an increase of  3 9   Celgene s third quarter results were mixed with the company beating on earnings but missed on sales estimates  
While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again  Otezla sales in the United States were weak due to challenges in the dermatology market which led the management to cut guidance  Celgene s Revlimid continued to outperform driven by further market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and the continued increase in treatment duration  Pomalyst and Abraxane also performed well  
The Zacks analyst likes the company s progress with its label expansion efforts and pipeline development  The approval of Idhifa in the United States for relapsed and or refractory acute myeloid leukemia has further boosted the company s portfolio  
However  Celgene is highly dependent on Revlimid while Abraxane sales are under competitive pressure  Weakness in Otezla s performance will also remain a headwind 
 You can  
Buy rated BlackRock s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry in the last six months    25 3  vs   16 9    This performance is supported by impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  
The company s third quarter 2017 earnings were supported by a rise in revenues and steady asset inflows while higher expenses were the undermining factor  The Zacks analyst likes Blackrock s initiatives to restructure its actively managed equities business with an aim to meet changing client needs  
These efforts  along with technological changes and its attempt to expand globally via acquisitions will further help top line growth going forward  However  mounting expenses mainly due to continued rise in marketing costs and high dependence on overseas revenues remain major concerns

31730,253245,EQIX,Equinix  EQIX  Expands Further In Europe  To Buy Itconic,opinion,It seems that Equinix Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   is firing on all cylinders to expand its data center business across different regions  The company  in a move to expand its European operations  recently announced an agreement to acquire certain businesses   Itconic and its subsidiary CloudMas   from The Carlyle Group  NASDAQ CG   The all cash deal is valued at  215 million or approximately  259 million and is anticipated to close during fourth quarter 2017 Itconic provides data center services  connectivity and cloud infrastructure solutions across Spain and Portugal  The above discussed acquisition will bring in five data centers for Equinix  with two located in Mandrid  and one each in Barcelona  Seville and Lisbon  On the other hand  Cloudmass is a wholly owned subsidiary of Itconic that focuses on supporting enterprise adoption and use of cloud services The deal marks the company s third European acquisition this year  Notably  earlier this year  Equinix acquired IO UK s data center operating business in Slough  the United Kingdom and ICT Center AG s Zurich based data center operating business in Switzerland Following the announcement  shares of Equinix gained 2 7  during yesterday s trade  Notably  Equinix has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year to date period  The stock has gained 32 8  in the said period while the industry lost 3 8  Buyout Makes Sense for EquinixThe addition of the aforementioned facilities will be beneficial for Equinix for a number of reasons  The deal will help the company expand its data center business in the two countries  particularly in Spain  which is the world s 14th and Europe s sixth largest economy Furthermore  the acquisition will bring in over 400 customers and 250 trained employees  It will also strengthen Equinix s business ecosystem as like itself  Itconic also  provides customers with the broadest choice of service providers for IT and multicloud deployments to accelerate business performance  Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   AWS  Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   Azure and Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google Cloud are some of the IT services providing companies which are Itconic s clients Additionally  Equinix believes that the buyout will help it support traffic growth between Europe  Latin America and Africa  which is anticipated to be driven by new submarine cable systems  Therefore  the company will be able to expand its interconnection capabilities across these three continents backed by this acquisition Acquisitions   Key Growth StrategyAcquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix  Last year  the company completed the acquisition of Telecity for  3 8 billion  in turn becoming the leading European data center operator  Moreover  so far this year  the company has completed two European acquisitions and is in the middle of the third one The company is also expanding its data center business in other regions as well  In May this year  Equinix completed the acquisition of 24 data center sites from Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    This acquisition expanded its interconnection capabilities in the United States and Latin America Its other notable acquisitions include Nimbo   a leading professional services company   primarily focused on enabling enterprises to develop and implement hybrid cloud  and Tokyo based Bit isle  All these acquisitions have made decent contributions toward total revenue growth Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been an important part of Equinix s core strategy  Further  the company remains positive on the elevated demand for data centers  To meet the growing demand for cloud services  this global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management  Thus  the company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8  from 2013 to 2017 and reach  24 0 billion  Based on this projection  Equinix forecasts revenue growth rate of 10  through 2017 Therefore  we believe that by acquiring data center assets  Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity  Furthermore  the acquisitions will help company further strengthen its global footprint and bring in additional revenues Nonetheless  we are concerned about the company s growing debt burden  which will adversely affect the operating results as interest expense would flare up  Also  intensifying competition and industry consolidation are other near term headwinds Currently  Equinix carries a Zacks Rank  3

31823,253338,EQIX,Forget Rate Hike  Bet On These 6 REIT ETFs To Scoop Up Gains,opinion,"The market anticipated a flight of capital from interest rate sensitive sectors like real estate investment trust  REIT  with the Federal Reserve raising the benchmark rate on Jun 14 by a quarter of a point  the second time in 2017 
But things don t appear too bad for REITs  This is because  the magnitude of the hike was in line with expectations  On top of that  the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury notes  which have an inversely proportional relation with prices  moved lower amid weak inflation numbers for May and the central bank s cut in inflation for the year 
So REITs are back in the spotlight  They are often treated as bonds for their high dividends and therefore treasury yields end up playing a significant role in their price movement  Therefore  when treasury yields decline  REIT stocks look attractive   Read   
In fact  on Jun 14  the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index managed to 0 09   compared with the 0 10  decline for the S P 500 Index  On the other hand  the on the 10 year Treasury note declined to 2 15  on Jun 14 from 2 21  the previous day 
What s Next 
Aside from the rate hike and treasury yields issues  the performance of REITs depends on other factors  Specifically  with REITs catering to a wide range of real estates and each asset category having its own demand supply dynamics  performance of REITs varies widely 
In the first five months of 2017 the overall returns from the REIT industry fell short of the broader market amid uncertainty and restrained trading activity  FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index registered a  of 3 34   which could not match the S P 500 s stellar gain of 8 7   and sectors like retail REITs felt the heat with dwindling traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales  However  a number of asset categories showed fundamental strength and the REITs catering to those asset classes reaped benefits 
Among these are data center REITs that posted total sof 23 6  in the first five months of 2017  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  Moreover  infrastructure REITs gained 21 9  and Specialty REITs delivered returns of 10 4   handily outpacing the broader market  Industrial REITs also benefited from the e commerce boom and returned 7 8  till May end   Read   
But retail REITs are not way behind and are avoiding heavy dependence on apparels and accessories  They are making every effort to win back footfall to their malls by transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones  expanding the dining options  opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities 
Also  several REITs are no longer restricting themselves to only one asset category and exploring options like mixed use developments which have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character  greater housing variety and density  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such development enable the companies to grab the attention of people  who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U S   Read   
Therefore  preferring the industry or ignoring it just based on rate and treasury yield movements won t be prudent  Investors need to first study the fundamentals of the underlying asset category before making any investment 
Dividends Standing Tall
Dividends are by far the biggest enticement in REIT stocks  and income seeking investors continue to prefer them  This is because  as of May 31  2017  the  of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 4 16   which handily outpaced the 1 99  dividend yield offered by the S P 500 
Among the REIT market components  the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index enjoyed a dividend yield of 3 87  while the FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs Index had a dividend yield of 9 70   Over long periods too  REITs have  the broader indexes with respect to dividend yields 
U S  law requires REITs to distribute 90  of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders  This unique feature helped the industry stand out and gain a solid footing in the past 15 20 years 
Capital Access
Further  in recent years  REITs managed their balance sheets well and focused on lowering debt and extending maturities  Also  REITs have indeed been proactive in the capital market  with the stock exchange listed REITs   69 6 billion in capital offerings in 2016  Moreover   23 11 billion of in the first quarter of 2017 was more than in any quarter since the second quarter of 2014  This denotes investors  growing confidence in the industry  Further  as of May 31  2017  REITs have nearly  37 0 billion in capital

31828,253343,EQIX,Direct Access To Oracle Cloud In Asia Pacific Via Sydney IBX  revised ,opinion,"The global data center operator  Equinix Inc    NASDAQ EQIX    recently announced that it will now sell direct  private access to Oracle s   NYSE ORCL   Oracle Cloud in its Sydney  Australia  International Business Exchange  IBX  data centre  with immediate effect  The access will be available for Oracle Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS   as well as Platform as a Service  PaaS  through Oracle Cloud Network Service   FastConnect and the Equinix Cloud Exchange 
We believe that the recent development will help Oracle in expanding its footprint across the Asia Pacific  particularly in Australia  and address rising demand for cloud services in the region  The increase in demand is also evident from the findings of an independent research firm  International Data Corporation  IDC  
Per IDC  about 67  of the total surveyed Australian enterprises have been using cloud services for more than one or two applications or workloads  Another research firm   Gartner   estimates the Public Cloud Services market to grow 18  in 2017 and reach  246 8 billion  Of this  IaaS is projected to make the highest growth of 36 8  
The recent development is in line with the two companies  partnership agreement entered in May this year  under which Equinix has been allowed to provide high performance direct network access to Oracle Cloud globally  With the latest addition of Sydney  Equinix now provide Oracle Cloud in five global markets  Notably  currently the Equinix Cloud Exchange is available in 21 markets globally 
With the collaboration  Equinix will help Oracle customers get the benefit of the former s cloud services  including secure connection  outstanding scalability and infrastructure dependability 
Cloud Exchange provides seamless  on demand and direct access to multiple clouds  across multiple global networks  These virtual circuit connections enable customers to use the cloud of their choice with dedicated  low latency connections 
The partnership will enable Oracle to expand the reach of its cloud platform and provide private connectivity to corporate customers globally in an uncongested and cost effective manner 
With this agreement  Oracle becomes the latest member of Equinix s Cloud Exchange  after Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Cloud and IBM  NYSE IBM  Cloud  The company s member list also includes Salesforce   NYSE CRM    which is Oracle s biggest competitor in the customer relation management market 
We believe that the recent deal is beneficial for both the companies  By using Equinix s Cloud Exchange  Oracle will be able to expand its footprint globally and address rising demand for cloud services 
On the other hand  an increase in public cloud services would automatically boost data center demand  This will ultimately benefit Equinix by bringing in more contracts  thereby bolstering the company s revenues 
Shares of Equinix have been steadily treading higher on a year to date basis  The stock returned approximately 17 1  compared with the Zacks  industry s decline of 9 1  

Currently  Equinix carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

Top Research Reports for Friday  HAL  PSA  NSC

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Halliburton  NYSE           Public Storage  NYSE          and Norfolk Southern  NYSE          

Halliburton  shares have gained almost  37 5  in the last one year  handily outperforming both the Zacks Oil   Gas Field Services industry and bigger rival Schlumberger that registered increases of  13 8  and  8 7   respectively  over the same time period  The Zacks analyst likes the company s intention of focusing on international markets instead of remaining confined only to North America 

	Additionally  the world s second largest oilfield services provider managed to beat expectations in each of the last four quarters through effective cost management  However  increasing U S production following the gathering of producers on the oil patch has offset the crude price improvement to some extent  This could lead to lower activity and limit demand for Halliburton s goods and services   You can   

	Shares of Public Storage have outperformed the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry over the past six months  gaining  4 8  vs  3 9   However  its first quarter and full year 2017 funds from operations  FFO  per share estimates have moved down over the past seven days  Public Storage is a recognized and established name in the self storage industry in the U S  and the Zacks analyst likes its acquisition and expansion efforts 

	Also  the self storage industry is expected to continue experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes  However  rising supply in a number of its markets is a concern  Rate hike also adds to its woes   You can   

Norfolk Southern  s shares have gained 43 2  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks categorized Transportation Rail industry s increase of 36 5  over the same time period  In fact  shares of Norfolk Southern have outshined those of larger rival Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   which appreciated 36 8  in the same time span  The Zacks analyst likes Norfolk Southern s efforts to cut costs in order to boost the bottom line  First quarter 2017 results  scheduled for Apr 26  are likely to be benefited by the company s cost cutting measures 

	Estimates for the first quarter have been rising over the last 30 days  The projection that coal volumes will increase in 2017 on the back of favorable conditions and the move to hike quarterly dividend are major positives  However  the company s high debt level is a major concern   You can

31889,253404,EQIX,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  American Tower  Equinix  Macerich And Mack Cali Realty,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 07  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the REITs  Part 2  including American Tower Corporation  NYSE     Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Inc   NASDAQ     The Macerich Company  NYSE MAC   NYSE     andMack Cali Realty Corp   NYSE      

	Industry  REITs  Part 2

	Link  

	Uncertainty about Fed policy has affected REIT stock prices lately  but the industry has enough reasons to cheer up investors  This is because  not only did the industry carve a niche and earn its own headline sector under the Global Industry Classification Standard  GICS   Fed officials keep repeating that they plan to keep rates low for an extended period  which should be a net positive for the REIT space in the long run 

	No doubt  the exclusive REIT headline sector will  and push up valuations over time  Moreover  a steady rate  at least in the near term  would help in making their dividends more attractive than yields on other money market and fixed income accounts  But the drivers of REITs are not limited to only these factors  REITs have ample scope to excel going forward  In fact  for gains over the long term  one should look forward to an added boost from solid fundamentals in several asset categories that REITs own and operate 

Industrial REITs

	In the industrial REITs market  demand for space has been fairly strong  This is because  amid economic expansion  an e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other such options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  And with a larger customer base  companies are opting for supply chain consolidation  resulting in greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  thereby creating scope for industrial REITs to flourish 

Residential REIT

	In apartment markets  supply has been a major concern in recent months  particularly in the high end and luxury apartment categories  However  market fundamentals are still steady in the mid range markets  In fact  residential REIT Apartment Investment and Management Company  AIV    commonly known as Aimco   with a portfolio that is diversified both in terms of geography and price point is still enjoying relatively stable revenues 

	Moreover  the student housing market recorded solid rent growth in the fall 2016 leasing session  though leasing slowed to some extent  per a recent  by Axiometrics  Going by statistics  the effective rent levels for fall 2016 have averaged  618 per bed nationally  This denotes a rise of 2 3  from a year ago  with the majority of properties averaging in the range of 2 4  

	Notably  student REITs lease their units to students  and hence their properties are generally situated in close proximity to colleges and universities  Therefore  enrollment growth ends up being a major driver for such assets  With a higher education earnings gap    earning just 62  of what the college graduate is making   enrollment statistics is expected to get a boost  Also  there is pent up demand for new  purpose built student housing properties that they prefer to shift to  given their better amenities than old  outdated housing 

Retail REITs

	For retail REITs  the absence of ample supply is expected to help keep the fundamentals favorable  Also  upbeat consumer confidence and increasing consumer spending amid an improving economy infuse optimism into the retail market  And a  of 3 6  increase in holiday sales this year by the National Retail Federation  which is above the 10 year average growth of 2 5   further raises hope for the retail market 

	Obviously  mall traffic declines and store closures remain lingering issues  But amid rising competition from online retailers  retail REITs are focusing on the omni channel retailing concept  They are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones and distribution centers as well as embracing the latest technologies to offer attractive services to tenants and mall visitors  Eventually  these will only help increase traffic 

	Also  retail REITs like Kimco Realty Corporation  NYSE KIM  are prioritizing the expansion of the small shop portfolio  Such shops comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices which enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  thereby offering a strategic way to beat online retailing blues 

Data Center REITs
	Data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  This is being driven by growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increased number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  These REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book  producing  of 25 39  in the first nine months of 2016 

Office REITs

	With economic improvement and recovery in the job market  healthy growth in demand for office spaces is expected  This is because as the economy revives and business grows  corporate sectors seek expansion and rent more space to accommodate an increased workforce  However  with a modest supply rise  the office market is expected to grow at a moderate pace for the rest of the year 

Health Care REITs

	Finally  the increase in the elderly population is expected to take place at a significantly higher rate than the overall population in the next 8 to 10 years  and this elderly age cohort is an important component of health care utilization  Therefore  the consequent proliferation of health care expenses along with a rise in new insured individuals with health care reforms is expected to continue driving demand for several types of health care 

	Medical office buildings are opening up solid scope for growth  Consolidation among physician groups  hospitals and increasing transfer of hospital services to outpatient facilities are boosting demand in this category  Therefore  despite the lingering rate issues and their adverse relation with health care REIT s long term leased assets  selective investments in health care REITs can help scoop up returns 

Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio
	Specific REITs that we prefer include American Tower Corporation  NYSE     Equinix  Inc   NASDAQ     The Macerich Company  NYSE     andMack Cali Realty Corp   NYSE      

	American Tower  a wireless communications and broadcast infrastructure company  is a steady performer  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate over all the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 6 16   It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   

	Equinix  a data center REIT  has a long term growth rate of 16 9   well ahead of the industry average of 5 5   Equinix currently has a Zacks Rank  1 

	Macerich  a retail REIT  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   It has a dividend yield of 3 48  and is a consistent performer  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarter with an average beat of 3 61  

	Mack Cali  which is engaged in office and multi family real estate assets  currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Estimates for the company for current quarter and full year 2016 are trending up  suggesting bullishness ahead

Equinix     NASDAQ          is a real estate investment trust that provides data center services to protect and connect the information assets for the enterprises  financial services companies  and content and network providers  The company is based in Redwood City  California and employs over 3300 employees  The stock is Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and todays Bull of the Day 

	Equinix has a market cap of  25 billion with a Forward PE of 26  The company has a dividend of 2  and expected EPS growth rate of 17   In addition  the company also sits in an industry that is ranked 77 out of 265  Top 29   in the Zacks Industry Rank 

Q2 Earnings

	Early in August Equinix reported earnings  with an EPS beat of 30   The company also beat on revenue  seeing  900 5 million on the quarter verse the  894 million expected  The company guided Q3 slightly below the  921 million expected  but guided fiscal year 2016 higher 

	CEO Stephen M  Smith had some comments on the quarter 

	 The second quarter marked another strong performance for Equinix as we delivered both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges  and as the company recorded its 54th quarter of consecutive revenue growth    As digital transformation drives companies to evolve business models and operations  Equinix continues to serve as an important partner as reflected in our strong growth and market leadership position  During the quarter we made significant progress towards our goal of owning more of our real estate with the acquisition of two Paris data centers  and we commenced construction on DC12  our first data center build on our owned Ashburn North Campus  The Ashburn campus is the largest internet exchange point in North America  and this expansion will effectively double our owned capacity in this important market over the next few years  

Surprise History

	Last quarters beat broke a losing streak for the company of 4 straight quarters of missing on EPS  Despite a full year of missing earnings  the stock continued higher  almost hitting  400 a share  The expansion and growth of the company hurt EPS during that period  but now the company looks to be hitting their numbers

	The company has a market cap of  19 billion and a Forward PE of 15  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of  B  in Value and Growth  but  C  in Momentum  The stock has been hammered of late  as an earnings report in August disappointed  It s off over 25  since the report  but due to falling estimates  investors should stay away 

Q2 results

	The company reported Q2 EPS on August 25th  where it missed on both the top and bottom line  The big red flag was the comparable sales which came in lower than expected  The report sent the stock tumbling  falling from  90 a share to  75  Now with the stock under  70  estimates continue to be revised lower  a sign it s still time to avoid the stock 

Estimate Revisions

	Over the last 60 days  estimates have been revised lower for all time frames  For fiscal year 2016  the numbers have been taken down 2 8   from  4 64 to  4 51  For next year  estimates are now seen at  4 95  down from  5 17 or 4 2

The solution is built on Equinix s International Business Exchange  IBX  data center that provides Equinix Internet Exchange and Cloud Exchange  The deal will enable Equinix to address the increasing demand for secure network and quality services from enterprises globally 
The Performance Hub permits the organization to connect its public or private cloud to theEquinix network  The increasing complexity in cloud infrastructure has led to growing demand for such solutions  These solutions increase the flexibility of the infrastructure and reduce costs for companies  It is expected that the lower cost proposition will lead to quicker adoption of Performance Hub solutions  which bodes well for suppliers such as Equinix 
Going forward  through this solution  Equinix will enable customers to increase the efficiency of their IT infrastructure and remove complexities related to administration and management of their infrastructure  while significantly reducing costs  This attracts customers to use the Equinix platform 
The company remains positive on the growing demand for data centers attributed to the Big Data exchanges  To meet this demand  the global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management 
The company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8  from 2013 to 2017 and reach  24 0 billion  Based on this projection  Equinix projects revenue growth rate of 10  through 2017

31941,253456,EQIX,REIT Poised To Grow On Low Rates  Stand alone Sector And More,opinion,"Uncertainty about Fed policy has affected REIT stock prices lately  but the industry has enough reasons to cheer up investors  This is because  not only did the industry carve a niche and earn its own headline sector under the Global Industry Classification Standard  GICS   Fed officials keep repeating that they plan to keep rates low for an extended period  which should be a net positive for the REIT space in the long run 
No doubt  the exclusive REIT headline sector will  and push up valuations over time  Moreover  a steady rate  at least in the near term  would help in making their dividends more attractive than yields on other money market and fixed income accounts  But the drivers of REITs are not limited to only these factors  REITs have ample scope to excel going forward  In fact  for gains over the long term  one should look forward to an added boost from solid fundamentals in several asset categories that REITs own and operate 
Industrial REITs
In the industrial REITs market  demand for space has been fairly strong  This is because  amid economic expansion  an e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other such options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  And with a larger customer base  companies are opting for supply chain consolidation  resulting in greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  thereby creating scope for industrial REITs to flourish 
Residential REIT
In apartment markets  supply has been a major concern in recent months  particularly in the high end and luxury apartment categories  However  market fundamentals are still steady in the mid range markets  In fact  residential REIT Apartment Investment and Management Company  AIV    commonly known as Aimco   with a portfolio that is diversified both in terms of geography and price point is still enjoying relatively stable revenues 
Moreover  the student housing market recorded solid rent growth in the fall 2016 leasing session  though leasing slowed to some extent  per a recent  by Axiometrics  Going by statistics  the effective rent levels for fall 2016 have averaged  618 per bed nationally  This denotes a rise of 2 3  from a year ago  with the majority of properties averaging in the range of 2 4  
Notably  student REITs lease their units to students  and hence their properties are generally situated in close proximity to colleges and universities  Therefore  enrollment growth ends up being a major driver for such assets  With a higher education earnings gap    earning just 62  of what the college graduate is making   enrollment statistics is expected to get a boost  Also  there is pent up demand for new  purpose built student housing properties that they prefer to shift to  given their better amenities than old  outdated housing 
Retail REITs
For retail REITs  the absence of ample supply is expected to help keep the fundamentals favorable  Also  upbeat consumer confidence and increasing consumer spending amid an improving economy infuse optimism into the retail market  And a  of 3 6  increase in holiday sales this year by the National Retail Federation  which is above the 10 year average growth of 2 5   further raises hope for the retail market 
Obviously  mall traffic declines and store closures remain lingering issues  But amid rising competition from online retailers  retail REITs are focusing on the omni channel retailing concept  They are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones and distribution centers as well as embracing the latest technologies to offer attractive services to tenants and mall visitors  Eventually  these will only help increase traffic 
Also  retail REITs like Kimco Realty Corporation  NYSE KIM  are prioritizing the expansion of the small shop portfolio  Such shops comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices which enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  thereby offering a strategic way to beat online retailing blues 
Data Center REITsData center REITs are experiencing a boom market  This is being driven by growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increased number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  These REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book  producing  of 25 39  in the first nine months of 2016 
Office REITs
With economic improvement and recovery in the job market  healthy growth in demand for office spaces is expected  This is because as the economy revives and business grows  corporate sectors seek expansion and rent more space to accommodate an increased workforce  However  with a modest supply rise  the office market is expected to grow at a moderate pace for the rest of the year 
Health Care REITs
Finally  the increase in the elderly population is expected to take place at a significantly higher rate than the overall population in the next 8 to 10 years  and this elderly age cohort is an important component of health care utilization  Therefore  the consequent proliferation of health care expenses along with a rise in new insured individuals with health care reforms is expected to continue driving demand for several types of health care 
Medical office buildings are opening up solid scope for growth  Consolidation among physician groups  hospitals and increasing transfer of hospital services to outpatient facilities are boosting demand in this category  Therefore  despite the lingering rate issues and their adverse relation with health care REIT s long term leased assets  selective investments in health care REITs can help scoop up returns 
Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include American Tower Corporation  AMT   Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Inc   EQIX   The Macerich Company  NYSE MAC   MAC  and Mack Cali Realty Corp   CLI

This week saw another big announcement in Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI   picking up Linear Technology   NASDAQ LLTC    Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO   finally accepting Verizon s offer and some speculation of a hostile takeover of Micron  And of course there were the hottest tech earnings from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Twitter  Groupon   NASDAQ GRPN   and so on 
Here are the top stories 
Earnings Highlights
Apple  Apple saw unit declines across all major product lines from iPhones to iPads and Macs although iPad revenues grew possibly because people are upgrading to newer models  It s also likely that people are reluctant to buy new iPhones with the next model just around the corner 
At any rate  the iPhone numbers were better than expected  which sent the shares up  Services Apple Music  the App Store  iTunes and iCloud  were a bright spot and now generate more revenue than both iPads and Macs    For more details read  
Alphabet  Alphabet s revenue and earnings topped estimates  The FX impact on revenue was negative on a year on year basis  The Google segment constituted substantially all of the business with Mobile and YouTube remaining strong drivers 
Google continues to sacrifice prices for volume  which helped it grow the advertising business   Nest  Fiber and Verily contributed to Other Bets revenue  For more details read  
Amazon  The company blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenue and earnings with the FX impact coming in positive across all segments  The North America and AWS segments were strong contributors to profits while investments in international continued  Operating efficiencies continued in the last quarter and the tax rate also continued to decline 
The company promised heavy investments to build out 18 fulfillment centers in the current quarter that will help it cope with the fourth quarter surge in demand  It continues to take the Prime advantage to new markets  For more details read  
Facebook  Almost like clockwork  Facebook comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines  This time  results were driven by very strong growth in mobile and continued growth in its huge user base 
But Facebook isn t satisfied with being the place where practically everyone on the planet socializes on  It has big ambitions to deliver other experiences  and build the social media one as well   After all  there s a limit to the real estate that you can plant ads on and this could curb its future growth  So the company has laid out future growth plans and intends to step up investments in emerging areas like AR VR   Messenger  WhatsApp  and so forth  For more details read  
Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN   The company reported another very strong quarter with margins continuing to expand significantly from the year ago quarter  TI as it is better known  has moved away from the fast growing  or in other words erratic  consumer electronics market for deep focus on automotive  industrial and communications markets 
Current R D efforts are focused on very long term analog and embedded processing solutions for these markets that will help the company to continue filling up its advanced  cost efficient fabs thereby driving up its margins  For more details read  
 Twitter  Twitter shares plunged 11  following disappointing second quarter results and third quarter guidance  It appears that all the efforts of current management to bring back users haven t yet yielded the desired results because user growth was again sluggish  For more details read  
Analog Devices to Buy Linear Technology
Since the boards of both companies have signed the deal and turned it over for regulatory approval  Linear Technology may soon become part of Analog Devices  For Linear  the offer of a 24  premium  or  14 8 billion   which will be paid in 58 million new shares and cash  through  7 3 million in fresh debt and Analog s balance sheet cash   was too good to pass up 
For Analog Devices  it is an acquisition of products  there is minimal product overlap and some possibility of cross selling   technology  Linear s power conversion products can complement Analog s data conversion capabilities targeting wireless  automotive and industrial customers  and an extremely strong engineering team that it has said it will focus on retaining  Moreover  annual synergies after 18 months are expected to be  150 million 
Unrelated to the acquisition  Analog Devices raised its fiscal third quarter guidance  revenue up from  800 million  840 million to  865 million and adjusted EPS of  0 77  0 78  up from prior guidance of  0 66  0 74 
Verizon Confirms Yahoo Buy
Verizon is buying Yahoo for  4 83 billion en route to transforming itself into an Internet company  In 2014  it acquired another ailing Internet giant AOL for  4 4 billion and Yahoo s core assets will be folded into this AOL business  Mayer will continue at Yahoo through the process but it s likely that Tim Armstrong  who heads AOL will take over the combination once the acquisition is complete 
Verizon has been buying online properties and will continue doing so to reach more users  With Yahoo  it will reach a billion users and the goal is to double this number by 2020  Advertising and video are two of its focus areas that are expected to help it diversify away from the highly regulated  low growth carrier business 
The deal will draw the attention of regulators as Verizon s history with law enforcement hasn t been spectacular to date  The company was earlier charged with planting super cookies to track users and passing on their details to advertisers without their consent  But Verizon is determined to collect more data and that s the reason for these acquisitions  It s highly doubtful that it will become the next Google or Facebook  but even capturing a few points of market share will make this a good deal for Verizon 
For Yahoo  this is the end of the road for one of the web s pioneers  Hopefully the brand stays  and also some of its popular services        
Is Micron a Takeover Target 
There was renewed speculation about a possible takeover after the board of directors of the company approved a plan to issue one right share for every common share held in the event any individual or group assumed greater than a 5  stake in the company  The rights issue would prevent a hostile takeover of the company  prevent the transfer of control to another party and also enable Micron to continue to use its prior losses to reduce its tax bills   
Two names are at the forefront in this respect  the first is China s Tsinghua Unigroup  which earlier offered  23 billion for the company and then backed out when it was thought that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CIFUS  could oppose it on security concerns 
The second possibility is Intel Corp  NASDAQ INTC  because the chipmaker has already partnered with it to develop its 3D XPoint architecture and other technologies  In the event of an acquisition  Intel would get Micron s other memory technology as well  but would also be saddled with its losses 
What could happen instead is that both Intel and the Chinese company  or any one of them  could increase investment in the company to gain access to some memory technology to further their own growth goals Sector Price Index

5 Strong Sales Growth Stocks to Power Your Portfolio

A healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  However  when it comes to picking stocks  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum 

Nevertheless  it s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  a sustainable bottom line growth invariably requires superior revenues 
	Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  Notably  this metric s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings 
	While sales growth provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  it doesn t indicate whether the company is operating efficiently  A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits 
	Therefore  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments A Strategy to Bet On
	A careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well 
	In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters 
	However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy 

Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

32014,253529,EQIX,Equinix  EQIX  Beats On Q2 AFFO   Revenues  Raises View  revised ,opinion,"Equinix Inc  NASDAQ EQIX      posted strong second quarter 2016 results  wherein both the top and bottom line not only came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimates but also witnessed significant improvement from the year ago quarter 
The company s adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  increased 7 3  year over year to  4 13 per share and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  3 16  The increase is mainly attributable to strong top line growth  partially offset by higher operating expenses and share count 
AFFO is a non GAAP financial measure generally used in the Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT  industry  Equinix converted itself into a REIT company effective Jan 1  2015 Quarter in Detail
Total revenue was  900 5 million  up 35 3  from the year ago quarter  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  894 2 million  The year over year improvement was mainly driven by strong booking activity  net positive pricing actions  and the acquisitions of Telecity and Bit isle 
In the first quarter  total revenue included contributions from the newly acquired businesses  Telecity and Bit isle  which accounted for a respective  107 2 million and  37 3 million 
Equinix continues to witness strong demand for its cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks  The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals  Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms boosted the top line 
Moreover  solid performance in MRR  monthly recurring revenues  per cabinet  MRR churn rate  1 8   and cross connect additions drove the top line  Recurring revenues came in at  851 8 million  95  of the total revenue   up about 36  from the year ago quarter  Non recurring revenues surged 25 3  to  48 7 million  5  of the total revenue  
Revenues from the three geographic regions increased on a year over year basis too  Revenues from the Americas  EMEA and Asia Pacific surged 11 3   72 8  and 55 1  to  413 5 million   300 6 million and  186 4 million  respectively 
Gross margin was 50 5  compared with 52 6  last year  primarily due to increased cost of revenues as a percentage of sales  Total operating expenses increased 38 5  to  291 9 million  Moreover  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses went up 70 basis points  bps  to 32 4  
Adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  came in at  420 3 million  up 35   AFFO increased 31 2  to  290 5 million  On a per share basis  AFFO was  4 13  compared with  3 85 in the year ago quarter Balance Sheet   Cash Flow
Equinix exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  486 5 million  The company s total debt principal outstanding was  7 06 billion as on Jun 30  2016  It generated cash of  278 8 million from operating activities in the second quarter and  383 1 million in the first half of 2016 Guidance
Buoyed by the strong top line performance in the second quarter  Equinix raised its full year revenue and AFFO expectations  Anticipating contributions from the acquisitions of Telecity and Bit isle  the company now projects revenues to come between  3 598 billion and  3 608 billion  mid point  3 603 billion   which exceeds its previous guidance of  3 595 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 590 billion 
Cash selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses are now projected in the range of  782 million to  792 million  mid point  787 million   up from its earlier guidance of  775  795 million  mid point  785 million  
The company predicts adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of  1 658 billion to  1 668 billion  mid point  1 663 billion   higher than the earlier expectation of  1 65 billion  Capital expenditure is expected to be between  950 million and  1 billion  mid point  975 million   up from the previous guidance of  900  1 billion   950 million  
AFFO is anticipated to be  1 04  1 05 billion  mid point  1 045 billion   higher than the previous projection of  1 015 billion 
For the third quarter  Equinix expects revenues in the range of  915 million to  921 million  mid point  918 million   lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  920 93 million  Cash gross margin is expected to be approximately 68   while SG A expenses are expected in the  199  205 million band 
Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be  419 million to  425 million  Capital expenditure is projected in the band of  270 million to  290 million Our Take
Equinix reported better than expected second quarter results  The company s top and bottom line results also improved on a year over year basis  Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services by corporations and benefits of the recently acquired Telecity and Bit isle businesses  Equinix witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals 
Moreover  the upbeat guidance for full year 2016 was encouraging  Equinix is presently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program  We are also optimistic on the company s recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March this year 
Equinix operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management  which should drive its revenues going ahead 
However  intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT T  NYSE T     and CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL      may affect product pricing  thereby denting Equinix s margins 
A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes 
Equinix has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Amkor Technology Inc      sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake  The original article  issued yesterday  August 4  2016  should no longer be relied upon  ",2016-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/equinix-(eqix)-beats-on-q2-affo---revenues,-raises-view-(revised)-200146456",200146456
32015,253530,EQIX,Technology Stock Roundup  ATVI  EA  PCLN  LNKD  AMZN  GOOGL,opinion,"Technology earnings are winding down  so just a few big companies like ActiVision  Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN   and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  reported numbers last week  But there were other interesting stories  like Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  buying Jet com  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   launching Prime Air and Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Verily teaming up with GlaxoSmithKline to develop bioelectronics products 
Here are the top stories 
Earnings Highlights
ActiVision  ActiVision s second quarter earnings were driven by three factors  Overwatch  which garnered more than 15 million users since its release on May 24  King Digital  which started contributing to revenue  and the Call of Duty franchise that continued to shine  Behind that excitement was the steady increase in subscription revenue that continued to offset the decline in product sales  Gaming companies will however be changing the way they report revenue deferrals  so the revenue number could start looking a bit different going forward  For further details read  
Electronic Arts  In Electronic Arts   it was more about FIFA Ultimate Team  as well as mobile games like Star Wars  Galaxy of Heroes and NBA Live  And similar to ActiVision  the company saw digital revenue growth that was partially offset by continued declines in packaged goods sales  The changing accounting system applies here too  For further details read  
Priceline  The online travel agent with huge exposure to Europe came out unscathed from Brexit  the British pound devaluation  currency headwinds and ADR pressure to report results that were better than guided and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While acquisitions did contribute to results  it s management s habit of conservatism that allowed the company to post another earnings beat  For further details read  
LinkedIn  The social networking company that will soon become a part of Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    reported a solid quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both revenue and earnings  The results were helped by ongoing investments in mobile  global expansion of content and jobs  and the acquisitions of lynda com and Connectifier  Management believes that being acquired by Microsoft will help the company to scale and deliver value to the global workforce  For further details read  
Walmart Jet com To Take On Amazon
It s being rumored by  people close to the matter  that discount etailer Jet com will be acquired by discount retailer Wal Mart for around  3 billion  This is  nearly double Jet s valuation at its last funding round late last year and it s probably warranted because the company said it sold  90 million worth merchandise on its platform in May 2016  which is nearly triple the  33 million worth it sold last December 
Jet charges  50 a year for the guaranteed cheapest price for any item being sold  which is attractive enough for cost conscious consumers  nearly 3 6 million of which have become customers  To get this done  it partners with 1 600 sellers 
Cash infusion would help Jet a lot to scale its efforts and take on Amazon directly as it has always promised to do  On the other hand  Wal Mart s online efforts have been less than desirable with sales reportedly decelerating even as Amazon grows in leaps and bounds  The company has promised to add millions of items to broaden its range of offerings  but the technology to do more  Jet uses an algorithmic approach to determine discounts based on order size  shipping distance  marketing e mail sign ups and a customer s willingness to forego the right to return an item  can t hurt      
Amazon Prime Air
Amazon is officially taking over some of its own package delivery  The company is showcasing the first of 40 jets it leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group at the Seafair Air Show  The Amazon One as it is called is a Boeing  NYSE BA  767 300  which has Prime Air emblazoned on its side  a huge branding exercise for its Prime membership program  The planes will supplement logistics and delivery services it already uses from UPS and FedEx  NYSE FDX   Amazon has had issues with third party delivery services in the past as it grapples to deliver on its one day and two day free shipping promise to Prime members  The aircraft are expected to help the process  especially during the busy holiday season  Amazon also expects to add 18 fulfillment centers this quarter so it can service the huge demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter  While the company may not stop using independent carriers just yet because of the high demand  it obviously stands to generate cost savings if it takes these operations in house 
Alphabet Glaxo Partnership
GlaxoSmithKline plc has signed an agreement with Alphabet subsidiary Verily Life Sciences to form a JV called Galvani Bioelectronics  The goal is to invest  540 million   714 million  over seven years to create devices that can replace faulty nerve signals responsible for diseases like diabetes  asthma and arthritis  Glaxo will bring its knowledge of drug discovery and development to the table with Verily supplying the necessary expertise in miniaturizing low power electronics  data analytics and building software to come up with clinical applications  The companies expect to have effective bioelectronics therapies for regulatory approval by 2023 Computer and Technology Sector Price Index Other stories you might have missed

Apple Energy Sales  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   subsidiary Apple Energy got the necessary regulatory approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to start selling excess solar power it produces at its three installations as well as the new campus in Cupertino  better known as the Spaceship   Other than its own installations  Apple has agreements to buy clean energy from a couple of in Nevada and one in Monterey County  Apple Energy applied for approval in June 
Facebook Hardware Lab  The leading social networking company now has a hardware lab a third of the size of a football field located inside its main campus  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   is most unlikely to get into hardware manufacturing itself  but the computerized lathes  industrial mills and tools suggest that it will dapple with the kinds of hardware that use its software to better understand what works and what doesn t  This isn t the first time we ve heard of hardware form Facebook  the company recently launched Oculus Rift  it has designed a 360 degree camera  it tests dronesin Somerset  England   it has built an R D team called Building 8 and has scooped up Regina Dugan  who was then responsible for new tech gadgets at Google after serving as director of the Pentagon s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  or DARPA 
Facebook Olympics Features  Facebook has added a few features to bring the Olympics closer to people  Profile frames  as the first one is called  adds a frame around your picture with the flag of the country you re cheering for below  Second  if you share photos or live broadcast video using the MSQRD app during the games  the flag will appear over your face like a mask  Third  from August 1 5  Facebook will serve up an Olympics related greeting in your News Feed with the option to click through to a page of  dynamic Olympic content  curated by Facebook tailored just for you 
Intel has New CIO  Intel   NASDAQ INTC   has appointed Paula Tolliver as corporate VP and CIO  replacing Kim Stevenson who will take on the role of COO of Intel s Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture  CISA  Group reporting to group President Dr  Venkata  Murthy  Renduchintala  Tolliver previously has been a Dow Chemicals executive for 20 years 
Microsoft Bond Sale  Microsoft announced the pricing of its  19 75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in what Bloomberg says was the third largest U S  corporate bond sale of 2016  The cash will be used for general corporate purposes which includes acquisitions  funding for working capital  capital expenditures  repurchases of its capital stock and repayment of its existing debt  The offer closes on August 8 
Alphabet Bonds  Similar to other technology giants  Google is also refinancing  2 billion of its debt rather than bringing its offshore cash home  The tax laws require companies to pay the 35  of the cash repatriated  which makes these multinationals with huge international businesses hold their cash offshore  In Alphabet s case  it also has a large number of other projects on hand  so there s plenty of use for the roughly 40  of the balance sheet cash it holds in the U S  It also generates significant cash on a quarterly basis  So raising fresh debt  Moody s rating AA2  to retire old obligations makes perfect sense 
Target Will Sell Amazon Gadgets Again  Bloomberg reports that Target will carry Amazon devices like its Kindles again  The devices were banned in 2012  with Wal Mart also following suit soon thereafter  as it was thought at the time that selling Amazon devices would drive sales away from the traditional retailers to Amazon  But it s now estimated that the online retailer already has a Prime member in half of U S  households  so stealing customers may not be a factor now  More important is probably the ability to broaden selection so consumers are more satisfied with traditional retail  This is a big win for Amazon because its devices will become even more accessible now that they will be selling at 1 800 odd Target stores 
Twitter Plans For The Olympics  Twitter is creating a dedicated section in Moments that will feature content and stories as they happen during the Games that users can react to with more than 200 hashtag triggered Twitter emojis that it has also launched  The company is promising users inside access  commentary  highlights and conversation through its Twitter  Vine and Periscope platforms  It is also featuring live Olympic Moments in Australia  Brazil  Canada  Mexico  Japan  UK and the U S

DoJ Royalty Decision On Music Streaming  Much to the chagrin of music publishers  Sony ATV owned by Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson and Universal owned by Vivendi  PA VIV  are the largest music publishers right now   artists and their organizations like American Society of Composers  Authors and Publishers  ASCAP  and Broadcast Music Inc   BMI   the DoJ has again ruled in a way that favors music streamers  Judge Denise Cote has ruled that no changes were warranted at this time to the laws governing consent decrees for payments through ASCAP and BMI  Judge Cote said that Pandora could therefore keep paying 1 87  of annual income rather than the escalating structure requested by ASCAP that would require it to pay 3  in 2014 and 2015  Earlier  she allowed Pandora the right to obtain a blanket license to all ASCAP music 
Apple On Patenting Device Design  Apple has roped in some designers to file an amicus curiae with the Supreme Court to uphold the decision of a lower court granting it  548 million  As things stand now  Samsung  KS 005930  is required to pay Apple the amount but is appealing to get it down to  399 million on grounds that the fine is excessive  Apple s supporters are Calvin Klein  Paul Smith and Alexander Wang in this fight  Samsung also has many supporters it acquired through an amicus curiae filed earlier that mainly comprises tech firms that fear the upholding of an archaic law and includes organizations like the EFF 
Google Can Test Delivery Drones  Google  which has been testing its drones over NASA property  has now been granted broader permission by the Federal Aviation Administration  Google s test sites are in Alaska  Nevada  Texas  New York  Virginia  and North Dakota  so presumably the testing will take place there  The search giant intends to use its drone service for high speed low pollution package delivery by 2017  around the same time that Amazon s drones are also ready  The FAA may now be playing catch up to the industry as Amazon recently announced it would by testing its drones in the UK 
Alibaba  NYSE BABA  Gets Favorable Ruling  Alibaba continues to battle big brands suing it for profiting from the sale of counterfeit goods on its online marketplaces  However  in one aspect of a case filed by Paris based Kering  PA PRTP   the company has received a favorable ruling from a U S  district court  The point seems to be nothing more than a technicality and Alibaba is unlikely to get away from other charges  In this case  the court said that Kering  failed to allege the existence of a conspiracy  between Alibaba and its merchants  He didn t say that a conspiracy did not exist

Uber Maps  Uber intend to use  500 million of the money it recently raised from a Saufi Arabian wealth fund to build some mapping technology of its own  Uber s moving away from Google Maps has less to do about the accuracy and popularity of Google Maps and more to do with creating a customized system that is more applicable to a pickup service  As the company s current maps expert and former Googler says   Existing maps are a good starting point  but some information isn t that relevant to Uber  like ocean topography  There are other things we need to know a lot more about  like traffic patterns and precise pickup and dropoff locations  Moreover  we need to be able to provide a seamless experience in parts of the world where there aren t detailed maps or street signs

32048,253563,EQIX,Equinix  EQIX  Lags Q1 AFFO But Tops Revenues  Ups View,opinion,Equinix Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   posted mixed first quarter 2016 results  wherein the top line beat estimates but the bottom line missed the same The company s adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  declined approximately 21  year over year to  2 98 per share and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  3 09  The weak bottom line resulted mainly from increased operating expenses and a higher share count  which more than offset the benefit from strong top line growth AFFO is a non GAAP financial measure generally used in the Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT  industry  Equinix converted itself into a REIT company effective Jan 1  2015 Quarter in DetailTotal revenue was  844 2 million  up 31 2  from the year ago quarter  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  841 5 million  The year over year improvement was mainly driven by strong bookings activity  net positive pricing actions  and the acquisitions of Telecity and Bit isle In the first quarter  total revenue included revenues from the newly acquired businesses   Telecity and Bit isle   which contributed  84 4 million and  34 2 million  respectively  Moreover  with these acquisitions  Equinix s total number of IBX data centers has now touched 145  with operations across 21 countries and 40 metros Equinix continues to witness strong demand for its cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks  The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals  Robust growth in revenues from global Colocation and Interconnection platforms boosted the top line Moreover  solid performance in MRR  monthly recurring revenues  per cabinet  MRR churn rate  2 2   and cross connect additions drove revenues  Recurring revenues came in at  797 1 million  94  of the total revenue   up 30 7  from the year ago quarter  Non recurring revenues surged 40 4  to  47 1 million  6  of the total revenue  Revenues from the three geographic regions increased year over year too  Revenues from the Americas  EMEA and Asia Pacific surged 11 1   62 7  and 50  to  404 4 million   267 9 million and  171 9 million  respectively Gross margin was 49  compared with 54  last year  primarily due to increased cost of revenues as a percentage of sales  Total operating expenses increased 57 1  to  303 8 million  Moreover  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses went up 590 basis points  bps  to 36  Adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  came in at  380 7 million  up 24 5   AFFO decreased 5 4  to  209 8 million  Moreover  on a per share basis  AFFO was  2 98  compared with  3 77 in the year ago quarter Balance Sheet   Cash FlowEquinix exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  633 8 billion  The company s total debt principal outstanding was  7 24 billion as on Mar 31  2016  It generated cash from operating activities of  104 3 million in the first quarter GuidanceBuoyed by the strong top line performance in the first quarter  Equinix raised its full year revenue and AFFO expectations  Anticipating revenue additions from the acquisitions of Telecity and Bit isle  the company now projects revenues to exceed  3 595 billion  representing year over year growth of over 32   Earlier  the company was expecting revenues of  3 55 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 568 billion Cash selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses are projected in the range of  775 million to  795 million  AFFO is anticipated to be higher than  1 015 billion  up from previous projection of  970 million The company predicts adjusted EBITDA to exceed  1 65 billion  higher than the earlier guidance of  1 62 billion  Capital expenditure is expected between  900 million and  1 billion For the second quarter  Equinix expects revenues in the range of  893 million to  899 million  mid point   896 million   higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  879 million  Cash gross margin is expected between 67  and 68   while SG A expenses are expected in the  195  201 million range Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be within  403 million to  409 million  Capital expenditure is expected in the band of  222 million to  242 million Our TakeEquinix s first quarter results were mixed with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line missing the same  Notably  the company witnessed robust year over year revenue growth Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for the company s cloud services by corporations  Growth across geographies and business segments also had a positive impact on top line Moreover  the company issued encouraging second quarter guidance and raised the full year revenue outlook  Equinix is presently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program  We are also optimistic on the company s recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March this year Equinix operates across various geographical regions and is increasingly becoming popular among major players in the tech industry for data management  which should drive its revenues However  intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT T   NYSE T   and CenturyLink Inc    NYSE T   may affect product pricing  thereby denting Equinix s margins A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation further add to the woes Equinix has a Zacks Rank  2  Hold   Another technology stock worth looking at is Silicon Motion Technology Corp    NASDAQ SIMO    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ,2016-05-05,Zacks Investment

32060,253575,EQIX,Tech Roundup  OTA Earnings  INTC Mobile Loss  GOOGL Auto,opinion,"Earnings season is winding down and there were just a few hot companies reporting last week  including Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN    TripAdvisor   NASDAQ TRIP    Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Yelp   NYSE YELP   and Fitbit   NYSE FIT    But there were some other interesting headlines such as Intel   NASDAQ INTC   abandoning some SoFIA chips and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   officially announcing its Ford connection 
Here are the top stories 
Earnings Reports
Priceline  Online travel agent  OTA  Priceline com topped first quarter guidance on all counts and easily   All the key performance metrics were strong  The biggest growth engine  hotel room nights continued to grow strongly  as did rental car days  Air tickets were weaker  Bookings on the agency model  70  of bookings  were up very strong double digits  an indication of the health of the busness 
Management expects FX to have a negligible impact on second quarter results  but still produced inexplicably weak guidance  especially given that it now also has vacation rental properties  integrated into Booking com   which grew 40  in the last quarter  But three things could be at play  first that management tends to guide conservatively  second  they are expecting some early bookings related to summer travel to be realized in the third quarter  and third  the travel market is slowing down 
The first one is more likely because the second factor is seasonality and would be roughly comparable year to year making the guidance below seasonal  The third reason is also unlikely because market research projections point to a strong travel market 
TripAdvisor  Unlike Priceline  TripAdvisor  as both subscription and advertising sales declined  The core Hotel business  which makes up 86  of revenue  was weak  with the Other segment growing  North America was the only region that grew sales  The weakness in Hotels is tied to the rollout of the Instant Booking feature  which defers revenue recognition to when the traveler stays at the hotel rather than when the hotel is booked  which gives the impression that s ales were weaker  So its impact is less apparent in areas like North America  where it was rolled out first 
Alibaba  The Chinese ecommerce company reported  on revenues that surpassed  The last quarter s results validated Alibaba s position that a weaker Chinese economy wouldn t dampen investor appetite to use its services  The company did particularly well in mobile where GMV soared 71  and mobile monthly active users jumped 42   Cloud revenue  while at just 4  of revenue  grew triple digits 
GrubHub  The online and mobile food ordering company reported first quarter 2016 results  wherein net income decreased 6  on a year over year basis although earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Management called out Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Uber Eats as new bogeys  which probably hurt share prices  But management remains confident about its growth prospects  stressing on the fact that delivery times can t be speeded up with more bikes on the road but with sending more orders to restaurants  something it is confident it will manage  And true enough  it reportedly has partnerships with 40K takeout restaurants across 1 000 plus U S  cities with millions of users availing the service  So it s definitely not a write off yet 
Yelp  The company s loss was greater than the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenue was ahead  But management chose to be optimistic with the statement  We hit a major milestone in the first quarter  surpassing 100 million cumulative reviews   But it was encouraging to see that local ad revenue grew 40  with local ad accounts growing 34   Another important metric was app unique devices  which grew 32  
Fitbit  Fitbit s top and bottom lines   The company will however be spending more on R D  so it can come out with more innovative and cost effective products  and marketing  which is vital for any consumer products company  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  can come in with a Watch and take immediate market share because it already has a loyal customer base and brand value  For a company of Fitbit s stature  it s not just a question of maintaining its brand image but also building it  especially as it targets markets across the world  So these expenses are necessary and not extravagant  certainly no reason to punish the shares 
ActiVision  The company  for both revenue and earnings  The acquisition of King Digital Entertainment  increasing digital revenues and continued strength in the Call of Duty title were the drivers 
Intel Dumps SoFIA  Broxton
Intel shocked the investor and analyst communities when it announced the 11  reduction in its workforce and everyone has been wondering whether there was some specific area that was getting the axe  No one is saying that it s all coming from mobile that Intel broke out for a couple of years before hiding it behind the PC business  But Intel s mobile efforts have struggled and failed to make an impact on the market that continues to be dominated by ARM architecture and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  chips  The fact that Intel hasn t been able to get its mobile chips out fast enough also meant that it missed important opportunity windows   
Now Intel is saying that doing away with some SoFIA  Smart or Feature Phone on Intel Architecture  chips  specifically 3Gx  LTE  LTE2 and the Broxton SoC for smartphones and tablets will help it move resources to  products that deliver higher returns and advance our strategy   We don t doubt it 
But the question seems to be what these products might be  If you re thinking data center  cloud etc  think again  Intel may have fallen back in the mobile race  but it refuses to bow out  It s now saying that it will invest to make a comeback when it s time for 5G adoption  Well    that s still several years away  so we can chill on Intel mobile for now 
It s Official  Alphabet and Ford Chrysler Have Deal
In the previous week I commented on a fresh rumor involving Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler  NYSE FCAU   wherein the two were thought to be collaborating on self driving cars  Fiat is carrying a huge debt pile so resources to fund this new technology were scarce  Alphabet  on the other hand  is widely believed to have a headstart in the development of self driving technology  having already tested it across several million miles 
Last week  Google confirmed the rumor saying that it would be loading its technology into 100 new 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans with the expectation that the first few would hit the roads by year end  This is the first time that the company is working directly with an auto manufacturer  its previous attempts involved a ready made vehicle from Toyota and another it built from scratch  
It is a non exclusive deal on both sides  meaning that both the companies have the option of seeking other partners Other stories you might have missed

32085,253600,EQIX,Today s 5 Most Important Tech Charts,opinion,"She s one of the best in the business at spotting major tech trends before they happen 
And since we re all about spotting big trends early  too  venture capitalist Mary Meeker is well worth our time and attention 
Particularly right now  too 
Each year  Meeker releases a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation on the state of the internet 

 From the funding climate to smartphone adoption to tech giants to cutting edge inventions  the Mary Meeker Internet Trends report has it all   writes TechCrunch s Josh Constine 

He s right 
Plus  there s something about seeing data represented visually that drives home the significance of trends more powerfully 
More importantly  it highlights their investment potential 
There s just one problem  I m guessing you don t have the time to sift through all 213 slides   Told you it was comprehensive  
I m here to help  I m going to give you the  Cliffs Notes  version of Meeker s 2016 Internet Trends report 
Here are five of the most fascinating stats and charts she shared   and of course  their investment implications 
  Tech Stat  1  Old  Advertising  Habits Die Hard
As the old saying goes   Advertising follows eyeballs   So why is it that companies still refuse to accept this reality 
Ad spending on print  radio  and TV accounted for 65  of total advertising spending  even though people spend 53  of their total time in those legacy media 
As you can see  the biggest disconnect and opportunity exists in mobile advertising  Ad spending needs to roughly double from current levels to reach equilibrium 

Cashing in on this trend couldn t be more straightforward   own the platforms that serve up the majority of ads 
That leads us to Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc  and Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB   Combined  the companies control 76  of the U S  advertising market  according to Meeker 
  Tech Stat  2  Amazon  and E Commerce  Eating the World
As billionaire chairman of Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD   Eddie Lampert  is learning the hard way  brick and mortar retail is on its deathbed 
That s because consumers are doing more shopping online 
Anecdotally  I m sure we ve all realized the change in our personal shopping habits  But as you can see  this is a widespread phenomenon  More than 10  of retail purchases are now made online  And there s no end in sight to the growth 

The investment implications couldn t be more obvious 
Avoid  or consider selling short  old school  struggling retailers like Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP   and own the undisputed king of online retailing  Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  
  Tech Stat  3  There s Only One Social Media Network That Matters
I ve spilled plenty of pixels bashing the long term potential for  darling turned dud  Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  
Thanks to Meeker  all I have to do now is point to this picture 

While Baby Boomers have been the engine of economic growth for decades  it s now the Millennials  turn  There are now more Millennials  87 million  than Boomers  76 million   And their preference for social media platforms is clear 
In terms of time spent and penetration  there s Facebook and everyone else  If you re going to own any social media stocks  there s only one choice 
  Tech Stat  4  Machine Speech Recognition Now Matches Humans
From Amazon s  to Apple Inc s  NASDAQ AAPL  Siri  virtual assistant use is on the rise 
Heck  20  of Google searches on Android devices are now voice 
It also helps that voice interfaces are quick  easy  personalized  hands free  and affordable 
There s a more important key trend underpinning this growth  though  More accurate voice recognition 
In fact  machine speech recognition is now at human levels in low noise environments  according to Meeker 

As for Siri  it still struggles with my wife s Southern accent  so it s clear that we need more tech advancement here 
As Meeker points out  in addition to handling diverse speaker and accent characteristics  voice recognition in heavy background noise situations is the next frontier of innovation and growth 
And that s what makes smaller innovators in this space such compelling investments  I m talking about guys like Nuance Communications Inc  NASDAQ NUAN  and Kopin Corporation  NASDAQ KOPN 
  Tech Stat  5  Data Storage and Security Explosion
As you know  our  always on  always connected  society means there s an incredible amount of digital data being created 
And there s no end in sight  either 
In fact  we churn out an astonishing 2 5 quintillion  that s a one followed by 18 zeros  bytes of new data every day 
The end result  As Meeker points out  global data growth is soaring at a 50  compound annual growth rate 
Interestingly enough  as data volume climbs  storage costs are plummeting by about 20  per year 

This is one heck of a disconnect 
There are two ways to profit from this situation   storage and security 
Data center real estate investment trusts  REITs  like Digital Realty Trust Inc  NYSE DLR   Equinix Inc  NASDAQ EQIX  CoreSite Realty Corporation  NYSE COR   CyrusOne Inc  NASDAQ CONE   Dupont Fabros Technology Inc  NYSE DFT   and Qts Realty Tr  NYSE QTS  have all proved to be reliable performers 
But as storage becomes increasingly cheap and commoditized  these businesses are going to face some headwinds 
When it comes to security  however  I believe there s unbounded upside 
Think about it  It s not enough to just store the data  We need to protect it all  too 
It can be hard to picture the enormity of this expansion in digital terms 
To help  though  try thinking about each byte of data and device as a landmass  The more bytes we produce   and the more devices in use   the larger the overall landmass gets  And every last inch of it needs to be defended against attack 
Long story short   the cyber attack  surface area  is growing at a dizzying pace 
Cyber security provider Proofpoint Inc  NASDAQ PFPT  estimates that it will surge a staggering 44 fold over the next 10 years 
That means the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security  NYSE HACK    and the individual companies in the ETF   promise to be standout performers 
So there you have it  That s my five most important takeaways from Mary Meeker s presentation  And if you re interested in the rest of it  you can read the full report   It s fascinating stuff

32088,253603,EQIX,Will Q1 Earnings Hold A Surprise For Equinix  EQIX  Stock ,opinion,"Equinix Inc    NASDAQ EQIX   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 4  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 5 32  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Equinix operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management should drive revenues in the first quarter 
Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and have helped it to expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003  We expect the company s buyouts of Telecity Group  LON TCY   Bit isle and Nimbo to boost the top line in the quarter 
Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones has been an important part of Equinix s core strategy  We believe that Equinix s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues as well as profitability in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays which may hurt Equinix s first quarter as well as the full year profitability  In Mar 2016  the company announced an aggressive expansion plan for the year  To this end  the company has targeted investment worth more than  4 5 billion this year  This will include opening of data centers  expansion of colocation space and acquisitions 
Moreover  increasing competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT T   NYSE T    Level 3 Communications  COLT and Verizon will affect product pricing  thereby denting margins 
Additionally  the telecommunications industry is undergoing consolidation  As customers combine businesses  the requirement for co location space will decline  thus affecting Equinix s overall growth prospects 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ESP for Equinix is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  3 09 per share 
Zacks Rank  Equinix hold a Zacks Rank  2  However  a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of stocks which you may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Synopsys Inc    NASDAQ SNPS    with an Earnings ESP of  6 38  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Arrow Electronics Inc    NYSE ARW    with an Earnings ESP of  1 42  and a Zacks Rank  2 ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-q1-earnings-hold-a-surprise-for-equinix-(eqix)-stock-200127387,200127387
32123,253638,EQIX,Playing The Data Center Trend,opinion,"The world s biggest technology companies are quietly embracing a huge new growth industry   one that was hatched with the birth of the internet and has soared ever since 
You probably won t read about it in the news  though  After all  these companies aren t making or selling anything for consumer use  And it s not what you d call  sexy  or  exciting  
But it s absolutely critical to our everyday habits 
That s because in our tech laden  always connected lives  and with the incredible growth of mobile devices  we continue to generate an ever increasing amount of data 
As we do  we need places to store  safeguard  and process it 
Namely  in those faceless buildings called data centers 
A Home for Our Digital  Stuff 
Alongside the very first computers in the 1940s came the data center  A cavernous room with an advanced air conditioning system to keep the air cool and clean  and with connections so that people could use the machines 
Whether it s a massive building in Utah like the National Security Agency uses  or a back room at your local auto dealership  these places are critical for the internet  businesses  and consumers  It s where information lives 
But as the internet has exploded   and with it  our data usage   data centers have become even more important  Indeed  the very meaning of a data center is changing  with big consequences for both companies and your experience on the internet 
The Rise of the Mega Data Center
As the amount of data being created has soared  many businesses have neither the desire nor the expertise to manage their information  Instead  they ve outsourced site hosting and data management to companies that specialize in operating mega data centers 
Even very large technology companies will outsource management of their hardware and often even their software to outside firms 
Giant companies like IBM  NYSE IBM   Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and others are building these mega data centers  Some smaller companies are building them  too  And there s even a REIT with exposure to this growing industry   the QTS Realty Trust  NYSE QTS  
As a result  whether it s a site dedicated to just one business or available to many customers  the number of data centers has exploded over the years  rising to over eight million in 2013 
But there s a big shift afoot  In the future  the number of data centers will decline  while the overall size of the data centers that do get built will go way up  as more and more companies participate in the outsourcing trend 
There are a few trends driving this data center growth 
Cost  Mega data centers are extremely expensive  but are much cheaper per unit of computing power or speed  They re cost effective in terms of hardware purchases  utilization of that hardware  air conditioning  and real estate   many of these data centers are purpose built in areas with relatively low land  power  and water costs  The savings allow data center operators to pay for high speed fiber connections  even in places where such connections are rare and expensive 
Access to Better Hardware  Because these mega data centers share resources among their customers  those customers have access to more powerful hardware than they could afford on their own 
The Cloud  Utilizing mega data centers is better for cloud computing because these centers are often directly wired to each other  separate from the public internet  In fact  many of these centers specialize in cloud computing 
Speed  Getting data quickly to the people who need it is paramount  The inter connection among mega data centers and their ability to purchase high speed communications hardware is highly valued and increases a network s speed  Indeed  most of the United States  outbound internet traffic already originates at one of these mega centers and is connected directly to ISPs  without ever touching the  old  network that people think about when they imagine the internet 
Reliability  Even very large companies are starting to realize how difficult it is to run their own data centers reliably  There are just too many variables  Even the most well run data center is vulnerable to a guy with a backhoe and an old cable map in the back of the building  But large  secure data centers protect customers from downtime with instant backups  multiple points of communications entry  and more 
Ubiquity of Software  It used to be that many companies wrote their own data management or information technology software  or used highly customized versions of commercial software  But many industries are moving to common software with relatively little customization  That s because it s both easier and cheaper to maintain  and allows themselves  auditors  regulators  and others to compare companies  IT backbones on an  apples to apples  basis  The trend allows more companies to outsource the management of that software  and big data centers are one place to do that  Once a company has outsourced its software  the decision to outsource the hardware to run it is simple 
How to Play the Rise of the Mega Data Center
There are a few ways to play this trend as an investor 
Data Center Companies  The most obvious is to invest in companies building these large data centers  However  many of those companies are so large that it s not a direct play on the trend  and would merely be one of several areas that propels stock prices 
Others  like QTS and Equinix  are very expensive by traditional valuation metrics  although they may make attractive acquisition candidates as the industry eventually consolidates 
Data Center Service Companies  Another way is to invest in companies that provide hardware  software  or services for these large data centers  Server companies may see mixed results  as new sales to these centers are offset by falling sales to more traditional data centers  But some companies make specialized hardware for data centers  and the ones at the highest ends of their product specialties will benefit from these centers  no corners cut philosophy 
In our technology based Digital Fortunes newsletter  I ve highlighted two companies that should benefit directly from this trend  plus another one more indirectly  And in my VentureCap Strategist premium advisory  I just recommended a little known small cap firm that should also be a direct beneficiary 
As for pick and shovel type plays  you might think that air conditioning companies would benefit from the data center trend  But these big centers are increasingly finding ways to use unchilled outside air to cool the buildings  And of course  one major plus point of these centers is that they can use less air conditioning per unit of computing power  So while local installers will benefit  large air conditioning manufacturers aren t likely to see much advantage from the shift 
Overall  the move towards mega data centers promises better utilization of existing hardware and software technology  It also brings huge pressure to deliver even better technology  as the centers seek to differentiate themselves from each other and from more traditional data centers 
And just as there are semiconductor companies without fabrication facilities of their own  in the future  you may see a major computer company that doesn t own any of its own computers

The major chop continues so I ll just run through the index charts  gold and silver and a few stocks but failed breakouts remain commonplace and as such  tight stops are needed for any buys although I did try some Equinix Inc  NASDAQ EQIX  today at 267 but that quickly failed and took me out right at cost so no biggie

32125,253640,EQIX,Playing The Ratings Game With REITs  And Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Care to take a guess at Lehman Brothers  credit rating right before its bankruptcy  I ll give you some help 
Investment grade ratings range from AAA down to BBB   on the Standard   Poor s ratings scale   Anything below investment grade  BB  and below  is considered high yield  which is also known as speculative grade  sub investment grade  or  junk   The higher the credit rating  the higher the perceived credit worthiness  In other words  high rated companies can probably pay you back 
Thus  you d assume Lehman Brothers had a solidly junky rating   perhaps CCC   reflecting the high risk of default during the credit crisis  right  Actually  Lehman had an  A  rating right before it went bust 
The major ratings agencies   Standard   Poor s  Moody s Investors Services  and Fitch Ratings   took a lot of flak for this egregious misjudgment  To be sure  credit ratings still provide valuable information  In fact  looking up the credit rating and reading the commentary from the ratings agencies is a great place to begin when evaluating a stock 
You can access Standard   Poor s ratings for free by registering on their site  Just keep in mind that the ratings agencies may have missed some material risks  Therefore  we should really take notice when a company has a high yield rating  Yet  most equity investors are unaware of the credit ratings of their holdings 
For example  the following table shows three real estate investment trusts  REITs  Equinix Inc  O EQIX   Crown Castle International  N CCI  and SL Green Realty Corporation  N SLG   that are in the S P 500 

Equinix  Crown Castle International  and SL Green Realty Corp  specialize in data centers  wireless communications towers  and commercial properties  respectively 
I guarantee that the vast majority of retail investors in these stocks have no idea that the S P s long term issuer rating of these REITs is sub investment grade  It s easy to see why these REITs have relatively low ratings  too  Their net debt  debt minus cash  to EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  ratios are all at least 4 0 times  which is high 
The average net debt EBITDA in the S P 500  excluding financials  is 1 36 times  At a time when many high yield bonds are coming under significant pressure  investors need to be vigilant 
I m not saying that these companies will default on their debt  However  I do think these REITs should have much higher yields to compensate investors for the additional risk  which is being ignored 
The cost of debt capital will likely rise for most high yield issuers during the next few years  This will be a painful process for unsuspecting equity investors in highly leveraged companies 
 Rate  Your Portfolio
Most stock watchers fail to appreciate the inextricable linkage between the credit and equity markets  Keep in mind  very few companies have rock solid balance sheets like Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   which is AAA rated 
Sadly  many people s idea of  research  involves pulling up a stock chart and  improperly  drawing some trend lines  If that s the extent of your analysis  then you shouldn t be investing in individual stocks  Stick with exchange traded funds  ETFs  
If you insist on individual stocks  at least do some credit analysis on your portfolio  You ll thank me when defaults spike  sending shockwaves through the credit   and equity   markets

32126,253641,EQIX,Data Center REIT Looks Solid,opinion,"As the cloud continues to grow  companies are finding ways of using off site locations to secure and store their information 
Not only does it clear valuable space  but it is also a more secure place to store it  One company that has been growing at a steady pace in this market is Equinix  O EQIX  
Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Redwood City  California  Equinix  Inc  is a publicly owned REIT  It provides data center services to protect and connect the information assets for the enterprises  financial services companies  and content and network providers primarily in the Americas  Europe  the Middle East  Africa  and the Asia Pacific

They have created a one stop shop for companies looking to secure and expand their wireless and cloud systems 
The theme of mergers and acquisitions has continued with EQIX as they have recently acquired Nimbo  Bit isle  and most recently Telecity  All of these have allowed EQIX to expand into broader markets and have given the view that they will continue to expand over the next several years 
Equinix is positive on the growing demand for data centers driven by the Big Data exchanges  To meet this demand  the global interconnection and data center company is expanding the IBX data centers across the world and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management 
Explosive growth in mobile  content delivery  video streaming  tele presence  social media  and cloud based data traffic offers tremendous revenue opportunities for high margin corporate and retail services such as Ethernet and MPLS

Because of this  security becomes an even greater priority with payments becoming wireless on all of these platforms  All of these factors leave us to believe that Equinix has much room to grow in the near future as demand continues to grow

32127,253642,EQIX,DLR  A High Quality REIT Growing Dividends,opinion,"Digital Realty Trust  NYSE DLR  is a fast growing real estate investment trust  REIT  that has raised its dividend every year since going public in 2004 
While the company is far from having a long enough dividend growth history to quality as a member of the dividend aristocrats list  it has numerous attractive qualities 
Digital Realty is a direct beneficiary of the rapidly growing usage of data by businesses and consumers alike  It powered through the financial crisis and also scores well for dividend safety and growth 
Digital Realty s stock has been one of the best performing holdings in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks and Conservative Retirees portfolios  and we remain optimistic about the company s dividend growth trajectory Business OverviewDigital Realty is a REIT that supports the data center needs of more than 1 600 customers across industries such as financial services  information technology  manufacturing  and more  The company is the largest data center REIT in the world and has a portfolio of 139 operating properties 
Data centers provide secure  continuously available environments for companies to store and process important electronic information such as transactions and digital communications  Data centers can also serve as hubs for internet communications in major metropolitan areas 
The key components of a data center can be seen below and include servers  network equipment  cooling systems  electrical power systems  and more  Data centers consume a lot of power to keep the servers running and the room s temperature under control 
Source  Digital Realty Fact Sheet
Approximately 61  of Digital Realty s rent is from turn key services  in which it provides everything but the servers  Some customers choose to provide the power components used in the data center  e g  HVAC  battery  generator  electrical  and design it all themselves  This mix accounts for another 20  of the company s rent 
Digital Realty generates about 80  of its rent in North America with the rest from Europe  14   and Asia  6    The company s largest tenants are IBM  NYSE IBM   7 5  of rent   CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   6 1    Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   4 0    Facebook  NASDAQ FB   2 3    and AT T  NYSE T   2 1    LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   2 0    and Oracle  NYSE ORCL   2 0   
Digital Realty is also well diversified by customer type  Approximately 33  of Digital Realty s annualized rent is from IT Services  24  from Telecom Network Providers  19  from Other Corporate Enterprises  15  from Financial Services  and 9  from Internet Enterprises Business AnalysisPlaying in a growing industry is almost always better than competing in a shrinking market  In Digital Realty s case  its data center operations are exposed to several long term secular demand drivers 
Simply put  data use is exploding and driving more demand for servers and data centers  Growth of internet traffic  over the top video  cloud  and mobile data traffic is expected to range from 21  to 45  per year over the next several years  according to an investor presentation by Digital Realty 
As a result  Markets and Markets expects the global data center solutions market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11 7  from 2015 through 2020 to nearly double in total value  As the largest data center operator in the world  Digital Realty is well positioned to ride this tailwind 
Data center REITs are also attractive businesses because their services are non discretionary expenses for companies   the data being stored and processed in data centers is needed to run their operations  As a result  Digital Realty enjoys high utilization rates in most economic environments 
As seen below  Digital Realty s total portfolio occupancy has remained about 90  in each of the last seven years  including 95  in 2009  The company also notes that its tenant retention ratio has been strong at about 72  of net rentable square footage 
Source  Digital Realty Company Overview
Occupancy and retention rates are also high because it is costly for customers to switch data center facilities  Digital Realty cites that it costs customers anywhere from  10 20 million to migrate to a new facility  A new data center deployment also costs customers  15 30 million  further reducing the incentive to switch landlords  The following chart shows how much higher tenant retention rates have been for data center operators compared to other types of landlords 
Source  Digital Realty Company Overview
Digital Realty s average remaining lease term with customers is 5 8 years  and fewer than 15  of its total leases are set to expire in any of the next five years  Most of the company s leases also contain 2 3  annual rental rate increases  As long as customers stay financially healthy to pay their rent obligations  Digital Realty has solid cash flow visibility 
The company is also uniquely positioned to meet the needs of major businesses because of its scale  reputation  and favorable real estate locations in major metropolitan areas  Having customers such as IBM  Facebook  LinkedIn  and Oracle speak to the quality of Digital Realty s properties 
We also like the company s diversification by customer  top 20 tenants are 44  of annualized rent  and industry  which helps smooth out earnings  Digital Realty s mix of data centers is also improving 
In October 2015  the company acquired Telx Holdings for about  1 9 billion  Telx is a leading national provider of data center colocation solutions and doubled Digital Realty s high margin colocation business  which allows companies to rent partial spaces within a data center 
Telx also introduced Digital Realty to over 1 000 new companies it can target for its existing data centers  This is important because over 80  of the company s traditional large footprint leasing activity over the last two years has been repeat business with existing customers 
Overall  Digital Realty operates in an industry with favorable growth trends and gains benefits from its scale  cost efficient real estate locations  non discretionary services  and strong customer relationships Digital Realty s Key RisksWe generally avoid investing in technology companies because industry trends can unexpectedly and quickly take a turn for the worse  In Digital Realty s case  we think the biggest risk is that data centers are overbuilt in anticipation of strong data usage trends 
After all  Digital Realty cannot control the capital allocation of its competitors  As long as cheap financing is widely available and industry margins are high  more supply will enter the market  If an excess supply of data centers occurs  Digital Realty could experience unfavorable lease renewal rates  13  of its square footage under lease expires through 2017   weaker profitability  and lower growth 
As seen below  new construction is set to double data center supply in some of the cities Digital Realty operates in  Time will tell if this new capacity loosens the market s favorable fundamentals  but it s important to remember that Digital Realty is somewhat protected due to its scale  reputation  cost efficiency performance  and financial stability 
Source  Digital Realty Fact Sheet
As technology evolves  it s also possible that companies learn to store and manage data much more efficiently  This could reduce demand for physical data center space  However  there would have to be major advancements to offset the 20   annual growth in data usage across Digital Realty s major markets 
Beyond risks unique to the data center market  Digital Realty faces risk from the health of capital markets  REITs are required to pay out 90  of their taxable income as a dividend to keep their REIT classification and the favorable tax treatment it comes with 
Since REITs pay out such a high amount of their earnings  they have less capital on hand to grow their businesses  As a result  they typically issue shares and debt  As seen below  Digital Realty s capital structure was over 50  debt last year  and the company s diluted shares outstanding have risen from 24 million shares in 2005 to a whopping 139 million shares last year Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
REITs can run into trouble if credit markets tighten up and or their share prices sink  raising their cost of capital and potentially causing a liquidity squeeze 
Digital Realty currently maintains investment grade credit ratings from the major agencies  although it sits at the bottom tier of what is considered  investment grade   The company has just  75 million in cash on hand compared to  5 9 billion of debt  but it has a relatively conservative debt maturity schedule with nothing major coming due until 2020  see below  
However  all REIT investors should be aware of capital market risk   companies will cut the dividend before they miss interest payments during times of financial stress 
Source  Digital Realty Fact SheetDividend Analysis  Digital RealtyWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Digital Realty s Dividend Safety Score of 77 indicates that its current dividend payment appears to be very safe today  The company s adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  payout ratio in 2015 was a reasonable 78   and Digital Realty targets an AFFO payout ratio below 90  
While this would be a relatively high payout ratio for many types of businesses  Digital Realty has generated very stable earnings and growth since it went public Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Demand for data centers is also somewhat resistant to economic cycles  The company s sales grew over 20  in 2009 as businesses continued outsourcing their mission critical data center needs  DLR s stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 29  in 2008 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While sales growth has decelerated over the last five years  Digital Realty has continued to earn a reasonable return on equity in the high single digits  The company s return is limited by its capital intensity and competitive nature of rental rates  but its profitability should be consistent Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As long as industry fundamentals remain positive and capital markets remain friendly  we believe Digital Realty s dividend is in good shape from a safety perspective Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
DLR has raised its dividend every year since its IPO in 2004 and grown its dividend by about 13  per year over the last 10 years  However  as seen below  dividend growth has decelerated  The company most recently raised its 2016 annualized common dividend by 3 5   marking its 11th consecutive increase  Going forward  we expect dividend growth in the low  to mid single digits Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationDLR s stock has a dividend yield of 4   which is below its five year average dividend yield of 4 9   The stock also trades at 18 times FFO per share  We think the company can continue generating mid single digit income growth  which would imply annual total return potential of 8 10  per year 
We have enjoyed a total return of more than 40  since initiating our position in the stock last summer  and it s hard to make a strong valuation case for the company today  These situations are difficult  Should we sell our stock or hold on ConclusionAt the end of the day  Digital Realty seems a bit overpriced today and we are not interested in adding to our position  However  data center fundamentals look strong  and we like the themes the company is benefiting from 
As long as Digital Realty is keeping its data centers occupied at favorable rental rates and capital markets remain healthy  we are content to keep collecting our quarterly dividend payments  We plan to hold Digital Realty and some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks for the long haul ",2016-03-20,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dlr:-a-high-quality-reit-growing-dividends-200122231,200122231
32128,253643,EQIX,Can Cloud Computing ETF  SKYY  Surge On Earnings Surprise ,opinion,"The technology sector is disappointing this earnings season with several bellwethers underperforming  But not all companies  or specifically  all corners of the industry are equally unimpressive  There are stocks like Facebook  NASDAQ FB     that have skyrocketed on impressive earnings  while areas like cloud computing look promising  read    
Thanks to the zooming ETF industry  we have a unique cloud computing ETF    First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund     The product comprises top notch tech giants with considerable presence in the cloud business  Investors should note that Facebook has 4 23  exposure in SKYY  Another holding  Oracle Corp  NYSE ORCL      which came up with mixed results in March  gets 4 28  focus in SKYY  read    
All these give cues of a strong trend in the space  Investors must be interested in knowing how other stocks might perform throughout the reporting cycle  For them  we have highlighted our earnings prediction of some of the holdings of SKYY  see  here  
Inside Surprise Prediction
Equinix Inc     NASDAQ EQIX    has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an  of 0 00   Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat on earnings since a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2016 is  3 09  down 23 cents over the past three months  Further  the stock has an unfavorable VGM score of F  The company is expected to report on May 4  EQIX has 4 46  weight in SKYY 
Cisco Systems    NASDAQ CSCO    has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   So chances of a beat are slim here again  The company witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 90 days for the yet to be reported quarter  However  the stock has a better VGM score of  B   The company will report in mid May  CSCO accounts for 4 26  exposure in SKYY 
salesforce com inc     NYSE CRM    is expected to release its earnings report in May  It has a Zacks Rank  3 but an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which makes surprise prediction difficult  There was an upward revision in earnings estimates  by 2 cents  over the past 90 days for the to be reported quarter  However  its surprise history is worse with an average miss of 18 75   Further  the stock has a moderate VGM score of  C   CRM has 3 88  weight in the fund Bottom Line
Though the Earnings ESP picture for the upcoming releases does not point to optimism  investors should note that SKYY has a Zacks ETF Rank  2 with a High risk outlook  However  investors should note that the Industry Rank for each of the above mentioned stocks is within the top 50  segment of the Zacks universe 
As we know  cloud computing is a process by which   but can be easily accessed from anywhere at any time via the Internet  And of late  enterprise cloud computing is rising at a rapid pace

32166,253681,EQIX,Bulls Await Post Holiday Reinforcement,opinion,As we head into the homestretch of summer and the Labor Day holiday weekend  investors are anxious to see if next week brings elevated volume and the reinforcements to help the bulls break out  However  there s no doubt that the bears are lurking in the wings to drive stocks down hard  given the right scenario  In any case  volume has been absolutely anemic as stocks have basically churned in place  and the market seems poised for a significant move one way or the other after a prolonged period within a narrow trading channel Solid U S  DataOn Wednesday  the Commerce Department said GDP rose at a 1 7  annual rate during the second quarter  which is higher than the estimate of 1 5   and the Fed Beige Book was mostly encouraging  Also  the National Association of Realtors reported further strengthening in the housing sector  as its index of pending home sales rose 2 4  in July Healthcare has been particularly strong lately  The iShares Dow Jones U S  Healthcare Sector Index Fund  IYH  and the Health Care Select Sector SPRD Fund  XLV  both hit all time highs on Wednesday  Also at or near their all time highs are the consumer oriented iShares and Select Sector SPDR ETFs  including IYC  IYK  XLP  and XLY  Notably  Yelp  YELP  bucked the trend of social media companies selling off upon expiration of the lock up period  surging over 3  on Wednesday U S  stocks have steadily climbed since early June on low volume    ever since ECB President Mario Draghi promised to do  whatever it takes  to save the euro  The major indexes have held their psychologically important support levels of Dow 13 000  Nasdaq 3 000  S P 500 1400  and Russell 2000 800 Two Notorious Months AheadNow  as we head into the two most notorious months of the year  September and October  with stocks near their highs  the bulls are hoping for some sort of supportive announcement from one of the central banks over the next few weeks  First up is Chairman Bernanke at the annual monetary policy conference of central bankers on Friday in Jackson Hole  WY  although Draghi apparently announced that he was too busy to attend   Then on September 6  the ECB will decide whether to begin its own quantitative easing strategy  Finally we ll see what comes from the next FOMC meeting on September 12 13 However  there are many compelling reasons why the Fed might choose not to launch a QE3  Chief among them is that banks simply don t need or want more cash  When the Fed buys Treasuries  bank reserves are increased so that the banking system will increase loan based demand deposits  But the big banks are already holding more than  1 trillion cash in combined excess reserves  Rather than wanting to sell their Treasury bonds to obtain even more lendable capital  these banks would likely prefer to hold them as interest earning collateral for their highly profitable trading activities Looking at the S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  chart  It closed Wednesday at 141 51  After trading above 143 on August 21 to reach its highest levels since mid 2008  it has gone moribund during these final dog days of summer  SPY has been trading within a bullish rising channel for over three months and many market observers still say we are way overdue for at least a minor correction  SPY has been contending with strong technical resistance from the April May closing highs near 142  and now might be forming a bullish ascending triangle within the established rising channel  Price still sits above the 20   50   100  and 200 day SMAs  and in fact the 20 day has been lending support since Friday  If markets try to correct  there are several interim support levels  including Friday s low near 140  the rising 50 day SMA and the bottom of the larger rising channel approaching 138  the 100 day SMA near 136  and then the 200 day SMA near 134   The VIX  CBOE Market Volatility Index    a k a   fear gauge   has continued to rise  closing Wednesday at 17 06  which is right at its 50 day SMA  However  its Stochastics are extremely overbought   Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF   High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions   Observations Technology  IYW  remains in the top spot with an Outlook score of 79  Stocks within IYW are displaying relatively low forward P Es  strong projected long term growth  and solid return ratios  However  the analysts have been reducing forward earnings estimates overall  Consumer Goods  IYK  makes a huge jump from eighth to second  with a 33 point increase in its Outlook score  primarily due to strong relative support from Wall Street  Financial  IYF   Healthcare  IYH   and Industrial  IYJ  round out the top five Telecom  IYZ  stays at the bottom of the Outlook rankings this week with a rock bottom Outlook score of 2  It s not the worst in every factor in the quant model  but it s close  Stocks within the sector are hobbled by the highest forward P E and the worst return ratios  and this week Wall Street analysts came out with net downgrades  Utilities  IDU  is back down in the bottom two with a score of 27  It continues to be hampered by a high forward P E and the worst projected long term growth rate Overall  this week s rankings are a mixed bag between the offensive and defensive sectors such that I would categorize the rankings as neutral Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 62  followed by Industrial  IYJ   Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 43  which is somewhat improved  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  remains the investor favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 57  Energy  IYE   which has the highest Bull score  has been abandoned  relatively speaking  by investors during market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 42  which is actually tied this week with Basic Materials  IYM   In other words  Energy and Materials stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best Overall  Technology  IYW  again shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 184  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 104  As for Bull Bear combination  Industrial  IYJ  is the best with 108  while Financial  IYF   Materials  IYM   and Utilities  IDU  share the worst at 100 These scores represent the view that the Technology and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Utilities sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   Top ranked stocks within IYW and IYK include Gartner Inc   IT   Equinix Inc   EQIX   The J M  Smucker Co   SJM   and Whirlpool Corp  WHR     Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned    About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look   Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions  Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors    About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade    that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest

32168,253683,EQIX,Low Cost Funds Dupe Investors  4Q2012,opinion,Fund holdings affect fund performance more than fees or past performance  A cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund  A fund that has done well in the past is not likely to do well in the future  e g  5 star kiss of death and active management has long history of underperformance   Yet  traditional fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance   Our research on fund holdings enables investors to find funds with high quality holdings   AND   low fees   Investors are good at picking cheap funds  We want them to be better at picking funds with good stocks  Both are required to maximize success   Figure 1 shows that 55  of fund assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with low costs but only 6  of assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with Attractive holdings  This discrepancy is astounding   Figure 1  Allocation of Fund Assets By Holdings Quality and By Costs  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Two key shortcomings in the ETF and mutual fund industry cause this large discrepancy  A lack of research into the quality of holdings Not enough research focuses on the quality of Portfolio Management of fundsA lack of high quality holdings or good stocks in funds With about twice as many funds as stocks in the market  there simply are not enough good stocks to fill all the funds These issues are related  in my opinion  If investors had more insight into the quality of funds  holdings  I think they would allocate a lot less money to funds with poor quality holdings   Investors deserve research on the quality of stocks held by ETFs and mutual funds   Quality of holdings is the single most important factor in determining an ETF or mutual fund s future performance  No matter how low the costs  if the ETF or mutual fund holds bad stocks  performance will be poor  Costs are easy to find but research on the quality of holdings is almost non existent   Figure 2 shows investors are not putting enough money into ETFs and mutual funds with high quality holdings  502 of 7 364  6  of assets  of ETFs and mutual funds allocate a significant amount of value to quality holdings  94  of assets are in funds that do not justify their costs and over charge investors for poor portfolio management   Figure 2  Distribution of ETFs And Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Portfolio Management Rating   Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Figure 3 shows that Investors successfully find low cost funds  55  of assets are held in ETFs and mutual funds that have Attractive or better rated Total Annual Costs  my apples to apples measure of the all in cost of investing in any given fund   Out of the 7 364 ETFs and mutual funds I cover  1 191  55  of all assets  earn an Attractive or better Total Annual Costs rating   Clearly  ETF and mutual funds investors are smart shoppers when it comes to finding cheap investments  But cheap is not necessarily good   Columbia Funds Series Trust  Columbia Mid Cap Index Fund  CIDIX  of a fund with low costs but poor holdings  It gets an overall predictive rating of Dangerous because no matter how low its fees  I expect it to underperform because it holds too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  over 38  of its holdings are rated Dangerous or worse   Low fees cannot boost fund performance  Only good stocks can boost performance   A good example of one these poor holdings is Equinix Inc   EQIX   It is one of CIDIX s top five holdings and receives our Very Dangerous rating  In the twelve years of history in our model  EQIX has never achieved positive economic earnings  Just recently  EQIQ began to produce positive net income  However  it still has yet to generate enough after tax operating profits  NOPAT  to cover its WACC  EQIX is also a very expensive stock  To justify its current stock price   182 84 share   the company would have to grow its NOPAT at 20   compounded annually  for eleven years  That is a tall order for any company  but especially for one with such a poor track record of economic earnings  Poor profitability and high expectations make EQIX a Very Dangerous stock   Figure 3  Distribution of ETFs And Mutual Funds  Count And Assets  By Total Annual Costs Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Investors should allocate their capital to funds with both high quality holdings and low costs because those are the funds that offer investors the best performance potential   But they do not  Not even close   Figure 4 shows that 5  of ETF and mutual fund assets are allocated to funds with low costs and high quality holdings according to my Predictive Fund Ratings  which are based on the quality of holdings and the all in costs to investors   Note the fund industry 2 857 Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds compared to just 200 Attractive or better ETFs and mutual funds  over 14 times more bad funds than good funds  That means a lot of fees are being paid to managers that do not deserve them   Figure 4  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Predictive Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Investors deserve forward looking ETF and mutual fund research that assesses both costs and quality of holdings  For example  Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  is one of my favorite funds  It earns my Very Attractive rating due to its high quality of holdings  over 72  of its holdings are allocated to Attractive or better rated stocks  and low costs  total annual costs of 0 20     XLP s largest holding is The Procter   Gamble Company  PG   13 54  of net assets   PG earns my Attractive rating  PG has earned positive economic earnings in all fifteen years of history in my model  In 2012  they grew economic earnings by 25   In exchange for this growth in profits  PG currently sells at 0 97x its economic book value  PG essentially sells at the no growth value of its operations  Comparing these expectations for future performance to its actual historical performance  PG looks quite cheap  Holding Attractive stocks like PG and charging low costs make XLP a Very Attractive fund  Why is the most popular fund rating system based on backward looking past performance   I do not know  but I do know that the lack of transparency into the quality of portfolio management provides cover for the ETF and mutual fund industry to continue to over charge investors for poor portfolio management  How else could they get away with selling over fourteen times more Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds than Attractive or better   John Bogle is correct   investors should not pay high fees for active portfolio management  His index funds have provided investors with many low cost alternatives to actively managed funds   However  by focusing entirely on costs  he overlooks the primary driver of fund performance  the stocks held by funds   Research on the quality of portfolio management of funds empower empowers investors to make better investment decisions  Investors should no longer pay for poor portfolio management   Disclosure  I receive no compensation to write about any specific

106868,328383,EQIX,Key Factors To Impact AvalonBay s  AVB  Q4 Earnings,opinion,AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB   is slated to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Feb 5  after the market closes  The company s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues as well as funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this residential REIT missed estimates with respect to the FFO per share  reporting a negative surprise of 0 43   Though the company achieved increase in average rental rates  economic occupancy registered a decline Over the last four quarters  the company missed estimates on three occasions and surpassed in the other  This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0 43   The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company AvalonBay Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderFollowing a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter  despite demand for apartments generally slowing down during the colder months  as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter remained as high as 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 Amid these  AvalonBay is expected to have registered steady rental revenues  given its ownership of high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental and other income is pegged at  592 million  indicating 1  sequential growth Further  high home ownership costs in several markets are affecting transitions from renters to homeowners  This  along with favorable demographics and household formation as well as job market gains  is likely to have contributed to high occupancy at the company s residential properties This will support top line growth for the October December period  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues of  594 million suggests 2 7  year over year increase AvalonBay has also been pursuing various initiatives to boost efficiency and margin expansion in its portfolio  It has deployed various technology enabled productivity enhancements like developing online tour scheduling  as well as launching an AI and new maintenance platform  Furthermore  the company has resorted to several physical building improvements like increasing usage of more durable materials  These efforts will likely result in lower repairs and maintenance cost  and drive revenues in the fourth quarter However  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 FFO per share remained unchanged at  2 40 over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it indicates 3 9  year on year growth  Here is What Our

106869,328384,EQIX,What s In The Offing For New Residential s  NRZ  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,New Residential Investment Corp    NYSE NRZ   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Feb 6  before market open  The company s fourth quarter earnings per share  EPS  and net interest income  NII  are likely to reflect year over year declines In the last reported quarter  this New York based mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT   primarily focused on residential real estate investments  posted core earnings of 50 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by around 2  Over the preceding four quarters  the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and missed in the other three  the average negative surprise being 0 05   The graph below depicts this surprise history New Residential Investment Corp  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayPositive economic growth  strong demand for housing and mortgage rates being relatively stable are expected to have supported mortgage originations during the fourth quarter  As for New Residential  the buyout of select assets from Ditech Holding Corporation and Ditech Financial LLC for  1 2 billion in October has enhanced the company s origination and servicing capacity  and positions it well to benefit from the strong origination environment  Notably  the company s origination volume was up 200   while servicing volume surged 100  in the September end quarter  This trend most likely continued in the fourth quarter as well  Moreover  for 2019  it anticipates origination volumes of around  22 billion  Also  since the assets acquired from Ditech can insulate the company from faster prepayments in a low interest rate environment  it will support the company s earnings The rapidly changing interest rate environment was the key theme dominating the financial markets in 2019  In October  The Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  slashed the federal fund rate by 0 25   This is expected to have resulted in higher mortgage prepayments and refinancing This speedy prepayment scenario will likely result in higher mortgage service rights  MSR  amortization expense for New Residential s MSRs   Servicer Advances investment portfolio Volatility in the repo markets in 2019 escalated funding costs and dampened performance of many industry participants  In fact  in mid September  the rate on overnight general collateral repo spiked to 10   about four times more than usual levels  due to shortage of cash available for lending  This prompted the Fed to conduct a series of operations for overnight repurchase agreements and outright U S  Treasury bill purchases  thus injecting significant liquidity to the funding markets  Amid this  repo funding levels remained elevated during the December end quarter Furthermore  credit risk related to New Residential s non agency residential mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage loans and consumer loans is expected to have made its fourth quarter earnings volatile In fact  the credit markets witnessed volatility during fourth quarter 2019  This resulted in tighter spreads and is expected to have adversely impacted the company s non agency portfolio Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter NII of  241 9 million reflects a year over year decline of 9 1  Moreover  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings per share for the quarter under review has been revised 1 9  downward to 51 cent over the past month  reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments  In addition  it indicates a decline of 12 1  from the prior year quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that New Residential is likely to beat estimates this quarter  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better increases the odds of an earnings beat  But that s not the case here You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earning ESP  New Residential s Earnings ESP is  1 96  Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  You can see  Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider

106871,328386,EQIX,Near Term Outlook Bleak For Equity REIT Stocks,opinion,"The Zacks  industry is a diversified group  comprising REIT stocks from diverse asset classes  such as industrial  office  lodging  healthcare  self storage  data centers and others Some prominent players in this industry are infrastructure REITs American Tower Corp  NYSE AMT    AMT   Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI

center REITs Digital Realty Trust  DLR  and Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Inc   EQIX   diversified REIT Vornado Realty Trust  NYSE VNO   VNO   and specialty REIT Iron Mountain  IRM  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Technological evolution has been transforming the real estate market dynamics and substantially driving demand in a number of asset categories  The e commerce boom  in particular  has significantly fueled demand for logistics facilities  besides backing cell towers and data centers  Further  rapid growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure are spurring demand for data center REITs  Also  5G network deployment has been benefiting tower REITs  Data analytics expertise of self storage REITs too are offering a competitive advantage  Apart from these  biopharma drug development growth opportunities amid increasing longevity of the aging U S  population are boosting the institutional life science and medical market fundamentals Strength in economy and job market plays a key role in determining REITs  performance  These factors determine the capacity of rent that can be shelled out  Resilient economic activity and healthy job market environment are translating into elevated demand for real estate  leading to high occupancy levels and landlords  greater power to command higher rents  For office REITs  the Sunbelt markets are likely to benefit from relocations of corporates and job growth  Moreover  easier capital availability and comparatively lower levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat for REITs  given their substantial dependence on debt and their consideration as a bond substitute for a high dividend paying nature  Further  specialty sectors   self storage  data centers  medical office  life sciences facilities and seniors housing   have made headlines in recent years  with investments in these alternative asset classes rising steadily  The aged population or the silver tsunami is shaping up healthcare REITs  future  as this group has the largest customer base of healthcare services  spending more on such services than the average population  spurring demand for seniors housing assets  skilled nursing facilities and others Nevertheless  despite a decent economy and a healthy job market environment  rising delivery of new units in several asset categories  such as industrial  office  senior housing and self storage  has kept REITs on tenterhooks  Rising construction activities with increased completions is moderating landlords  ability to demand higher rents and boost occupancy levels  as well as resulting in high concessions  In the self storage industry  growth might be limited thanks to the development boom in several markets  along with elevated marketing expenses and property taxes  Healthcare REITs too keep witnessing softness in seniors housing fundamentals as supply has shot up rapidly  of late  in this asset category  while labor costs are flaring up  In fact  with excess labor inflation amid tight labor market  margins are likely to be under pressure  Meanwhile  aggressive pricing pressure and substantial debt burden might limit data center REITs  growth tempo Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  171  which places it at the bottom 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s FFO per share estimate for 2019 and 2020 moved down 4 7  and 13 2   respectively Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation
