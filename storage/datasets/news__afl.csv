139914,361429,AFL,Japan Post Insurance says 1 400 improper sales cases broke law,news,"By Takashi Umekawa and Takaya Yamaguchi
TOKYO  Reuters     Japan Post Insurance Co Ltd   T 7181  said on Monday it discovered 6 327 cases of improper sales in a previously flagged misconduct matter that is still under investigation and that 1 400 cases among them are suspected of violating the law 
This is the first time the unit of Japan Post Holdings  T 6178  has said some of the cases have broken the law 
Another group company   Japan Post Bank Co Ltd   T 7182   separately said earlier this month it had improperly sold investment trust products to elderly customers in about 19 500 cases 
The misconduct cases have rocked the Japan Post Group and some of their affiliates  pummelling their shares  Japan Post Insurance has suspended sales of insurance policies 
The admissions cast a shadow over the government s plan to sell  10 billion worth of its shares in parent Japan Post Holdings to pay for reconstruction in areas hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami 
Japan Post Insurance had said in August it possibly sold a total of about 183 000 insurance policies that could have been disadvantageous to policy holders  over the five years through fiscal 2018 
It said on Monday most of the cases that fell foul of the law involved false explanations provided to customers  The company has so far scrutinized about 68 020 cases  accounting for about 37  of total misconduct  it said  releasing an interim report on the investigation 
 I will lead from the front to restore our trust from customers   Mitsuhiko Uehira  president of Japan Post Insurance  said at a news conference  He  Masatsugu Nagato  chief executive at Japan Post Holdings  and other senior executives who attended the briefing  bowed in apology 
 We will continue to investigate with the view that even a single case of misconduct cannot be tolerated   Uehira said 
Once their internal investigation is concluded  Japan Post Insurance will consider imposing punishments such as disqualifying insurance agents who violated law or internal rules  the company said 
While it had aimed to restart selling insurance policies in October  the company postponed it to January 2020 
The Financial Services Agency s  FSA  division that monitors Japan Post Group declined to comment as the investigation is not over 
Japan Post Insurance shares have slumped about 20  since July  while Japan Post Holdings and Japan Post Bank shares have fallen 16  and 6   respectively  over the same period 
The group s U S  affiliate Aflac s  N AFL  shares have also fallen since the news of the misconduct emerged on worries about its sales in Japan ",2019-09-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japan-post-insurance-says-1400-impropersales-cases-broke-law-1988847,1988847

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome to the Aflac Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions  Please be advised today s conference is being recorded  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr  David Young  Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations David Young    Vice President  Investor   Rating Agency RelationsThank you  Nicole  Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter call  This morning  we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos  Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States  Then Fred Crawford  President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Incorporated will follow with more details about our operations  And Max Broden  Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated will discuss our financial results In addition  joining us this morning during the Q A portion are members of our executive management team in the United States  Teresa White  President of Aflac US  Eric Kirsch  Global Chief Investment Officer  Rich Williams  Chief Distribution Officer and Al Riggieri  Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary  We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan  Charles Lake  Chairman and Representative Director  President of Aflac International  Masatoshi Koide  President and Representative Director  Todd Daniels  Director and CFO  Koji Ariyoshi  Director and Head of Sales and Marketing Before we start  let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities laws  Although we believe these statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature  Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today  We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10 K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results  The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac s website at investors aflac com and includes reconciliations of certain non US GAAP measures I ll now hand the call over to Dan  Dan Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you and good morning  Thanks for joining us  Let me start  the morning all by saying with the fourth quarter rounded out another great year for Aflac in terms of earnings  capital and overall financial strength  I m especially pleased with the company s financial performance in 2019  Financially  Aflac is as strong as we have ever been in our 65 year history  Our capital position by any measure is robust  Our investments are high quality and diversified and we have among the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry Total pre tax adjusted earnings increased 2 5   which is even more meaningful when you consider that we have continued our extensive investment in our core technological platforms and initiatives to drive future earned premium growth and efficiencies  investing in growth and innovation will continue to be critical strategic focus for 2020  Fred and Max will provide more detail in a moment In 2019  Aflac Japan generated strong overall financial results  As we anticipated  full year third sector and first sector protection sales were down in the mid teens  predominantly reflecting reduced sales of our cancer insurance through Japan Post following the strong launch of our revised cancer insurance in 2018  Earned premium growth for third and first sector protection products was 1 3   which was in line with our expectations  As you may have seen last Friday  the new management of Japan Post Group held a press conference in regard to the submission of its business improvement plan to the Japanese government  This update includes additional measures that Japan Post Group management is undertaking to restore the public trust and address concerns raised by the sale of Japan Post insurance products  Understandably  the new management of Japan Post group has placed this plan as a top priority management issue and we would expect sales of Aflac Japan s cancer insurance through Japan Post distribution to be secondary especially during the first half of the year Based on comments from Japan Post and our review of monthly trends  we expect very little production in the first half of 2020  The level of recovery in the second half of the year is uncertain but we will provide updates as we learn more  Importantly  we assume the possibility of low production with slow recovery in our forecast  Therefore  our guidance for Aflac Japan s earned premium and pre tax earnings does not change materially from our 2020 outlook call  We continue to expect a decline in the range of 0 7  in the third and first sector protection earned premium for 2020 As we think about distribution  we look forward to working with Japan Post s new leadership to continue deepening the strategic alliance relationship for the long term  To that point  Aflac Japan s executives met in January with Japan Post new leadership as part of the established strategic alliance framework  The discussions were positive and the Japan Post Group Presidents expressed their desire to further enhance the strategic alliance to the benefit of both organizations over the long term  In addition  Fred and I will be meeting with the CEOs of Japan Post Group in March  As I said earlier  we look forward to working with Japan Post s new leadership to continue deepening our strategic alliance for the long term Aflac Japan s medical insurance focused upon a rider strategy in 2019  While various factors affected sales that Fred will address shortly  the positive medical insurance sales results reinforced my confidence in our position as Japan s number one provider of cancer and medical insurance  insuring one out of every four households  As we have discussed in the past  the Government of Japan is debating social security reform for all generations as part of its growth strategy plan for dealing with the shrinking and aging population under the concept of 100 Year Life Society  The government is debating key social security issues  including potentially increasing co pays by elderly  As this debate continues  the public will be even more focused on the need for supplemental insurance and the environment in Japan will continue to evolve Against this backdrop  we take a longer term perspective when it comes to our business and we will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership by leveraging the experience  expertise and scale and efficiencies developed over the last 45 years in Japan to bring value and protection to our policyholders  At the same time  we are continuing to fully engage our wide reaching distribution networks  Our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners Now turning to Aflac US  We are pleased with our strong financial performance  which was consistent with our expectations and reflected elevated expenses as a result of the ongoing investments in our platforms  distribution and customer experience  While sales were slightly down for the year  coming off record sales in the prior year  earned premium growth was 1 8   Ultimately  we seek to grow earned premium growth  It is evident that there are macro elements at play  Strong salaries and employment means fewer people that are willing to take independent commission sales role  This dynamic continues to constrain both sales agents recruiting and ultimately sales to an extent but keep in mind  workers continue to convey a significant need for Aflac s benefit solutions in the workplace and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity Our broker strategies are taking hold  opening the door for more sales opportunities and larger accounts  Additionally  we are fortunate to have such a strong independent field force  which is truly distinctive within our industry  We will continue to work with our agents to equip them with the tools that they need to be productive and to have a successful career with Aflac  We have also been encouraged by the advancement in our direct to consumer platform and associates partnerships  which are still in the initial stages  Taking all factors into account  we continue to expect Aflac US to generate earned premium growth in the range of 1  and maintain stable persistency in 2020  We will continue to invest in product development and efforts to facilitate producer growth and productivity  including the measured roll out of Aflac s Dental and Vision that was initiated in January Aflac has historically been known for its organic growth  However  we recognize that prudent investment is critical to our growth strategy and to driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line of the long term  With this in mind  we will look for other opportunities to accelerate growth through measured buy to build transactions  We balanced reinvestment in the core business with a focus on increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares  I am pleased with the Board s decision to increase the first quarter 2020 cash dividend by  0 01 per share  which is 3 7  increase over the fourth quarter of 2019  This increase is coming off the 37th consecutive year of dividend increases in 2019  where we increased the dividend  0 01 each quarter generating a 3 8  dividend increase for the year  These increases recognize the stability of our earnings and capital generation and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders We expect share repurchase will be in the range of  1 3 billion to  1 7 billion in 2020  with the range allowing us to be more tactical in our deployment strategy  As always this assumes stable capital conditions and the absence of any compelling alternatives  We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios and maintaining a strong risk based capital ratio in the US and solvency margin ratio in Japan on behalf of our bondholders  our policy holders and our shareholders Through Aflac Incorporated subsidiaries in Japan and the United States  we have the privilege of helping provide protection to more than 50 million people  In both countries  we have earned our position as the leading supplemental insurer by paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured  Looking ahead  we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States  It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders  As always  we are working to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders Now I ll turn the program over to Fred  who will cover more on the operations and then Max to cover our financial results in more detail  Fred Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerThank you  Dan  I ll focus my comments on market color and key areas of execution in Japan  the US and global investments and connecting to our 2019 results and outlook for 2020  Let me first start with Aflac Japan  while the focus has been understandably on Japan Post and cancer sales  there have been additional market developments during 2019 that have shaped our product and distribution strategy for 2020  As Dan noted  we were pleased to end 2019 with an increase in medical sales  This is noteworthy as the medical product marketplace faced natural headwinds  specifically a change in corporate tax law late in the year that impacted products sold as part of a company benefit program and a measurable increase in competitive pressure as the traditional life players continue to pivot toward medical products after being hit hard by the low rate environment  These same dynamics continue in 2020 and as a result we have adjusted our product and marketing strategy accordingly Our 2020 product launch plans include the introduction of a fresh approach to cancer riders that greatly simplifies the product design by bundling coverage riders for ease of sale and meeting customer needs  This enhancement is also available in the Japan Post system and is tailor made for their unique distribution model once returning to full strength  We ve decided to accelerate our medical product refresh from 2021 launch into 2020 launching in the fourth quarter  While this will have a modest impact on 2020 sales  it positions us better as we head into 2021  The refreshed product expands coverage and fills a gap with non exclusive agencies that offer higher premium and more expansive benefit structures to their clientele  This move accelerates approximately JPY3 billion of product launch spend into 2020  As discussed during our outlook call  we have also set aside funding to strengthen the associate channel  our largest sales contributor  Investment includes technology and marketing spend in order to leverage our 22 million policies in force and 30 000 corporate groups to up sell and cross sell more effectively Finally  in an environment of low interest rates and related pressure on premium growth  we continue to work on our long term expense structure  We are building out agile teams focused on customer experience enhancements  administrative efficiency and go to market productivity improvements  For example  the work of our agile teams has successfully reduced Japan s product launch cycle by over three months  Separately  we have a medium term plan to go paperless in our main operating centers and ongoing digital initiatives that require continued investment over the next few years  We believe the most accurate way to track our expense ratio is when adjusting for paid up policies  We anticipate our adjusted expense ratio will trend down gradually beginning in 2022 time frame  While we are early in the year  Japan s accelerated investment is not expected to change our guidance range for the segment s 2020 pre tax margins Turning to the US  as medical and group benefit carriers pursue voluntary business and attempt to go down market  we believe it s important to build out a presence on the first page of the employee benefit marketplace  An initial step in that direction is our entry into network  dental and vision  along with entering a growth market we believe this portfolio expansion will increase producer productivity and assist with recruiting and retaining agents and expand broker access  We are taking a methodical approach beginning in 2020 with introduction in select states following by a national launch in 2021  We expect to generate  300 million to  500 million in incremental revenue over the next 5 to 7 years  Argus  our recently acquired Dental and Vision TPA platform  ended the year with annual revenue of  84 million and normalized pre tax margin of approximately 5   We expect this to be a growth area for the company as Argus has a strong reputation for servicing Medicare and Medicaid dental and vision members  In fact  last week we issued a press release under the Argus brand announcing the awarding of four new partnerships administering dental and vision benefits to new Medicare Advantage members  Like any TPA model  this is a scalable business with strong return potential  but has naturally reset our reported expense ratio by approximately 60 to 80 basis points We are actively investing in a consumer markets platform for the digital sale of insurance direct to consumer along with partnerships that leverage lead generation for agent assisted sales  We are up and running with sales of  45 million in 2019  We are making important investments in a fully digital experience from acquisition to administration to policyholder experience  including a digital claims capability  We expect production through this platform to double in the next three years  Our US outlook has assumed roughly 40 to 50 basis points of expense ratio drag in 2020 as we build out network  dental and vision and consumer markets platforms  We continue to invest in our operating platform in the US with two critical deliveries anticipated in 2020  The first is an upgrade to our enrollment platform used by our agents and focused on the small business market  Upgrades are expected to provide more intuitive functionality and speed  The second is the successful migration onto a modernized platform for Aflac Group  which is our fastest growing segment  Modernization includes scalability and automated back end processing and billing functions  We just recently began placing new groups on our modernized platform  These projects along with other key initiatives are also supported by an agile work environment Overall  we anticipate expense ratios will remain elevated in 2020 and 2021  then trending down beginning in the 2022 time frame as the top line responds to our key initiatives and we begin delivering on expense efficiencies Turning to Aflac Global Investments  as Eric noted at last year s Analyst Briefing  where it makes sense we will explore team lift outs  joint ventures and equity stakes in asset managers that will then manage a portion of our assets  In January  we closed on a minority investment in Varagon Capital Partners  a leading direct lender to middle market companies  Our equity stake includes a mandate for up to  3 billion invested in middle market loans over the next three years  The mandate is consistent with our overall general account investment strategy  Our minority equity investment will be held within our US investment subsidiary with any associated returns running through the corporate segment  At this early stage  we do not expect a measurable impact on our 2020 outlook for investment income or earnings I ll now hand off to Max to cover our financial results  Max Max K  Broden    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Fred  We finished the year with a solid Q4  reporting adjusted EPS of  1 03  up 1  year over year  Underlying earnings continue to come through strong with no significant items to call out in this quarter  As previously guided  expense ratios ticked up in both operating segments due to seasonality and  as Fred detailed in his comments  our continued strategic platform builds  For the full year  adjusted earnings per share increased 6 7  to  4 44  the strengthening yen benefiting earnings for both the quarter and the year by  0 02  As a result  adjusted earnings per share on a currency neutral basis rose 6 3  to  4 42 per share  which was at the upper end of our upwardly revised guidance of  4 35 to  4 45 at the end of Q3  Adjusted book value per share including foreign currency translation gains and losses grew 10 6  in both Q4 and for the full year  The adjusted ROE excluding the foreign currency impact was a strong 15 1  for the full year 2019 Turning to our Japan segment  total earned premium for the quarter declined 1 6  reflecting first sector policies paid up impacts and to pay medical policies sold in 2017 reaching paid up status as well  However  we continue to focus on driving the quality and value of new business  As a result  our earned premium for the first sector protection and third sector products increased 0 6   Japan s total benefit ratio came in at 70  for the quarter with third sector benefit ratio coming in at 60 1   Both of these ratios are up on a year over year basis as these ratios will naturally bounce around a bit on a quarterly basis and the comparable benefit ratios last year were very low  Looking at the full year numbers  we are reporting a stable third sector benefit ratio and a decline in our total benefit ratio supported by mix shift  Overall claims trends are still tracking favorably but were less of a tailwind this quarter  Digging into the details  a lower lapse rate on our cancer insurance block led to an increase in future policy benefit reserve and we also experienced a slight up tick in incurred claims  We do not see this as a trend but rather a quarterly noise  Our expense ratio in Japan was 21 7   90 basis points higher than in Q4 last year  due to technology investments as well as sales and marketing spend  The ratio is also impacted by lower reported earned premium  Net investment income declined 1 4  in yen terms  unlike the previous few quarters  there was no significant call income or alternative investment returns in this quarter to call out  The pre tax margin for Japan in the quarter was 19 8   for the full year  we recorded a very strong pre tax profit margin of 21 3  toward the high end of our forecasted range Turning to US results  earned premium was up 1 1  despite weaker sales results and a 100 basis points decrease in persistency  which we view as temporary result of a large case volatility and replacement of an administrative partner  Our total benefit ratio came in at 49 1  in line with recent claims trends and mix of business shift toward our accident product  Our expense ratio in the US was 39 9   while the fourth quarter is a seasonally higher period for expenses  the increase of expenses in Q4 is due to lower unit cost capitalization  higher DAC amortization and the inclusion of Argus  which carries a structurally higher expense ratio in its benefits management business Net investment income in the US declined by 1 6  due to one time benefits    sorry  due to one time benefits from call income last year that did not recur this year  Maintaining consistent net investment income is a very good result on the back of sending excess capital up to the holding company as the final step in our planned RBC draw down  Profitability in the US segment was impacted by the previously discussed elevated expense ratio  which pushed down the pre tax profit margin to 16 8  in Q4  For the full year  the pre tax profit margin held up well and came in at 19 4   In our corporate segment  the main driver of improved results is higher levels of amortized hedge income driven by our enterprise corporate hedging program  Amortized hedge income contributed  27 million on a pre tax basis to this quarter s earnings with an ending notional position of  4 9 billion As a reminder  this program reduces the exposure to the yen  lowers the absolute level of hedge costs and reduces our exposure to volatility in hedge costs ultimately improving the risk adjusted return on capital for the group  For 2020  we would expect the segment pre tax profit for the full year to be a loss of  55 million to  65 million  This is  5 million higher than communicated on outlook call due to an updated and refined internal allocation of expenses with no impact on our total earnings  In December  we successfully executed a JPY38 billion of global yen issuance with a weighted average coupon of 80 basis points  The proceeds will be used to redeem  350 million of 4  senior notes maturing in 2022  reducing our run rate interest costs by  11 2 million on a pre tax basis and extending our debt maturity profile Turning to capital  Japan s estimated solvency margin ratio remains above 1 000  and our estimated US risk based capital ratio at quarter end was north of 500   With the announcement of our Japan branch conversion to a subsidiary  we pledged to remove excess capital out of the US entity targeting 500  RBC by the end of 2019  The fourth quarter marks the successful completion of our RBC draw down plan where we moved  1 75 billion  Phonetic  of capital from Aflac Columbus to Aflac Incorporated supporting our capital deployment and risk management activities  As we ve noted previously  we have room for additional capital optimization as the risk profile of our US business suggests an RBC closer to 400  is more appropriate  We ended the quarter with approximately  3 4 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company  net of pre funded debt  This is slightly lower than previously guided for  The deviation is primarily driven by a voluntary pension fund contribution to maintain strong funding levels on the face of lower discount rates and our decision to tactically buyback some additional shares  In the quarter  we repurchased 8 9 million shares for approximately  470 million  There is no change to our guidance for repurchase of  1 3 billion to  1 7 billion in 2020 Finally  let me comment briefly on guidance with our full year 2019 results in the books  there are no material changes from our 2020 outlook call this past December  While there are natural movements in our plan  we affirm all material segment margin contributors  including ranges for benefit ratios  expense ratios  net investment income and pre tax profit margins  In addition  we affirm our range for share repurchase and EPS guidance  recognizing we have adjusted a currency neutral range for a final average exchange rate of JPY109 07 to the dollar  As you may recall  our outlook call guidance was set at assuming a JPY110 to the dollar  Thus we have adjusted our guidance accordingly to  4 32 to  4 52 per share Now let me turn the call over to David for Q A Questions and Answers David Young    Vice President  Investor   Rating Agency RelationsThank you  Max  We re now ready to take your questions but first let me ask that you please limit yourself to one initial question and a related follow up to allow all participants an opportunity to ask a question  We will now take the first question in the call OperatorThank you  First question is from the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley Nigel Dally    Morgan Stanley    AnalystWith medical  Fred  you highlighted the competitive nature of the medical market  From what I understand  medical is being competitive for some time for years  But from your comments it appears conditions have heated up some more  Just wanted to make sure I got that right  And if so  is it just more crowded  more participants or are we also seeing some companies actually get more aggressive with pricing as well Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerYes  it s    thank you  Nigel  it s not more competitors really more specifically what we ve seen is some of the large and respected domestic life insurance players have moved toward refreshing their medical products as well as enhancing compensation or basically incentives  if you will  around the sale of medical product  We think this is understandable given that the interest rate environment has made it very difficult to sell yen based life insurance products and so that s really what we re starting to see take place  We have distribution  unique distribution  through exclusive agency arrangements and so most of what we see in the way of competitive dynamics is in the non exclusive agencies that we sell through and perhaps to a lesser degree some of the banking channel  which is very small for us right now  And so that s why the new product refreshment is meant to be more competitive  but also particularly make us more competitive in nonexclusive agencies  Interestingly  it s not really a pricing war  it s really more enhancing and enriching benefits going after a marketplace that s able to pay more premium for enhanced and broader coverage capability and so that s the gap we re looking to fill  And that s where we see the competition OperatorNext question is from the line of Andrew Kligerman Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystJust going back to capital  I mean  so what would be the timing I guess per Max s commentary of getting the RBC down to 400   now being in excess of 500   What would be the timing of getting that figure down  And I guess your guidance implies about a 71     70 ish  capital return this year  Why not pick it up a little bit more Max K  Broden    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSo  Andrew  first of all  let s step back and realize that we just finished the draw down of the capital that was generated through the branch conversion and we are now in a position to  for the first time  have a clean blue book that we are printing and that we then can take to regulators  to rating agencies et cetera  So we will then have clean financials on a statutory basis that we can discuss with these constituents  So we will have these discussions throughout the year and we don t feel that we have a rush to bring it down to the 400  range right now  given where we are in the cycle  we feel that holding strong capital levels is a benefit to us  So I would expect to travel downwards toward 400  over time  We will not initially pull capital out but rather we would like to see that the growth of the business will consume that capital and take us down to the 400  Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystI see  So growth of business not so much extracting the capital Max K  Broden    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  And I think Fred you were alluding to earlier to group business  Could you talk about some of the initiatives there and the potential to impact premium in the United States Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerSo  the reference that I made in my comments was what we have been seeing for a while now not surprisingly  and particularly if you listen to other true group carriers  calls  We re seeing competitors in that space look to move into the voluntary space and look to move down market and sometimes with success  sometimes without  That also leads to a level of bundling at times where true group players and even health players will bundle voluntary product with their core offering  And so what we have been doing is looking at making sure that we have an answer to that type of competitive dynamic  First and foremost  our voluntary benefit programs on a group basis tend to be very competitive and desired by employees and HR professionals and so we tend to do very well in that space  it s the fastest growing part of the company  But in order to combat bundling type dynamics  we need to have a broader solution  that includes dental and vision and also true group life and disability  Right now we have a partnership on true group life and disability where we offer the product and partner with DRMS on the administrative side and we need to evolve that platform so that it s more competitive and able to fight off that type of dynamic  So  again  we are competing very well in that space  but we think we have more opportunity to grow if we build out those programs Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystFred  do you think that at some point in the next 2 to 3 years  you could see a very material impact on the top line from the group product like group life and group disability Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerToo early to tell on that topic  I think right now our focus primarily is driving earned premium growth in the dental and vision space because  obviously  we ve made a transaction in that space  built out the platform and we re starting to build out that state by state platform to generate  300 million  500 million of premium over the next 5 to 7 years  And so that s right now the focus  I would say to a lesser degree we would expect to pick up earned premium over the next 3 to 5 years on the direct to consumer and lead generation platform  Those are incremental adds  Remember our core business  we still intend to grow earned premium there through the blocking and tackling of building out our platforms in group voluntary as well as the individual voluntary business  But incrementally it s focused right now on dental and vision and on consumer markets  True group will evolve over time  but it s too early to pinpoint earned premium on that at this point OperatorNest question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan Jamminder Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystSo  I had a question on Japan sales and  obviously  you had mentioned and everyone expected cancer sales to be fairly weak given the Post situation  I thought medical sales were a little weaker than expected as well  And you mentioned the tax change that might have hurt demand  What s your view on how that product s performing  And then also given that you re updating the product later this year  should we assume that as the year goes on  sales total moderate because people might    or agents might wait till the new product to start pushing it again Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think Aflac Japan can take that question  So let s see over there  Who would like to  Koji or Koide  how would you like to do this Koji Ariyoshi    Director  Executive Vice President  Director of Sales   Marketing Foreign Speech  Okay  this is Koji  I will speak   Foreign Speech  So let me explain a little bit about the medical insurance   Foreign Speech  So for our exclusive agencies  the new rider that we ve implemented last year has worked very well for the coverage for our existing policyholders   Foreign Speech  So this has worked positively   Foreign Speech  However  in non exclusive agencies  our competitors have expanded their coverage and that has really been hitting us hard   Foreign Speech  So that is the reason why the positive or the increase of the medical has slowed down coming to weaker sales   Foreign Speech  And because of this  the current situation  where our non exclusive agencies are expanding and that negative impact could also impact our exclusive agency   Foreign Speech  So what we will do is to make improvements in our new medical insurance by having a more enriched coverage to really be able to be competitive   Foreign Speech  And in terms of the actual coverage that we plan to offer  since this is before the filing to the FSA  we are not able to disclose the details   Foreign Speech  However  what I can say is that we would like to increase our competitiveness to the top level   Foreign Speech  That s all from me Jamminder Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystAnd  Fred  anything on just likely weakness as you go through the year  people    are agents sort of holding back from pushing the product in anticipation of the new offering Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerI don t think we expect any material dynamic in that respect  either holding back or what have you  I think right now our cancer product  particularly with the right  I m sorry     medical product with the rider strategy remains very competitive in our core associated platform  I think I would remind everybody that since we moved to a rider strategy  the reported sales naturally declines because you re selling a rider and we only count the rider premium as a sale as opposed to the full policy  So please keep in mind that we continue to add economic value throughout the year by maintaining policies having better persistency and then adding riders to our core policies  So economically  we continue to push forward on medical even though the sales look a bit dampened due to the rider strategy  That hasn t changed  that will still remain popular  We just think this particular gap in our product is a good one to fill  So we ve accelerated into 2020 OperatorNext question is from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling   Partners Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners Securities    AnalystI have a question related to US sales  So  in your prepared remarks  you talked about sales being a little bit soft  and I understand it s the dynamics of some of the agency and broker relationship kind of management that you ve done throughout 2019  But I was just wondering have you seen any kind of changes in the competition as well and kind of how we should think about it as you kind of go into 2020 Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI ll ask Rich Williams to take that for us Richard L  Williams    Executive Vice President  Chief Distribution OfficerSo first of all  as we discussed at FAB in September  our results finished the year as expected and we had shared the drivers in 2019 being exiting partnerships  large case volatility and some headwinds with average weekly producer  On a positive note  our broker sales growth as well as our consumer markets contribution are two areas that we are very pleased with  And also as we finished the second half of the year  as we focus on producer growth  we are encouraged to see career recruiting grow in both those quarters  From a competitive dynamic  as Fred alluded to  with medical and group benefits carriers getting into the space  this is another opportunity for us to be at the table and we re excited about our progress with dental and vision and the ability to also offer life and disability  So what I would say is we re speaking balance  both on our core supplemental products and also being able to provide benefit solutions on the front page benefits Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners Securities    AnalystAnd then in terms of the elevated expenses in the coming couple of years like should we think about it  kind of  in terms of elevation  it s more like toward the upper end of your guidance range for 2020 and 2021 before kind of normalizing in 2022  is that the way that we should think about it or could be elevation be above and beyond what your  kind of  guidance range  its upper end Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerI would say we certainly don t see it above and beyond the upper end of our range  it will naturally fluctuate within the range  But usually when we set those ranges  it s plus or minus around our actual financial plan target  Those plans can evolve and  of course  performance can evolve  But I would not fix a rate at some spot within the range  What I can say with confidence is we wouldn t expect to be above it  And  again  these investments are all    I think where you re going to see eventual benefit in the expense ratio is really driving the top line  Most of the investments that we re making  both operationally as well as  of course  in the incremental projects that we have around dental and vision and direct to consumer are meant to drive the top end or the revenue side of it and that s where I think we ll start to achieve a turnaround in the expense ratio OperatorNext question is from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystFirst  just one follow up  I think  on Humphrey s question  Fred  you mentioned no change to 2020 Japan margins despite bringing in some additional product launch spend related to accelerating the medical product timing  Is there something  offsetting this or does it just push you a little bit toward the lower end of the range Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerWe do have a little bit of an offset in the sense of a little better revenue dynamic as persistency was a bit better coming off of 2019  but also locked in a little bit better net investment income coming through Japan  And that has helped us to accelerate some of that spend without impacting the bottom line that much  But again most of the commentary is really important around the range  meaning we don t see really any change in the ranges  but again will naturally fluctuate within the range Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystAnd then can you comment a bit more broadly on your aspirations for investment management  Do you want to potentially explore commercializing your offering at some point and looking to manage assets for third parties or other insurance companies or do you see the investments in properties like Varagon more as a way to source assets and just participate in their growth Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerYou know  I ll make a couple comments  but then ask Eric to expand on it  I think we have not made a fundamental decision to commercialize our institutional asset management capabilities  But we re absolutely looking to leverage what Eric and the team have built over the better part of 8 plus years now in New York and in Tokyo  And really what you should think of these strategies as is a natural extension of our external manager program  If you think about it  we ve moved assets that we have less of an expertise into external managers and it s quite naturally that we will from time to time run across teams and managers that we find attractive enough to where we want to hold an equity interest along with mandating them on investments  So  that s really more of the strategy is a natural extension of what we have in the way of our core capabilities  but  Eric  I don t know if that covers it or if you have anything else you want to add from your   Eric M  Kirsch    Executive Vice President   Global Chief Investment Officer  PresidentI think Fred covered it perfectly  No aspirations in the traditional sense  Erik  as you stated it  commercially for our teams to be a third party asset manager  That s a very tough business  There s a lot of players but where we can differentiate ourselves is in the selection of asset managers for our balance sheet and how we are an income for Aflac Japan and Aflac US  But if we re able to lever that into examples like NXT  Varagon and potentially others in the future  which we see those opportunities  will not only improve the income of the balance sheet for the two insurance operations but will create revenue streams from owning those equity stakes and eventually potentially some upside as well  So in that way we kind of have exposure to the third party asset management business indirectly through those joint ventures or equity ownership OperatorNext question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystIt s a question about Japan  Historically  you guys have done a lot of market research on brand and trust and a lot of those dynamics  And so my question is  given everything that s been going on with Japan Post  has your research pointed out any impact on Japan Post brand in Japan   And if there is do you worry about some kind of spill over effect on the Aflac brand Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  let me just say  and then I ll have them follow up that  of course  we worry a little bit but all indications from everything we ve seen  it s had no effect on our brand because as you ve seen in the media  we were excluded from any of the issues concerning that  I feel good about that  I think the longer it goes on the more potential there is for issues  but I do believe that the Japan Post is on these issues resolving any issues with the consumers  And I think the change in the management team and their focus right now has been viewed very positive by the public  And so I think it will all take care of itself in the next 6 months or so  But Koide or    I think might want to speak on this Masatoshi Koide    President   Representative Director Foreign Speech  This is Koide from Aflac Japan   Foreign Speech  Let me just add a little bit  In January  we have conducted a consumer survey on our brand   Foreign Speech  So among the people who recognized the media coverage on Japan Post insurance issue since last year   Foreign Speech  There were very few people who thought negatively about Aflac as a brand based on that media coverage on JPI   Foreign Speech  And specific  there were only 2  who thought there was a negative impact on Aflac s brand   Foreign Speech  So in other words  we have confirmed that there has been no impact on Aflac s brand based on JPI  Japan Post Insurance  product issue   Foreign Speech  That s all from me Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystMy follow up question is just on the co payment increase that you talked about in your prepared remarks  I guess for the elderly population in Japan  We ve heard about this at different periods in the past in terms of the government wanting to do that  Does it feel like it s got a little bit more legs this time in terms of actually happening or any color around that would be helpful Frederick J  Crawford    President  Chief Operating OfficerYeah  well  what I would say is  there seems to be more activity in that regard predominantly about people living to be 100 and as you probably remember from the past  they kind of send out trial balloons to see what the reaction is publicly sometimes and it s too early for us to tell  But my gut says that there is more of an interest now than there has been in quite a while  We ll have to wait and see but they do have issues with budgets and their deficit that they ve created and how they re going to control that  So certainly I think they re trying to find out where and how they will attack those issues and this is certainly one way to do that by increasing the co pay deductibles  But don t walk away from this call thinking that this is a done deal and it s going to happen  We don t know any more than you know from what we read in the newspapers  But in talking to our people  I think it s a reasonable thing for them to be considering and one I think that has a much higher probability than in the past few years when it was a much lower chance of that happening Masatoshi Koide    President   Representative Director Foreign Speech  Once again this Koide from Aflac Japan   Foreign Speech  So with the backdrop in Japan with the government funding  the government is facing financial issue from the increasing medical cost in the social welfare system   Foreign Speech  So what our administration is trying to do is under the name of health reform for all generations  what the administration is trying to do is to motivate the elderly population who is still willing to work and secure employment of those people and have them support the social welfare system instead of being the recipient and that is the reason why at the same time the administration is trying to increase the co pay of the medical fee of elderly population   Foreign Speech  So this is something that is being covered in the media right now  As a result  many of the consumers are becoming interested in this type of media coverage   Foreign Speech  So the focus of the discussion right now is whether there will be any co pay increase for the population age to 75 or above   Foreign Speech  But because this is a very difficult reform as this will require co pay increase of elderly   Foreign Speech  so my assumption is that this discussion will continue for some time   Foreign Speech  But then the government s intention is to want to address this issue by the time the baby boomers reach this age group from 2022   Foreign Speech  That s all from me OperatorNext question is from the line of John Barnidge of Pfeiffer Sandler John Barnidge    Pfeiffer Sandler    AnalystProductivity as listed on Page 19 of the supplement materially increased  I guess there is a seasonal nature to this  but it was definitely higher than the last couple of years  Now with the strong economy  recruitment and engagement may be harder given the Commission nature  So I was just curious in the commentary you had on that Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTeresa  you want to    Teresa L  White    PresidentYeah  I ll start and then I ll hand it to Rich  One of the things that we ve been working on  that we ve talked about in the FAB and in other calls  is our enrollment tool and we have invested a tremendous amount in those tools to drive productivity for our agency force  We re also investing in third party tool for enrollment so that we can increase the productivity of those enrollments as well  So that has been a focus for our administrative side to support what Rich and his team is doing from a growth perspective  Do you have any other comment Richard L  Williams    Executive Vice President  Chief Distribution OfficerThe only other comment that I would say  Teresa and John  is that in the fourth quarter we see productivity spike  So productivity in 2018 in the fourth quarter over  17 was up 5  and in 2019 in the fourth quarter  it was up 4 8   So the productivity we see is pretty consistent  where most of our field force is working as that s the larger part of our sales for the year Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think it s important for you to tell them about the change in compensation at the management level to try to push productivity for new associates Richard L  Williams    Executive Vice President  Chief Distribution OfficerAbsolutely  Good point  Dan  So first and foremost  we communicated to our field in the fourth quarter of 2019 that we were aligning all compensation from associates through their management hierarchies all the way up to our highest levels toward producer growth  That is something that had been missing for several years and you had seen it in sort of our inconsistent recruiting and producer growth results  It s not a quick fix  but it s one that we believe is going to have positive effects and we re seeing in the near term a positive indication Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd that will drive that average weekly producer growth OperatorNext question is from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs  First one I had was just on the third sector benefit ratio in Japan  was just interested in light of the comments you re making about the competitive environment  some of the domestics pushing a little harder on the medical in particular  I mean  what s being priced in the new product in terms of like hospital days stayed on the cancer side  And what s the medical relative to the trends you re seeing  I mean can you keep that benefit ratio stable or will there have to be a natural kind of upward pressure on that over time Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerQuite honestly  we have been pricing for quite a while now to mirror the improvements in morbidity that we ve been seeing in Japan  but we continue to see actual to expected results run favorable  which implies a continued level of improvement in benefit ratios  But we ve been saying now for a while that particularly around medical that we would expect some level of stabilization of benefit ratios  In other words  there s a point at which you would expect that to normalize to some degree and so there s been a slowing down gradually of movement in the third only benefit ratio  that is improvement in the benefit ratio and we think that s illustrative of both pricing actions as well as a natural slowing down of the pace of shrinking hospitalization stays  et cetera  Having said that  these are still products that are priced at very attractive returns relative to our extremely low cost of capital in Japan and as a company  And so the economic value being added by every policy we put on our books is quite significant given our scale and the performance  So that gap  if you will  between cost of capital and return on capital remains healthy and allows us to be aggressive where we need to be  But as I mentioned earlier  we do see pricing pressure but frankly at the moment right now  it s really product design type pressure  which is something we can react too quickly and why we accelerated medical product refresh into 2020 Alex Scott    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd then maybe just a quick follow up on these potential social security changes  I mean  is your view still that cancer and sort of medical policies with maybe a nursing care rider takes care of the nursing care piece of this in the best way  Or are you exploring other types of products may be stand alone nursing or something like that that would potentially garner more demand from that kind of a change Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI ll let my Japan colleagues answer  but from my perspective  I would tell you that right now  our answer is just as you say  it s attaching care or nursing care riders to the medical product that allows the buyer to age with the life of the policy to age with the buyer  everything from the younger side of the cohort  which is interested in income or disability type protection to core medical to then as the policyholder ages naturally attaching riders related to nursing care  We think that s the best on a risk adjusted basis  because as you can imagine that type of risk as well as dementia type risk is one that we want to stay away from  And as a result  the supplemental nature of our policies  the limited benefits structures of our policies  the fact that its attached to a high return medical base policy  all of that strikes us as the best way to address it  But we have to continue to explore what opportunities we have with an aging population and we ll continue to do that  but it s going to be done on a risk adjusted way OperatorThe next question is from the line of Marcos Holanda of Raymond James Marcos Holanda    Raymond James    AnalystI just wanted to drill down on US sales and I was hoping you guys could give us some more color on sales results by distribution channel  and if there was any one channel that exceeded expectations last year Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo as we alluded to earlier  the areas where we saw productivity was broker sales and consumer market sales  Broker sales were strong for the quarter  as were consumer markets and then  obviously  with our associate agency distribution channel  it was lower than anticipated  And then I think as we ve alluded to also  our mix of business is moving gradually more toward brokerage and that s been doing that over the last 10 years and 2019 was consistent with prior movements Marcos Holanda    Raymond James    AnalystAnd my follow up  I think you mentioned the Argus platform generated about  84 million in revenue last year  And as I m looking at your 2020 outlook  I guess you guys are assuming basically flat revenue growth  and I was hoping maybe you could bridge the gap between that and your long term target of  300 million to  500 million  is that just a function of a slow ramp up  is there anything else you guys can give us here Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I m actually glad you asked that question  because it allows me to be very clear on this  don t confuse Argus  TPA or administrative platform with the growth expectations of our dental and vision business  In other words  what we bought when we purchased Argus was a  administrative what we believe to be a top notch administrative platform that simply administers Medicare Medicaid dental and vision products on behalf of other large typically health organizations and that is a traditional TPA administrative only business and not a conventional risk taking business  That business we would expect to steadily grow over time  And in fact  even the purchase price is designed in a way to incent growth rates  Separate and apart from that though is the dental and vision business  which is the actual insurance business  that is really Aflac strategy leveraging that platform to build out and sell and grow premium on Aflac dental and vision and that s the  300 million to  500 million we re pointing to Max K  Broden    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerAnd keep in mind that the TPA revenues that is not running through the premium line  So when Fred talks about earned premium growth  that does not include a TPA revenue  it s coming through fees in the other income line OperatorNext question is from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore Tom Gallagher    Evercore    AnalystJust looking at the distribution disclosure on channels for Japan in the supplement  it s a little hard to know how important the independent agency channel is  Fred  where you were citing the increased competition in medical  Can you give us a sense for what percentage of Japan sales through the independent channel where the competition has escalated  How large and how important that is for Aflac and just relatedly  would you also expect similar competition with the new rider cancer product launch  What do you think that it s going to be less competitive there Daniel P  Amos    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI can answer the second part of your question  I m going to toss to Japan to answer the breakout of exclusive agencies versus independent agencies  But we intend to be competitive in every channel  period  even on the exclusive front because we think that s important  But  obviously  when you get to the non exclusive channels here  there s more of a spreadsheet environment that you have to be constantly conscious of  The fact that we are facing competition in those channels is nothing new  That has been going on for several years now  it s really just more that we need to react and react more quickly to product development moves as we see the competition turn their attention to more proactively going after medical product  That s where  for example  closing down or shrinking the product launch cycle by 3 months really helps because we re going to need to be more nimble as we move forward  And this is an example of being nimble  The cancer rider we think is actually a very interesting dynamic on the cancer product  and will be interesting to track how we see sales going there  That rider is meant to simplify a series of riders that address different types of cancer and cancer treatment to really simplify the offering and we think that could help both in the sales process as well as in ease of the buying public understanding the risk benefit  if you will  or the benefit of what they re paying for us  So we think that could be a very good rider  It s also a rider that adjusts with the amount of risk you have as you age  So as you know  as you age in Japan  a greater proportion of your medical costs are covered under the National Medical System and this product will adjust accordingly  which makes it more affordable and more practical as you age in Japan to buy the cancer rider  So  again  it s an example of both putting out a very marketable product but also adjusting to the aging population with our products  Koide San or Koji  if you want to comment on the relative proportion of independent versus exclusive agencies  if you have that data handy Koji Ariyoshi    Director  Executive Vice President  Director of Sales   Marketing Foreign Speech  So this is Koji  Looking at the fourth quarter performance  independent and individual agencies account for more than half of the medical sales   Foreign Speech  But then the most fierce competition is  of course  in the non exclusive independent individual agencies   Foreign Speech  However  as you may know  we are very strong in the cancer insurance market  So we are not facing fierce competition in cancer insurance market   Foreign Speech  And in terms of cancer insurance revision this time  this product will be very easy to sell and that would expand our sales because even new sales agents will be able to sell this product because it is a simplified product   Foreign Speech  So the meaning of launch of this product is not to really win over competitors  but rather expand our sales and our positioning in the market   Foreign Speech  That s all from me David Young    Vice President  Investor   Rating Agency RelationsTom  I

 By Chuck Mikolajczak
 NEW YORK  April 28  Reuters    The Dow Jones transports
closed at an all time high on Thursday  leading U S  stocks
higher and signaling more gains due to its role as a
touchstone of economic demand 
 The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 1 2 percent to
5 510 06  led by Norfolk Southern  which jumped 8 percent to
 73 87 after reporting strong results 
 Investors had expectations for strong gains after the S P
500 broke through resistance at 1 344 on Tuesday  However 
with volume weak and economic data suggesting a still unsteady
path to recovery  it raises questions as to how fast the S P
can surpass the next milestone at 1 400 
  There is a disconnect in the market right now    we are
getting this mixed bag of news   said Jonathan Corpina  head
of NYSE floor operations for Meridian Equity Partners in New
York 
 There were also some signs of creeping cost pressures in
some companies  results  Procter   Gamble Co lowered the high
end of its profit forecast as it trimmed expenses and
increased prices to offset rising materials costs  Its shares
were up 0 8 percent at  64 50 
 Earnings eased the blow from a batch of soft economic data
showing U S  economic growth had slowed and the labor market
may be weakening 
 But the U S  Federal Reserve has maintained support for
its easy monetary policy  which has helped push up equity
prices in the face of increasing inflation 
  As operating costs continue to move higher across the
board  that is clearly going to affect the bottom line moving
forward   Corpina said 
  Seeing commodity prices  oil and energy prices at the
rate they are trading at now  with no end in short term sight 
that has to be factored in  going into the next quarter or
two  
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 72 35 points  or
0 57 percent  to 12 763 31  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
added 4 82 points  or 0 36 percent  to 1 360 48  The Nasdaq
Composite Index advanced 2 65 points  or 0 09 percent  to
2 872 53 
 Insurers moved higher as Allstate Corp  up 5 7 percent at
 33 76  and Aflac Inc  up 5 percent at  57 advanced on
quarterly results  Health insurer Aetna gained 4 2  percent to
 41 48 following quarterly results that topped Wall Street s
expectations 
 The KBW insurance index climbed 2 percent and the Morgan
Stanley healthcare payor index added 1 9 percent 
  We are kind of getting in that stage where we ve had a
lot of good earnings reports  The market really likes that 
but as we are getting through earnings season  they are going
to start focusing more on these economic numbers   said Peter
Jankovskis  co chief investment officer of OakBrook
Investments LLC in Lisle  Illinois 
  The fact we ve had this string of economic numbers that
are at par  sub par  however you want to put it  is going to
cause people to be looking more at the individual companies 
It s not  a rising boat lifts all ships story  any more  
 Silver soared to an all time high and gold rose to another
record  as a falling dollar and signs that the Federal Reserve
would maintain a loose monetary policy boosted precious
metals  appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic
uncertainty 
 Other economic data showed pending sales of existing U S 
homes were much stronger than expected in March  offering
faint glimmers of hope for the depressed U S  housing market 
 Volume was modest  with about 7 43 billion shares traded
on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  slightly
below the daily average of 7 72 billion

For Aflac s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015  which ended in late December  the company reported earnings of  730 million or 1 71 per share  up from  703 million or 1 57 per share during the same period in 2014  For the three month period  Aflac s earnings were suppressed by a weaker yen as the Japanese currency traded at an average of 121 54 versus the dollar in the fourth quarter  It represented a decline of nearly 6  in comparison with the dollar yen exchange rate in the final quarter a year earlier  As a result  the impact of foreign exchange translation contributed to a 0 05 loss per share in quarterly earnings  Aflac said 
Aflac derives a significant portion of its global business from its Japanese segment  Over the last year  the company insured approximately a quarter of all households in Asia s second largest economy 
 We are very pleased with Aflac s financial performance for both the quarter and year   Aflac CEO Daniel P  Amos said in a statement   Aflac had a very strong quarter  and we finished the year above the top of the range for operating earnings per diluted share  excluding the impact of foreign currency  
While Aflac s revenues fell by 3 5  to 5 32 billion on the quarter  the company still topped analysts  forecasts of 5 22 billion for the period  In Japan  Aflac s premium income gained 0 3  in yen terms but fell more than 5 5  to  3 6 billion when measured in dollar denominated terms  Aflac s revenue and premium income in its U S  division both increased by more than 2  on the quarter 
Amos also sounded optimistic about the company s third sector sales in 2015  which were driven by a 40  increase in its cancer insurance revenues  For the year as a whole  the company s third sector sales soared by 13 6   achieving their strong growth rate in more than a decade 
 As we indicated during our December outlook call  we anticipate that for 2016  sales of third sector products will be down mid single digits following very robust production results in 2015   Amos added   We continue to believe the long term compound annual growth rate will be in the range of 4  to 6

140134,361649,AFL,Why Aflac  AFL  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Aflac  AFL   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 01  
For the most recent quarter  Aflac was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share  but it reported  1 16 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 41   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 07 per share  while it actually produced  1 13 per share  a surprise of 5 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Aflac lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Aflac has an Earnings ESP of  0 33  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 4  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aflac-afl-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497701,200497701
140135,361650,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Aflac  AFL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 56 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac 
For Aflac  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Aflac will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of  8 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

140153,361668,AFL,Why Aflac  AFL  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Aflac in Focus
Aflac  AFL  is headquartered in Columbus  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 7 51  since the start of the year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 27 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 2   This compares to the Insurance   Accident and Health industry s yield of 1 1  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 98  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 08 is up 3 8  from last year  In the past five year period  Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 49   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Aflac s current payout ratio is 25   This means it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 34 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 33  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AFL is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aflac-afl-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200459387,200459387
140154,361669,AFL,Accident And Health Insurers Near Term Prospects Gloomy,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that provide workers  compensation insurance largely to employers operating in hazardous industries such as construction  trucking  logging and lumber  manufacturing and agriculture  These companies also offer group  individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products Workers  compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees  pay  Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state run workers  compensation fund Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes The demand for workers  compensation insurance has been boosted by increase in employment in the manufacturing and construction sectors that have been gaining momentum  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  job opportunities in both these industries have risen at a rapid rate  Increased exposure to these sectors leads to higher premiums for industry players  Pricing pressure might weigh on premiums  Though other business lines in the insurance industry will continue to witness improved pricing  workers compensation is likely to witness a decline in rates  The efforts to retain market share will lead to continued pricing pressure  which might curb bottom line growth   Also  higher spending on technological advancements will result in higher expense ratios  Nonetheless  adoption of technologies like cloud computing or blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge  Rising medical costs remain a headwind for workers  compensation insurance  However  increased underwriting exposure  sustained decrease in claims frequency rates  attributable to better working environment  and conservative reserve levels should drive the industry s performance Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dull near term prospects  The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  180  which places it in the bottom 30  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is the result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are doubtful of this group s earnings growth potential  Before we present a few accident and health insurance stocks that investors may focus on  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms Sector  Lags S P 500The Accident and Health Insurance industry has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite but outperformed its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 1 1  in the past year while the Finance sector has declined 6 7   The Zacks S P 500 composite has decreased 0 7  over the same period One Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month price to book  P B   which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks  the industry is currently trading at 1 12X compared with the S P 500 s 3 91X and the sector s 2 69X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 1 6X  as low as 1 1X and at the median of 1 39X Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM  Bottom LineContinued economic improvement should keep supporting the industry s performance  Also  prudent underwriting and intensive claims management practices with the help of

140158,361673,AFL,Is Aflac Incorporated  AFL  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Aflac Incorporated   NYSE AFL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Aflac Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 26  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 35  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Aflac Incorporated s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11 13 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 27  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Aflac Incorporated has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 16  which is lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Aflac Incorporated has a P S ratio of 1 85  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Aflac Incorporated currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Aflac Incorporated a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Aflac Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B  This gives AFL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen one upward and two downward movements  the current year estimate has seen six upward and no downward movement over the past two months This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus dropped 1  over the past two months  the current year estimate has shot up 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Aflac Incorporated Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAflac Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 5  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  analyst sentiments and past industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to

140175,361690,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Aflac in Focus
Aflac  AFL  is headquartered in Columbus  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 16 07  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 27 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 04   In comparison  the Insurance   Accident and Health industry s yield is 1 19   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 93  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 08 is up 3 8  from last year  Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8 49   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Aflac s current payout ratio is 25   meaning it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 34 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4 33  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200454219,200454219
140176,361691,AFL,What Makes Aflac  AFL  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Aflac  AFL  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Aflac is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Aflac imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Aflac
This insurer is expected to earn  4 34 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 4 3  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aflac  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

140198,361713,AFL,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Aflac  AFL ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Aflac  AFL   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 59   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Aflac was expected to post earnings of  1 05 per share  but it reported  1 12 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 67   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 94 per share  while it actually produced  1 02 per share  a surprise of 8 51  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Aflac  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Aflac currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 47   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

140200,361715,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Aflac  AFL  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  5 50 billion  down 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 37  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac 
For Aflac  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 78  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Aflac will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Aflac appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200441559,200441559

140224,361739,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Is Up 6 34  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Aflac  AFL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AFL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AFL  shares are up 6 34  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry is up 4 29  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 99  compares favorably with the industry s 0 33  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Aflac have increased 10 15  over the past quarter  and have gained 20 49  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 31  and 5 81   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AFL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AFL is currently averaging 2 724 495 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AFL 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AFL s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 22 to  4 30 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AFL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Aflac on your short list ",2019-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-is-up-634-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200432088,200432088

140226,361741,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Aflac  AFL  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Aflac is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Aflac  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Aflac
This insurer is expected to earn  4 30 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 3 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aflac  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Aflac to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200436371,200436371
140249,361764,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Aflac  AFL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  50 72 in the previous session  Aflac has gained 10 2  since the start of the year compared to the 14 2  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 12 5  return for the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 25  2019  Aflac reported EPS of  1 12 versus consensus estimate of  1 05 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 22  
For the current fiscal year  Aflac is expected to post earnings of  4 3 per share on  21 92 billion in revenues  This represents a 3 37  change in EPS on a  0 88  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 47 per share on  21 9 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 11  and  0 1   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Aflac may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Aflac has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 6X versus its peer group s average of 8 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 41  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Aflac fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Aflac shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200415605,200415605
140250,361765,AFL,5 Recession Proof Stocks That Pay 15 ,opinion,"We retirees and soon to be retirees have a dilemma  The traditional pension is just about gone  Social Security won t support the lifestyle most of us want  We are left to our own devices 
But even if we do build up a fat balance in a 401 k  or other company retirement plan  how do we make it last  Especially when the bank pays  zero point nothing   Today  you can t find anything that pays significant  interest  
This is becoming a crisis in the US  We are told that stocks provide the best returns over the long term  but retirees need income now  Most retirement investors prefer dividend income to long term gains  but yields haven t been this low in decades  The S P 500 pays a measly 2  or so today  If you have a million dollar portfolio  that s a lousy  20 000 per year in income  or  385 a week  That s no retirement 
Now some dividend income investors protest   But I don t own the S P 500 index for income  I choose the best companies in the index  the ones whose dividends have gone up and up  The dividend aristocrats   But are they true monarchs or mere pretenders to the throne 
The problem with growing your dividends for a minimum of 25 consecutive years is that s a lot of time for your own profit growth to slow down  That means many of your dividend increases are cutting even further into your earnings  You don t want to break the bank  so your hikes shrink over time a couple percent here  a couple percent there  just to keep your Aristocrat lapel pin 
I ll let you in on a secret  Sometimes  the best place to make your dividend growth play is on the ground floor  in companies that have really only begun to scratch the surface  In fact  two of the picks I m about to show you have been paying dividends for less than five years 
Let me show you the difference between some of the largest blue chip Dividend Aristocrats and my plucky group of five turbo charged dividend growers 
These Blue Chips Are Crawling to the Finish Line
The 9 5  growth rate above is nice but it s not sustainable  These firms are already paying 80  of their profits as payouts  This stat is great for the last five years  but awful for the next five and that s what we care about 
So let s look past these paupers for lesser known bargains that are primed to double their over the next five years  Some will double within three 
How is this possible  These five stocks are only paying 20  of their earnings as dividends  which means they could multiply their payouts by 2X  3X or even 4X today 
They won t do it overnight however  These firms will bump their dividends by 15   20  and even 25  or more per year  Which means their stock prices will probably follow  and investors who buy today will double their money with these safe dividends 
Ally Financial  NYSE ALLY Dividend Yield  2 3 Payout Ratio  19 0 5 Year Dividend Growth  28 6 
Ally Financial  ALLY  as we currently know it has only been around since 2010  but the company has roots going all the way back to 1919 as GMAC Capital Trust  NYSE ALLY pa    the financing providing arm of automaker General Motors  NYSE GM  
The company still has extensive automotive operations  providing financing for more than 4 million customers across 18 000 dealerships  But Ally also offers online banking  vehicle insurance and credit cards  among other products  It also re entered the mortgage business in 2016 via its direct to consumer Ally Home  and in mid April  it announced a partnership with Better com to launch a digital mortgage platform 
Ally Financial s top and bottom lines have ebbed and flowed over the past few years  but things are starting to perk up  and the pros are starting to take notice  The company beat Q1 earnings estimates in April  prompting a couple  Buy  calls  That included one from Oppenheimer analyst Dominick Gabriele  who wrote   We see a long runway for earnings given continued strong management execution that some investors are only just beginning to appreciate  
The company started dividends relatively recently  at 8 cents per share in 2016  and has already more than doubled it at its current 17 cents per share  That history as well as optimistic profit growth estimates of 10  annually through 2024 would almost seem to guarantee breakneck dividend growth going forward   right 
In early April  Ally announced a massive  1 25 billion repurchase program for 2019 that was far more than what most analysts expected  When you factor in that  the financial stock s total  cash return  payout ratio is actually a hair above 100   So yes  Ally does indeed have the means to make major dividend increases going forward   but only if it s less aggressive about buybacks 
Ally s Dividend Is a Mere Morsel of its Profits 
Valvoline  NYSE VVV Dividend Yield  2 2 Payout Ratio  28 2 5 Year Dividend Growth  30 1 
Valvoline  VVV  is a global juggernaut in its relatively niche area of the market  It offers automotive services and supplies lubricants to more than 140 countries  including 1 170 quick lube stores in the U S  It has roots going all the way back to 1866  though the company is a relative newbie on the public markets  executing its IPO in 2016 
The dividend is just as fresh  so its five year growth is extrapolated out from its original 4 9 cent dividend to today s 10 6 cent payout 
That s a lightning quick doubler 
The stock hasn t been nearly so spry  however  VVV has bounced back and forth since it came public  and shares sit about 16  lower than their IPO price  Particularly troubling was its fiscal first quarter report in February  Not only did Valvoline miss the mark on both earnings and revenues  but it announced a restructuring to  reduce costs  simplify processes and ensure that the organization s structure and resource allocation are focused on key growth initiatives   The initiative should save the company about  40 million to  50 million pretax each year starting with fiscal 2020 
Valvoline surely has the room to keep the pedal down on its dividend  though the company s focus now appears to be reinvigorating growth  I would wait to see green shoots from its restructuring efforts before even considering a move into VVV 
Aflac  NYSE AFL Dividend Yield  2 2 Payout Ratio  27 6 5 Year Dividend Growth  7 1 
Income investors should know that earnings payout ratios for dividends don t always tell the whole story  Net income can be manipulated  after all  So I also like to look at free cash flow payout ratios   You can calculate free cash flow simply by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow  
Aflac  AFL  is  and has long been  a reliable dividend stock on that and several other fronts 
Aflac  which we all know from its ubiquitous duck commercials  is a leading provider of supplemental insurance   things such as dental and vision plans  short term disability insurance and life insurance   serving more than 50 million customers 
The company has been slowly but steadily growing for years  though 2017 earnings spiked thanks to a considerable tax benefit  Analysts see more of the same going forward  with low single digit profit growth estimates for the next couple of years  That s fine  Aflac is an insurer  not a chipmaker 
That reliable growth has translated into a higher dividend each and every year since 2000  And given payout levels like these  shareholders can count on Aflac continuing to plump up the dividend 
Aflac Has It Covered 
Chemours  NYSE CC Dividend Yield  2 7 Payout Ratio  15 4 5 Year Dividend Growth  69 9 
Chemours  CC  is one of the byproducts of years of wheeling and dealing by DuPont  NYSE DWDP    which  following a merger with Dow is now DowDuPont  DowDuPont Inc  NYSE DWDP     which recently spun off Dow  Dow Jones 30 Futures  
That confusing bit of history aside  Chemours the  performance chemicals  division of DuPont that was spun off in 2015 is pretty straightforward  and really fascinating  For instance  it s the world s largest producer of high quality titanium dioxide  which goes into coatings in automobiles  marine craft and airplanes  It also makes fluor0products such as Teflon  and chemical solutions that cover a wide range of applications  such as acids for semiconductor manufacturing and sodium cyanide production for gold and silver miners 
Chemours   performance  isn t limited to its products  While CC shares had a nasty start in their first year of trading  they ve exploded by more than 525  off their July 2016 lows  versus 48  returns for the S P 500 in that time 
The dividend didn t start to get off the ground until a couple years after the spinoff  What started as a mere 3 cent payout finally took off with a massive jump to 17 cents in 2018  then to 25 cents that same year  where the payout stands today 
Pricing weakness in some of its products have hobbled its performance  and the stock  over the past year  and analysts see earnings weakening this year before returning to 2018 levels in 2020  That s a lot of sideways movement  which means Chemours would have to inflate its payout ratio to keep up with its red hot income growth  But considering it distributes just 15  of its net income as dividends   that s no biggie 
Wendy s  NASDAQ WEN Dividend Yield  2 1 Payout Ratio  18 1 5 Year Dividend Growth  12 8 
Baconator slinger Wendy s  WEN  has really come into its own over the past three years 
The House That Dave Thomas Built was only the eighth biggest fast food chain as of QSR magazine s August roundup behind both McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Restaurant Brands International s  QSR  Burger King  But it has the happiest shareholders 

While its actual financial results have been up and down for years  they re generally trending upward  and analysts expect that to continue this year and next  One of the catalysts for 2019 is a less value focused environment in the fast food arena  which is tailor made for Wendy s more premium positioning compared to the likes of McDonald s and Yum  Brands   YUM  Taco Bell 
Wendy s also has managed to double its dividend since 2014 to its current dime per share without stretching the purse strings  The company has a lean sub 20  payout ratio and could double the payout again overnight without dropping a bead of sweat 
I obviously don t expect that  but I do expect the next few Februaries   when Wendy s announces its payout increases   to be full of fireworks

140266,361781,AFL,Why Aflac  AFL  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Aflac  AFL   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6 28  
For the last reported quarter  Aflac came out with earnings of  1 02 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  representing a surprise of 8 51   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 99 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 03 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 04  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Aflac  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Aflac has an Earnings ESP of  0 38  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aflac-afl-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200403622,200403622
140267,361782,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Reports Next Week  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"The market expects Aflac  AFL  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  5 48 billion  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 75  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac 
For Aflac  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 02  delivering a surprise of  8 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Aflac doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-reports-next-week-what-to-know-ahead-of-the-release-200408479,200408479
140268,361783,AFL,Accident And Health Insurance Near Term Prospects Bright ,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that provide workers  compensation insurance largely to employers operating in hazardous industries such as construction  trucking  logging and lumber  manufacturing and agriculture  These companies also offer group  individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products Workers  compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees  pay  Claims are generally met by insurance companies or state run workers  compensation fund Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes The demand for workers  compensation insurance has been boosted by increase in employment in the manufacturing and construction sectors that have been gaining momentum driven by economic improvement  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  job opportunities in both these industries have increased at a rapid rate  Increased exposure to these sectors leads to higher premium for the industry players Pricing pressure might weigh on premiums  The efforts to retain market share will lead to continued pricing pressure  which might curb bottom line growth  Also  higher spending on technological advancements will result in higher expense ratios Rising medical costs remain a headwind for workers  compensation insurance  However  increased underwriting exposure  sustained decrease in claims frequency rates and conservative reserve levels should drive the industry s performance Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  98  which places it in the top 38  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is the result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  In a year s time  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have gone up 0 9   Before we present a few accident and health insurance stocks that investors may focus on  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms Sector  Lags S P 500The Accident and Health Insurance industry has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite but outperformed its own sector over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively increased 0 4  in the past year while the Finance sector has dipped 0 2   The Zacks S P 500 composite has increased 10 9  over the same period One Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month price to book  P B   which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks  the industry is currently trading at 1 4X compared with the S P 500 s 4 1X and the sector s 2 6X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 1 72X  as low as 1 17X and at the median of 1 4X Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM  Bottom LineContinued economic improvement should keep supporting the industry s performance  Also  prudent underwriting and intensive claims management practices with the help of technology position the industry well for growth  Nonetheless  pricing pressure and escalating medical costs remain concerns Investors may focus on the following stocks that carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   AMERISAFE  Inc   AMSF   This workers  compensation insurance provider in the

140269,361784,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Aflac  AFL   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Aflac is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Aflac imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Aflac
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this insurer is expected to earn  4 27 per share  which is a change of 2 6  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aflac  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

140286,361801,AFL,Why Aflac  AFL  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Aflac in Focus
Based in Columbus  Aflac  AFL  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 7 53   The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 26 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 2   This compares to the Insurance   Accident and Health industry s yield of 1 1  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 08 is up 3 8  from last year  In the past five year period  Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 7 68   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Aflac s current payout ratio is 25   This means it paid out 25  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 22 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 1 44  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aflac-afl-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200390119,200390119

Based in Columbus  Aflac  AFL  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 6 74   The insurer is paying out a dividend of  0 26 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 22  compared to the Insurance   Accident and Health industry s yield of 1 06  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97

Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-aflac-afl-could-be-a-great-choice-200395858,200395858

140310,361825,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Aflac  AFL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AFL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For AFL  shares are up 0 5  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry is up 0 9  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 09  compares favorably with the industry s 3 73  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Aflac have increased 6 39  over the past quarter  and have gained 13 4  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  2 11  and 5 37   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AFL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AFL is currently averaging 3 730 005 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with AFL 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AFL s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 15 to  4 22 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that AFL is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Aflac on your short list ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200386749,200386749
140315,361830,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Aflac  AFL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  49 38 in the previous session  Aflac has gained 8 2  since the start of the year compared to the 10 5  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 10 8  return for the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 31  2019  Aflac reported EPS of  1 02 versus consensus estimate of  0 94 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 25  
For the current fiscal year  Aflac is expected to post earnings of  4 22 per share on  21 79 billion in revenues  This represents a 1 44  change in EPS on a  1 47  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 42 per share on  21 85 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 7  and 0 3   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Aflac may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Aflac has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 1X versus its peer group s average of 11 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 4  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Aflac meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Aflac shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-02-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200389319,200389319

140340,361855,AFL,Aflac  AFL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Aflac  AFL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 47 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac 
For Aflac  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  4 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

140342,361857,AFL,Insurance Stocks  Earnings Due On Jan 31  AFL  MMC   More,opinion,"In the to be reported quarter  the insurance industry is expected to showcase an increase in revenues driven by higher premium and investment income This upside will be partly offset by high weather related losses and rise in expenses  Also  share buybacks made to utilize excess capital levels should provide an extra cushion to the bottom line   
Given below are the major influences this time around Increase in Fed Funds Rate Hike to Aid Investment IncomeAn important component of insurers  revenues is net investment income  which is largely dependent on federal interest rates The Central Bank made four rate hikes in 2018  reflecting economic progress  a strong labor market and 2  inflation as targeted by the Fed  With the one quarter percentage point hike at the December FOMC meeting  the interest rate now stands at 2 50  Given a rising rate environment  insurer s investment income should gain from an increase in investment yields Higher Pricing to Buoy PremiumsPer InsuranceNewsNet findings  Commercial insurance  which accounts for about half of U S  property casualty insurance industry premium  prices in the United States increased nearly 2  year over year  during the fourth quarter of 2018  This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of price hike   Per the findings  all business lines  other than Workers  Compensation saw price increase in the range of 1 3   Workers  Compensation was down 1 5  in the fourth quarter Another major insurance line  the Personal Lines  witnessed an average increase of 2 25  in the fourth quarter of 2018  Among the sublines  Homeowners rates in the fourth quarter remained stable at plus 3  for homes under  1 000 000 and plus 2  for homes above  1 000 000  Automobile rates were marginally down and personal articles rates were up slightly  both moving by 0 5  The rate increase in response to catastrophe loss sustained in recent years  helped players to recover losses across the affected insurance lines  This is  however  a welcome development after the industry saw soft market conditions in three years prior to 2017  Better pricing should therefore help insurers  revenue growth Margins to Gain From Low Taxes  Disciplined Capital DeploymentA lower level of tax incidence  courtesy of the new tax rate effective first quarter 2018  has been boosting margins of companies  This will not only aid margin expansion  but also lead to dividend payouts owing to higher net profit available to shareholders Also  the insurance industry boasts an all time high capital level  helping it to pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions Catastrophe Loses to Drain Underwriting ProfitabilityCalifornia wildfires destroyed thousands of residential and commercial properties in the fourth quarter of 2018  Apart from California wildfire  Hurricane Michael is also expected to take a toll on insurers  fourth quarter profits  According to a report published on Insurance Journal on

mix through efforts to deemphasize sales of first sector  life insurance  products in Japan and promote sales of third sector products that are less interest sensitive  has actually paid off  Sales in

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Aflac  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry  posted revenues of  5 48 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 42 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Aflac shares have added about 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for Aflac 
While Aflac has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Aflac was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 31  2019  Aflac reported EPS of  1 02 versus consensus estimate of  0 94 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 25  
For the current fiscal year  Aflac is expected to post earnings of  4 18 per share on  21 87 billion in revenues  This represents a 0 48  change in EPS on a  1 1  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 32 per share on  21 57 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 3 47  and  1 35   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Aflac may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Aflac has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 7X versus its peer group s average of 10 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 23  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Aflac passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Aflac shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-afl-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200382631,200382631

140418,361933,AFL,Aflac  Valuation Conundrum  Fair Value Dividend Aristocrats  Part 1 ,opinion,"Introduction
Aflac  NYSE AFL  is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 35 consecutive years  However  it is only one of seven Dividend Aristocrats that I consider attractively valued in light of the current bull market  Therefore  this will be the first in a series of seven articles where I will cover these seven attractively valued Dividend Aristocrats 
True value investors are a rare breed  because it takes a special mindset and or psyche to successfully implement a value investing strategy  This is especially true during major bull markets like we ve experienced since the 1st quarter of 2009  Common sense would dictate that it is much harder to find attractively valued companies during strong bull markets  Consequently  value typically only manifests during bull markets when a specific company is facing a negative situation  The secret is to determine whether the situation the company is facing is temporary or permanent 
If temporary  low valuation can represent an extraordinary long term opportunity  If the problem represents a permanent deterioration of fundamentals  then a value trap exists  Value investors attempt to exploit opportunities while avoiding value traps  During our most recent bear market Warren Buffett quipped that  we should be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy   When dealing with fundamentally strong companies  this is truly sage advice  On the other hand  when dealing with fundamentally weak companies  being greedy can lead to catastrophic long term results  In other words  greed only works when it is applied to fundamentally strong businesses that the market is temporarily mis appraising 
Therefore  I believe it only logically follows that successful value investing strategies require investing in extremely high quality companies when they can be purchased below their intrinsic value  Moreover  successful value investing requires the willingness to focus more on long term fundamental strength and less on short term price volatility  But perhaps most importantly  value investors   by trusting fundamentals over price   are able to maintain the patience to give the price the time to inevitably revert to the mean 
Additionally  value investors purchasing high quality companies are prepared to walk through short term price declines while the company is temporarily out of favor with most investors  In fact  successful value investors understand that finding a perfect bottom is impossible notwithstanding luck  Therefore  accomplished value investors are prepared for and even expect to experience short term underperformance   unless  of course  they get lucky  As Warren Buffett also once quipped  you can t buy what s popular and expect to do well   However  I believe Warren Buffett was referring to long term results not short term results when offering that advice 
This belief is based on the reality that value investing implies a long term perspective which Warren Buffett obviously embraces  Value investors are made up of tortoises racing against the hares  Value investors embrace the reality that investing is a marathon and not a sprint  But more to the point  value investors understand that it takes time for a business to generate operating results  and they understand the auction nature of the stock market over the short run  In other words  short term market returns tend to be emotionally generated  fear or greed  while long term returns are driven by successful business results  growth of earnings  cash flows and dividends  
Aflac  Measuring Business Value versus Market Value
When the prudent long term investor buys a stock  they are really buying the business  Therefore  I believe that knowing how well the business behind the stock you are considering has historically performed on an operating basis is an important first step in the investment process  Later in the video portion of this article I will present an earnings and price correlated FAST Graph reviewing Aflac Inc  NYSE AFL    its business and how the market has priced its business since the beginning of calendar year 1998  There are a couple of important points that I believe this long term graphic vividly reveals  First and foremost  as the video analysis will reveal  Aflac had achieved a very strong record of historical earnings growth  the orange line  up through 2012 averaging 12 9   However  since 2012 earnings growth has been low at less than 2  
As you will see in the video  this change in Aflac s growth dynamic represents a critical consideration regarding shareholder returns  On the other hand  this slowing of growth that Aflac is experiencing is effectively counterbalanced by the lower than normal valuation that the market has applied to Aflac shares since the Great Recession  As previously suggested  growth is an important driver of long term returns  However  unjustified low valuation can produce attractive long term returns even when growth is muted  Of course  the trick is to identify opportunities where the market has overreacted to the company s situation  I will illustrate how this works in the video below 
Second  we discover that up to the Great Recession of 2008  Aflac s stock price had not only tracked earnings  but even more importantly  that the stock had typically commanded a premium valuation  The blue line on the graph represents the normal PE ratio of 19 5 that the market historically applied to Aflac  Moreover  we also will see that the stock price rarely fell below its earnings justified valuation  the orange line  representing a P E ratio of 15  However  since the Great Recession  the market has not been as kind as it historically had been to Aflac as the stock market has clearly been valuing Aflac much lower at a normal P E ratio of approximately 10 since 2009  On the other hand  the fact that earnings growth has slowed considerably and considering that financials and financially related companies have been chronically out of favor since the Great Recession  a significantly lower valuation could be considered justified  However  a justifiably lower valuation and significant undervaluation are two different matters altogether 
Clarifying Remarks on the Proper Use of the PE Ratio
Moreover  I believe it s critical to recognize and understand the proper utilization of the PE ratio and its significance as an investor s tool for making sound valuation judgments  Furthermore  it s important to add that the perspectives that the PE ratio provides are primarily relevant to long term investing  The PE ratio at its core deals with measuring the value of a company s earnings  Therefore  it is more of a business valuation tool than it is a stock market trading vehicle  As a result  it is also implied that the principles underpinning the PE ratio s relevance take time to manifest  When dealing with ascertaining the proper valuation of a business  it s only appropriate to conduct this measurement as it pertains at a minimum to a normal business cycle  3 to 5 years  and the longer the timeframe   the better 
In this respect  it s also important that the reader recognizes that a stock can be overvalued and still go higher  and conversely  become undervalued and still go lower in the shorter run  Therefore  understanding when a PE ratio represents fair valuation is not necessarily a perfect market timing tool  Instead  it is a valuable measurement when used and looked at properly that can alert the investor to precisely recognize the time when markets may begin mispricing a stock  over or under 
Therefore  one of the greatest values that the proper understanding and utilization of the PE ratio offers investors is the ability to recognize the level of risk they are taking based on earnings values when making buy  sell or hold decisions  What the investor does with this information is up to them  but at least their decisions will be made with the clear understanding of the valuation risk levels they are assuming  When used properly  the PE ratio is an important and beneficial risk measuring tool for the prudent long term oriented stock investor  Of course  the P E ratio is not the only valuation metric that value investors should appropriately consider  Valuation is a puzzle  and it takes all the pieces to paint a complete picture of a company s true value  The P E ratio is just one of many valuation puzzle pieces 
Aflac  FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Valuation Analysis
The following analyze out loud video will present a quick overview of Aflac  Inc  based primarily on price relative to earnings and cash flow  However  as discussed above  I will also evaluate several other metrics  For any reader concerned with the current valuation of Aflac  this video is a must watch  Furthermore  although I will be only providing a cursory  or a pre more comprehensive due diligence analysis  I believe you will find the video enlightening and hopefully entertaining 
As an aside  this is the third article I ve written on Aflac  On November 9  2011 I authored an article titled    Although I still believe my premise that Aflac deserved a higher P E ratio was valid  the stock has yet to reach my target P E ratio of 15  However  although the P E ratio has yet to double  it has increased significantly above where it was when I wrote the article  Consequently  performance has been strong even though the company s growth rate has slowed considerably  Double digit performance came primarily as a result of P E ratio expansion coupled with a growing dividend 
My second article was written on August 2  2012 titled    As a testament to the importance of valuation  Aflac s performance since the second article has also been strong in spite of the fact that earnings growth did not manifest as analysts were forecasting  Nevertheless  it was once again primarily P E ratio expansion and dividend growth that generated strong results  Proving to me at least that investing in an undervalued stock produces strong results at lower risk even when earnings growth did not pan out as expected 

Summary and Conclusions
Legendary investor Ben Graham has taught that the stock market is a voting machine in the short run  but a weighing machine in the long run  This lesson means that emotionally driven stock values are merely a function of investors  short term attitudes which can be very mercurial and  therefore  change very quickly  However  longer term  the strength of the business is what ultimately matters the most  I believe that Aflac is a very strong business and a high quality company with a strong balance sheet  However  the conundrum is whether or not the market is currently mis appraising the business or not 
Based on the undeniable reality that the market has been applying a normal P E multiple of approximately 10 on Aflac over the past decade or so would indicate that Aflac is currently overvalued on that basis  On the other hand  based on a more market neutral P E ratio of 15  Aflac could be considered undervalued  However  this chronic undervaluation has persisted since 2009 until the P E ratio began increasing since the beginning of this fiscal year  2017  
Nevertheless  I leave it up to the reader to draw their own conclusions  Do you believe Aflac is finally  after many painful and excruciating years  reverting once again towards a mean P E ratio of 15 indicating that it is currently undervalued  Or do you believe that Aflac will revert to its more recent normal P E ratio of 10 indicating that it is currently overvalued  Although either scenario may prove to pan out in the future  investors should also strongly consider the significant slowdown in growth that Aflac has been experiencing in recent years  But more importantly  expectations for future growth continue to be lower than average  Caveat emptor  in other words  determining fair value for Aflac is a conundrum

140419,361934,AFL,Should Value Investors Consider Aflac Incorp   AFL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Aflac Incorporated   NYSE AFL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Aflac has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Aflac s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is a bit undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Aflac has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 9  which is in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Aflac has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Aflac currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Aflac a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Aflac might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B  This gives AFL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen two estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and none down in the same time period Therefore  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up only by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Aflac Incorporated Price and Consensus   This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAflac is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 4  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past six months  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it s hard to get too excited about the stock overall  so value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021

Since 2015  Schlumberger s long term debt load has increased considerably  Moreover  the company s cash balance has been declining over the last six quarters  reflecting significant balance sheet weakness

Shares of Buy rated American Express are up  31 6  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry  which has gained  10 9  over the same period  The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics  plus lower operating costs  
The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position and strength in the card business  Significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments are key growth drivers  Strategic initiatives focusing on the platinum card portfolio and the OptBlue program will drive business volume  Cost reduction and return of significant capital to shareholders through dividend and share buyback are also positives  
However  an increase in provision for losses  high rewards expense and cost of card member services are some of the headwinds  American Express will likely incur nearly  2 4 billion charges in fourth quarter 2017 from tax reform  which will cause its 2017 earnings to fall short of its guided range of  5 80  5 90 per share

Strong Buy rated BlackRock s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry in the last six months    22 1  vs   17 1    This performance is supported by its impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst likes the initiatives taken to restructure its actively managed equities business with an aim to meet changing client needs  These along with technological changes and its efforts to expand globally via acquisitions will further help top line growth going forward  However  mounting expenses mainly due to continued rise in marketing costs is likely to hurt the bottom line growth

Will Aflac deliver a positive earnings surprise this quarter as well   Let s see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around Q3 FlashbackFor the third quarter  we expect to see a sharp decline in sales of the first sector products in Japan due to the company s deliberate action to fight the low interest rate environment over there by reducing the sale of these  The company took a number of measures such as product caps  commission restructuring  product re pricing in select cases and product discontinuance in the second quarter  These are expected to have a profound effect on sales in this quarter and in the next 
Sales of third sector products are likely to grow as the company is emphasizing these  The introduction of cancer insurance product in the first quarter in this line has been well received in the market place and will contribute to top line growth 
The company is expected to have witnessed improved underwriting margins on the strength of its franchise in Japan and the U S  supplemental health markets 
Nevertheless  expenses are expected to flare up in the quarter as the company undertook certain strategic initiatives and increased promotional spend entering the enrollment season 
We also expect to see an increase in hedge costs as the company hedged additional dollar asset classes 
Also  a low interest rate environment will present headwinds to net investment income

140616,362131,AFL,Aflac Ready To Fly Higher,opinion,"The insurance sector has been a bright spot since January after a small pullback  One name that has been soaring is Aflac Incorporated  NYSE AFL   Rising from the pullback of December into the beginning of the year  it made a new all time high over 69 50 at the end of April  Since then it has moved sideways  But it might be time for Aflac to spread its wings and fly higher 
The chart below shows that it made a Cup and Handle pattern that broke to the upside in the beginning of April  This gave a price objective to at least 73 30  From there it has been consolidating  This leaves  4 of upside to that objective  But it has also set up a Measured Move to 74 75 with this consolidation 

Momentum remains strong  with the RSI running flat well into the bullish zone while the MACD resets lower but also in positive territory  There are two indications of why now may be the time for the next leg up  The first is that the Bollinger Bands  are squeezed  This is often a precursor to a move  And the second is the rising 20 day SMA  This has acted as support and a place where price has bounced each time it was touched in this move higher  Earlier this week the price touched the 20 day SMA again 
Look for a break over 69 50 as a trigger to own and use the 68 level  at the bottom of consolidation as a stop loss level

140617,362132,AFL,AFLAC  Even More Attractive After Earnings,opinion,"Aflac  NYSE AFL  is one of only 2 insurance stocks in the Dividend Aristocrats Index  The company is the global leader in cancer insurance  and has paid increasing dividends for 33 consecutive years 
On April 26  AFLAC reported strong first quarter 2016 financial results  which beat earnings per share expectations by  0 10  6 1    Total revenue increased 4 3  year over year to  5 45 billion due to a stronger yen dollar exchange rate  Revenues also surpassed consensus estimate of  5 23 billion 
Aflac showed earnings per share surprise in its three last quarters after missing estimates in the previous quarter  as shown in the table below 

Aflac  the largest provider of individual insurance in Japan and the leading provider of voluntary insurance at the worksite in the United States  has its primary business is in Japan In fact  about 70  of the company s total revenues in the last quarter came from Japan 
As such  Aflac s financial results depend heavily on the yen dollar exchange rate  The latest trend of the stronger yen is favoring the company s revenues and earnings in dollar terms  Aflac Japan s yen denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period  The average yen dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2016 was 115 35  or 3 30  stronger than the average rate of 119 16 in the first quarter of 2015  Moreover  The average yen dollar exchange rate thus far in the current quarter is 108 99  or 5 84  stronger than the average rate of the previous quarter 
As such  we can expect higher revenues and earnings in the current quarter due to the even greater strengthening of the yen in the current quarter 

  Thus far in Q2 2016

Commenting on the company s first quarter results  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P  Amos stated 

We are pleased with our overall financial results in the first quarter of 2016  Aflac Japan  our largest earnings contributor  generated solid financial results in yen terms for the quarter  Sales of first sector products were elevated in the quarter  consistent with our expectations  As we further implement various measures later in the quarter  we expect to see a sharp decline in first sector sales in the second half of the year  Although sales of Aflac Japan s third sector products were up 1 0  in the quarter  you ll recall we communicated in February that we anticipate sales of third sector products will be down mid single digits for the full year following very robust production results in 2015  While it s early in the year  we are running ahead of expectations for sales of third sector products as of the end of the first quarter  We continue to believe the long term compound annual growth rate for third sector products will be in the range of 4  to 6  
In the first quarter  Aflac U S  produced solid financial and sales results  We continue to believe that the changes we made to our career and broker management infrastructure have created a foundation for greater long term growth opportunities  The increase in new annualized premium sales of 3 7  establishes a solid baseline for our expectation of a 3  to 5  growth rate for the U S  in 2016  Keep in mind  we anticipate the achievement of our annual U S  sales target will be increasingly reliant on fourth quarter production 

Outlook
Aflac reiterated that its annual objective was to produce operating earnings per diluted share of  6 17 to  6 41  assuming the 2015 average exchange rate of 120 99 yen to the dollar 
If the yen averages 105 to 115 yen to the dollar for the second quarter  the company would expect earnings in the second quarter to be approximate  1 55 to  1 82 per diluted share  Since thus far in the current quarter the yen has averaged at 109 yen to the dollar  we can expect earnings near the top of this range 
Dividend
Aflac has paid increasing dividends   The second quarter dividend is payable on June 1  2016  to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18  2016  The forward annual dividend yield is at 2 4   and the payout ratio is only 26 2  
The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at 5 6   over the past five years was at 6 7   and over the last ten years was high at 13 6  
Source  company s reports  assuming same dividend rate for the year

In the first quarter  Aflac repurchased  600 million  or 10 2 million of its common shares  At the end of March  the company had 38 2 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorizations 
Growth
In my opinion  Aflac s growth prospects are still firm 
According to the company  sales of cancer insurance in Japan continue to be extremely strong following the introduction of the end of the third quarter of 2015 the new cancer days products  which includes an exclusive policy sold for Japan Post  In the first quarter of 2016  the company introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and been cancer free for five years  just as it does in the United States  as well as an enhanced nonstandard medical insurance product 
According to Aflac  it will continue to be innovative in its providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle to bear the financial burdens of higher medical expenses  All of Aflac s alliance partners continue to produce strong results  and the company is especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20 000 plus postal outlets selling Aflac s cancer insurance 
In the U S   the company has made changes to its sales organization to enhance it sales growth  Aflac sees 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth and continues to execute on its strategies  With Aflac generating new annualized premium sales of 3 7   it is off to a good start toward its expectation of a 3  to 5  sales growth for the U S  in 2016 
Valuation
Since the beginning of the year  AFL s stock is up 15 0  while the S P 500 Index has increased 0 1   and the Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 5 8  
However  since the beginning of 2012  AFL s stock has gained only 59 2   In this period  the S P 500 Index has increased 62 7  and the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 81 1  
According to TipRanks  the average target price of the top analysts is at  71 67  an upside of 4 1  from its May 13 close price  however  in my opinion  shares could go higher 
AFL s valuation metrics are excellent  the trailing P E is very low at 11 3  and the forward P E is even lower at 9 9  The price to free cash flow is extremely low at 4 75  and the enterprise value EBITDA ratio is also very low at 6 87 
According to James P  O Shaughnessy  the Enterprise Value EBITDA ratio is the best performing single value factor  In his impressive book  What Works on Wall Street   Mr  O Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years back testing  from 1963 to 2009  have shown that companies with the lowest EV EBITDA ratio have given the best return 
Ranking
According to Portfolio123 s  All Stars  Greenblatt  ranking system  AFL s stock is ranked second among all S P 500 stocks 

The  All Stars  Greenblatt  ranking system is taking into account just two factors  Return on Capital and Earnings Yield  E P  in equal proportions  Back testing has proved that this ranking system is one of the best free available ranking method  I recommend investors to read Joel Greenblatt s book     where he thoroughly explains his system 
Summary
Aflac delivered another strong quarter financial results which beat EPS expectations by  0 10  6 1    the company showed earnings per share surprise in its three last quarters  The average yen dollar exchange rate thus far in the current quarter is 5 84  stronger than the average rate of the previous quarter 
As such  we can expect higher revenues and earnings in the current quarter  AFL s valuation metrics are excellent  the forward P E is very low at 9 9  and the EV EBITDA ratio is also very low at 6 9  Aflac is generating strong free cash flows  and returns substantial capital to its shareholders by stock buybacks and by increasing dividend payments  Aflac has raised its annual dividend for 33 consecutive years  In addition  the company ranks in the top 40  of high quality dividend stocks using  
All these factors bring me to the conclusion that AFL s stock is a smart long term investment ",2016-05-15,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-is-even-more-attractive-after-earnings-200129921,200129921

140640,362155,AFL,Top Trade Ideas  Week August 17  2015,opinion,"Aflac  NYSE AFL  is known for their crazy commercials with a duck that quacks the company name  But if you did not know  they are the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the US  Nothing to quack at  They also provide 1 in 4 Japanese households with life insurance  Not bad for a company founded in Columbus  Georgia 
The stock price has benefited lately from a broad rise in the insurance sector since 2012  It has consolidated in a cup and handle formation since late 2013  and is triggering now  That pattern gives a target to 74 75  Shorter term it is consolidating in a bull flag with a target to 68 on a break to the upside 
The momentum indicators show a supportive environment for more upside with the RSI bullish and rising and the MACD positive  But with the MACD cross down it could be a bit better  There is support lower at 63 65 and 62 50 before 61 40 and 60 35  Resistance to the upside comes at 64 90 and the prior high at 67 50  Short interest is low at 1 2  and the company is expected to report next on October 27th 
Looking at the options chains the August expiry shows large open interest this week on the call side and between the 62 5 and 67 5 Strikes  There is a big open interest at the 47 5 strike on the put side that looks like it will not come into play  September open interest is not very big at this point  but favors the current area  Moving to the November strike beyond earnings shows the 65 to 70 strike range with large open interest on the call side and that same 47 5 put strike below big  too 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 65 with a stop at 63 50  A straight stock play 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the August 65 calls  offered at 26 cents late Friday  and sell the August 62 5 puts  10 cents  if you want leverage  A short term leveraged trade with defined risk using just the calls  and more leverage with the puts added 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the September 60 65 bullish risk reversal  69 cents   Give it more time  but stops prior to earnings 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the November 65 70 call spread   1 55  and sell the November 62 5 put   1 50   A highly levered trade giving up some upside for a maximum levered return 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad market macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into August Options Expiration Week  sees the equity markets looking to consolidate in the short term and looking better long term 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue the bounce in its downtrend while crude oil just continues lower  The US Dollar Index seems content to move sideways  but with a short term downward bias while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to consolidate in the longer uptrend while emerging markets look ugly with more downside to come 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite their failure to move higher last week  Their charts show weakness continuing in the IWM and consolidation in the SPY and QQQ short term  All look better longer term with the QQQ strongest followed by IWM and then SPY  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trade  em well

140641,362156,AFL,Allocation For Corporate Debt Hangover,opinion,"Are corporations in great shape  Three consecutive quarters of declines in earnings suggest that they are not  Worse yet  record high leverage coupled with close to record low interest coverage indicate stress within corporate balance sheets 
Beginning with the  profit recession   it has become fashionable to describe the deterioration as a function of the price collapse in oil and gas  However  that assessment fails the sniff test on three different levels  One  six of the ten S P 500 economic segments share in the year over year earnings contraction  not the energy sector alone  Second  if one excludes energy as an outlier on the negative side  one would be obliged to throw away super sized contributors like health care on the positive side of the ledger  In doing so  the profit picture still appears weak 
A third reason that it is foolish to dismiss energy earnings  Analysts made the same mistakes prior to the economic downturns in 2001 and 2008  It was short sighted to toss the technology sector in the dot com collapse  It was irrational to exclude financials in the banking crisis  It follows that it would be just as insular to ignore the influential energy segment when evaluating corporate profitability today 

Perhaps more troubling is the erroneous belief that corporations have improved their balance sheets since the Great Recession  In truth  U S  companies have doubled their total debt levels since 2007  while simultaneously finding it more difficult to pay interest expenses on outstanding obligations 
According to Investopedia  the interest coverage ratio determines the ease or difficulty by which a company can service its existing debt  The ratio is calculated by dividing a company s earnings before interest and taxes  EBITA  by the company s interest expenses for the same period  The higher the ratio  the less burdened by borrowing costs a company is  the lower the ratio  the more onerous the debt expense is for a company 
Now take a look at the charts below  Total leverage by U S   investment grade   IG  corporations has catapulted through the proverbial roof  Leverage does not matter as long as companies can service the debt  right  Unfortunately  investment grade interest coverage is back to levels not seen since 2009 

If one shifts to corporations on the world stage  the picture becomes more nebulous  Consider the net debt to earnings  EBITA  at global companies  This measure looks at the number of years  theoretically speaking  that a company would require to pay obligations back  And right now  according to Standard   Poor s  net debt to EBITA in 2015 at 3 0 was the highest since 2003 
That s not all  Analysts typically regard a ratio below three as  safe   With the average global company straddling the fence between safe and not so safe  what does that tell investors about the financial health of the world s corporations 

Why should anyone focus on all the debt talk surrounding the world s corporations  Don t they always find a way to right their respective ships  Well  for one thing  if a company has money left over after it services its debt obligations  it cannot necessarily expand its business in productive ways  including research  development  human resources acquisition  marketing and so forth  We ve already seen the most recent reading of the Institute For Supply Management  ISM  Non Manufacturing Index hit its lowest level since March of 2014  55 3   That s not encouraging  even if it shows expansion in the services arena 
In a similar vein  it is highly discouraging to witness carnage in the capital goods arena  It would seem that companies are unwilling and or do not have the discretionary dollars to invest in tangible assets to produce goods or services such as office buildings  equipment and machinery  Maybe debt is taking a nasty toll after all   See the chart below  

So how might one invest in an environment where corporate and government debts have skyrocketed  asset prices have hit extremes and the Federal Reserve is committed to raising borrowing costs  Former PIMCO  guru  Mohamed El Arian has finally decided that 25  30  in cash is the best way to survive what he anticipates will be better buying opportunities down the pathway 
For my clients at Pacific Park Financial  Inc  we began making the tactical allocation shift in June of 2015   seven months ago  We downshifted from 70  growth  e g   large cap  smaller cap  foreign  etc   to roughly 50  growth  high quality  low volatility large cap stocks   We moved from 30  income  e g   short  long  investment grade  higher yielding  etc   to approximately 20  25  investment grade income  With cash or cash equivalents approximating 25    safer harbors such as SPDR Nuveen Short Term Muni  N SHM  as well as money market vehicles   we reduced volatility while awaiting better buying opportunities 
While I expect the corrective activity that began in May of 2015 to continue  my clients understand that I seek to reduce risk  not eliminate it  It follows that current stock exposure at 45  50  does not represent a mindset of  shorting  or being out of equities completely  For the most part  we have been out of foreign positions and smaller U S  companies for quite some time  Nevertheless  we maintain an allocation to equity ETFs via funds like iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor  N QUAL  and iShares USA Minimum Volatility  N USMV  
The bond story is remarkably similar  Rather than pursue cross over corporates or high yield or even long term investment grade corporates  we have stayed near the middle of the curve with funds like   1  SPDR Nuveen Muni  N TFI    2  Vanguard Total Bond  N BND    3  iShares 7 10 Year Treasury  N IEF  and  4  iShares 3 7 Year Treasury  N IEI  
There are those who crave a bit more potential than cash or T bills  For those folks  rather than  shorting   we employ multi asset stock hedging  We ve picked up some of the assets in the FTSE Multi Asset Stock Hedge Index  including the yen  gold and zero coupon treasuries 
Make no mistake about it  however  The cash that had been raised in 2015 has multiple purposes  It provides a measure of comfort when stock volatility surpasses norms  In addition  cash offers one the ability to acquire  buy low  value propositions  Even now  there are folks with excess cash who might want to examine a dividend aristocrat like Aflac  N AFL   With a trailing P E of 10  a forward P E of 9  a dividend yield of 2 9  and a price from mid 2014  you may decide the rewards are worthy of the risk

140642,362157,AFL,Top Trade Ideas For The Week March 7  2016  AFL,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Aflac Incorporated  NYSE AFL   had a steep drop in August as the market fell  It recovered slowly over the next 3 months  exactly like the market adage  take the stairs up  and the elevator down  That high to start December was a marginally higher high  but this time the stock seemed to take the stairs down  It slowly fell over six weeks to make a slightly higher low in February  Higher high and higher low   Uptrend  Does not appear that way so far in this stock 
What may be more interesting to view over this time period is the role the 200 day SMA has been playing  It was support in July but since the fall in August it seems to act as a midpoint in an oscillation of price action  Falling lower  then being pulled back up and overshooting to be pulled back down and overshoot to the downside  With the rise off of the February low is it ready to overshoot to the upside again 
Looking at the other details of the chart suggest that it might be  The RSI is rising and bullish while the MACD continues higher  Both support the upside continuing  A move through the current resistance zone has resistance higher at 62 70 and 64 60 followed by 66  Support lower comes at 61 and 59 70 followed by 58 65 and 56 50 
The options chains show some potential for the price to stay at 60 for the next two weeks  or at least return there at Expiry  The big open interest at the 60 Strike Call in March dwarfs that at all other strikes in March on both sides  In April it shifts up to the 62 50 strike  And in May  beyond the April 22nd earnings report  the biggest open interest is at 65  Steady progress higher  And the past pace higher would look for a top somewhere between the April and May Expiry 
Aflac  Ticker  AFL
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 61 60 with a stop at 60 50  just under the 200 day SMA

140669,362184,AFL,Implications Of A Strengthening Dollar And Foreign Sales For SP,opinion,"In a recently released report by S P Dow Jones Indices and authored by Howard Silverblatt  Senior Index Analyst  an analysis is provided for the sales generated outside the U S  for S P 500 companies  Although the reporting of foreign sales data is less than complete  S P s report provides detail on the 239 companies that do provide foreign sales data  The report provides a comprehensive discussion on the companies used in the analysis with a snapshot provided below 

 
A number of important facts can be gained from reviewing the report  however  one important factor is the impact of a strong US dollar on reported earnings for U S  domiciled firms  We touched on the strong dollar issue in a recent post    and a number of strategists highlighted this issue last week as well  The issue with a strong dollar is the negative impact on earnings when the foreign currency is converted back to the dollar  The dollar based company reports fewer dollars because of the dollar s strength  A good example of this is Aflac Incorporated  NYSE AFL  
 
In 2013 operating income for the company equaled  6 18 which included a   76 reduction due to the negative impact of a weaker Yen  i e   stronger dollar  In the company s second quarter 2014 10 Q  they include a table noting the potential impact of Yen currency moves relative to the dollar 

 
 Also detailed in the S P report is the foreign sales percentage by S P 500 Index sector  Information technology  energy and materials are the three sectors with the largest foreign sales percentage 
 

 

Additional detail is provided on specific companies that comprise the sectors and their respective foreign sales allocation 
 
Importantly  investors will want to evaluate where the foreign sales are generated  Some country currencies may actually trade stronger to the dollar versus weakening  In total though  the fact the U S  Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its QE program in October and the simultaneous desire by the European Central Bank to weaken the Euro  a further strengthening of the dollar is likely  Currency moves are difficult to predict and currency volatility should be expected  For investors  understanding the potential currency impact for companies selling goods outside the U S  and understanding any currency hedging at the company level  is an important variable at this point in the economic cycle ",2014-09-21,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/implications-of-a-strengthening-dollar-and-foreign-sales-for-s-p-226510,226510

140671,362186,AFL,Aflac Is Undervalued,opinion,"Aflac Incorporated  NYSE AFL  is a supplemental life  health  and accident insurer with operations in the United States and Japan  The company generates about 75  of its revenue in Japan  with the remaining 25  coming from the United States 
Aflac is a very shareholder friendly company  The company has increased its dividend payments for 32 consecutive years  This makes Aflac a Dividend Aristocrat  The company s commitment to share repurchases is equally as impressive 
CEO Daniel Amos had this to say about Aflac s share repurchases in the company s  
 We continue to believe our capital strength puts us in an excellent position to repatriate approximately  200 billion to the United States for the calendar year 2015  which reinforces our plan to repurchase  1 3 billion of our common stock in 2015  As we said at our financial analysts briefing in May  we believe that over the next few years  we ll be able to increase the capital available for deployment  emphasis added   
 1 3 billion is a lot of money for a company Aflac s size  Aflac currently has a market cap of  27 8 billion   1 3 billion in share repurchases comes to 4 7  of the company s current market cap  Add in the company s current dividend yield of 2 4   and Aflac plans to return 7 1  to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2015 
Aflac expects to generate earnings per share of around  6 00 in 2015  The company plans to pay out about  4 50 per share in dividends and share repurchases in 2015  for a total payout ratio  including dividends and share repurchase  of 75  
Aflac s Growth Prospects
Aflac grew earnings per share at 10 3  a year over the last decade  The company managed solid earnings growth in a difficult time for insurance companies  This growth includes both the Great Recession  and a period of rapidly falling interest rates 
Low interest rates cause insurers to generate less profit from their insurance float  The higher interest rates are  the more profits can be squeezed out of the float 
Aflac expects continued growth ahead  The company s CEO had this to say about expected results for the rest of 2015 
 With the first half of the year complete  I am pleased with the company s results  Those results  combined with our outlook for the remainder of 2015  well position us for another year of solid financial performance  These results have also given us the confidence to upwardly revise our target for 2015 operating earnings per diluted share to now be in the range of 4  to 7  on a currency neutral basis  
As discussed above  Aflac expects to repurchase about 4  of shares outstanding in fiscal 2015  This means the company expects currency neutral operating income  before share repurchases  to grow 0  to 3  in fiscal 2015 
This level of growth is far below the company s average operating income growth of 7 9  a year over the last decade 
Aflac s growth has slowed in large part due to weakness in the Japanese economy  Japan is the most indebted  western  country  Japan has a public debt to GDP ratio of 227   Compare this to Greece s debt to GDP ratio of  just  175   For comparison  the United States has a debt to GDP ratio of 71  
Massive debt and an expected negative population growth rate will likely doom the Japanese economy to several more decades of stagnation at best  Because Aflac generates 75  of its premium revenue in Japan  the country s future is of importance to Aflac 
This does not  however  mean that Aflac will not reward shareholders with growth going forward  The company will likely not grow operating income near 8  a year over the next decade  growth of 3  to 6  is more likely  Still  with growth at these numbers combined with massive share repurchases and dividend payments of around 7  a year  Aflac offers investors total returns of 10  to 13  a year even with sluggish growth 
Aflac s Valuation
Solid total returns bode well for shareholders  In addition  Aflac operates in perhaps the most stable industry in the world  The insurance industry is extremely slow changing  It is virtually inconceivable to think of any changes in technology that would make insurance obsolete  People will always have risks that they want to hedge   and insurance companies will fill this need  for a price  
The  icing on the cake  for Aflac investors is the companies low valuation  Aflac is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 10 8  Prior to 2009  Aflac traded for an average price to earnings ratio of around 19  The company appears deeply undervalued at current prices given its solid expected total returns 
The Bottom Line
Aflac is a high quality insurer  The company is the global leader in supplemental cancer insurance  The company has maintained after tax operating margins over 10  since 2007  Aflac writes highly profitable policies 
When an insurance company is able to write profitable policies  it has a negative cost of capital  Aflac takes in money from customers in the form of premiums  It invests these premiums into  primarily  debt securities and earns interest on the  float    premiums paid that have not yet been paid out as benefits 
The company writes profitable insurance policies  so it pays nothing for its access to float  When an insurer can sustain writing profitable policies  it will be highly profitable  Aflac is among the most lucrative insurers around   and it is on sale for a price to earnings ratio of just 10 8 
Aflac s combination of a solid dividend yield  excellent expected total returns  a long dividend history  and a low price to earnings ratio make the company a favorite of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing  Aflac makes a compelling purchase for investors looking for additional exposure to the insurance industry ",2015-08-07,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac-is-undervalued---has-a-7-shareholder-yield-260928,260928

140721,362236,AFL,Shiller PE Continues To Mislead Investors  S P 500 Fairly Valued,opinion,Allow me to start this article by emphatically stating that I have a real problem with forecasting stock markets in the general sense  Instead  I prefer to forecast the intrinsic values of individual businesses based on their earnings justified fundamental values  I hold this position because I believe that it is not only possible  but also quite practical to analyze a specific business and then make an intelligent forecast  not a guess  but a rational estimation  based on the assimilation of fundamental facts  as to its past  present and future intrinsic value  Importantly  I m not suggesting this can be done with absolute perfect precision down to the precise penny  rather I am suggesting it can be done within a reasonable range of rational probabilities In contrast  trying to estimate the collective results of a large group of companies such as the S P 500  SPY  is a very daunting task  There are just too many variables and too many data points to contemplate from which to make a rational and or reasonably accurate forecast  On the other hand  the evidence I ve reviewed suggests that the earnings and price correlation and relationship is just as valid on an index  as it is on an individual stock  In other words  earnings will be the primary driver of stock price for both a specific company and an index With the above said  I have been periodically posting articles relating to the valuation of the S P 500 based on the earnings and price correlated fundamentals analyzer software tool F A S T  Graphs   My rationale for engaging in an activity that I generally eschew is born of my desire to help people to being better informed investors  To my way of thinking  this means injecting more fact based information into our analysis and less opinion  Facts provide information that can be quantified and evaluated  Opinions  on the other hand  are often emotionally charged which can lead to irrational responses and behaviors  Therefore  I feel that the emotional response does not belong in something as important as making prudent investing decisions  Reason should dictate behavior rather than emotions such as fear or greed Allow me to try to clarify this a little more by presenting the current earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on the S P 500 since calendar year 1993  The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share at the historical normal PE ratio of 15  The reader should note that the blue line on the graph represents a historically normal PE ratio of 19 over this time period  This simply indicates that for much of this time frame  that the S P 500 s stock price was in overvalued territory  Importantly  notice how the stock price tracked the orange earnings justified valuation line  and that whenever it deviated away from the line it inevitably moves back towards alignment  Today  with a blended PE ratio of 14 8 the S P 500 is reasonably valued   Note  that because of the long duration of this graph  that only every other year is typed in  although data for all years is plotted  At this point  it s important to state that historical F A S T  Graphs  valuation measurements are based on actual S P 500 operating earnings as reported  and estimated earnings  numbers marked with E for estimate  come directly from the Standard   Poor s website  This is in contrast to the very popular statistical S P 500 valuations based on the Shiller PE ratio calculation known as CAPE which utilizes earnings calculated as a 10 year average  If you carefully study the earnings and price correlating graph above  it is obvious that earnings for the S P 500  the orange line  have mostly advanced with the exception of the two recessions of 2001 and 2008  This is important  because mathematically speaking the 10 year average of an advancing number will most often calculate earnings to be lower than they actually are  Of course  the exception would be when you re calculating a 10 year average during a recessionary period when earnings have fallen  The point is that the only way that the Prof  Shiller statistical calculation can be correct is if future earnings fall  Again  an average of 10 years worth of increasing numbers will  mathematically speaking  always be lower than the current number  However  the problem is that as the graphic clearly indicates  earnings of the S P 500 increase much more often than they fall  This clearly  at least  has been true for the last couple of decades This creates a problem for investors that I find appalling  For the great majority of the time  the Shiller calculated PE ratio will generally indicate that the market is overvalued  Consequently  investors who buy into this thesis will generally tend to avoid investing in stocks  Yet  if they were to calculate valuation based on actual numbers  they would more often than not find that stocks are fairly priced to even cheap  instead of overvalued  Therefore  they are often avoiding stocks at precisely times when the risk of investing in them is lowest  and simultaneously  when the rewards for owning them are highest To further illustrate my point   published on 10 12 2011 where real earnings data indicated that the S P 500 was cheap with a PE ratio of 12 6 based on the then estimated earnings for the S P 500 for 2011 of  97 98  Actual 2011 earnings came in slightly lower at  96 44  1 6  lower than originally estimated   but still represented a 15  advance over 2010  Consequently  the S P 500 was still trading at a PE ratio below 13  and less than its historical normal PE of 15  Unfortunately  the Shiller PE for the S P 500 was at 20 15  Since anything over 16 is considered expensive  CAPE was declaring that the S P 500 was overvalued  not undervalued  The following earnings and price correlated graph shows the S P 500 at a price of 1194 89 on October 10  2011  As of this writing  the S P 500 is priced at 1472 05 or approximately 23  higher than it was in October of 2011  Therefore  investors believing in the Shiller statistical PE missed out on a great buying opportunity  n the spirit of accountability  the following are links to several other similar articles to this one  utilizing the actual PE of the S P 500 based on real earnings and the near estimate of future earnings  For perspective  I ve reported the date the article was published and the respective Shiller PE ratio on that date  Once again remember that according to Prof  Shiller  his statistically calculated PE ratio has to be approximately 16 or lower for fair value to exist  All of the following examples show that the Prof  Shiller CAPE  Cyclically Adjusted PE  would have caused investors to avoid investing in equities when the opportunities in doing so were high  and the risks based on valuation low  When  was written on January 6  2010  the Shiller S P 500 PE was 20 52 indicating overvaluation  The F A S T  Graphs  calculated PE on actual earnings of 19 1 agreed  However  by February 21  2010 when  the Shiller S P 500 PE was 19 91 still indicating overvaluation  However  it is interesting to note that earnings forecasts for both 2008 and 2009 ended up being lower than the actual results  Then on November 2  2010   suggesting that the S P 500 should reach 1254 by year end based on estimated earnings  the Shiller S P 500 PE was 21 69 continuing to say that the market was overvalued  When I published  the Shiller S P 500 PE of 22 39 was still indicating overvaluation  But as actual earnings were higher  the S P 500 target of 1254 was reached  By January 9  2011   when the Shiller S P 500 PE 22 97 continued to suggest overvaluation even though the Index continued to make above average returns for those investors with the foresight to focus on actual earnings rather than a statistical representation  When I  the Shiller S P 500 PE of 23 05 continued to relentlessly suggest overvaluation  Nevertheless  the market has advanced approximately another 10   from 1333 to 1472  since that time  Yet all of the gains were achieved during times when the Shiller PE was suggesting that stocks were overvalued  Since the beginning of 2010 when the first article I cited above on the valuation of the S P 500 was published  the S P 500 has produced a compounded annualized rate of return of 11 6   including dividends   while all the while  the Shiller PE was screaming overvaluation  In contrast  the valuation based on the actual earnings of the S P 500 suggested reasonable valuation  The following performance results since December 31  2009 illustrate what investors  afraid of owning common stocks  missed out on  This is why I prefer decisions based on facts over decisions based on artificial constructs and mere statistical representations such as CAPE  Perhaps if you keep yelling that the sky is falling long enough  it may one day occur  However  where I sit  it appears that that may be a long way off  Therefore  I much prefer serious analysis based on the facts that I do some hypothetical estimation based on what can be very misleading statistics A Fair and Balanced ViewHowever  and in order to be fair and balanced with this article  the following F A S T  Graphs  looks at the S P 500 since January 1  2009 when the Shiller PE ratio was at 15 17 indicating undervaluation  From this picture  it is clear that both real operating earnings and the CAPE  Shiller s Cyclically Adjusted PE  both indicated fair value  However  it s important to recognize that this was a time when the S P 500 s earnings had actually fallen from  87 72 in calendar year 2006 to  49 51 by 2008  In other words  the Shiller CAPE was accurate because it was measured at a time when S P 500 earnings had fallen for two consecutive years in a row  and just prior to strong S P 500 accelerating earnings growth coming off of the low base  Consequently  the S P 500 performance when the Shiller PE ratio was at 15 17  indicating a solid buy  was exceptional  However  it was also during a time when the S P 500 was moderately overvalued based on actual earnings  and just prior to the strong earnings advance previously mentioned and illustrated A Few Words About Specifics Versus GeneralitiesAs I indicated in my opening remarks  I prefer analyzing individual companies over attempting to forecast the earnings of a broad market like the S P 500  One of my primary reasons for believing this is that my research has suggested that in every market  whether bull or bear  there can always be found overpriced  underpriced or fairly priced individual selections among the group  Therefore  I believe in making specific decisions rather than general ones Since a picture is worth 1000 words  I am going to present earnings and price correlated graphs on the following three well known S P 500 stocks to illustrate my point  I will let the graphs speak for themselves and offer only this brief explanation  When the price is above the orange earnings justified valuation line  the stock is overvalued  when below the line  undervalued  and when on the line  or very close to it   fairly valued  Therefore  I offer Home Depot  HD  as an overvalued S P 500 company  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  as a fairly valued example  and finally Aflac  AFL  as an undervalued company Summary  With a blended PE ratio of 15  I believe the S P 500 is fairly valued based on real current and near forecast earnings  My optimism rests on the idea that the world economy is improving coming out of the great recession  and that we will soon see significant productivity enhancements as the deployment phase of the information revolution comes into high gear  Moreover  I believe that high profile blue chip publicly traded US companies are well positioned for profitable long term growth  The great recession of 2008 forced many of them to take long hard looks at their balance sheets and P L s  As a result  I believe corporate America is leaner and meaner  so to speak  than they have been in a long time  Consequently  productivity enhancements should feed their bottom lines  In their October 5  2012 edition  Trends Magazine published an article titled  The Truth About Stocks   A few select excerpts from the article both summarize and highlight my optimistic views  On the Market s Long term Record  Since 1912  the inflation adjusted total return for investments in common stocks has averaged 6 6 percent per year  compounded  That s 100 years of solid performance despite numerous surges and crashes   Any way you slice it  it s an impressive record  But  after more than 12 years of minimal price appreciation and weak dividend performance  many investors find themselves asking the question   Will we ever see 6 6 percent average annual returns again   On Future Earnings Growth  As soon as 2014  we ll begin to see rapid economic growth return  the exact timing will depend on policy factors that are hard to predict  Houses will begin to move  demand for autos will grow  and sales will pick up in retail stores  As a result  corporate profits will grow at a renewed pace  which will drive up stock prices  As long as long term interest rates move up  improved investor confidence will eliminate much of the pervasive  worry deficit  that s held down  relative P E ratios  for a decade  Another factor contributing to equity returns will be demographics  Domestically  solid birth rates plus immigration will create demand for more goods and services  Although it s true that Europe and Japan will remain stagnant due in large measure to aging and declining populations  this will be more than offset by The  30 Trillion a Year Opportunity of 2025 discussed later in this issue   On the Sources of Growth  Second  in the coming decade  total returns on stocks should actually exceed historic norms  as the Deployment phase of the global Information Revolution takes off  This phase will drive the biggest boom in world history  providing the  productivity miracle  Bill Gross could evidently not imagine happening  This boom will materialize for a number of reasons  Here are a few  This is the first time that over 5 billion people living in the developed world will take part in this type of revolution  previous revolutions have been limited to the developed world   New technologies will make low cost energy available in enormous quantities   The combination of infotech  biotech and nanotech will dramatically increase the amount of GDP that can be produced per unit of matter and energy  eliminating much of the traditional drag created by resource shortages   Increasingly  the most valuable resource will become information  which can be made available to almost anyone  anywhere  at any time for free once it is created    The bottom line to my thesis is that I expect future earnings of the S P 500 to be higher than they are today  not lower  as the Shiller PE would want you to believe  On an absolute basis  in other words  on actual current earnings  I believe the S P 500 is fairly priced  In my experience  when the markets in general are fairly priced  it is easier to find fairly priced individual selections than it would be if the market were truly overvalued  Furthermore  like all markets there are overpriced stocks in the general market  I shared an example with Home Depot above  Nevertheless  there is plenty of value to be found for the discerning investor willing to dig deep enough  Conclusions I believe there is no substitute for making intelligent decisions based on factual information  Having an intelligent framework with which to make investing decisions can eliminate mistakes that are too often made when emotion is overtaking reason  Within this process  I believe it s important to recognize that over the vast majority of the time  positives outweigh negative  Therefore  it s important to realize that negative economic cycles such as recessions only come rarely  and usually end rather quickly  So  I suggest that instead of being traumatized and frightened away  it s worth considering that the best times to be looking at equities is when times are tough  Because  it is during these times when great businesses go on sale

140747,362262,AFL,Dividend Champions a Rare Undervalued Opportunity,opinion,We believe that based on earnings  2012 is starting out with the stock market undervalued  We believe in the long term ownership of great businesses purchased at sound and attractive valuations  Consequently  we view the stock market as merely the store that we shop at in order to buy the businesses we want to own Furthermore  we do not rely on the market to set the price at which we are willing to buy or sell  Instead  we prefer to calculate the intrinsic value of the business based on the company s earnings power  If the market price is at or below that level of valuation we will be a buyer  if not  we either look elsewhere or patiently wait for the True Worth  valuation to manifest Conversely  if the market significantly overprices a company  even one that we like very much  we will sell to avoid long term risk  Based on years of research and reviewing the earnings and price relationship on thousands of companies  we are confident that the proper value will inevitably be applied to a business by the market  it s only a matter of time Shares of stock represent ownership in the business  In the long run  business success and shareholder returns will inevitably correlate  However  it is also an undeniable fact that the stock market can and will temporarily either over price or under price a business  And  it is also an undeniable fact that a company  business  derives its true value from its earnings power  in other words  the amount of cash flow it is capable of generating on its shareholders  behalf Therefore  contrary to what many people are willing to accept  is the indisputable reality that the business results of the company behind the common stock you own is far more important to wealth creation  than what the stock market may be mispricing it at over a short period of time Mispricing happens when emotions erode rational thinking thereby manifesting either greed or fear  It is important that investors maintain a reasoned and rational approach and avoid the emotional response at all costs When reviewing the broader stock market in the context of market price versus intrinsic value  we emphatically state that the stock market is significantly undervaluing many best of breed American corporations  We believe this is primarily due to extreme pessimism that has been promulgated by the masters of the media Currently  when you review America s best of breed companies from the perspective of operating results  i e   earnings power  you will discover that in the aggregate  there are a large number of businesses that have performed extremely well in calendar year 2011 Stated more simply  there are numerous businesses that grew at above average rates during 2011  but alas  the stock market did not reward that growth according to what it should have  Therefore  based on price action  many of America s best businesses had a down year  However  when you measure earnings power  the same companies generated significant business growth  In time  we contend that it is inevitable that these fine businesses will be rewarded according to their business achievements  Once again  it s only a matter of time Even more importantly  we further contend that best of breed companies trading at such unrealistically low valuations  at least in our opinion  offer the best combination of low risk and future growth possible  The opportunity to invest in and own best of breed companies trading at unjustified low valuations is very rare  Common sense would dictate that it can only come when pessimism about our future is at its lowest Furthermore  we are also very confident that the majority of these companies are going to continue to generate above average future earnings growth  As a result  we see a potential double barreled explosion in the future stock price of many of these fine businesses First  we expect a PE expansion as the market inevitably values these companies at more normal PE ratios  Second  we expect that the majority of these companies will continue to grow their businesses  earnings  at above average rates over the next several years The combination of these two factors could generate significant future rewards at low levels of risk  We feel that risk is reduced when valuations are too low to be reasonable  and could be reduced further with the proper level of diversification The Case for a Positive View of StocksThe following list is comprised of Dividend Champion companies that are trading at historically low PE ratios based almost exclusively on negative investor sentiment  Our list is comprised exclusively from David Fish s current list of 102 Dividend Champions  companies that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years  Amazingly  of the 102 names on this list  43 of them were available at below normal  and therefore we feel  attractive valuations To be clear  there were another 45 or so names out of the 102 Dividend Champions that could have been included based on reasonable or fair valuation  Names like McCormick   Co   MKC   McDonald s Corp   MCD   Hormel Foods Corp   HRL   Sherwin Williams Co   SHW   and RPM International  RPM  represent just a few of the high profile names that were excluded due to our strictest definition of intrinsic value  In other words  these names were not necessarily overvalued but just fully valued  Of the entire Dividend Champions list  we only rejected five that we considered either excessively overvalued or poor investments based on weak fundamentals 43 Dividend Champions On SaleWe have organized this list in order from the highest five year estimated annual total return to the lowest  based on the combination of consensus analyst estimates for growth and valuation  The first four columns in the table compare the current PE to the historically normal 15 year PE and the 15 year historical EPS growth rate to the 5 year estimated EPS growth rate  Then the current dividend yield is listed  and finally  the 5 year estimated annual total return calculation  The 5 year estimated annual total return is a calculation based on the company achieving the estimated EPS growth rate and then the stock trading at its earnings justified valuation More Reasons to be Positive About the MarketOn top of low valuations  there are additional insights supporting a positive view for our economy and the stock market  John Bodnar  a financial planner registered investment advisor in Florham Park  New Jersey  sent a letter to his clients  and with his permission we offer a few excerpts  What fascinated us was the following paragraph referencing an article in TIME magazine in 1992 that is eerily similar to even almost identical to the doom and gloom promoted by the media today  The U S  economy remains almost comatose  the economy is staggering under many structural burdens  as opposed to familiar cyclical problems  The structural faults represent once in a lifetime dislocations that will take years to work out  Among them  job drought  debt hangover  the banking collapse  the real estate depression  the healthcare cost explosion  and the runaway federal deficit  All of these worries  which reflect almost perfectly the exact worries we face today  were offered by TIME magazine just prior to one of the longest and strongest stock market advances in recorded history   1992 to 2007  Similarly  with stock valuations as they are today  we believe that we are sitting on the threshold of extraordinary future returns from owning high quality common stocks that can be bought at such low valuations  Billions upon billions of dollars have been fleeing the stock market as panicked investors seek the refuge of so called safer alternatives such as bonds and other fixed income instruments However  we would caution you that interest rates are currently at all time lows which imply that the future price of bonds could be just as volatile and fall just as far as stock prices did in 2008 when interest rates return to more normal levels  Moreover  the rates on these so called safer investments are so low today as to almost guarantee the potential for loss given any level of future inflation It is comforting to know that we are not alone regarding a positive view of the future  Most of us have heard or read Warren Buffett s famous refrain   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  With stock market fears at such a heightened state  and with billions of dollars on the sideline  it only seems logical that investors faced with few alternative viable choices for an adequate return at reasonable risk levels might someday soon become once again attracted to blue chip stocks This would especially apply to blue chip dividend paying stocks with long histories of increasing their dividends every year  As the list above depicted  there are so many blue chip names like Procter   Gamble  PG   PepsiCo  PEP   Abbott Labs  ABT   Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Medtronic  MDT   and others that offer an attractive and growing dividend rate  that can be bought today at historically low values The following excerpt from the concluding remarks from John Bodnar s piece referenced above summarizes our views  Ready to wrap this up  Let s return to the 1992 Time cover story  Sounds eerily like the headlines we read today  And yet  the decade of the 1990s turned out to be a boom for investors  Odd considering all the negative headwinds reported in the Time article  I suggest we resurrect the American spirit and align ourselves with the economic realities instead of the political headlines  American businesses are doing well  They are well capitalized  sitting on loads of cash  increasing their dividends  and buying back their own stock  It is a great time to be an investor in some of the greatest companies in the world   Significant market bottoms  when they finally occur  have less to do with fundamental economic and financial shifts than with crescendos of public panic  On this you can rely  the stock market remains an exceptionally efficient mechanism for the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient   A link to an article we posted on our blog includes John Bodner s entire letter can be Low Valuation  A Significant Long term OpportunityWe remain very frustrated by the low  and what we consider to be ridiculous  valuations that the market is applying to many great businesses  It is inconceivable to us that strongly above average franchise names such as Hewlett Packard  HPQ   Aflac  AFL   or Teva  TEVA   the world s leading generic pharmaceutical company  could be trading at single digit PE ratios when the more than 150 year old historical normal PE ratio for the S P 500 has been 15  as it is today To be clear  many average companies with significantly lesser earnings power are trading at earnings multiples approaching 2 to 3 times greater than many above average companies are trading at  This makes no logical sense  and therefore  we believe it represents a rare and significant opportunity for those investors with the foresight to consider earnings power over what is often a very fickle stock market  We believe that these low prices simply mean that many stocks are currently illiquid  and not that they are poor or bad investments  In this context  we are suggesting they are illiquid because they cannot be currently sold for what they are truly worth based on fundamentals  Selling a stock  or any asset for that matter  for less than it is worth is not a wise decision  in our opinion Three High Profile Examples of Extreme UndervaluationNotice how the black monthly closing stock price lines are uncharacteristically and significantly below the orange earnings justified valuation line on the following earnings and price correlated  This vividly illustrates how undervalued these companies really are AFLAC Inc   AFL TEVA Pharmaceutical  TEVA The above are just three examples of many that we could show ConclusionsTo be fair  many undervalued holdings have experienced moderate to even minor issues that spooked investors  After being traumatized by the 2008 market crash  investors remain fearful  Therefore  even the slightest bit of negative news can result in panic  even when it s mostly unjustified  We believe the reactions with the three examples featured in this article have been extreme  Consequently  we further believe that the opportunity that these reactions have created represent an incredible long term opportunity  The above emotional reactions do not reflect the fundamental strengths and future potential of those fine businesses Speculating in the stock market can be fraught with risk  At any moment in time the market can become disconnected from economic reality  We believe the key is not to react to market volatility  and we have certainly had lots of that recently  If you invested in a business that you like  and the business continues to perform well as an operating entity  short term market variations should mean little to you  After all  if you were not planning to sell your investment today why should you care what someone is willing to offer you  This especially applies to dividend growth investors that have invested in businesses that they believe can continue to provide them a growing income stream Disclosure  Long MKC  MCD  AFL  ITW  WAG  MDT  ABT  BCR  SYY  MHP  JNJ  PG  KMB  PEP  GPC at the time

140749,362264,AFL,Stock Prices And The Fundamentals  Don t Be Fooled,opinion,As stock prices made new highs this past week  a frequent media theme was that this was happening     drum roll          in spite of the fundamentals  If you listened to the accompanying discussion  you eventually learned what was meant by  fundamentals   For many observers it is some kind of unquantifiable headline risk  As long as there is something to worry about  something to call a  headwind   then this viewpoint means that  the fundamentals are bad   The parade of pundits warns that you should make sure that all of these risks have been resolved before investing  Don t hold your breath waiting for that  The big reason that traders are missing the rally is that they mis define  fundamentals   Comparing to the 2008 Highs I lost count of the stories saying that we were back to the 2008 highs  Danger  The idea seems to be that we all remember what happened then  so watch out  We also have triple tops and the like   Whatever happened to the Death Cross and the Hindenberg Omen   So I did some checking  May of 2008  Forward earnings on the S P 500 then were 93 77  the ten year yield was 3 9  and the odds of a recession    according to the best method    were nearly 100  Now  Forward earnings are 108  the ten year yield is 1 59  and the recession odds for the next year are below 10   People talk about headlines and sling around phrases like Draghi put  printing money  etc   instead of analyzing data  The world is a much better place for investing than it was in 2008   This is not a political blog  and the comparison to four years ago relates to the market  not the election cycle  I am well aware that the mileage has varied for many people  Most folks do not have significant stock holdings  At  A Dash  we aim to engage in successful investing no matter who is in power   The Failure of Static Analysis The bogus fundamentals of the  headwinds pundits  never change  They can always complain that there is too much debt and too much government  They are basically in denial about the power of government and central banks  Put aside your political viewpoint  Go ahead and cheer when Rick Santelli tells you that this is all a  sugar high  but put emotions aside when investing  Meanwhile  Rick is not a candidate to get on the FOMC    nor is Ron Paul  Furthermore  if Romney is elected we will see someone who shares the Bernanke philosophy  But that is a subject for another day  Your assessment of the fundamentals should change with events  represented by actual data  If you do not have your head in the sand  you are watching the events in Europe  On Thursday  the Spanish 10 year yield is down to 6 02   down 59 bps  This is important for the ability to refinance debt  and much lower than the touted  danger zone  of 7   On Friday  Italian 10 year yield now 5 02   Spain at 5 57   down another 39 bps  This is not the point of the curve where the ECB proposes to buy  This is market data  confirming what I have been telling investors for nearly a year with the decline in the St  Louis Financial Stress Index  If you are following the data  you know that the world is a better place for investors now than it was a week ago  It is much better than it was four years ago  The fear premium in the market is still very high  I know that many investors  mistakenly  think that it is too late to buy stocks since we are at the old highs  This article is for you   Last year how to use data to evaluate fundamentals  Here is a brief quote covering one topic  but I invite you to read the entire article  where I cover valuation  risk  and potential  I use the one year forward earnings from the  bottoms up  estimate from Thomson Reuters  Many critics take the inconsistent position that forward earnings are too optimistic  but explain the typical 70  beat rate by saying that estimates are guided down  I have  and  I maintain that there is a point where forward estimates by bottoms up analysts are quite useful    the best we can do  That point is approximately one year ahead  I continue to invite any loyalist for another method    particularly those espoused by Hussman or Shiller    to show that they can predict earnings one year in advance with greater precision  With this in mind  the  Jackson Hole  forward earnings yield was 8 31  and it has declined to 7 74  now  When compared to the ten year yield  interest rates in the table  the risk premium was a huge 5 75  last Fall and is still 4 61   On a long term basis this is a juicy premium unless risk is huge  Conclusion All of the metrics are better now than they were at the prior market top  This is why stock prices increase over time     the fundamentals  defined correctly  get better  If I had to pick one stock right now that reflects the changes  it would be Aflac  AFL   The earnings and dividends are great  The valuation is low because of excessive fear about Europe  where the company has invested insurance premiums  Cyclical stocks like CAT are great and I still like tech stocks like ORCL  There are many names consistent with this theme  These stocks have bounced

140750,362265,AFL,Aflac  Rather Stable In 2012 Q4 ,opinion,Here we revisit our stock price model for Aflac Incorporated  AFL   This model was first estimates in March 2011 and has been several times re estimated with new data  Currently  we have the closing monthly price for October 2012 and the consumer price indices for September 2012  We decompose a share price into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  This allows linking any share price with relative pricing power of goods and services associated with the company  Accordingly  our goal is to test the original model and to update time lags and coefficients  Overall  the model has demonstrated an excellent predictive power and stability over the whole period since 2011  It can predict at a two month horizon and the current prediction foresees no significant changes in the AFL price in November December 2012   As in all previous models  the AFL share price is defined by the consumer price index of household furnishing and operations  HFO  and that transportation services  TS   In February 2012  the defining time lags were as follows  the HFO index led the share price by 1 month and the TS by 6 months  but in the current model the first lag in two months  Five relevant best fit models for AFL t  are as follows   AFL t     5 02HFO t 2    2 87TS t 6    20 42 t 1990    997 71  March 2011  AFL t     4 63HFO t 0    2 90TS t 5    20 41 t 1990    953 49  September 2011  AFL t     4 63HFO t 1    2 87TS t 6    20 23 t 1990    948 72  December 2011  AFL t     4 65HFO t 1    2 86TS t 6    20 20 t 1990    949 35  February 2012  AFL t     4 43HFO t 2    2 71TS t 6    19 10 t 2000    1094 64  September 2012  where AFL t  is the AFL share price in U S  dollars  t is calendar time   In March 2012  we predicted that the price would likely not change much in 2012Q1 and it stayed around  45  Figure 1 confirms our prediction  It depicts the high and low monthly prices for an AFL share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  adjusted for dividends and splits   The model residual error   3 84 for the period between July 2003 and September 2012  is depicted in Figure 2   We do not see any large change in the price in November December 2012 and will revisit the model in January for a new forecast ,2012-11-11,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac:-rather-stable-in-2012-q4-143091,143091
140762,362277,AFL,Aflac s  AFL  Fair Value PE Ratio Should Be Double  and So Should Its Price,opinion,"This is the third in a series of articles that have been designed to provide investors greater insights into the proper understanding and utilization of the PE ratio as a valuation measurement tool  With this iteration we re going to look at Aflac  AFL  as our example for using the PE ratio to identify significant undervaluation   The first article in this series looked at Amazon  AMZN  as an example of overvaluation  Our second article looked at SCANA Corp   SCG  and Darden Restaurant Group  DRI  as examples of fairly valued companies  however  we further introduced the concept of the earnings growth rate as a relative component of future return For clarification  this article and the two previously mentioned are written in order to provide deeper insights and a greater understanding of the PE ratio as an investment tool   Additionally  they are also focused on the proper utilization of the PE ratio as a valuation metric  In that vein  these articles are not offered as in depth analysis of the respective companies being discussed   Instead  these articles are offered as intellectual exercises that reveal the mathematical investing principles and realities that the PE ratio is reflecting  assuming that the estimates and assumptions are correct  Therefore  we ask that the reader accept that the estimates being used are accurate or at least within a reasonable range of probability  In other words  we want the reader to understand the relevance of the PE ratio and its application relative to an accurate assessment of past  present and future earnings growth The PE Ratio  Proper PerspectivesIn order to accomplish this goal we are going to properly utilize the PE ratio as a relative measuring stick   As previously pointed out in the first two articles in this series  looking at the PE ratio in a vacuum is an ineffective and mostly irrelevant way to use it   The PE ratio only brings value to security analysis when it is applied and looked at relative to the past  present and future earnings power of the company or companies being analyzed  The PE ratio is a measurement of current valuation in the static sense  but it is a more relevant measurement of valuation when looked at dynamically relative to the future growth potential of the underlying business  earnings growth   Because only when the future growth of the business is correctly ascertained does the PE ratio draw a true picture of valuation The PE Ratio DefinedIn our first article in this series we provided three extensive definitions and explanations of the PE ratio   Here is a link to that article for those interested in digging a little deeper into the definitional side of the PE ratio   In our second article  and repeated here  we offer three condensed versions of our PE ratio definitions 
The simplest definition of the PE ratio is the mathematical formula  PE   Price divided by Earnings 
This second definition relates to the PE ratio as a measurement of the cost of earnings  PE  How many dollars you must pay to buy one dollar s worth of a company s earnings 
This final definition relates the PE ratio to the time use of money  PE   How many years in advance you are paying for this year s earnings  
Aflac Inc   AFL   The Thesis for GrowthHowever  for those who are interested in Aflac as a current investment idea  we direct you to our previous article that provided a comprehensive dissertation on Aflac by an independent third party   Here is a link to that article   note that the discussion of Aflac is deep into the article   Additionally  the following excerpts from Zacks Investment Research dated October 27  2011  and one from The Value Line Investment Survey dated October 14  2011  provide additional third party corroborations for future earnings growth Excerpt from Zacks Investment Research Dated October 27  2011  V aluation  Aflac has historically traded at a premium valuation to other health insurers  reflecting its higher growth prospects  consistent earnings record  superior ROE and strong financial position   Over the years  the company has been significantly focusing on strengthening its insurance operations through successful product launches and expansion of its distribution system   Moreover  AFLAC has strong earnings potential in 2011 and beyond  which will help in mitigating risk related to the constitutional capital  while also enhancing the company statutory earnings   Hence  we expect some upward potential pressure on the performance of the stock in the medium to long term once the global economy rebounds to its historical highs  Although fundamental outlook for AFLAC remain strong  the near term outlook remains cautious due to interest and exchange rate fluctuations  investment in hybrid securities  catastrophe losses  low payroll accounts  rating downgrades and volatile economic cues  Therefore  we are maintaining our recommendation on Affleck at neutral  waiting to clear the smog around stock  Excerpt from Value Line Investment Survey Dated October 14  2001 These neutrally ranked shares have above average long term capital appreciation potential  We think that AFL s recent price reflects renewed fears of large asset write offs   But business in Japan should grow as that country further restricts free healthcare services   And in the US  AFLAC s customers account for well under 20  of its target small to midsized business market Sigourney B  Romaine October 14  2011 Aflac  AFL  Trading at Half its True WorthThe following 15 year historical earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly shows that the market has traditionally provided a modest valuation premium on Aflac s shares relative to its earnings justified valuation line  the orange line   Aflac has achieved a consistent above average earnings growth rate of 17 1   Therefore  since calendar year 1997  and up through calendar year 2008  Mr  Market applied a normal PE ratio of 18 6 on Aflac s shares   However  the great recession of 2008 changed all that  yet  even after earnings have rebounded strongly in years 2009  2010 and expected to continue for 2011  Mr  Market stubbornly applies a current PE ratio that is less than half its historical norm  See Red Circle on Graph  

Even when considering today s significant undervaluation of Aflac s shares  their long term shareholders have been handsomely rewarded in excess of the general market as measured by the S P 500  Aflac is a Dividend Champion  and on October 26  2011 the Board of Directors of Aflac announced a 10  dividend increase marking their 29th consecutive year of dividend increases  The dividend cash flow table on the performance graph below illustrates how powerful Aflac s growth yield   yield on cost  has historically been  See Purple Circle  

Aflac  AFL   Interpreting the Estimated Earnings and Return CalculatorThe F A S T  Graphs estimated earnings and return calculator is designed to offer short  intermediate and long term estimates of a company s earnings growth potential   The graph contains one year of historical price correlated to earnings  then an actual forecast number for the current year  note that since there only two months left in the current year this forecast is  more likely than not  to be very accurate   Then the actual consensus forecast for the next year s earnings is plugged in  and then from that point  future earnings are grown by the five year consensus estimated earnings growth rate Therefore  in our Aflac example we show earnings of  6 37 for calendar fiscal year 2011  followed by  6 60 for calendar fiscal year 2012 which represents approximately a 5  growth rate  From this point  future earnings are compounded at the 9  consensus estimate by 20 analysts reporting to Capital IQ  Although these are analyst s estimates  we also want to point out that these numbers are consistent with the guidance that Aflac s management has provided   The following excerpt from an Aflac s press release on October 26  2011 presented management s guidance that coincides with our forecast graph  With three quarters of the year complete  we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance  Throughout the year  both Aflac Japan and Aflac U S  have continued to do a very good job managing our operations  including expense control  As we have stated previously  our expectation was to increase spending in the last half of the year  particularly on marketing and IT initiatives in the fourth quarter  Despite our expectation for higher spending in the fourth quarter  I am confident we will achieve our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8   excluding the impact of the yen  If the yen averages 75 to 80 to the dollar for the last three months of the year  we would expect reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter to be in the range of  1 45 to  1 52 per diluted share  Under that exchange rate assumption  we would expect full year operating earnings of  6 30 to  6 37 per diluted share  Looking ahead  I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2  to 5  on a currency neutral basis  Furthermore  once the effects of our proactive investment derisking program and low interest rates have been integrated into our financial results  we believe the rate of earnings growth in future years should improve  Remember that the reader is asked to assume that these estimates are accurate for the purposes of this article  However  as an interesting aside  the consensus of leading analysts reporting to Zacks expect Aflac to grow earnings at 10 5   and Zacks itself forecasts 11  growth  while the Value Line Investment Survey forecasts earnings growth of 13    Consequently  a strong case can be made that the forecasts on the following graphs are conservative representations for Aflac s future earnings growth  Once again  assuming that they are  this implies a potential five year estimated annualized total return of 25 9   See Brown Circle on Top of Graph    Of course  this also assumes that Aflac meets our targeted estimates  and that the market applies a normal PE of 15  or twice what it currently applies 

The following EYE  earnings yield estimates  table mathematically articulates how undervalued Aflac s stock really is   At today s valuation  Aflac offers an earnings yield of 14  and a 5 year future earnings yield over 20     Note the brown cell on the table coincides with the five year estimated earnings growth   Applying a stock market normal PE ratio of 15 implies extremely attractive long term share price appreciation potential as depicted by the white column titled Target PRC Est Tot Ret  Furthermore  note that the blue dividend columns and the green earnings columns reflect returns in excess of the riskless 10 year Treasury bond for all years 

Final Perspectives on AflacWhen properly utilizing the PE ratio to evaluate our Aflac example  today s current blended price earnings ratio of 7 4 makes no logical sense  The only way it could make sense would be if future earnings were expected to be significantly lower than they are today  not greater as consensus now expects  Yet  since Aflac s historical record and the expectations for its future record are both strong and above average  the rational thinker must assume extreme undervaluation is present today   To state this as clearly as possible  we believe that a fair value PE ratio for Aflac  AFL  should be at least 15  which suggests that the price should be double what it currently is trading at  Furthermore  the rational thinker would also logically assume that there exists a significant opportunity for a price earnings ratio expansion in the future   Growing earnings and the rational expectation of PE expansion augurs extremely well for significantly above average future long term returns   Moreover  today s extreme low valuation also implies a lower than historical normal level of risk As Warren Buffett has said   Investing is most intelligent when it is most business like   And the future business prospects for Aflac appear very promising  Consequently  we believe that all Aflac shareholders need to do today is exercise a little bit of intelligent patience and the rewards should be great and the risks manageable to low Concluding Remarks on the Proper Use of the PE RatioThis concludes the series of articles on the PE ratio and its significance as an investor s tool for making sound valuation judgments   It s important to add that the perspectives on the PE ratio that this series of articles has addressed are primarily relevant to long term investing  The PE ratio at its core deals with measuring the value of a company s earnings   Therefore  it is more of a business valuation tool than it is a stock market trading vehicle   Therefore  it is also implied that the principles underpinning the PE ratio s relevance take time to manifest   When dealing with ascertaining the proper valuation of a business  it s only appropriate to conduct this measurement as it pertains to a normal business cycle  3 to 5 years  Furthermore  it s also important that the reader recognizes that a stock can be overvalued and still go higher  and conversely  become undervalued and still go lower   Therefore  understanding when a PE ratio represents fair valuation is not necessarily a perfect market timing tool   Instead  it is a valuable measurement when used and looked at properly that can alert the investor to precisely recognize the time when markets may begin mispricing a stock  over or under  Therefore  one of the greatest values that the proper understanding of the PE ratio offers investors is the ability to recognize the level of risk they are taking based on fundamentals when making buy  sell or hold decisions   What the investor does with this information is up to them  but at least their decisions are being made with the clear understanding of the risk levels they are assuming   When used properly  the PE ratio is an important and beneficial measuring tool for the prudent stock investor Disclosure   Long AFL at the time of writing ",2011-11-08,Chuck Carnevale,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/aflac’s-(afl)-fair-value-pe-ratio-should-be-double,-and-so-should-its-price-105061",105061
