6299,227814,COKE,Week Ahead  Bullish Dow  USD Set To Climb Higher  Gold Lower,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
The Week That Was
Dow s Bullish Hat Trick
The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn t just breach the 22 000 level for the first time last week  it also closed above it on Friday  finishing the week at the very highest price of the day  Each of these benchmarks on their own would demonstrate investor confidence  but all three together represent exceptional bullishness 
While Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  Q3 results propelled it higher by 5 percent up  leading the Dow upward  the historically low borrowing costs currently in effect prop up otherwise inflated wages  However  the perhaps the single biggest boost for multinationals has come from the weak dollar  increasing revenues   as with Apple 
Earnings Season Wrap Up
While the S P 500 has been beating the 8 percent growth expectation during this current earnings season  coming in stronger at 10 percent  non US markets have been doing even better  Earnings results in Europe and Emerging Markets reflect both decisive economic growth and lower valuations  providing more robust opportunities for multi asset portfolios  Japan  for example  is set to see an earnings boost of 25 percent 
December Rate Hike  Rising Potential
The July employment report was solid  209 000 jobs were created  beating the 180 000 consensus expectation  even the June number was revised higher to 231 000 from 222 000  This is the one area of the US economy which has continued to be a source of strength  relative to mediocre 2 percent economic growth 
However  the big market mystery remains  why is there a strong labor market but no inflationary pressure  This fosters investor doubts the Fed can pull off another rate hike this year 
Though the unemployment rate dipped even lower  to 4 3 percent  the most interesting and closely watched portion of the data release were the wage inflation statistics  For the first time in months  a bit of strength began to infuse the US wage growth numbers in the US  On an annual basis  we re still only at 2 5 percent  but on a MoM basis although it s been a crawl at least it s in the right direction 
In May it was 0 1 percent  in June 0 2 percent and in July 0 3 percent  Still  the solid NFP read raised bets from 46 percent to 50 percent for a December hike  However  should wage growth continue to rise  investors might be more convinced of a December rate hike

Disney  NYSE DIS  reports Q3 2017 earnings after the close  Consensus expectations are for EPS of  1 53  vs YoY  1 62 on  14 60B in revenue 
Analysts expect Disney s profits to have fallen in the latest quarter  after its shares have been up 3 percent this year  far less than 10 7 percent gains seen in the S P 500  It is not your parents  favorite cartoon company  at least not anymore  Focus now is on an increasing cord cutting  along with costs for broadcasting rights 

Disney s share price has been unable to overcome the  120 level since August 2015  It has just failed for the fifth time since then  This prevalence of selling suggests first a retesting of the July  103 low  and then the  90 low since 2015 
Coca Cola Bottling Co Consolidated  NASDAQ COKE  reports after the US close 

The price has been trading within an ascending channel since November 9  2016  the day of the US election results  It had formed consolidation during June  which it has broken out of during July  On July 27  it had formed a powerfully bearish shooting star  with no lower shadow and whose upper shadow is several times bigger than its body  This shows how far down bears have pushed the bulls  advance  The June consolidation has been providing support though  which is why it hadn t yet declined toward the channel bottom of  230  However  a close beneath  235 would suggest just that 
Wednesday
10 30  US   EIA Crude Inventories  w e 4 August   expected to fall by 1 5 million barrels  in line with the previous week  Markets to watch  Brent  WTI

Unlike WTI which doesn t have a shorter term downtrend line it has surpassed the price of Brent s lowering peaks since April plotted a steeper downtrend line  which was overcome on July 28  Since then the price  as with WTI  has been consolidating  in what may prove to be a continuation pennant  following the sharp 10 percent rise since July 24  The 200 dma  in the center of the pennant demonstrates the importance of this price level and pattern  The original downtrend since January 3 would be the next resistance at  54

4 30  UK   Manufacturing Production  MoM   June   Forecast sees it rise to 0 0 percent from a previous reading of   2 percent  Market to watch  GBP crosses
4 30  UK   Trade Balance  June   previous reading was a deficit of  3 billion  Market to watch  GBP crosses

The pound has been in an uptrend since the October Asia flash crash  It has overcome its December downtrend  creating a potential bottom with a 1 400 pip reversal 
The May high of 1 3040 correction ended on June 21 with a 1 2688 low  confirming the support of the pattern  Since then the price of the pair advanced with a rising but narrowing channel  suggesting a possible bearish wedge  which it is currently testing  with a close beneath the uptrend line 
Notice the red dotted line signaling the current price level  It is right above the May high  which is acting as a support  The leading momentum RSI already provided a decisive downside break pointing the way for the price to follow  The MACD is about to cross below  as well 
Notice how while the 50 dma  green  is protecting the rising channel since June  while the 200 dma  red  is protecting the reversal pattern s support  The 100 dma  orange  is naturally in between the two  While it has to close beneath the May high price  the close beneath the potential wedge  already executed by the RSI suggests a correction 
8 30  US   Initial Jobless Claims  w e 5 Aug   PPI  July   241k expected  against a reading of 240k last month and a flat 0 1 percent expected for the PPI  Market to watch  US dollar crosses

The EUR USD has overcome its 2 5 year pattern  but was held at bay by the 200 wma  which forced the price into a bearish shooting star  with both the MACD and RSI in multi year oversold levels  For the MACD  that s been since July 2011  and for the RSI since November 2007  A correction in the form of a return move to the range line  toward 1 1400  is appropriate  with a strong 1 1500 round psychological support on the way 
10 00 PM  China   Retail Sales  July   forecast to rise 10 5  YoY from 11  a month earlier  Markets to watch  Shanghai Index  Hang Seng Index  CNY crosses

The price surpassed the November 2016 April 2017 peaks  but was forced into closing below the April close  forming a bearish shooting star on Wednesday  It also turned out to be the top of the rising channel  in itself a resistance  Sure enough  the index continued to decline in the following two days  A support awaits the composite at 3227  which was confirmed between July 20 and 28  after overcoming the June 22   July 19 consolidation

Since mid May the price has been acting as if it s forming a rounding bottom  The RSI provides such a positive divergence  rising  while the price has yet failed to do so  The price has managed to overcome the 50 dma  which is a step in the right direction  and a possible first step to an advance

Big time programs engulfed in scandal  debate surrounding the one and done rule  and the NCAA s role in enforcing amateurism are likely to remain some of the biggest storylines during the 2017 18 college basketball season  even as the regular season begins to heat up 
Still  in an era where blue chip college basketball programs  such as the University of Kentucky  Indiana  and Duke  could be worth upwards of  on the open market  the sport is seemingly more profitable than ever 
CBS and Turner   NYSE TWX   are set to spend billions of dollars on the rights to the roughly one month NCAA March Madness tournament through 2032  On top of that  major sponsors of one of the biggest U S  sporting events such as Coke   NASDAQ COKE    AT T   NYSE T    and Capital One   NYSE COF   aren t likely to leave anytime soon  And this just covers the most mainstream portion of the college hoops season 
Disney s   NYSE DIS   struggling sports media network  ESPN  is deeply invested in college basketball  The nearly five month regular season is fueled by marquee games presented by the likes of Lowe s   NYSE LOW   and sponsor laden in season tournaments tied to Progressive   NYSE PGR    Gildan   TO GIL    2K   NYSE T    and many more  Even social media powerhouse Facebook   NASDAQ FB   bought the rights to live stream college basketball this season 
Lastly  as many college basketball fans and investors already know  Nike  Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Under Armour   NYSE UAA   might be the real lifeblood of NCAA hoops

 Sure   you might be thinking   But that s just one year  Apple has still clobbered the market over just about any other timeframe  
You d be right 
But consider the bruising Apple has taken  despite its stellar brand  it s now almost 40  off its 52 week highs  Plus it plunged 10  on January 3  its biggest single day drop in six years 
Those are the kind of wipeouts you expect from a cash strapped small cap  not the world s most fawned over name 
Other big brands haven t exactly been killing it  either  Check out how McDonald s  NYSE MCD   in blue  Toyota  NYSE TM   in red  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO   in green  the top three non tech stocks on Interbrand s list  have fared since the market bottomed in  09 
S P 500  1  Big Brands  0
So what s really going on here 
In a nutshell  those product reviews you see everywhere from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to Facebook  NASDAQ FB  are giving folks more intel than ever and they re using it to zero in on products that precisely fit their needs  not just blindly grabbing the next offering from their favorite big name brand 
Apple s No Win China Play
To see what I mean  consider Apple s latest face plant in China 
Sure  the company is taking a hit from the trade war and a general slowdown in the country  But that s not the whole story  it s also being pummeled by lower priced domestic players like Huawei 
The latest numbers from research firm Counterpoint tell the tale  Huawei led the Chinese smartphone market in the third quarter  with a 23  slice  up solidly from 19  a year earlier  Vivo  the No  2 player also grew  from 19  to 21  
Apple  Its slice fell from 10  to 9   Worse  its all American brand actually works against it  setting it up as one of the first casualties if Chinese consumers decide to boycott American names should trade talks falter 
Coke Is Not It
So don t be distracted by big names like Apple  and especially its consumer staples cousin  Coca Cola  NASDAQ COKE   which has posted negative sales growth in 21 of the last 22 quarters and pays a totally unsustainable 117  of cash flow as dividends 
The trouble with Coke is that  like Apple  its brand can undermine it  reminding folks that  at heart  Coke is about sugary drinks  no matter how much it goes on about the coconut water  organic teas and other healthier fare it s been pushing out at a fever pitch 
Instead  we re going to go small and invest in the sustainable dividend growers that are eating the big guys  lunch  starting with the first of the two buys I have for you now 
Midcap Pick No  1  The Only Car Stock You Need
I don t know why you d mess around with General Motors  NYSE GM   Ford Motor  NYSE F  or Toyota  NYSE TM  when you could grab a diversified player like Penske Automotive Group  NYSE PAG   It s easily lapped the big guys since GM s came out of bankruptcy in 2010 
Dark Horse Pick Cruises to a Win
The best part is that  thanks to the pullback  you can still pick up PAG for just 8 times forward earnings very close to its all time low of 7 2  Sure  all carmakers are cyclical  but such a silly valuation gives us plenty of upside  and minimal downside  here right now 
And when I say PAG is diversified  I mean it  the company has 313 dealerships selling cars and commercial trucks in the US  Canada  Europe and New Zealand  It also owns a thriving parts business  financing arm and service operation  in addition to a 29  stake in Penske Truck Leasing 
Here s another shock absorber the big guys can t match  PAG s near even balance between new and used cars  These markets often move in different directions  and we saw that in Q3  when new car revenue slipped 4 2   but used sales surged 6 1   easily offsetting that dip and driving a nice 2 4  rise in PAG s overall revenue 
Finally  check out this dividend chart 
4 Quarters  4 Dividend Hikes
That s right  PAG is one of a handful of stocks that raises its dividend every quarter  It s done so for 30 quarters running and has boosted its payout 106  in just the last five years 
The kicker  The stock also yields a market beating 3 2  and pays out a measly 27  of cash flow as dividends  so this payout and its growth streak are safe 
Midcap Pick No  2  An Accelerating 4 1  Payout on the Cheap
Leggett   Platt  NYSE LEG  is so boring it would make the stodgiest investor s eyes water  it makes a bevy of manufactured goods  from floor underlayment to mattress springs the latter of which is its biggest segment 
When it comes to Leggett  here s the key thing you need to know  mattress sales are skyrocketing  According to Transparency Market Research  this will be a  43 billion business in 2024 54  bigger than it was in 2017 
It s also a business that s being taken over by custom mattress makers peddling their wares online  Leggett sees online mattress sales doubling in the next four to five years  which is a big reason why it just paid  1 25 billion for Elite Comfort Solutions  a maker of memory foam with a roster of online mattress sellers as customers 
Funny thing is  you d never know this by looking at Leggett s share price  which dove 23  in the past year  with almost all of that coming in the last three months 
That s turned two vital numbers in our favor  the dividend yield  which  at 4 1   is the highest it s been in more than six years  and the forward P E ratio  which is at 14 1 near all time lows baking in some nice upside while helping keep the stock from falling out of bed 
In fact  Leggett is one of a very few midcaps that s also a Dividend Aristocrat  having hiked its payout for 47 straight years  And as you can see below  these hikes have been getting bigger since 2016 
Leggett s Dividend Takes Off
My advice  Grab this ignored midcap manufacturing star now before it makes its next big move up

6336,227851,COKE,With U S  Cuba detente  a battle over trademarks looms,news,"By Jaime Hamre CAMAGUEY  Cuba  Reuters    When Julio Manzini decided two years ago to name his small restaurant McDonald s after the famous fast food chain  N MCD   he had no idea it could cause any trouble  He has since been frightened into removing the name    I don t even know what McDonald s tastes like  I just thought the name was striking  like Shakira or something   he said at the lunch counter of what used to be  Cafeteria La McDonald s Camagueyana  in the Cuban city of Camaguey  about 300 miles  500 km  east of Havana This month  Manzini stripped  McDonald s  and the famous golden arches from his handcrafted sign as a precaution after he claimed his establishment was visited by a lawyer sent by the company   The place is now simply called  Cafeteria La Camagueyana    His counterfeit McDonald s illustrates a potential battlefront between Cuba and the United States over trademark and intellectual property rights as Cuba s economy opens up to more private enterprise and closer ties with the United States  The two countries restored diplomatic relations this year after half a century of Cold War hostility and are now working to improve ties  Trademark and intellectual property issues will be on the negotiating table  both sides have said  Both have grievances  The United States has denied Cuban companies the same trademark protection enjoyed by brands from everywhere else  forcing marquee names such as Havana Club rum and Cohiba cigars into long  expensive court battles   And while Cuba protects trademarks registered with the government  it also tolerates or officially sanctions the resale of unlicensed music  software and entertainment  State television routinely pirates American movies and shows for broadcast   In a socialist economy that only in recent years has allowed small scale private businesses  knowledge of trademark law is poor  Manzini said he never thought to check with the Cuban Office of Industrial Property  OCPI  to see if the McDonald s name was available  It is not  McDonald s has registered trademarks in Cuba since at least 1985   Despite the United States  53 year old trade embargo against Cuba  companies from both countries have continued registering trademarks and patents in the other   Since 1966 about 1 500 U S  businesses have filed nearly 6 000 trademarks in Cuba  including renewals  according to data from Saegis  the online trademark database from Thomson Reuters  Among them are Coca Cola  O COKE   Pepsi  N PEP   Levi s  LEVST UL    Nike   N NKE   Starbucks Coffee  O SBUX    Pfizer   N PFE   Intel  O INTC   Burger King  KFC and Goodyear  O GT   Another 1 355 trademarks of U S  origin  including Walmart  N WMT  and Google  O GOOGL   are protected under an international treaty known as the Madrid Protocol  according to World Intellectual Property Organization data  Aside from the  special hamburgers  and  American coffee  on offer  there is little that separates Manzini s hole in the wall operation from hundreds of other snack bars tucked in doorways across the island   But he was likely violating trademark protections by using the McDonald s name and the golden arches on his sign  He said he only fully understood he could be in trouble after the lawyer visited the restaurant recently while he was away   I m really afraid  I don t even pull in 1 000 pesos   40  a day   Manzini said   McDonald s would have to complain to the OCPI to legally stop Manzini and others  such as the  McDunald  cafe in the city of Santa Clara  which also uses the golden arches on its sign  A spokeswoman for McDonald s declined to comment except to say that  we are committed to vigorously protecting our intellectual property   EXPLOSION OF INTEREST More companies have registered their brands in Cuba since U S  President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente last December  among them Twitter  N TWTR   Uber  UBER UL  and Segway   There has been an explosion of interest from U S  companies   said Jaime Angeles  an intellectual property lawyer and partner at Dominican law firm Angeles   Lugo Lovaton who represents firms fighting for their trademark rights in Cuba   Some 192 U S  trademarks were filed in Cuba in the first four months of 2015  compared to 78 in all of 2014  according to Saegis data   A few U S  companies have seen their brand names pursued by others in Cuba   Gustavo Fuentes  a Cuban lawyer residing in the United States  has applied for 65 trademarks  including famous brands such as John Deere  N DE   Chase  N JPM   the NFL and Pixar  Some companies are contesting those rights  including JetBlue Airways Corp  O JBLU   which announced plans for a New York to Havana charter five months after Fuentes asked for the name JetBlue    We will vigorously protect our brand in Cuba   spokesman Doug McGraw said   Fuentes declined to comment  The OCPI has yet to grant him any trademarks  according to its public records   Angeles  who represents eight of the U S  companies  including restaurant chain IHOP  DIN UL  and pharmaceutical company  Hospira   N HSP   said he was confident they would win the rights to their brands in Cuba    The Cuban system has all the legal tools to protect trademarks of any country   he said  adding that companies should claim their trademarks before someone else does   Filing first is the cheapest protection you can get    Cuba has long struggled to protect its marquee brands under U S  law  including one statute that aims to protect owners of Cuban companies nationalized after the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power  Bacardi  the former Cuban distiller that now makes rum in Puerto Rico  controls Havana Club in the United States after acquiring the name from its original pre revolutionary owner  Everywhere else  Cuba and its French joint venture partner   Pernod Ricard   PA PERP   control the rights to

6337,227852,COKE,Brands seek Rio gold in new advertising playing field,news,"By Liana B  Baker NEW YORK  Reuters    Dozens of major companies and specialty brands that are not official Olympics sponsors have applied to run advertising campaigns featuring athletes ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games  taking advantage of new rules that are shaking up the business of marketing surrounding the event  U S  multinationals including  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ    General Mills   N GIS    Under Armour   N UA   and Gatorade  a unit of PepsiCo Inc  N PEP   told Reuters they have applied to the U S  Olympic Committee  USOC   seeking a waiver that will allow them to compete with official Games sponsors during the Olympics in August and the Paralympics in September   Others that have applied include Austrian energy drink maker Red Bull  camera maker  GoPro Inc   O GPRO   footwear brands  Asics Corp   T 7936    Skechers USA Inc   N SKX   Brooks Running  swimsuit company Speedo  and Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  for a charitable campaign  the companies told Reuters  The applications underline how the Rio Games are set to herald a radical change for advertisers  even if viewers may not notice much difference as U S  household names such as two time gold medalist gymnast Gabby Douglas appear in commercials for everything from banks to cereal  Thanks to a rule change by the International Olympic Committee  IOC  after years of lobbying by athletes  official Olympic sponsors will have to share the big names with brands that have paid nothing to the IOC or a National Olympic Committee such as the USOC  Companies running these campaigns will have to operate under detailed restrictions aimed at retaining some exclusivity for official sponsors such as Coca Cola  O COKE   Visa  N V  and McDonald s Corp  N MCD   Still  the change to the IOC s  Rule 40  could have a big impact on the multi billion dollar marketing engine that drives the Games  said Frank Ryan  head of intellectual property at DLA Piper  a law firm that has worked on sponsorship deals with the IOC and the USOC   If  Rule 40  isn t policed properly  top sponsors will use it to argue for better pricing for top sponsorship deals   Ryan said  Athletes had long argued that the old rule deprived them of commercial attention and income during their most marketable moments  Whether on TV  online or on billboards  only ads from official sponsors could feature Olympic athletes during the games  Athletes would face sanctions for any violations  Under the new rules  the USOC is banning unofficial sponsors from using words such as Olympics  and even  summer    victory   and  effort  in some contexts  But the average consumer still might not notice much difference between official and unofficial ads  said David Abrutyn  executive vice president international sports marketing at Bruin Sports Capital   When you see Michael Phelps  face in an ad  you automatically think of the Olympics  even if there s no mention of it or any rings   Abrutyn said  referring to the 22 time U S  Olympic gold medalist   In March  Under Armour released a commercial showing Phelps swimming to a song called  The Last Goodbye  and then facing a flash of cameras    images that evoke his Olympic successes  Phelps is aiming to qualify for Rio in what would be his fifth and potentially final Games  Under Armour will follow the new rules carefully and expects other non official brands to do the same  Peter Murray  vice president of global sports marketing for the firm  said in an interview  He added that Under Armour will be sponsoring 250 Olympic hopefuls   The USOC says a team of marketing staff will closely monitor commercials for any rule breaches  For companies without waivers or which end up breaking the rules  it says its lawyers will be armed with letters threatening legal action  It can also bar athletes from competing   But even though brands have to submit their plans to advertise on social media in advance  it could be difficult to keep tabs on all the activity in real time during the Games   Social media is the spot where there s the most opportunity for ambush marketing and commercialization that would be an irritant to a top sponsor   Ryan  the DLA Piper attorney  said  BRAND POLICE  Lisa Baird  chief marketing officer for the USOC  said in a statement that the new rule allows athletes  to continue their long term promotional relationships with brands  and helps to curtail ambush of our partners    Baird added   It s a new process  but a process we believe is fair to all parties   Official sponsorship deals with the U S  Olympic team can cost a sponsor about  40 million for a summer Games  according to sources who declined to be identified because terms of sponsor deals are not made public  Much of that goes to buying ad time from U S  Olympic broadcaster NBC  a unit of Comcast  O CMCSA   NBC declined to comment on the matter   In addition  the IOC has agreements with a set of 11  Top Sponsors  with special privileges   including Proctor and Gamble Co  N PG  and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930    that pay even more for global sponsorship rights   Seventeen official USOC sponsors have their sponsorship agreements up for renewal after Rio  according to the USOC  The criteria to receive approval from the USOC under the new advertising rules are strict  Non official advertisers are allowed to mention that their athletes are Olympians because the information is biographic  according to documents posted on the USOC s website  But the USOC says the applications are more likely to be approved if the Olympic reference  is balanced with non Olympic achievements   Brands had to submit a schedule for their media campaigns with the rule that the advertising had to be up and running by March 27  That gives the USOC enough time to approve  refuse or ask for changes on the submitted advertising before the Olympics start  Brant Feldman  a sports agent with American Group Management who works with Olympians  estimates that hundreds of brands have applied for the waivers   NBC is already seeing a boost in ad spending from non official sponsors thanks to the rule change  according to Seth Winter  executive vice president of advertising sales at NBC Sports Group  
Wheaties  a General Mills brand that competes with official U S  sponsor Kellogg s Co  N K   said swimmer Missy Franklin and sprinter Allyson Felix  two former gold medalists expected to compete in Rio  would be part of  Team Wheaties   A General Mills spokesman said it had received approval from the USOC for its campaign  Official sponsors are sure to be vigilant to prevent non official brands from  ambushing  them  Tina Davis  head of corporate sponsorships at  Citigroup  Inc  N C   said she is counting on the USOC to make sure the new rules don t erode the rights of official Olympic partners like her company   This is the first year so I m sure there will be lessons learned   she said ",2016-04-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brands-seek-rio-gold-in-new-advertising-playing-field-392947,392947
6338,227853,COKE,U S  eases sanctions on Myanmar in bid to promote reforms,news,"By Joel Schectman and Yeganeh Torbati WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States eased some sanctions on Myanmar on Tuesday to support ongoing political reforms  but maintained most of its economic restrictions in an effort to punish those Washington sees as hampering the country s newly elected government   U S  officials said they were easing sanctions to encourage the  historic  progress in Myanmar  including the formation of the country s first democratically elected government in more than 50 years   The moves included removing Myanmar state owned banks from a U S  blacklist and the lifting of sanctions against seven key state owned timber and mining companies  Officials said they hope the actions will eliminate key obstacles to trade in Myanmar  Potential investors in Myanmar have long complained that the blacklisting of some of the country s biggest banks made business in the country too risky  Major firms including  General Electric   N GE    Western Union  Co  N WU   Gap Inc  N GPS   and Coca Cola  O COKE  have made business forays into Myanmar  and the moves announced on Tuesday will ease their and other companies  ability to operate there   The U S  Treasury Department also extended indefinitely a sanctions exemption that allows banks to finance shipments coming in through Myanmar ports  even though key terminals are controlled by blacklisted businessman Steven Law  The issue had forced Western banks to cut financing of trade into the country until the U S  Treasury granted a six month exemption in December  But the United States also strengthened measures targeting Law  who was blacklisted for alleged ties to Myanmar s military  Six companies owned 50 percent or more by Law or the company he controls  Asia World  were added to Treasury s blacklist  The announcement highlighted a key challenge for Washington  as it seeks to both encourage political reform while maintaining pressure on those it sees as spoilers  More than 100 individuals and groups remain on Washington s sanctions blacklist for Myanmar  making them radioactive to the international community and barring U S  banks or companies from making deals with them   There can be a tension here   a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity   Some of these actors are key economic players    Tuesday s announcement reflects what will be a stilted process of bringing back trade into Myanmar  said Peter Harrell  a former senior State Department official who was part of the first efforts to lift sanctions on Myanmar in 2012   I think this is a significant step  I don t think it s a massive step   said Harrell  now a senior adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security   The practical reality is if you can t do business with military owned companies  chunks of the economy are going to remain off limits   The U S  moves followed a landmark November election in which the party of Aung San Suu Kyi  the country s Nobel Peace Prize laureate  won a landslide victory  A constitution drafted by the country s former military rulers bars her from becoming president  U S  officials began lifting trade and financial sanctions against the country after military leaders launched reforms that led to a civilian government being formed in 2011  beginning its transformation from a half century as an international pariah  The sanctions decision  reported by Reuters on Friday  came before a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by Secretary of State John Kerry on May 22  President Barack Obama  in a letter to Congress  said he was extending for one year the legal underpinnings for those sanctions that remain and provided his justification for doing so  He said Myanmar had made significant progress on reforms since 2011  but that  concerns persist regarding continued obstacles to full civilian control of the government  the ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in the country  particularly in ethnic minority areas  and military trade with North Korea   Despite the sanctions lifting  Washington has deep concerns about alleged human rights violations in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar  particularly violence against the minority Rohingya Muslims  the officials said  RELUCTANT TO RE ENGAGE The U S  actions on Tuesday removed three state owned banks from the U S  blacklist  and authorized transactions with two other banks that are still blacklisted  The changes mean that most transactions with all Myanmar financial institutions will be allowed as of May 18   The adjustments we are making today are to try and facilitate a broadening of the aperture so that the investment that s intended can take place   a senior U S  official said  Though the United States began unwinding sanctions on Myanmar years ago  U S  banks have been reluctant to re engage with the country because of concerns that key sectors of the economy are still controlled by businessmen linked to the military  No U S  bank has yet opened a correspondent banking relationship with a Myanmar bank  considered an important step in accessing the global financial system  While the moves on Tuesday help pave the way for basic transactions necessary for investment  U S  citizens are still barred from striking deals with individuals and companies on the blacklist    Businesses are going to look for more   said Erin Murphy  a former State Department official who worked on Myanmar sanctions issues   They still have to conduct extensive due diligence  not just on reputational concerns but also whether or not who they re dealing with is blocked   The U S  is also easing restrictions on Americans living in Myanmar  allowing them to conduct everyday transactions like renting apartments   The State Department also loosened its requirement that U S  companies investing in Myanmar disclose their dealings  Previously  companies had to make those disclosures if their total investment reached  500 000 or more  That cap has now been raised to  5 million  The requirement was intended to promote greater transparency in Myanmar  But it had a chilling effect on companies wanting to avoid criticism from human rights and other groups for dealing with the country  said Murphy  now a principal at Inle Advisory Group  which advises businesses investing in Myanmar  
The  5 million cap will likely mean major corporations will still have to disclose their business there  but will allow for modest investments without the disclosures ",2016-05-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/u.s.-eases-sanctions-on-myanmar-to-support-economic-growth-402559,402559

6343,227858,COKE,Post Mugabe Zimbabwe set to frustrate eager investors,news,By MacDonald Dzirutwe and Joe Brock HARARE  Reuters    A European investor s phone rings in a Harare restaurant and it s good news  an  80 million construction deal has been agreed with the Zimbabwean government  All that s needed now is a central bank guarantee letter  It never arrives  President Emmerson Mnangagwa  who took power when Robert Mugabe was removed in a de facto coup last November  has been trying to woo investors ahead of an election on July 30  a contest in which he is the narrow favorite  Mnangagwa  a 75 year old former ally of Mugabe  says he has already secured  15 billion of foreign investment  including from foreign multinationals  although these are mostly non binding commitments  according to analysts from local financial advisory firms who reviewed the agreements  In May   General Electric   N GE  said it would look at healthcare  power and transport in Zimbabwe  while Coca Cola  O COKE  said it planned to make the country an export hub for juice and other products  and a source of raw materials   Most big companies however are waiting until after the election to make their move although already the atmosphere has changed since the fall of Mugabe  whose nearly four decades in power brought a promising economy to its knees  Harare taxi drivers say they are hearing more foreign languages in their cabs  businessmen gather around laptops at restaurants  and the often sleepy international airport is buzzing with newcomers  But  so far  most are leaving frustrated and empty handed   It s like the Wild West   the European businessman said  paying his bill in crisp U S  dollars to the delight of a waiter more used to the dreaded quasi currency  bond notes  introduced in November 2016  After three days rushing between government ministries to get the deal done  the signed contract in his briefcase is useless since it lacks a guarantee from the central bank that he can access the dollars he needs to import equipment   Right  I better go deliver the bad news   he said  rising to catch a taxi to the airport  Reuters spoke to more than 20 investors  ranging from multinationals to entrepreneurs  who are interested in entering Zimbabwe for the first time or in expanding their businesses there since Mnangagwa was sworn in  All expressed optimism about new opportunities in sectors from mining to telecoms  and financial services to construction  after a decade when China was the only big outside investor  For economy graphic click   For currency graphic click    TURN THE NEEDLE  When these political changes happened  immediately there was positiveness returning to the economy   said Adriaan de Lange  managing director at  Omnia   J OMNJ   a chemicals firm operating in Zimbabwe   The potential exists for Zimbabwe to really turn the needle    But investors also raised concerns about the election and infighting over facilitating investment between factions linked to Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga  the army general who led the coup against Mugabe  The biggest obstacle is the chronic cash shortages that prevent businesses from importing the goods they need or repatriating the profits they hope to make  while portfolio investors can t get their money out of the stock market  After raging hyperinflation  Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 in favor of the U S  dollar  but a widening trade deficit and lack of foreign investment have led to currency shortages  For ordinary Zimbabweans this means winter nights sleeping outside banks in the hope of withdrawing the few dollars that are left  sometimes  20 in coins  often nothing  The crunch wasn t solved by the introduction of the  bond notes  which officially trade at parity with the U S  dollar but have already depreciated to 1 60 to the dollar  Banking sources say the central bank has a backlog of  600 million in unpaid imports but less than  200 million cash  and the situation is getting worse  The reserve bank declined to comment for this story  CASH CRISIS Hundreds of firms are waiting for the central bank to release their money  banking sources said  London listed Fastjet  L FJET   the low cost Africa airline backed by easyJet s  L EZJ  Stelios Haji Ioannou  said it may go bust if it doesn t recoup some of the  7 million it is owed by the Zimbabwean central bank   It s all at risk because of cashflow   Chief Commercial Officer Sylvain Bosc told Reuters   The demand is there  the opportunities are there  We actually want to expand in Zimbabwe   Mnangagwa s team acknowledges the challenges   For 37 years we have been living under one man  It doesn t change just like that but we are getting there   said presidential advisor Chris Mutsvangwa   For investors it is a question of risk and reward   The only way to convince foreign lenders and investors to provide the funds needed to end the currency crisis is if a financing program can be agreed with the International Monetary Fund  and that will come with painful terms  A source at the IMF said in order to get funding Zimbabwe will need to overhaul its public sector  including a crackdown on rampant corruption and mass layoffs  which has led to demonstrations in the past  A deal to compensate white farmers who were evicted from their land also needs to be reached  the IMF source said  If the ruling ZANU PF wins the election  Mnangagwa has said he will strike a deal with the IMF and introduce a new Zimbabwean currency within 3 5 years  But the leader known as  The Crocodile  hasn t shown any signs of prudence yet  handing civil servants a 17 5 percent pay rise in May and passing a 2018 budget with a bigger deficit  UNCERTAIN ELECTION Even before the IMF will engage in talks  it will want to see a free and fair election  The opposition protested this week  saying the electoral process was being rigged  with ballot papers being printed without their participation  Mnangagwa is slightly ahead in opinion polls  which are unreliable  but his challenger  Nelson Chamisa  40  is gathering momentum and the vote may provide no clear winner  meaning a messy coalition may have to be formed  Even if Mnangagwa wins  he does not have a firm grip on ZANU PF  with his powerful deputy Chiwenga intent on imposing his authority after taking a massive risk in leading the coup to oust Mugabe  political and diplomatic sources say  Middlemen from both camps want to be the gateway for investment and are obstructing deals that don t pass through their offices  making it difficult for businesses to know who they should work with  several investors said  A party divided with the military on one side and Mnangagwa on the other is not a conducive environment for investment   Everyone wants a slice of the pie   said the owner of an energy firm who has a deal in limbo due to a dispute between factions aligned to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga   They must be careful  The experience  small boys  like me are having sets the tone for how  big boys  view the risks   Mnangagwa and Chiwenga did not respond to requests for comment  Whoever wins the election won t have long to take the difficult decisions needed to get Zimbabwe s economy back on track before the public optimism built on the back of Mugabe s removal disappears   Do you think this is what I want to do with my life   said black market currency trader Charity Kambarami  waving a wad of bond notes in the air   I would also love to go to work and get paid at the end of the month but there are no jobs  The politicians have promised a lot  We have suffered enough

6346,227861,COKE,Obama  corporate giants announce plan to boost suppliers,news,"By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Barack Obama is enlisting several major U S  and multinational companies to draw attention to an initiative aimed at helping small businesses expand and hire workers 
The president will meet on Friday with representatives of household name firms such as Apple  O AAPL    AT T  N T   Coca Cola  O COKE  and Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  to spotlight the corporate giants  pledge to pay their smaller suppliers within 15 days 
The speedy payout puts more money in the coffers of smaller firms and helps them invest and hire workers  the president and his aides say 
For the larger companies  the initiative ensures that their own suppliers are robust and  demonstrates a recognition that a healthy supply chain is good for business   the White House said in a statement 
Frustrated by a legislative stalemate with the Republican led House of Representatives  Obama has vowed to act unilaterally when he can to achieve his agenda  and the announcement Friday is typical of the sorts of modest initiatives the White House has unveiled 
This approach has antagonized congressional Republicans who say the president has overstepped executive branch authority 
House Republicans on Thursday made public a  discussion draft  of legislation to authorize legal action against the president for misusing executive orders and other unilateral actions to advance his agenda 
The supplier initiative is based on a similar program for government contractors  The federal government promises to pay contractors quickly if those companies in turn commit to rapidly pay the smaller firms that supply them 
The White House says that arrangement affected 172 000 small businesses and generated over  1 billion for them to invest and hire workers since it was launched three years ago  The president was due to renew that program on Friday as well as announcing the public sector initiative 
Other firms attending the White House event include CVS  N CVS   FedEx  N FDX   IBM  N IBM   Lockheed Martin   N LMT   and Walgreens  N WAG  

Honda  T 7267   Toyota  T 7203   Rolls Royce  L RR   Ericsson  ST ERICb   and Westinghouse  T 6502  are also among the corporate participants in the White House event

6354,227869,COKE,Interesting Tidbits After A Nice Week In The Market,opinion,"Be thankful for what you have  you ll end up having more  If you concentrate on what you don t have  you will never  ever have enough      Oprah Winfrey


Coming on the heels of two drubbings at the end of last week  most observers believed last weekends tragedy in Paris would send global markets tumbling even further  When futures opened down on Monday morning  it appeared geopolitical events would indeed alter the pricing of global assets  However  when the week finished up yesterday with U S  equity markets having it s best five day session in nearly a year  clearly political events cannot be considered the primary concern of the investment community  Indeed  putting a few bucks in ones pocket usually takes precedent  and if bargains are to be found  well  we might as well be the ones finding them  The search for gains also takes on greater importance as we inch closer to the end of the year because track records matter  When the books close on December 31  2015  the preliminary result becomes official  just like the race track 


So what caused the change in course this week  Well  one big event investors focused on was the release of the October Federal Open Market Committee notes  It was clearly communicated the Fed is looking at raising interest rates in December  but the rate and duration of the tightening should be lower and slower  Stunner  When Stanley Fischer  vice chairman of the Fed  said in a speech  We have done everything we can to not surprise the markets   it might have been the understatement of the century  Still  given the fragile mindset of many investors  I am sure it was reassuring the 10 Year Treasury note will probably stay in the 2 3  for the foreseeable future 


Another data point helping the cause was a stock split and nearly 20  raise in the dividend from apparel juggernaut Nike  N NKE   With many questioning the retail sector and its prospects  Target Corporation  N TGT  posted strong numbers that met expectations but were not as strong in the e commerce area  Still  retail has been bludgeoned for quite some time  so any positive information was viewed constructively  A stronger case can be made that an upgrade by Goldman Sachs  N GS  of Apple  O AAPL  was more meaningful  As the most valuable company in the world  any sustained move by the beloved I provider has a much greater impact on all indexes  so when the fellows at Goldman put Tim Cook and his crew on their most preferred list  well  it did not hurt 



November is always a time when some private companies venture out into the public domain  This week was no different as both Square  N SQ  and Match com listed their shares  Square is in the difficult payment processing area and is led by Twitter  N TWTR  CEO Jack Dorsey  Match Group Inc  O MTCH  sold only 10  of the company with the rest being held by parent IAC InterActiveCorp  O IACI   Both popped nicely and give hope to much of Silicon Valley that many Unicorns will eventually be able to move from rich private valuations and capitalize on their global ambitions  Still  Square took a nearly 50  haircut to its private valuation  so you have to wonder about the marks on some of these Unicorns  I am sure their audit committees are paying close attention  and if not  they ought to 


Bill Ackman and Charlie Munger seem to have a little issue  Munger has criticized Valeant  a big Ackman position  for its accounting and ethical inadequacy  Ackman responded by questioning the moral value of Coke  O COKE   a big Berkshire holding  Ackman has long admired Buffett  so this one probably will fizzle out  but it is worth watching  On the global stage  Macau has been difficult and is turning even more problematic  especially for casino companies which generate the majority of revenue from these properties  We are referring to Wynn Resorts Limited  O WYNN  and Las Vegas Sands Corp  N LVS   as I am sure you are aware  Both have taken it on the chin despite being the best operators in this sector  Tesla Motors Inc  O TSLA  announced a recall of 90 000 of it s vehicles  which only proves  yet again  the car business is not a great business  let alone a good business  In my judgment  the only thing you want to do with cars is go from a to b in them  Investing in autos  Uh  no  but if you have to  try doing it in a way which stays away from the manufacturing side 




In a development which certainly has potential political ramifications  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  N UNH  announced they are considering leaving the exchange business because of the heavy losses  nearly  500 million   United is the nation s largest health insurer and if it is having problems  you can bet others are as well  United stated it will evaluate the issue by he middle of 2016 to see if they stop participating altogether  It does not mean the Affordable Care Act is dead  but it becomes very uncertain as to the future of these exchanges  You can use your imagination as to how this plays politically  but like the terrorism and refugee issues  it is not going away any time soon 

Finally  Thanksgiving is in a few days and it is one of my favorite holidays  like many other people  I hope everyone has a great week and enjoys their turkey and pumpkin pie  Stay healthy and happy  Thanks for reading the blog this week

6355,227870,COKE,In discounter war  will Aldi s Coke rush fall flat ,news,"By Emma Thomasson  BERLIN  Reuters    Aldi and Lidl have a new weapon in their battle to be Germany s discount grocery number one  Coca Cola   Both chains have for years used own brand goods and low prices to woo customers from global giants like Carrefour  Tesco and Metro  Both are still expanding abroad   particularly in Britain and the United States   At home  though  they have hit saturation point  There are now six times as many Aldi or Lidl stores per person in Germany as there are Wal Marts per person in the United States  That s one reason Aldi decided in October 2012 to stock Coca Cola  to add to a limited range of other big name brands it has introduced in recent years such as Nivea and Nutella   The move reversed a key tenet of Aldi s strategy  and underscores the challenges companies face as they eke out growth in mature markets   Aldi is the world s biggest discount store operator by sales  and had flourished for more than 40 years without stocking major brands  Lidl  on the other hand  has offered a slightly more varied range of products including Pepsi Cola  which it bottles in Germany  and Coca Cola  Gradually  it had been winning market share    Aldi s radical move with Coke did lift its market share  though Lidl s also rose in 2013  The biggest benefit for Aldi was that it wrong footed its rival  Lidl s initial response was confused  the company lost executives  and it recently postponed a planned international expansion   Longer term  though  will abandoning the philosophy that made Aldi successful backfire    Dieter Brandes  a former managing director at Aldi  worries that a new generation of managers may be steering the firm in the wrong direction    Today they are increasingly approaching the management methods and behaviour of the big supermarkets and hypermarkets   said Brandes  a longtime confidant of Aldi s late co founder Theodor Albrecht   Both Aldi and Lidl are privately held and declined to comment in depth on strategy for this article  Spokeswomen for Aldi s two main divisions said the firm s focus remains on developing its own brands and only listing a very limited selection of name brands     We make these exceptions for proven brand products with which customers have an almost emotional relationship   said Serra Esatoglu  spokeswoman for Aldi Nord    THE ALDI WAY  The Aldi discount store was pioneered in 1962 by the Albrecht brothers  Karl and Theodor  Lidl  part of the Schwarz group  followed in 1973  Both chains expanded rapidly  making multi billionaires of the intensely private families which still own them    For most of that time Aldi has led the way   There really is an Aldi way of doing absolutely everything  It is efficiency based  Everything is very carefully calculated   Paul Foley  managing director of Aldi UK from 2000 2009  said   When Foley joined the business in 1989  he said  the company still required its cashiers to memorize the prices of the 890 goods it sold  that was faster and more accurate than using scanners  Founder Theo was known for driving an ancient car and obsessively switching off lights   The goal was simplicity   Anything that adds complexity  difficulty and would eventually require a more complex process to manage is looked at 100 times before accepting it   said Foley  now a consultant based in Austria   In most cases it is turned down     After squabbling about whether to stock cigarettes in the 1960s  the Albrecht brothers split the firm into two units  Aldi Nord and Aldi Sued  Aldi Nord handles north Germany and eight European markets as well as an upmarket chain  Trader Joe s  in the United States  Aldi Sued concentrates on southern Germany  English speaking markets and four other European countries  Though they have different logos  the firms keep costs down by cooperating closely on supply and marketing   Lidl s twist on Aldi s model was to use selected brand promotions  It also has a broader range of fresh produce  and pays more attention to lighting and product presentation than at minimalist Aldi   Lidl has grown its market share in Germany to 6 5 percent from 5 5 percent in 2008  according to data from business intelligence firm Planet Retail  Aldi s market share has slipped to 8 8 percent from 9 1 percent over the same period  Planet Retail forecasts that the Schwarz group that owns Lidl will overtake Aldi as the world s biggest discount store operator by 2018  growing at a compound annual rate of 6 1 percent from 2013 to 2018  against 4 5 percent for Aldi   But both chains have struggled recently in Germany  where the grocery market has stagnated  German shoppers  who in 2008 spent 45 percent of their grocery money at Aldi  Lidl and other discount chains such as Netto and Penny  are shifting to mainstream supermarkets as the economy picks up  The market share of the discounters slipped to 43 4 percent in the first five months of 2014  according to research firm GfK   To compete  both Aldi and Lidl have become increasingly complex  They have introduced more premium product and brands  spruced up stores by adding things like bakeries  and spent more on marketing  Aldi s stores now stock around 1 000 basic goods in Germany plus several thousand non food items like children s clothes  plants and household appliances  Lidl has 1 600 items in its standard range     UNBRIDGEABLE DIFFERENCES   Aldi s Coke move shows where complexity can lead  When Aldi began stocking the soda  Lidl responded with special offers on Coke  Late last year  Aldi hit back  slashing the price of a 1 25 liter bottle of the drink to just 89 cents   Coca Cola then demanded an industry wide price rise  according to Mike Dawson  who has been writing about the German retail industry for 30 years for trade journal Lebensmittel Zeitung   Lidl pulled Coke from its shelves  instead pushing its own label cola and listing more Pepsi brands like Mirinda orange drink  according to Dawson    But just six weeks later  the smaller chain reversed course and restocked Coca Cola  Within weeks  Dawid Jaschok  Lidl s main negotiator with its suppliers  and Lidl CEO Karl Heinz Holland were out of a job  Lidl said in a statement the dismissals were due to  unbridgeable differences  over strategy    German business monthly Manager Magazin said the men were casualties not just of the Coca Cola dispute but of Lidl s handling of the broader price war with Aldi    Neither Jaschok nor Holland could be reached for comment   Schwarz boss Klaus Gehrig  whom the firm had lured from Aldi Sued in 1976 and who has been the driving force behind Lidl s international growth  had planned to launch the stores in the United States in 2015  But in April  he announced that Lidl would postpone its U S  debut to 2018  Apart from plans to expand to Serbia in 2016  Gehrig says it is time to pause and take stock    We have grown very fast  Now it is time to review the structures and ask where there are synergies   he said in a rare interview with the Heilbronner Stimme  a newspaper in the southern German region where Lidl is based    TERRITORIAL DISPUTES  Aldi s move to big brands may attract more shoppers  but it also makes things more complex    For firms like U S  food maker General Mills  maker of cereals like Cheerio s  Aldi s move is an opportunity   but one to manage carefully to avoid putting too much pressure on margins  Chris O Leary  head of the group s international division  said   We sell in a pallet or two  get it limited time only and people buy it up on impulse    The chains themselves also need to be wary  By limiting its range  Aldi used to be able to control its supplies and keep costs down  said former executive Brandes  author of  Bare Essentials   The Aldi Way of Retailing    This advantage is easily lost     There is evidence Aldi s move has already generated problems within the chain  The Albrecht family has tried to assert more control over Aldi Sued  a complex web of dozens of holding companies  Last year it hired Frank Lutz  former chief financial officer of German truck maker MAN  giving him a mandate to modernize the company structure  Lutz lasted just eight months after his plans met resistance from long serving executives  business monthly Bilanz reported  Aldi Sued declined to comment   Brandes foresees further turbulence as  these guys with their MBAs  arrive from universities  with their computer programs and controlling techniques and sit in front of the screen rather than talk to customers     
 Company culture was defined by Karl and Theo Albrecht    Now they are gone and we see the cock fights and territorial disputes that we know from nature  Who is the number one  Who has the last say   said Brandes    Why turn away from what has made Aldi so successful       Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London  Edited by Sara Ledwith and Simon Robinson ",2014-07-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/in-discounter-war,-will-aldi’s-coke-rush-fall-flat -293188",293188

6363,227878,COKE,3 Indicators For A Debt Saturated Economy,opinion,"If you re my generation or older  you may remember taking the original Pepsi Challenge    the  COKE O  versus  NYSE PEP  taste testing booths that you would find at sporting events  fairs and similar venues  I took the Challenge and stuck with Coke  The majority of people went the other way  as confirmed by even Coke s private tests  Nowadays  though  I m guessing the public version of a Challenge booth would bring heckling from the nutrition conscious folks at the Just Juice stand  The bigger challenges for Coke and Pepsi are health risks linked to their flagship products  Researchers are zeroing in on a handful of ingredients that may be harmful  such as sodium benzoate and phosphoric acid 
We have nothing to add to the soda studies  but they somehow seem similar to our research on debt  Like soft drinks  you can think of debt as having different ingredients  some benign and others risky  At the highest level  here are the ingredients that everyone should be aware of  hereafter  we ll call them funding sources  
Funding from outside the U S 
Funding from the Federal Reserve system
Funding from private banks
Funding from non money savings
Over any period  we can examine the total amount of borrowing and divide it among these sources with only a small residual  Here s a breakdown for the last 60 years 

Now  you may look at this picture and see nothing interesting  If that s all we have  then there s no fizz in our soda  right  You already knew that foreigners  the Fed and private banks help to finance our debt  According to mainstream economic thought  that s a good thing  We don t think it s quite that simple  We ll show that credit financed by lenders outside the U S   the Fed and private banks is a major source of economic volatility  We ll also describe three indicators that help to size up the related risks 
First  though  we ll define and comment briefly on each funding category shown in the chart   If you re just looking for the bottom line  skip to  Okay then  what should I be watching   
Funding from outside the U S  Foreigners invest the proceeds of our current account deficits back into U S    denominated investments  Therefore  the money that drains out of our real economy  when we import more than we export  flows back into our financial economy  Large amounts of these flows are unsustainable over the long term and unstable through the business cycle  Inflows to the financial economy contribute to asset volatility and  in the extreme  bubbles  They also make it easier for politicians to increase public debt  Outflows from the real economy are linked to declining savings rates  which are harmless in the short term but come back to bite when low savers inevitably learn they ve overspent   America s mix of low personal savings and high public deficits owes much to credit market financing obtained from outside the U S 
Funding from the Fed  Like foreign funding  too much credit from the Fed  primarily debt securities held on its balance sheet  contributes to financial volatility and declining savings rates  These effects are largely intentional  Central bankers who ramp up the supply of credit through  say  quantitative easing  aim to lower interest rates  thereby pushing up asset prices and encouraging more spending and less savings  What you won t hear from these central bankers  unlike ex central bankers  who sometimes spill the beans  is that near term benefits are invariably followed by an opposite reaction once interest rates  asset prices and savings rates normalize 
Funding from private banks  In a fractional reserve system  banks create   print   money by conjuring up deposits to deliver loan proceeds  Generally  the extra deposits remain in the banking system for as long as the corresponding loans are retained on bank balance sheets  When loans are either paid down or sold off and removed from bank balance sheets  the extra deposits are extinguished  In other words  bank funding increases when the amount of credit that s extended and retained on bank balance sheets is greater than the amount that s paid down and removed from bank balance sheets   Note that banks also create money through activities that don t involve loans  but these tend to be either less significant or on the Fed s behalf  
Because of the link to loan issuance  bank funding typically boosts spending more immediately and certainly than funding supplied by the Fed  Not only that  but loans retained by banks deliver the extra oomph that comes from the fact that deposits are created from thin air  Setting aside potential inflation effects  bank lending essentially turbocharges the economy  creating a  virtuous  feedback loop where more spending leads to more production  which then leads to a higher level of income and reinforces the initial lift in spending 
Unfortunately  though  turbocharged lending eventually reaches borrowers who produce things that can t be profitably sold  Or  it flows to home buyers and consumers who spend more than they can afford  Either way  loans go sour and the virtuous loop gives way to a vicious loop of less lending  spending  production and income 
Many economists  although mainly from outside the mainstream such as Austrian business cycle theorists and Chicago Plan advocates  recognize that vicious loops are a natural consequence of balance sheet expansion by banks in a fractional reserve system  While it s not the only culprit  we ll demonstrate the link between bank balance sheets and economic volatility in just a moment 
Funding from non money savings  Debt that s placed directly with domestic  non bank investors   through either debt security issuance or loans that banks choose to sell and move off their balance sheets   is fundamentally different from other sources of funding  It s financed by 100  genuine  domestic savings  It excludes the monetary expansion that occurs when banks match a loan on the asset side of the balance sheet with a newly created deposit on the liability side  thereby lifting the supply of credit without a prior increase in savings 
Most of the non money savings in our economy comes from households  pension funds and insurance companies  You shouldn t think of these sources of funding as completely risk free  but they re the Just Juices of the credit markets  Or  you can think of them as the relatively harmless ingredients in your soda that are mixed with the more dangerous stuff when other funding sources come into play 
Uncategorized funding  This is our residual category  which has negligible effects on the analysis  It s explained in the accompanying  
Okay then  what should I be watching 
Now for our three indicators  We start by estimating the percentage of total borrowing that s funded by the three riskiest sources  the red shaded areas of the chart above   rather than non money savings 

As noted on the chart  three periods stand out for an unusually high percentage of risky borrowing  The first two coincide with the creeping inflation of the 1960s and Great Inflation of the 1970s  The third overlaps the serial bubbles of the last two decades and leads into the 2008 financial crisis  While some may call this a coincidence  we beg to differ  Problems with either inflation or financial instability are exactly what you should expect when debt funding is tilted heavily towards risky sources 
Next  we divide risky borrowing by GDP 

This chart can help you gauge how hard the economy might fall after the inevitable cracks appear in credit markets  Not surprisingly  it shows that the three periods with the greatest amounts of risky borrowing were followed by the three hardest falls   severe recessions in 1973 75  1980 82 and 2008 09 
You may have also noticed that virtually every recession follows a drop in risky borrowing  This  too  shouldn t be surprising  If you agree that large amounts of risky borrowing eventually lead to vicious circles   in which soured loans and a slower borrowing pace drag economic activity lower   then you should expect recessions to occur after risky borrowing peaks  This is exactly what we see 
We create a third indicator by measuring the change in risky borrowing  Using two year changes  it looks like this 

This isn t a perfect recession predictor  there s no such thing   but it helps to narrow down recession probabilities  And while it doesn t offer ironclad proof that borrowing in excess of non money savings leads to recessions  once again  there s no such thing   it fits into the very process described by economists who ve dared suggest that such borrowing is risky 
The bigger picture
We recommend including the three indicators in any risk analysis  alongside other factors such as debt ratios and interest rates  Debt ratios show the economy becoming more and more saturated with debt  We ve seen steady increases in debt to GDP  debt to income  debt to sales  debt to assets  name the ratio and we ll show you an unsustainable upwards trend   We won t repeat the charts here  but you can go to our last post and work backwards to others showing data on public and private debt  
These upwards trends are a direct consequence of the risky borrowing shown in the charts above  If borrowing was limited to amounts funded with non money savings  debt ratios wouldn t rise  Even a modest margin above non money savings would leave debt ratios stable  As it is  risky borrowing averaged 8  between 2002 and 2013  a pace that you can call hell for leather without much exaggeration  The post 2009 average is only slightly lower at 7  of GDP  thanks to money printing at the Fed and a shift in the debt mix from private borrowers to the U S  Treasury 
Interest rate developments are another important part of the picture  Falling rates may explain why risky borrowing declined sharply in the mid to late 1980s without an especially severe recession  The secular decline in rates continued to provide tailwinds in the 1990s and 2000s  but these tailwinds shouldn t have much power left  if any  now that we ve reached the zero lower bound 
Conclusions for today s economy 
There are two particular messages in the latest indicator readings  First  with risky borrowing on the upswing  we re still not seeing a recession signal  This is consistent with several other business cycle indicators that remain benign  such as profit margins  still high   bank lending standards  mixed  and the yield curve  still positive  
Second  the risky borrowing indicators are troubling  nonetheless  They show that we ve reverted to old habits of borrowing far more than we can fund with non money savings  At almost 10  of GDP in 2013  risky borrowing is higher than in all but the early 1970s and middle part of the last decade  This tells us that we re accumulating risk at a rapid clip  although not for as long as in those earlier episodes   Yet  
Worse still  policymakers and mainstream economists are unperturbed  failing to acknowledge that some types of financing are riskier than others  It s as if we re stuck at a 1970s Pepsi Challenge booth  watching people debate cola tastes with no mention of health risks  With ample evidence of these risks  how can this be  One theory is that the current generation of mainstream economists staked their careers on the soda business  filling resumes with research on topics such as sweetness and carbonation  but nothing on health  It s just too big a step for them to acknowledge that the old research is unhelpful and the resumes hollow  We can only hope that the unpopular  long term thinkers who are willing to take that step become more influential over time 
In the meantime  keep an eye on the sources of financing and  in particular  the three indicators of risky borrowing discussed above ",2014-05-06,F.F. Wiley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-indicators-for-a-debt-saturated-economy-211789,211789
6364,227879,COKE,Quarterly Earnings Parade Marches On,opinion,"The quarterly earnings parade continued last week  and as is so often the case when prices have been marching higher seemingly of their own accord  accompanied by a steady parade of misinformation  One CNBC guest proclaimed the latest quarterly earnings to show 10  growth    10   Kelly  Evans   10    to which Evans herself added the affirmation that last quarter was about 10  too 
Except that they weren t  The first quarter earnings myth keeps growing even as the second quarter earnings dream blooms  First quarter earnings for the S P 500 were 2 1  according to FactSet  below 2  according to Zacks  between 5  6  according to a Reuters story a couple of weeks ago and now have been rumored up to nearly 10   No doubt there are a some  adjusted  EBBS reports floating around  Earnings Before Bad Stuff  from brokerages that tell us that earnings were great if you would only look at them from just the right angle  For now  the  blended  earnings growth rate  i e   reported plus estimated  for the second quarter is 6 7  for the S P 500  Not 9   as CNBC s Bob Pisani avowed late Friday 
A final tally of 7  would certainly be better than last quarter s 2   though the rebound effect of the quarter ought to be kept in mind  Still  a number of large Dow stocks have disappointed either with earnings or outlook  including Coca Cola Bottling Co Consolidated  NASDAQ COKE   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   Boeing Company  NYSE BA   Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV   United Technologies Corporation  NYSE UTX   AT T Inc  NYSE T   and Visa Inc  NYSE V   How about Microsoft Corporation  NASDAQ MSFT and J P Morgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   That s a lot of jumbo cap disappointment for what I hear being called a  great  earnings season  Visa management had an interesting comment on Friday    we see no signs yet of any acceleration in economic recovery   I guess they don t listen to CNBC  Not enough  anyway 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc  NYSE GS  made an interesting call on Friday that dovetails with what I ve been saying  They downgraded equities over a 3 month period  while remaining bullish over 12 months  For one thing  the market does badly need at least a small correction  which may seem like an odd thing to say but is necessary to stave off a sharper decline later  Goldman is worried about rates rising at the same as European bonds marked record low yields amid an ocean of complacency and perhaps equity related fear   European equities took an even worse beating on Friday from the threats of EU sanctions moving into Russia  and heavy military equipment from Russia moving into the Ukraine  As Louis Armstrong used to sing  it s a wonderful world 
For another thing  a lot of companies have been unenthusiastic about June  implying that the rebound effect is waning even as geopolitics heat up  I don t know what will happen in the Ukraine or Gaza  though prospects for peace looked pretty rotten for both at week s end  but keep in mind that stocks will need a constant diet of constantly worse news to keep up selling pressure  There doesn t have to be peace in Ukraine  just a few days of standing down to get stocks to rally again 
On the other hand  the stock market does feel heavy right now  A Fed meeting comes next week  so things aren t apt to go seriously awry the next few days unless the statement sounds unexpectedly hawkish  and there is also the matter of an impending jobs report that I expect to post a good result  All of that said  prices still feel vulnerable and ripe for a pullback of at least a few percent  August could get bumpy  and it often is 
The Economic Beat
The two main US reports last week were June new home sales and durable goods  The former was a clear disappointment  while the latter report was mixed  Both led to downgraded estimates for second quarter GDP  heightening the possibility that the first half of 2014 was one of zero growth  the first estimate is due next week  though recent initial estimates haven t been close to final ones  
With new home sales  the disappointment in June results was magnified by a major revision downward to May data  What had been a 504K annualized rate   the first 500K print since May 2008   was revised all the way back down to 442K  Instead of being the best rate in six years  it ended up the best rate in four months  That leaves first half sales for 2014 running 4 3  behind the first half of 2013  clearly not what was expected this year  The trailing twelve month  TTM  year on year growth rate has been falling quite fast  from  23  24  in May June last year to  1 2  in the latest read      The count of actual TTM sales has been edging downward from a peak of 430K in January to 419K through the June estimate  That s not good  but we can expect some Wall Streeter to claim it is by declaring it will add extra rebound fuel to 2015 
New orders for durable goods were better than expected at 0 7   consensus 0 5    but May data was revised downward and shipments were light   0 1    The latter means another downward revision to estimates for 2nd quarter GDP  which now looks to have trouble cracking 3   the Bureau of Economic Analysis  keepers of the GDP flame  could still come to the rescue with a very low deflator   The compound rate of growth for the trailing 24 months in business cap ex spending remains quite low at 2 2  
Coming back to housing  existing home sales were a bit ahead of consensus at a 5 04mm annualized rate versus the 4 99mm estimate  I certainly am seeing a lot of new  for sale  signs here in my town and on my bike route  However  the rate still remains 2  3  below last year  and mortgage purchase applications are down 15  year on year in June  The rate of price increase for conforming loans  less than  750K and owned by one of the federal mortgage agencies  moderated to 5 5   That s actually a good thing for first time buyers 
Employment continues to print decent numbers  with initial jobless claims falling back below 300 000 again  284K seasonally adjusted  for the first time in two months  The improvement that had nearly disappeared in March has picked up again with the better weather  The insured unemployment rate remains at 1 9   the last cycle got down to 1 6  so we can hope for some more improvement to come 
The consumer price inflation rate remained steady at 2 1   overall  and 1 9   core   On the regional Fed side  the Chicago Fed s national activity index remained at a modest  0 12 with the three month average at  0 13  zero is neutral   The Richmond Fed s manufacturing index moved up from 3 to 7  zero is neutral   while Kansas City moved up to 9 from 6 
Among next week s highlights in data releases should be the first estimate of second quarter GDP due Wednesday morning  though if it hits right on target the effect might be muted  Anything with a 3 handle will probably be considered a victory 
The real highlight is of course the FOMC statement that comes out later that day at 2PM  I cannot imagine the Fed not continuing the taper  but stranger things have happened 
It s a busy week with other data  with the monthly housing data completing with pending home sales Monday and the Case Shiller price index on Tuesday  Consumer confidence comes Tuesday  and there are regional surveys from Dallas on Monday and Chicago Thursday 
Friday is the busiest day of the week  with the jobs report being the third highlight of the week  Estimates are for about 235 000  but claims data suggest something over 250K  It will be released at the same time as June personal income and spending  The ISM manufacturing survey and June construction data come out later that morning  and July auto sales should come out throughout the day ",2014-07-27,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/quarterly-earnings-parade-marches-on-220702,220702
6365,227880,COKE,Earnings Help Wall Street Bounce Back,opinion,Who would have ever guessed U S  stock markets would have such a strong week  When you look at the potential problems popping up on a daily basis  from Ebola to ISIS  Europe  China  oil prices  and now  school shootings  well  a six percent gain in the last ten days seems more than anyone could have hoped for  The last five days were loaded with a heavy dose of earnings from the heavyweights of the corporate world  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Boeing Company  NYSE BA   Coca Cola Bottling Co Consolidated  NASDAQ COKE   Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ YHOO   and Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   there were plenty of others as well   You really have to go through each report on a case by case basis to evaluate the merit of each result Investors did not like what McDonald s  Coke  and IBM had to say because these huge icon s are continuing to have problems generating any kind of growth  Just as important is the poor positioning of their core businesses and failure to address the problem areas  In McDonald s case it is the perception of low quality food and a public increasingly moving towards healthier choices  Coke has been plagued with a decade of declining carbonated beverage sales in North America  IBM is very much tied to computer mainframes and a software and services business which is considered mediocre  Consequently  the investment world has the idea these behemoths might now be vulnerable to an activist who can bring badly needed change  These are enormously successful companies which still have incredibly profitable businesses  For example  in three months  McDonald s still brought in  1 billion in net income  Yes  there are issues  big issues  which each management team is going to have to address  Competition is fierce in each of their areas  and getting tougher by the day  Still  they all have continually evolved over the last 30 years and always responded by eventually becoming the best company in their respective industry  It would be a mistake to underestimate any of them The other side of the coin are those which actually impressed Wall Street and you have to begin with Apple  The company sold 39 million new phones and totaled over 50 million units if you add in computers and I pads  They reaped over eight billion in profit and investors have continued to buy the stock based on these results and future product introductions  Another tech giant which got a favorable response was Yahoo  which showed a little growth  can you believe it    In fact  Marissa Meyer has slowly been changing where their revenue is coming from  with native ads on mobile devices and video accounting for an increasingly higher percentage of revenues  They are still a work on progress  and much attention continues to be paid to the tax efficiency of how they will handle their sixteen percent position in Alibaba The most surprising  and without question the one which made the most impact  was from Caterpillar  They typically tell the world how bad global business is and guide down for the next quarter  but instead they blew away the numbers  The night before  China posted a better than expected GDP growth figure of 7 3   so the market decided maybe deflation is not in the cards after all As always  earnings season brings plenty of attention to those companies which absolutely get destroyed when their results don t meet expectations  The most blood was shed in the technology area where Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and Yelp Inc  NYSE YELP  got taken to the woodshed in a big way  Interestingly enough  even after the thrashing  these companies still trade at monster multiples  If you are a buyer  which I am sure is a big if  be very very careful  Purchasing at 200 000 times earnings makes anything very difficult to make money at  no matter how great the company is Another group which got beat up pretty good was Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc  NYSE LL   which was tied to weakness in housing  It is very disappointing to watch something you own lose so much value in such a short period of time  It is the nature of investing because it happens to everyone  This week  it happened to Warren Buffett as IBM and Coke proceeded to lose him over a billion dollars during the day of their respective report  Tough stuff this investing profession  wouldn t you say Next week brings a heavy dose of corporate financial reporting as well  Two of the biggest industries on the planet  pharmaceuticals and big oil will be telling all  I expect the oil patch will show slightly lower profits due to lower realizations on the upstream component  while the downstream portion will be helped by reduced feedstock costs  We can also look forward to the FOMC meeting on Wednesday when it is expected the world will discover there will be an end to quantitative easing  I know you were worried about it ending as well Disclosure  Y H   C Investments  Yale Bock  and the family of Yale Bock own positions in securities mentioned in the blog post  Investing in stocks can lead to the

6366,227881,COKE,Avoiding The Peter Lynch Bias,opinion,"Peter Lynch is one of the all time greats  While running the Fidelity Magellan fund from 1977 to his retirement in 1990  he generated almost hard to believe annualized returns of 29 2  per year  And take note that this was before the roaring bull market of the 1990s  If there were a pantheon of investing gods  no one would question Peter Lynch s place in it 
But Lynch was also responsible for some of the most misunderstood and poorly used words of investment advice in history when he recommended that you  invest in what you know  
Lynch s advice here is actually pretty solid if used right  Wall Street analysts and fund managers often never leave their elegant New York offices  Regular  everyday investors can often see a budding trend years before Wall Street simply by virtue of having boots on the ground  And new trends in consumer goods are often visible on the street months or years before they show up in the financial statements  Lynch routinely wrote over the years that he found some of his best investment ideas from trips to the mall 
But this is where good advice can go very wrong   Buying what you know  can very quickly degenerate into buying a stock because you like its product what I call the  Peter Lynch Bias  
Liking the taste of their burritos is not a sufficient reason for buying shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  any more than liking their lattes is reason to buy shares of Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   Peter Lynch was never that simplistic  and we shouldn t be either 
On a related note  we need to look past the hokiness of another legendary investor  Warren Buffett  Buffett likes to play the part of a simple Midwesterner  the kind of guy that really would buy  NASDAQ Coca Cola  stock because he likes the taste of Cherry Coke  Don t believe it for a second  It s an act  Buffett is one of the sharpest financial minds in history  and he didn t build Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  into a financial empire with such sentimental nonsense  He did it by having discipline and buying the shares of great businesses when they were reasonably priced 
So  how can we avoid the Peter Lynch Bias 
Simple  By staying emotionally detached  having a process in place and sticking to it 
By all means  follow Lynch s advice by looking for emerging trends on your next trip to the mall  But before you pull the trigger to buy or sell something  make sure you re following your process 
Here are a few practical suggestions on avoiding the Peter Lynch Bias 

If you re looking to  invest in what you know  with respect to a product you like  try using one of their competitors before seriously considering purchasing the stock  Years ago  if I had really taken the time to learn how to use an Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhone  I probably wouldn t have gotten sucked into the BlackBerry  NASDAQ BBRY   Back then  Research in Motion  value trap  Yes  it was one of the cheapest stock in the world when I recommended it last year  But I cannot deny that my decision to recommend it was biased by my ownership of a BlackBerry phone 
To the best extent you can  try to follow trading rules and use stop losses  What works for one investor will be very different than what works for another  Perhaps you use a hard stop loss of  say  10  below your purchase price  Or perhaps you use a trailing stop or 20  25   If you are a value investor  perhaps you base your sell decision on valuation or fundamentals rather than market price  But in any event  my point stands  Lay out the conditions under which you intend to sell and stick to them  Stock ownership is a marriage of convenience with quick  no fault divorce if your situation changes  Don t make the mistake of falling in love 
Unleash your inner Spock  For readers who are not Star Trek fans  Spock is an alien from the planet Vulcan who has completely supressed his emotions  If talking about a stock or watching its price fluctuate gets your heart racing  take a step back and try to look at the investment through Spock s eyes  Is it logical  Do the numbers make sense  Are the growth projections based on reasonable facts or on optimistic hope  Would you buy a different company if it were trading at the same price multiple 

One size does not fit all here  But whatever investment discipline you follow  don t allow your enthusiasm for a product to cloud your judgment ",2015-04-07,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/learning-the-wrong-lessons:-avoiding-the-peter-lynch-bias-247596,247596
6367,227882,COKE,Earnings And China Torch Investors,opinion," What comes first  the compass or the clock  Before one can truly manage time  the clock   it is important to know where you are going  what your priorities and goals are  in which direction you are headed  the compass   Where you are headed is more important than how fast you are going  Rather than always focusing on what is urgent  learn to focus on what is really important  

In the capital markets  there is always plenty of news  but not much of the information is critical for making decisions about investment merit  With the deluge of earnings reports over the past week  however  the last five days served as an important reminder of why reporting season is always important  and the foundation of what equity prices are based on  This is not to say that the market is always efficient  Over the long term  usually it is  Still  the idea market values always are an accurate representation of the worth of an enterprise is not one hundred percent correct  There in lies the opportunity  but one certainly full of risk  Which is why investing is not for the faint of heart  If you lack resolve  you will be tested  without a doubt  Of course  everyone believes they have the fortitude to hang in there when it gets difficult  Sure you do  of course you do 

Last week  the proverbial bleep hit the fan when technology heavyweights Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO   and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  all reported numbers which disappointed Wall Street  Apple sold over 60 million devices  but fell short in phone orders and got hammered  Microsoft had great cloud numbers  not so much in PC related devices  and took a massive write down  Nobody yahooed for Yahoo but it still showed better growth and some promise in their mobile areas  Head chopping and activist investor participation were the themes for Qualcomm  which certainly did not help the cause  Adding to the joy was the despair about the current state of affairs in China  Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates remarked the firm missed the crash in equities and now was not a place which was  safe  to invest  Interesting  I did not realize first aid was what should be considered when allocating capital  My mistake 
Adding fuel to the fire about China was the continued decline across the commodity complex  Oil  gold  copper  steel all were hammered repeatedly this week  and any company in those areas got beat up  The poster children in these places are great firms like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   United Rentals Inc  NYSE URI   and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   You would not know it based on the constant selling this week  Helping the situation was Coca Cola  NASDAQ COKE  and Boeing  NYSE BA   which both reported nice quarters  and the soft drink maker even showed some volume growth in North America  It has been a while  so congrats to the fellows down in Atlanta  In the gaming world  Caesars Entertainment Corporation  NASDAQ CZR  shares got torched after losing a court order centering around their treatment of large hedge fund creditors  The artist formerly known as Harrah s has been battling to preserve their equity for a long time  but it appears the creditors have a good chance of reclaiming the assets  Stay tuned 
In what you would have thought would be very positive for the market  Seattle stalwarts Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Startbucks reported superb numbers on Thursday after the bell  Amazon actually overtook Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  in equity value and it appears Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  will do the same with McDonald s  NYSE MCD  relatively shortly  The hardest part about these situations is there have been a few occasions over the last decade where you could buy the stocks at good prices  As they continued to report good numbers  those chances become few and far between  Still  Amazon represents a great example of what investors have to  overcome  when facing a demanding equity market  For a few years now  Amazon s stock had done very little  until recent quarters  Friday  it was up 10  in a day  and nearly 20  after the bell on Thursday  You saw the same thing with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  a few weeks ago  The stock did very little for a few years  and in one day it goes up 100 points  Both are emblematic of another issue which affects the current environment  very few winners  Why should an institutional buy an index  or a small stock  when they can just own Google  Amazon  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   or Apple and get out performance  Of course  the assumption is this will always be the case  Maybe  maybe not  Right now  and it s been this way for a long time  market leaders remain the preferred entity  Elsewhere  AT T  NYSE T  showed nice growth and got approval from the FCC for it s purchase of Direct TV

6368,227883,COKE,S P Futures Fall As Crude Oil Futures Trade Down To  45 10 A Barrel,opinion,"Today the ESU15 CME opened the regular session 3 handles lower on the day before trading higher within a tick of Fridays close and in turn sold off during the New York lunch hour nearly 20 handles from the high down to 2080 00 then rallied nearly 12 handles to close at 2090 75
Leading the selling charge was crude oil futures  CLU5 NYMEX  which sold off  1 70 trading all the way down to the  45 area before finding mild support there  Also participating in the selling were Shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  trading lower by as much at 3 5  this afternoon bring it down over 11  in just two weeks
Turnaround or Terrible Tuesday 
There may be some optimism heading into tomorrow given this afternoons solid bounce  a positive market on close imbalance and a Dow Jones Transportation average which closed in the positive today  Adding to optimism is the fact that  Turnaround Tuesday  has been very relevant as of late while 8 of the last 10 weeks Tuesday s session closed opposite of Monday for the S P 500 
However over the current year of 2015 Tuesday has been the weakest day of the week closing down 62  of the time  and while most months open have strong stats the beginning of August has the weakest stats of any month over the last 50 years  adding to this is the fact that August has been the weakest preforming month over the last 20 years

6370,227885,COKE,S P 500 Futures Strong  But Facing 2100 Pivot,opinion,"Last night  the S P 500 futures opened the globex session at 2073 00 down one handle and showed weakness early  trading down and making a session low of 2064 25 early in the Asian session  10 handles from Friday s close  From there  the futures rallied into the Asian close and Euro open before popping higher at the 3 00 CT globex pivot time we refer to  The S P continued on that strength  making a high late in globex of 2078 75 up 14 50 handles from its session low 
At the regular trading hours open  the S P futures opened at 2077 just off its globex high and traded 7 ticks lower before powering its way higher in an upward grind that would last the duration of the session  makings its cash session high of 2100 during the last hour before hitting some late day resistance there on a  336 million market on close buy imbalance  The ESZ15 settled the session at 2094 75 
Heard across the news wires was the Fed s Williams  while giving a speech  he did not give hint toward policy  Also was the Atlanta FED adjusting their GDP projections for this quarter low in the midst of disappointing manufacturing and sales data 
The calendar tomorrow is light both overseas and in the U S  but interestingly  the ECB s Mario Draghi speaks at 2 00 pm EST  Today was a return of mutual fund Monday on the first trading day of a new month that is seasonally strong  With the S P futures up so much and strong today  but facing the 2100 pivot  we are expecting some give back tomorrow on a turn around Tuesday trade  but at the same time  seeing any 10 handle pullback an opportunity to reinstate long positions

Coupa garnered a significant amount of buzz heading into its IPO day after the company priced its initial public offering at the high end of its range late Wednesday  Investors are also excited about the company s recent growth  for the six month period ended July 31  Coupa saw revenues of  60 3 million  up 74  year over year

6381,227896,COKE,Matching Investment Risks To Goals,opinion,"Wall Street ended the week of Thanksgiving and Black Friday with another record high  as consumer staples and technology stocks lead the way  Companies such as Proctor   Gamble and Coke  NASDAQ COKE  gained on Friday as energy stocks fell overall  Since the U S  election  all three major indexes have hit new intraday highs and closed at record levels many times in the past few weeks  Andre Bakhos  managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville  New Jersey explains that 

people are looking for value in the market  While many stocks have risen quite brusquely  investors are looking for some forgotten names in the rally 

Although it s good to see high stock prices  paper profits are not guaranteed  Unless investors sell some of their holdings and lock in some gains  their portfolios could just as easily drop in value in the next market correction  So the highest point in the stock market is also the riskiest point in a way  Since no one can accurately time the top of the markets investors should use their personal financial goals to help them decide what to do during these unprecedented times of record high stock prices  For example  they can take a look at their portfolio to determine if the sector or asset allocation is right for their personal situation 
For someone who is in his thirties  growth may be his biggest priority and his goal is to match the index of growing equities around the world  Putting money in an index fund that tracks the Russell 2000 or emerging markets ETFs may not be a bad idea  He would assume a higher degree of risk than other investors but his principal is also likely to gain the most  There may even be some room for trading and speculation to significantly increase the value of his investments by assuming a significantly higher risk  Speculation should only be done on a small scale that won t jeopardize the entire portfolio 
But for someone in her fifties and getting ready to retire soon  investing in dividend stocks and preferred shares is probably a better strategy  Her primary goal is to generate dividend  interest or other types of income rather than seek out portfolio appreciation  Companies such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  would be a good candidate to add into a dividend generating portfolio  The stock inched up 0 8  rise after the company confirmed media reports that it was in talks to buy Swiss biotechnology company Actelion  JNJ has been increasing its dividends for 54 years in a row so far  JNJ is currently distributing  3 20 of dividends per share annually 
With the stock price around  114 each  the yield comes out to 2 80  which is better than the 10 year U S  government bond right now  Not only that but the stock also has a lot of growth potential as an added bonus because it s a very profitable blue chip company  Dividend growth and earnings growth are some of the most important metrics that investors look at when they analyze a company  The stock price is currently up 12  year to date  compared to the 6  return of the broader S P 500 index 
And finally  for someone in his sixties or seventies  the main priority might be capital preservation  This means going after safety and security  For someone who can t afford to lose a big chunk of their net worth and are still heavily invested in stocks today  taking profits now and redirecting capital to lower risk investments like government bonds would be more appropriate  By understanding personal goals and priorities  investors can adjust their risks accordingly and better manage their portfolios at any stage of their lives ",2016-11-27,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/matching-investment-risks-to-goals-200166702,200166702
