Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2019 Earning Results Conference Call  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded  It is now my pleasure to introduce Jess Lubert  Vice President  Investor Relations  Thank you  please begin Jess Lubert    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  operator  Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call  Joining me today are Rami Rahim  Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller  Chief Financial Officer  Today s call contains certain forward looking statements based on our current expectations  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially  These risks are discussed in our most recent 10 Q  the press release  and CFO commentary furnished with our 8 K filed today and in our other SEC filings  Our forward looking statements speak only as of today  and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements Our discussion today will include non GAAP financial results  Reconciliation information can be found on the investor relations section of our website under financial reports  Commentary on why we consider non GAAP information a useful view of the company s financial results is included in today s press release  Following our prepared remarks  we will take questions  Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up  With that  I will now hand the call over to Rami Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Good afternoon everyone  We reported solid results during the December quarter  Total revenue of  1 208 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance and we returned to growth on a year over year basis  Strength for the quarter was driven by our cloud and enterprise verticals  which more than offset expected weakness within our service provider business  Non GAAP earnings per share of  0 58  came in  0 01 above the midpoint of our forecast as top line strength flowed through to the bottom line  For the year  2019 played out largely as we anticipated and we were encouraged to finish the year on a high note  Some of the highlights from the year included a third consecutive year of enterprise growth including a record quarterly performance during the December quarter  a return to year over year growth in the cloud vertical following a difficult product transition  which we believe will position us for additional growth in the years to come The successful acquisition of Mist  which is already exceeding our initial expectations  and has the potential to have a material positive impact on our P L on a go forward basis  Strong software growth that we expect is likely to continue due to the value of our off box platforms like Contrail and efforts to better monetize the value of our existing solutions and significant progress enhancing our go to  market organization  which we believe will help us capitalize on the various technology innovations we are bringing to market and gain share as many of our markets transition over the next few years  We expect to build on many of these accomplishments in 2020  We believe we are executing well and positioned to sustainably grow the business starting this year  While this will require some incremental investment  particularly in go to market  we remain committed to growing non GAAP earnings this year and expect the investments we are making in 2020 will create the top line momentum needed to drive incremental leverage in earnings growth in future years Now  I d like to provide some insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals  Starting with the cloud  we experienced better than expected results during the December quarter as the business grew 18  year over year and increased year over year for a third consecutive quarter  We continued to see momentum within our customers wide area networks  particularly for some of our switching products this past quarter  Although our cloud routing business also saw double digit growth year over year Order trends remain healthy and despite some likely seasonality  we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business on a year over year basis during the March quarter We re encouraged by the success we re seeing with some of our largest cloud customers and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us  That said  we have also been experiencing growth with Tier 2 cloud providers and believe we are gaining share as many of these accounts increasingly leverage their own private clouds  While our existing cloud use cases should present modest growth opportunities for us over the next few years  we are very much focused on leveraging the 400 gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center where historically we have maintained limited share  On this last point  we believe we have delivered the system  silicon  and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400 gig cycle and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters  These solutions are now in our customers labs and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins  While early 400 gig deployments are expected to begin during the second half of the year  we do not expect material revenue to materialize until 2021 due to the availability and cost of optics We achieved record enterprise results in the December quarter with this business growing 2  year over year despite a difficult comparison  These results were better than expected and we were pleased to grow despite a year over year decline in our federal business which moderated following several strong quarters  We believe our portfolio of enterprise solutions is truly differentiated and resonating in the market  which is driving increased confidence that the go to market investments we re making should position us to take share and grow this business in the years to come even in a challenging macro environment Some of the items driving confidence in our enterprise outlook include the following  first  I couldn t be more pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader enterprise market  Mist is a truly differentiated platform that offers industry leading scale and AI capabilities  Mist AI engine leverages more than four years of advanced learning to help customers improve network operations and the user experience as compared to our peers which simply focus on uptime of the network access points  routers  and switches  Mist capabilities are clearly resonating in the market  Mist customer base grew more than 150  year over year in the December quarter and aggregate bookings for Mist and the direct pull through it enabled  Phonetic  exceeded  100 million run rate on an annualized basis  While Mist is already exceeding our initial expectations  we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist s potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio  To this point  we are seeing strong initial demand for our recently launched Mist Wired Assurance that brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the EX portfolio  This capability has already enabled us to secure EX wins with several Fortune 100 accounts  including a Fortune 10 that previously were not Juniper EX customers  We plan to mystify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio through the year  which we believe should create incremental pull through opportunities in future periods  We are investing to further monetize Mist with our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to Wi Fi 6 and the AI driven enterprise Second  our enterprise switching businesses is seeing healthy momentum growing both quarter over quarter and year over year in the December quarter with our QFX data center products experiencing record orders  We believe our industry leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management software platforms are resonating in the data center market and should position us to grow this business moving forward  While our EX portfolio declined year over year  sequential momentum has been strong now for several quarters and we expect to see better year over year trends on a go forward basis as the productivity of our go to market organization improves after last year s organizational transformation and the Mist pull through we are starting to see further materializes Third  our secure SD WAN capabilities are seeing healthy traction  While this opportunity remains in the early innings  we believe our ability to offer cloud management  security  and Wi Fi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is expected to be a large and fast growing market  but also present another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio  Our service provider business remains challenged  However  we experienced healthy quarter over quarter growth in the December quarter and the pace of year over year declines began to moderate  which is a trend that we expect to continue during the upcoming year  The move of our MX5G  Phonetic  line card from qualifications to deployments  the success of our Contrail telco cloud platform  high end security opportunities  and the availability of new edge products are among some of the reasons we expect our service provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods  While our security revenue slightly declined year over year during Q4  our security orders grew 24  quarter over quarter and 3  year over year and came in at the highest levels in the last four years  We saw notable strength in our mid range portfolio  which saw orders increase nearly 35  year over year and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our high end offerings  We believe our security portfolio is highly competitive  which was recently validated by NSS Labs  which provided a recommended rating for our high end data center offerings and Gartner which ranked us as a top supplier for both data center and distributed enterprise security use cases in its critical capabilities report  We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our connected security strategy  which focuses on bundling security with our traditional networking platforms  We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend We are continuing to see success in our software business  which grew 25  year over year and accounted for more than 12  of our revenue during the December quarter  While much of our software revenue today is driven by on box software licences  our off box software orders increased more than 90  year over year  and off box subscriptions increased more than 170  year over year due to Contrail  security subscriptions and Mist  Based on the momentum we re seeing  we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially as subscription based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market Not to be overlooked  our services business delivered a record quarter and the business grew more than 2  on a full year basis  Our services team continues to execute extremely well with improved attach rates and renewals  the primary factor driving strength in both the quarter and the year  Our service pipeline remains healthy and we remain confident in our ability to once again grow this business during the upcoming year  Finally  I d like to highlight that we are making solid progress in our sales transformation initiatives  Our population of quota carrying sales reps is up by approximately 20  from the trough levels we experienced during the Q1 of 2019 and we are making solid progress against our productivity goals  We believe our investments in go to market should create tailwinds through the course of the year and present an important revenue driver that helps us capitalize on the various innovations we are bringing to market  particularly within the enterprise vertical during the upcoming year  I would like to extend my thanks to our customers  partners  and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper  I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication  which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders  I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Rami and good afternoon everyone  I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook  We ended the fourth quarter with  1 208 billion in revenue and non GAAP earnings per share of  0 58  both above the midpoint of guidance  The higher than midpoint results were driven by greater than anticipated strength in cloud and to a lesser extent enterprise  As we expected  we are exiting the year stronger than we entered  We are pleased with our 2  year over year growth in total revenue  Looking at our revenue by vertical  on a year over year basis  cloud increased 18  and enterprise increased 2  while service provider declined  Phonetic  5  On a sequential basis  all verticals  all technologies and all geographies are up  Service provider increased 9  sequentially with growth across all products and services  Enterprise growth of 7  on a sequential basis was primarily driven by switching  Our cloud business increased 3   Phonetic  on a sequential basis primarily driven by routing and services  From a technology perspective  routing grew 4   switching increased 11   and security grew 7  sequentially  Our services business increased to 3  year over year and 7  sequentially  primarily due to strong renewals  As Rami mentioned  we saw continued solid performance from our software offerings  which increased 25  year over year and was more than 12  of total revenue in the quarter In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter  three were cloud  six were service provider  and one was an enterprise  Product deferred revenue was  133 million  up 3  sequentially and down 8  year over year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments  Non GAAP operating expenses increased 4  year over year and 1  sequentially  Cash flow from operations was  96 million  down sequentially and year over year  primarily due to timing differences related to payments to suppliers and customer collections  We expect to see a rebound in cash flow in the first quarter when it will likely exceed  200 million  We paid  64 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of  0 19 per share  We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for  200 million in shares  which was completed earlier this month Moving on to the results for the full year  Fiscal 2019 largely played out as we expected with revenue declining 4  versus last year  While the service provider business remained challenged declining 12   our enterprise business grew for the third consecutive year  and our cloud business returned to full year growth  On a full year basis  security grew 3  year over year and our services business grew 2   Software grew 16  and was greater than 10  of total revenue for the full year  However  routing declined 12  and switching declined 4  versus 2018  Both results were primarily due to weakness in service provider  In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year  four were cloud  five were service provider and one was an enterprise Non GAAP gross margin expanded over 20 basis points due to the strength in our service margin  which more than offset lower product volume and China tariffs  Our focus on disciplined non GAAP operating expense management continued with a decline in operating expenses of  10 million  Non GAAP diluted earnings per share declined 9   For the year  we had cash flow from operations of  529 million  During 2019  we took a balanced approach to capital allocation  Let me  Phoentic  return to shareholder perspective  we repurchased  550 million worth of shares  and paid  260 million in dividends totaling 193  of free cash flow  In addition  we used approximately  360 million to acquire Mist  and approximately  450 million to pay down debt Before we move on to Q A  I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website  At the midpoint of our first quarter guidance  we expect year over year growth in both revenue and non GAAP earnings per share  Beyond the first quarter  we expect revenue and non GAAP earnings per share to grow on a sequential basis and we expect modest growth for the full year  We expect non GAAP gross margins to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter and improve with volume throughout the course of the year  While non GAAP gross margins can be difficult to predict and can be impacted by deal and customer mix  we currently expect full year gross margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2019 levels  We expect first quarter non GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially due to the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase in fringe costs  Through the course of 2020  we expect quarterly non GAAP operating expense to remain near Q1 levels  While we expect non GAAP operating expenses to be up on a full year basis  as we invest to take advantage of market opportunities  we remain committed to discipline operating expense management and expect earnings to grow in 2020  For 2020  we expect non GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be 19  plus or minus 1   Finally  our Board of Directors has declared a 5  increase in our quarterly cash dividend to  0 20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record In closing  I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper s success  Now  I d like to open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from line of Hetai Kidron with Oppenheimer   Company  Please proceed Ittai Kidron    Oppenheimer   Co    AnalystThanks  Hey  guys  nice to see the cloud business clicking again  Can you talk about visibility in the cloud business and the revenue concentration there  How has that improved  And as 400 kicks in  I know you ve talked about more the next year event  but you expect that ramp to be lumpy  How should we think about that Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  So first  needless to say  it s great to see the performance in our cloud business in the Q4 time frame  The year largely played out as we expected  in fact  probably saw a little bit stronger results in the Q4 timeframe than what we had originally anticipated  The success in the hyperscaler is always going to be concentrated and capex concentrated  However  I m pleased with the fact that we saw success across a broad number of customers  not just within the hyperscalars  but also in Tier 2 cloud where I think we re doing actually quite well Also the breadth of the technologies with strength in those switching and in routing  that we re quite pleased with  We have a unique position when it comes to the routing footprint that we retain in the hyperscale space  And we fought hard to retain it  as you know  with the prior transition that we ve undertaken over the last year and a half  At this point  I think that is largely behind us and we are now in a situation where the strength of the business  the momentum is going to be very much based on the timing of deployments  So that I think gets us to sort of mid to low single digit growth type rates in the cloud segments in the 2020 timeframe Certainly  as you get into the 400 gig deployments  and in particular  in the data centre and DCI that post  that presents a much bigger opportunity for us to go after  And we re doing just that  I mean  all of our focus  our energy  our investments are going into the 400 gig system  the software  the specific features that our customers are requiring and we re engaging with our customers in order to have a very good shot at not just getting our fair share  but more than our fair share in that segment  And timing of that is going to be closer to the end of the year into next year for where meaningful revenue happens  And it s largely tied to the timing of the projects within hyperscale  as well as the finding and availability of 400 gig optics Ittai Kidron    Oppenheimer   Co    AnalystGot it  And as a follow up you know  it s very nice to see that mist is kind of pulling EX  but maybe can you tell us  is that the mode of operation  Do you lead with a bundle right now or mid sales people try to make introductions or    and vice versa  How much of this is truly the preferred path for you into customers Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerThat s a great question  I think there are really two sales plays that we undertake when it comes to the enterprise space and the specific customer and their requirements  their presence  So one sales play is very much data center oriented and it is around satisfying the sort of highly automated private cloud data center with a simple fabric management  high performance  EVP and VXLAN type functionality that I think we have real strength and we saw really good momentum in the data center  switching space in the Q4 time frame  in fact  record orders for the QFX in Q4  largely driven by both cloud as well as the enterprise The second sales play is very much aligned with what you re talking about  which is around the campus  And there we are finding a lot of success in leading with Mist  the highly differentiated cloud based management  AI driven simplicity and user experience that now allows us to start the conversation to open the door and then to insert EX switching  which I think is leading to the the sequential performance that we re starting to see with the EX portfolio  And I ll just mention that we just recently introduced functionality that makes that sales play not just one of a commercial play  where we start with one product and then leads us to a conversation with the other  it s very much a technical tie in where the Mist cloud  the management  the AI analytics and assurance now actually technically ties in the acts where you give the customer the ability to look at the performance of their network across both wired and wireless and I think that s a very unique offering that we have now in the market OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore  Please proceed Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks a lot for taking my question  I have two as well  I guess supposed to adjusting the free cash flow numbers  historically I think December quarter has been one of the better free cash flow quarters for you guys  the conversion at least versus net income was fairly low  Can we just talk about what happened in the December quarter free cash  When should we expect that to pick up as you go into the march quarter Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So free cash flow was down a little bit compared to our normal kind of seasonal average  primarily just due to timing of both purchases as well as some cash collections from customers  We did see a buildup in deferred revenue and we saw some strong bookings particularly in the services side  service renewals and you see our DSL also went up in the Q4 time period which is not abnormal  We absolutely expect that timing to revert  We expect Q1 to be a strong cash flow quarter for us  In fact  I would expect it to exceed  200 million in Q1  So the cash    the cash flow that you were expecting to see in Q4 was just pushed down a bit into the Q1 timing Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystPerfect  Really appreciate that  And then  I guess  I ll just follow up  When I listened to your calendar  20 commentary around gross margin being flat to slightly up  opex  I think  you said would be up year over year as well  What does that embed from a revenue perspective for you guys  Is that going to be some flat volumes  Or does that factor in some revenue leverage as well  Because  I guess  I would think if revenues are up we would see better leverage  especially in the gross margin line Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  For revenue  we were comfortable with current Street estimates for 2020  which we re looking for about 1  growth  From a gross margin perspective  we think flat to slightly up volume would help  but modest growth  call 1  level  it s not gonna have a tremendous impact on gross margins  I d expect flat to slightly up gross margin perspective  We are driving for a full year earnings growth in 2020 as well Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystPerfect  Thanks a lot OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan  Please proceed Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking the question  If I could just start off with the telecom vertical and kind of what s embedded in terms of revenue outlook  As you mentioned  your full year outlook is for modest revenue growth  but how you think about the telecom vertical within that  And what could potentially drive some upside to the expectations  What do you need to see from the service providers Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYes  certainly  Samik  So  we actually saw a pretty good recovery on a sequential basis in telcos and the service provider vertical in Q4  2019 was largely played out as we expected  we had expected the second half to be stronger than the first half  and that essentially panned out as expected  A lot of the momentum was in the Q4 timeframe  There s a couple of reasons for this  one is  timing of orders  timing of projects that we had visited into  There s only so much time that a service provider can go without having to invest in their network  So that certainly benefited us The other thing that I d like to call out is  the breadth of the solutions that we re now selling into the telco domain where we have  obviously  very tight relationships and strategic discussions with is increasing  So not only are we now selling routing technology  which is our traditional business  but we saw good strength in switching and in security  Not to mention in software  in particularly  around the cloud and telco cloud solutions that we re now offering across a large number of customers So when I extrapolate out into 2020  I would not return    I would not estimate or predict a return to growth  I think growth is in the cards for further out in a couple of years timeframe  but for 2020  I d say  less headwinds supported by some of these other solutions that we are now introducing and selling to our telco customers  I do think that there are going to be some catalysts out there that we can leverage  5G  although the timing is somewhat unpredictable  I do believe it s going to be big and it s going to be a catalyst for investments that will play out over a number of years  Our Metro portfolio which will start to come together for us later this year  I think will be good  Our partnerships  our strategic partnerships with companies like Ericsson  I think starts to help and not to mention just the portfolio  So we introduced last year some pretty meaningful enhancements and upgrades to our MX portfolio and those have gone through certifications  And I think we ve now started getting into the early deployments I think  starts to benefit us throughout this year Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    AnalystGot it  If I can just follow up  On the last earnings call  you had mentioned you are seeing some weakness in the bookings from the enterprise customers  You had revenue growth with the Enterprise vertical this quarter  But if you can just kind of help us with whatever the trends you saw play out during the quarter  how did it end the quarter in terms of bookings  How did you end the quarter Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We did mention in Q3 that we were seeing some more caution from some of our Enterprise customers  And I d say that Q4 played out largely as Q3 did  There is some level of caution that is out there that is maybe delaying some orders  however  look  I mean  we had a good Enterprise quarter  I think even in a scenario where there is weakness in the macro  our share in the Enterprise vertical leaves a lot of room for growth and I have optimism based on the strength of our portfolio  especially around the data center switching portfolio as well as the Campus wired wireless switching solution as well  And couple that with the hard work that the that we did over the last year in restructuring our sales force  cutting in order to invest in front line sellers that we re now starting to see the benefit of  So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks  compared to trough levels of last year  where we stopped we are now at 20  increase in the number of quota carrying sales reps that are out already  Now many of them are relatively new and are still in the process of becoming fully productive  I think as that happens throughout this year  we re going to start    we re going to really benefit from it  especially second half of the year Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    AnalystGot it  Thank you  Thanks for taking my questions Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James  Please proceed Simon Leopold    Raymond James Financial Services Inc     AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking the questions  I wanted to ask two  The first one is  just maybe if we could double click a little bit on what s occurring in your gross margins  In other words  I guess I m trying to get a better understanding of how much of the forecast for the year as well as the March quarter is related to mix  geographies  customer mix  product mix  I know all these sort of factor in  but maybe if you could help us with a bridge to get an idea of how to model that Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So deal mix is very much two factor  I would say  If you look at the full year basis  2019 versus 2018  the primary driver to the drop in product gross margin was both tariff and volume  So mix did not play a big factor on full year basis  19 verus  18  however in a quarterly basis  so for example  Q3 last year versus Q4  the quarter we just ended  you did see some negative mix trends that affected the margin marginally  So any given quarter  it s going to vary based on deal mix on a kind of a more longer term period  we re managing it quite effectively  We did see some headwinds last year with tariffs as well as boiling things down  Those are really the two drivers in the product was margin  We saw tremendous strength in service gross margin  which enabled us to deliver fairly flattish  overall gross margins for the company Simon Leopold    Raymond James Financial Services Inc     AnalystAnd then as follow up  just want to get a better sense of the 400 gig market opportunity  It sounds like you re a little bit more pessimistic about the timing  pushing the volume into 2021  And I guess one of the things I m trying to understand here is  will you be shipping essentially 400 gig capable chassis in essentially establishing a footprint that might be equipped with 100 gig optics waiting for the optics to to be at the right price point or does the whole product cycle really go along with the the optics availability and is really a 2021 cycle  Hopefully that makes sense Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerIt certainly does  And let me be clear  I think that s what we re seeing with respect to the timing of 400 gigOf the solution  deployments  the opportunity that is there for us is not different than anything that our peers are seeing as well  We ve done everything that is in our control right now  I mean  retaining our routing footprint was necessary because that gives us an amazing platform off of which to increase our relevance within the cloud vertical and we ve done that  In terms of the solutions and the product  we already have our first 400 gig systems that are in the market based on both custom and merchant silicon  the new operating system that s very much developed with our cloud vertical in mind  with the kind of modularity  Linux nativecapability  the programmability has now seen its way into the market  We are very much engaged with our customers in early deployments  in early lab certifications  And the timing is essentially tied to the timing that our customers are looking to deploy  And yes  optics plays a big role in the timing and not just the availability of the optics  but also in the    the economics of those optics Simon Leopold    Raymond James Financial Services Inc     AnalystGreat  Thank you very much Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo  Please proceed Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks for taking the questions  If I can start just on a strategic basis  One of your biggest competitors has talked recently about selling silicon directly into the cloud verticals  obviously  getting what s your proprietary silicon strategy  I m just curious of how you think about whether or not that would present an opportunity for Juniper to do something similar  Or how you see that engagement possibly  with some of the cloud customers  I do have a follow up Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks for the question  Aaron  I ll start by just saying that  I have a tonne of confidence and I certainly have a lot of experience and background in this domain from my engineering days here at Juniper  In our silicon strategy  in our silicon execution and the strength and the competitiveness of our silicon products that are    that make their way into a variety of our systems  In particular  when it comes to 400 gig  I think we have a unique offering already in the market  but still to come in terms of the full breadth of the solutions that we are bringing to market based both up on merchants silicon  in certain classes of switching silicon  but also on custom silicon that we ve developed over the last several years When it comes to sort of efficiency performance coupled with security and encryption  we really believe that we have done something very special here  So very well equipped to deal with what we know is a competitive environment  Disaggregation  selling software and silicon separately is not a new concept  In fact  I believe architecturally we ve done a lot over the last couple of years to disaggregate our software from our silicon in a way that allows us to achieve much more nimbleness in how we develop our systems and can move and adapt to different silicon offerings That said  in terms of the business model of selling software and silicon separately  we certainly we have experienced  because we have now done this for quite some time in selling software separately from the system and from silicon  We did    we started this doing    we started this years ago  As far as selling silicon separately  while I have confidence in our silicon itself  that business model  I m not sure that there would be a huge market for it  quite frankly  So it s something that we would be open to  it s something that we would take a close look at going forward  But for now  we re going to be very focused on selling the systems  the software and the silicon photonics capabilities when they hit the market later this year Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystYeah  That s great answer  And then just as a quick follow up  just on a model basis back to the gross margin  When I look at gross margin here in this last quarter  you saw a pretty healthy services gross margin  Was there a one time items in there or how do we think about the services gross margin going forward relative to the    I think it was 65  you just reported Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So services gross margin clearly benefited from the very strong services revenue  As you saw  actually a little bit more less there than we expected beginning in the quarter  The cost is little more fixed  Most of our cost of services is really our    our services JTech facilities  labs  etc  So we re seeing a relatively stable cost line and its revenue ramps sequentially as it did last year  You did see a bigger market than normal  I would expect that to come down a bit in Q1 as revenue seasonally will come down for services and the cost will remain kind of at fixed levels Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystPerfect  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura  Please proceed Jeffrey Kvaal    Nomura Instinet    AnalystYes  Thank you  And Rami  I m hoping to peel back that the answer on the independent ship a little bit  Why don t you think that there would be a market for stand alone silicon  And then I guess the broader question with that is  do you feel like the Cisco announcement makes the web scale market more or potentially less competitive heading into the 400 g cycle Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerI think the the cloud demand has always been a very competitive environment and let s just say that we re very used to and comfortable operating in that competitive environment and doing well despite the competition  Again  I ll just reiterate part of my answer  I think that there is a large market out there for selling the software  many of our customers are looking at buying especially off box software  The opportunity to sell a network operating system disaggregated from silicon  we have a tonne of experience here is limited  There are only a few number of customers that are interested in that model  A lot of them talk about it  but ultimately they desire the simplicity of a system that includes the software and in some case  merchants silicon  in other cases in custom silicon  As far as selling silicon separately  like I said  the focus for us right now is on a technology that we believe has breath in demand  and that is in the 400 gig silicon photonics space As far as silicon forwarding engines and switch silicon is concerned  I doubt that if we entered that market  we re going to see the other OEM s being customers of ours  So that really limits it to the cloud providers themselves  And based on our conversations  very specific engagements that we re having with them  I think for now  the demand is more in the converged systems  And meeting their requirements in terms of the programmability  the telemetry capabilities  the power  efficiency  the performance of their requirements that we are confident that we re satisfying Jeffrey Kvaal    Nomura Instinet    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then  it seem you say that Tier 2 cloud was an area of success for you  How much runway do you have in that  Is that a    is that a sustainable theme for 2020 and beyond Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerI think yes  because what we re seeing with Tier 2 cloud is  first  there are a number of customers that we ve seen sort of pivot back to a strategy where they want to deploy their own data centres as opposed to just moving to or embracing the public cloud offering  So that certainly is a trend that will help Tier 2 specifically  Second  not only did we retain customers and saw sort of strength in the build out of data centres worldwide  but we ve won some new logos that I think will help us in coming quarters OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from a line of Alex Henderson with Needham  Please proceed Alex Henderson    Needham    AnalystThank you very much  I just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics around what you re suggesting for the 2020 timeframe  It sounds like 2  revenue growth  modest increase in gross margins  Are you suggesting that your opex increases will be roughly comparable to the revenue growth  And therefore  the only margin leverage you ll have is slight improvement in gross margin hence operating profit growth fairly consistent with the revenue growth  Is that the way we should be reading the commentary on 2020 Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So we re comfortable with the current Street revenue estimates for 2020  which are approximately 1  revenue growth  I believe at that    at those kind of revenue numbers  we should expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up  Opex will be up on a full year basis  I do expect us to continue to be opportunistic with our capital return programme as well with share buybacks  So the combination of that we believe will get us to earnings growth on a full year basis next year or this year Alex Henderson    Needham    AnalystI see  And just going back to the commentary around the switching market  Is your co packaged technology helping you penetrate into any of the Tier 1 cloud companies where they want to get experience with that co packaging functionality  It seems that that s one of the distinguishing characteristics of your 100 gig products currently and obviously  it would be better to to learn about it at 100 gig and then try to deploy it at 400 gig Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerAlex  I would say I m not sure I fully understand the question  but when I think co packaging  really that comes to co packaging of optics and switching silicon  That s something that s more a future trend that we do believe in  but it s not a here and now  it will actually take a number of years before that becomes a necessity or something that s technically or economically feasible  Having said that  we do very much believe that our silicon photonics technology  our IP that we have that were initially embracing to put into stand alone pluggable transceivers has future replicability into co packaging  And that is an outcome that we very much are working toward  but it s certainly not a here and now  it s really more of a future trend Alex Henderson    Needham    AnalystThank you Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerMy pleasure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed Ashwin Kesireddy    Goldman Sachs Group Inc     AnalystHi  thank you for taking my question  This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod  I got one two part question and another question on APAC  Phonetic   First on 400 gig  Rami  can you give us an update on the timing of 400 gig silicon photonics and any update on the progress there  And sort of related to that  I want to check if you guys are willing to sell 400 gig boxes to run someone else s software on it  And I have a follow up Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Ashwin  So silicon photonics  a lot of progress has been made  The big challenge with silicon photonics is not so much about the technology itself  I believe from a technology standpoint  we have something that s unique  highly differentiated in the market today or relative to what s out there in the market today  The challenges around production  manufacturing in large volumes and what we have done over the last several months now is that we have struck up strategic partnerships with strong manufacturing entities  companies  fab houses that specialize in this type of technology that will mitigate the risks associated with the large scale manufacturing of the technology  So at this point  I feel good about the differentiation  I feel good and confident that we re going to get to a solution that we can ship to our customers later this year  And this is not easy  this is certainly a lot of technical hurdles that are in the way  but I do believe that we re overcoming one by one  And like I said  before the end of the year we should have our first products in the market As far as your question    yeah  a question about 400 gig  So it is    it s an interesting question  I actually think the demand    there is a greater demand for software    network operating system software that will sit on white box hardware than there is for something that is the other way around  That said  what there is  of course  an interest in by some of our cloud customers in particular is  a very efficient implementation of SONiC on a system that we build that could either be merchant or in some cases custom  And so  SONiC as sort of this lightweight NOS  network operating system  that some of our cloud customers are asking for  something that we have very much embraced  we ve invested in  we ve demoed versions of this on our systems that I think have demonstrated to our customers how seriously we are  And there s more to come in this space Ashwin Kesireddy    Goldman Sachs Group Inc     AnalystThank you  And just as a follow up on Asia Pacific and the revenue growth there  I think that region has been declining for about eight quarter straight now  Just wondering what s driving that and what could sort of turn around the business there Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll take that  So  I think part of this has to do with the fact that some of our big customers in the APAC region  we really had a    we had some level of concentration  especially in the telco space and to a lesser degree in the cloud space  That    just    we re not spending as much over the last few quarters as they had done traditionally  And that resulted in some weakness  I also just would acknowledge  I think we ve had some execution challenges in Asia Pacific that we ve had to address  And we are actually going to be announcing a new APAC leader fairly imminently at this point Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would just add that we did see two consecutive quarters of sequential growth in Asia PAC  And we did see enterprise up on a year on your basis  So we are seeing some pockets of strength there  I think there s more to come  I would expect all of our geographies to have the potential to grow in 2020 OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from a line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thanks  guys  You spoke about the 20  increase in quota carrying comps and I just wanted to kind of check and make sure that kind of all positions that you were looking to hire for are filled at this point and then just increases in OpEx throughout 2020 are just more commissions as they become productive  And then I have a second question Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  So  most of the positions have been filled  Our OpEx outlook certainly factors in both the filled positions and those that we anticipate will be filled shortly  And I just highlight the fact that  we took the harder path here cutting to invest  We ve restructured  we reduced layers and increased span of control and simplified the organisation  which freed up the capacity for us to go and invest in frontline sellers and I think that has    that was tough to do  but it was the right thing to do  So certainly you will not see a 20  increase in OpEx for our sales organisation  but it s great to see that we re going to have 20  more sellers that are actively positioning and selling the technology and the differentiation that we believe we have  especially in the Enterprise space Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  And then just maybe on the CTO transition  just  you know  any kind of customer feedback or kind of  Indecipherable  starts making the rounds with customers  any kind of early commentary would be helpful  Thanks Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  I think that the CTO transition has gone remarkably smoothly  Bikash did a very nice job in sort of seamlessly transition over to Raj  There was in fact a period of all overlap between the two executives  Raj is an outstanding technical leader that has experience in the cloud provider space  but also in the Enterprise  was at Intel for a number of years  so has some experience in the silicon photonics space  at VMware  lot of experience in enterprise software  So I think the breadth of his experience has already in just the month or two that he has been on board been a huge benefit to us and I think he s going to do a fantastic job leading the technical strategy in this company going forward Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from a line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen  Please proceed Paul Silverstein    Cowen   Co LLC    AnalystThanks  guys for taking the question  And I ll apologize because I m going to ask you to revisit some questions from earlier  First off  Ken  on the margin questions you ve been asked  a couple of things  One  I thought that the announced reduction of last round of tariffs  I thought that that would benefit you and your peers  will that not be the case  Secondly  what is the rate of price erosion  Has that changed one way or the other  I assume from your margin guidance  it hasn t  And third  going back to Simon s question  when we think about the levers going forward  it sounds like mix is the number one lever  If I look at what you did back when before you had the whole MX and PTX and the impact in your revenue  you were doing 64 and 63 off several hundred million or higher revenue  Is it to get back to that level or to get back to 62 plus  Is it primarily a function of better volumes that magnitude or is there something else  And then I ve got a straightforward question Rami in your response to the demand question  if I may Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So with respect to tariffs  first  I would say that we ve been predicting tariffs would impact our business by 30 basis points to 50 basis points for the year and that s largely played out as we expected  I would remind you  that s a total gross margin impact  If you actually take the impact of product gross margin  it s greater than that as the denominator gets smaller  right  So if you look at product only gross margin  the tariff impact is greater than 30 basis points to 50 basis points As it relates to Wave 4  Phonetic  and the change there  we did not see a benefit in time to impact Q2  we will slightly benefit from that in Q1    in the Q1 tariffs  But our biggest opportunity is to continue to mitigate the entirety of the tariff as we continue to look at retooling our supply chain  that s something that s ongoing  We weren t able to mitigate much in Q4  In fact  our Q4 tariff exposure was the highest of any of the quarters in 2019  Which is time  just not having enough time to really react to Wave 4  We are now reacting and we expect to be able to mitigate some tariff impact going forward As far as the big levers  I would order them in    volume is number one  I mean  we did    although we re pleased with our Q4 returned to growth  we are still seeing product revenue down  That is obviously a negative to our gross margin  our product gross margin in particular  So getting the volume back is    would be number one  Obviously  if we can mitigate tariffs further that would help  And last but not least  on a mixed perspective  as our software business continues to get stronger  particularly as we start to get more renewals in our subscription software business  we should see some lift in our software margin as well OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed Brian Yun    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for squeezing me in  Also I had kind of a question on 2020 outlook  mainly  the levers for sort of top line growth  Wondering in your view  sort of what those are that can kind of cause revenue to perform better than expected  And then any headwinds or speed bumps we should kind of be aware of in 2020  Maybe if you could talk about the cloud and enterprise vertical  I think you touched on service provider earlier  So that would that would be helpful  Thank you Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Brian  let me start and maybe Ken has something to add  And it s best to think about it from the standpoint of verticals  I think in the cloud space we saw good    we close the year strong in 2019  I wouldn t expect that Q4 performance is sort of sustainable on an ongoing basis based purely on the footprint that we have  I think sort of mid single digit    mid to low single digit growth rates in the cloud provider space based on existing footprint is a reasonable assumption In the enterprise space  I d say continued momentum and if anything  maybe even better strength in the second half of the year as we get to more productivity with the increased number of sellers that we have  that s out there  not to mention the continuously increasing strength of our joint portfolio  So the EX switching portfolio being managed by the Mist Cloud  Initial versions of that have now entered the market  it s only going to get stronger and more competitive throughout the year  So I m quite optimistic about the enterprise vertical in 2020  And I think that s going to be a good growth catalyst for us In SP it s moderating declines  right  Sort of mid single digit declines in SP is probably in the right ballpark  And it s based on a number of factors that have already highlighted around the fact that SP s need to invest eventually  5G becoming more of a catalyst to investment  the fact that we re broadening our solutions and our portfolio that we re selling to the SP into software switching and security  That s how I think about it Ken Miller    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerNow I think that makes sense  I think if you wanted to ask what could go wrong  I would say  clearly the enterprise business operating in a dynamic macro environment  if that were to change materially that could have an impact on our ability to grow enterprise  Rami already mentioned kind of service provider and cloud Thank you  Our last question will come from the line of Thejeswi Venkatesh with UBS  Please proceed Thejeswi Venkatesh    UBS    AnalystThank you  I have two questions  You had new MX and PTX products out in the market recently  I wonder if you could update us on the uptake and refresh opportunities  And then secondly  you ve talked about switching strength into when opportunities in the cloud  I wonder if you could clarify whether these were new wins that were coming through  Thank you Rami Rahim    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So as far as the routing products  MX and PTX  I think we ve now seen a few quarters of PTX momentum driven largely by the clouds vertical  And I m quite optimistic that that can continue  The MX    we introduced new MX 5G line cards  roughly at first half of last year timeframe  Those typically take six months to nine months of certification  that has happened now over the last couple of quarters  And I think that starts to result in some growth opportunities for us into 2020 And I think the second question was around switching in the cloud provider space and whether there were net new logos  And the answer is  yes  In the Tier 2 space I think we ve seen momentum as a result of both satisfying the growth demand of Tier 2 clouds  especially Tier 2 cloud providers that have made a strategic decision to either stick with or to insource their data centre infrastructure  but also net new logos worldwide that I think will help us throughout this year OperatorThank you  That is all the time we have allotted for our question and answer session  Allow me to hand the floor back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks Jess Lubert

192073,413589,JNPR,Juniper Networks Will Stabilize in 2020  Then Get Back to Real Growth,news,"Networking equipment maker Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  reported earnings Monday evening  The report  which covered the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal year 2019  edged out Wall Street s estimates thanks to  encouraging trends  in several key segments of Juniper s business 
Juniper Networks  fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Juniper Networks  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Juniper s routing revenue fell 4 6  year over year to  424 million due to soft orders from large scale communications service providers  The service provider weakness should abate in the coming quarters as Juniper rolls out several new products in its edge routing portfolio 
On the other hand  switching sales rose 17  to  267 million  The company is enjoying strong interest in high end switching products from enterprise customers  Juniper s management expects this trend to continue  giving the company a solid growth vector in the hyperscale data center market 
Security sales fell 3  to  100 million  but that s still a hefty 24  rebound from the trough seen in the third quarter 
 We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our connected security strategy  which focuses on bundling security with our traditional networking platforms   CEO Rami Rahim said in the fourth quarter earnings call   We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend  

Betting on better days ahead
Encouraged by healthier order trends in the fourth quarter  Juniper funneled  200 million into share buybacks while also boosting its sales and marketing budget by 10   The stock has fallen 14  over the last 52 weeks  which amplifies the efficiency of Juniper s buyback program 
The generous stock repurchasing policy in the face of lower share prices also underscores the move as a vote of confidence  Management sees sunnier days ahead  to the point where share buybacks are viewed as a good use of Juniper s own cash  It s also a relatively low risk idea since Juniper s stock is trading at just 14 times trailing earnings today 
But there s no need to rush into buying Juniper today    Rahim sees 2020 as a year of stabilization rather than growth  5G networks and increasing infrastructure investments across the telecom industry should provide strong growth catalysts in 2021 and beyond  but these long term prospects will take some time to materialize ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pobv9,2070280
192074,413590,JNPR,Why Juniper Networks Will Stagnate Despite Its Cloud Recovery,news,"During the fourth quarter  Juniper Networks has shown signs of recovery  The network vendor posted results in the high end of guidance thanks to the strength of its cloud and enterprise segments  But despite forecasts of revenue and non GAAP  adjusted  earnings growth in 2020  the company s operating leverage seems limited  and you should not expect any significant improvement before 2021  
Cloud recovery versus service provider challenges
Juniper s fourth quarter revenue increased to  1 21 billion  up 2 3  year over year  This expected performance marks an important step in the company s recovery after nine consecutive quarters of revenue decline 
The company s challenging cloud business seems to be at an inflection point  Juniper had been struggling with its legacy MX routers  network devices that forward data between networks  that didn t match the expectations of the giant cloud providers such as Amazon com with Amazon Web Services or Microsoft with Azure  But with its transition to its new PTX routers that offer superior flexibility  programmability  and performance  Juniper seems to have improved its offerings for those cloud providers 
As a result  revenue from the company s cloud business reached  279 8 million  up 17 8  year over year  And management expects low  to mid single digit growth in 2020 in this segment  
In contrast  the company is still struggling with its service provider segment  which includes sales to wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators  Revenue from service providers dropped to  492 5 million  down 4 6  year over year 
Juniper is facing the lumpiness of this segment  which depends on a few huge customers  six out of 10 of the company s largest customers are service providers   And technologies like 5G and 400G high speed data networks represent tailwinds that won t materialize in the short term  

Weak revenue growth and stable margins in 2020
Despite the company s improving cloud business  management expects revenue to grow by only 1  in 2020  This outlook seems weak given the easy comparison  Revenue in 2019 dropped 4  compared with 2018 
In addition  management expects gross margin to remain flat and operating expenses to increase  which would result in tiny non GAAP  adjusted  earnings growth  
The company s lower gross margin compared with its peers Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  and Arista Networks  NYSE ANET  indicates Juniper lacks pricing power  Despite its smaller revenue base  Arista Networks  gross margin remains much higher than Juniper s 
In addition  during Juniper s Q4 2019 earnings call  management announced that operating expenses will increase in 2020 to support the company s investments  which would leave Juniper s operating margin well below Cisco s and Arista s 

Data source  Juniper Networks  Cisco Systems  and Arista Networks
Looking forward
Despite these challenges  management expressed confidence in the company s stronger growth beyond 2020  But these forecasts remain uncertain because of the intensifying competition  
Cisco s new strategy to address its weaknesses with cloud titans represents an extra threat for Juniper  Cisco now proposes disaggregated network software and hardware  competing with Juniper s similar existing offering  In addition  Cisco also now sells its own silicon architecture  the brain of a network device   which is something Juniper doesn t plan to offer so far  The success of Cisco s new chip remains uncertain  but the lack of presence of Juniper in this market could reduce its competitiveness 
Juniper s management highlighted significant synergies between its Wi Fi business and its enterprise portfolio  Combined wired and wireless solutions provide customers with integrated management and consistent network solutions from a single vendor  But the competition in this market is intensifying since Arista  which has shown great success in the cloud area  started expanding its portfolio in 2018 to address that market 
As a result  because of its weak revenue growth and low margins  Juniper looks cheap versus its competitors

But despite its recent recovery  Juniper must still show it can grow its revenue and margins in the context of an intensifying competitive environment  Thus  investors should wait for stronger signs of improvement before getting involved with this tech stock ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pog9f,2070648

192310,413826,JNPR,Analysts Estimate Juniper Networks  JNPR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 19 billion  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper 
For Juniper  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Juniper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Juniper would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 48  delivering a surprise of  4 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Juniper doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-juniper-networks-jnpr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200500082,200500082

What s Next for Juniper 
While Juniper has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Juniper was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

superior rural broadband coverage  In addition  a  5 billion deal with Dish Network for divesting Sprint s prepaid wireless businesses  including Boost Mobile  and some of its spectrum cleared the decks for the formation of a new entity in the wireless industry     The all stock merger will help accelerate development of faster 5G wireless networks driven by operational synergies and extended customer base on shared infrastructure assets  The New T Mobile will have a strong closing balance sheet and a fully funded business plan with a strong foundation of secured investment grade debt at

192329,413845,JNPR,Earnings Preview  Juniper Networks  JNPR  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 14 billion  down 3 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 32  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper 
For Juniper  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Juniper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Juniper would post earnings of  0 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

192333,413849,JNPR,Earnings Preview  Juniper Networks  JNPR  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 11 billion  down 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper 
For Juniper  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Juniper will beat the consensus EPS estimate

in the year earlier quarter Non GAAP net income for the reported quarter was  92 7 million or 26 cents per share compared with  99 5 million or 28 cents per share a year ago  This year over year decrease was due to weak sales performance and lower operating margin  The company s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents Weak Cloud and Service Sales Lower RevenuesQuarterly total net revenues were  1 001 7 million  down 7 5  from  1 082 6 million in the prior year quarter  This was primarily due to weakness in cloud and service provider businesses  which more than offset

192348,413864,JNPR,JNPR Vs  IDCC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Wireless Equipment sector might want to consider either Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  or InterDigital  IDCC   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Juniper Networks and InterDigital are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that JNPR has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
JNPR currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 45  while IDCC has a forward P E of 106  We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 2 34  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  IDCC currently has a PEG ratio of 7 07 
Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P B ratio of 1 81  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  IDCC has a P B of 2 48 
Based on these metrics and many more  JNPR holds a Value grade of B  while IDCC has a Value grade of D

This computer network equipment maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 13 12  
For the last reported quarter  Juniper came out with earnings of  0 59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 57 per share  representing a surprise of 3 51   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 44 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 54 per share  delivering a surprise of 22 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Juniper  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Juniper currently has an Earnings ESP of  10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

192383,413899,JNPR,Juniper Networks  JNPR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  987 29 million  down 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper 
For Juniper  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Juniper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Juniper would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  3 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

192391,413907,JNPR,Telecom Stock Roundup  Nokia Faces EU Probe  BlackBerry s Q4 Earnings   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed an overall downtrend as uncertainty regarding U S  China trade negotiations persisted  An apparently sluggish pace of discussions and the resultant listless pace of reforms in China are seemingly eroding the patience of the U S  firms as they gear up for 5G transformation across the country  As the industry awaits an early resolution to the prolonged bilateral talks to better focus on the impending 5G boom  efforts are on to give a final push to a mutually acceptable trade deal that is easily enforceable Both the United States and China seem eager to walk the extra mile to reach a consensus decision that honors domestic obligations and international commitments  The U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have resumed discussions with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He in Washington this week  Although the White House has qualified the talks as encouraging and  making good headway  for a probable settlement within this month  the enforceability of the purported deal remains the latest stumbling block  China has reportedly agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director  vice minister and minister to keep a tab on its deal commitments  However  the Communist nation is resisting univocal U S  powers to re impose tariffs unilaterally if it revokes the trade agreement and Beijing s inability to retaliate on such occasions with its own punitive measures Per the latest report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association  which represents the U S  wireless communications industry  both the United States and China are currently on equal footing for 5G readiness  This represents a marked improvement from the last year when the United States was trailing way behind China and South Korea  This was made possible through continued investments from the industry and a prod from the top policymakers to update networks faster  With a holistic top down approach  the United States was able to expedite the process to set up the required infrastructure and back it up with testing and launching of early networks in key locations  As the battle for 5G supremacy intensifies  it remains imperative for the United States to clinch a favorable deal that would help it achieve the coveted technological dominance Regarding company specific news  antitrust regulatory cases  earnings  strategic restructuring and

192404,413920,JNPR,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Juniper Networks,opinion,"Juniper Networks  Inc    NYSE JNPR   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for JNPR broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 5 4  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for JNPR stock 
If that wasn t enough  JNPR isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  10 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for JNPR  You can see

192411,413927,JNPR,Juniper Networks  JNPR  Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 59 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 57 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 53 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 51   A quarter ago  it was expected that this computer network equipment maker would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of 22 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Juniper  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  posted revenues of  1 18 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 56   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 24 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Juniper shares have added about 4 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Juniper 
While Juniper has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

192432,413948,JNPR,Why Is Juniper  JNPR  Down 3 8  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR   Shares have lost about 3 8  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Juniper due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Juniper Beats on Q3 Earnings Despite Soft RevenuesJuniper reported better than expected results in third quarter 2018  wherein both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Its financial performance was primarily driven by sales growth in Enterprise business  decrease in total cost of revenues and income tax benefit Net IncomeOn GAAP basis  net income increased to  223 8 million or 64 cents per share from  165 7 million or 43 cents per share in the year earlier quarter despite softer revenues  primarily due to lower operating costs and income tax benefit Non GAAP net income for the reported quarter was  191 million or 54 cents per share compared with  211 1 million or 55 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The year over year decline was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and reduction of expected tax liabilities from tax accounting method change  However  non GAAP earnings per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents RevenuesNet revenues were  1 179 8 million compared with  1 257 8 million in the prior year quarter  down 6 2  primarily due to decrease in sales in Service Provider and Cloud business  However  the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 174 million Product revenues  comprising Routing  Switching and Security  and accounting for 67 4  of total net revenues  decreased 8 6  year over year to  794 7 million due to lower demand for routing products  Service revenues  accounting for 32 6  of total net revenues  were down 0 8  year over year to  385 1 million due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 Geographically  net revenues increased to  329 9 million from  298 6 million in EMEA  Europe  Middle East  and Africa  supported by healthy performance in Enterprise business  Quarterly revenues in the Americas decreased 11 8  year over year to  643 1 million due to decline in Service Provider and Cloud business  For Asia Pacific  net revenues decreased 10 1  to  206 8 million By vertical  net revenues from Cloud business declined 27 5  year over year to  250 million as several of the company s customers are running their networks harder and the pace of cloud deployments are proceeding more slowly than it was previously anticipated  Net revenues from Service Provider business were down 5 8  to  543 6 million due to lower customer strength  Net revenues from Enterprise business climbed to  386 2 million from  336 million driven by solid demand for the company s enterprise routing portfolio  as new solutions like the MX204 and MX10003 are witnessing success in previously unserved markets Other DetailsNon GAAP operating margin decreased year over year to 20  from 23 5   While quarterly capital expenditures were  31 6 million  depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to  48 8 million Cash Flow and Balance SheetJuniper generated  648 7 million of cash from operations in the first nine months of 2018 compared with  1 046 7 million in prior year period As of Sep 30  2018  the company had  2 501 7 million of cash and cash equivalents with long term debt of  1 788 6 million Q4 OutlookJuniper is anticipated to return to growth in the fourth quarter but the mid point of its revenue guidance reflects a year over year decline due to the slower pace of expected deployments in the Cloud business   The company expects tariffs on Chinese imports to have no direct impact on its fourth quarter results  However  customer buying behavior could be affected and gross margin could be slightly impacted The company expects revenues of approximately  1 220 million       30 million  for the fourth quarter  Non GAAP gross margin is projected to be around 60       1    Non GAAP operating expenses are expected to be nearly  490 million       5 million   The company expects non GAAP operating margin to be around 20  at the midpoint of revenue guidance  While non GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 18   non GAAP net income is anticipated to be approximately 57 cents per share      3 cents   assuming a share count of nearly 350 million Looking ForwardDespite some short term challenges in the market particularly within the cloud vertical  Juniper expects encouraging developments in many areas of its business that augur well for its long term growth prospects  The company remains optimistic about the potential of its MX5G offerings  which it plans to begin shipping early next year Also  Juniper is excited about new and expanding partnerships with firms like Nutanix and Ericsson  BS ERICAs  as this will provide competitive edge over alternative offerings  It is in the early stages of ramping several important new innovations  such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and the SPC3 line cards for its high end SRX firewall  both of which began shipping in the third quarter Juniper is on the verge of introducing the industry s first 400 gig product and is well positioned to gain incremental market share as cloud  service provider and enterprise customers look to meet surging bandwidth requirements

The Dow Industrials hit another record high  even as the NASDAQ suffered a sharp drop 
The U S  economy s growth rate last quarter was revised upward to the fastest in three years on stronger investment from businesses and government agencies than previously estimated   grew at a 3 3  annualized rate  est  3 2    revised from 3  
The performance  achieved despite two devastating hurricanes  marked the fastest expansion in gross domestic product since a 5 2 percent annual spurt in the third quarter of 2014  Consumer spending  which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy  continues to be the main driver of growth  though revisions showed it was slightly weaker than previously estimated on purchases of both durable and nondurable goods 
The biggest improvement came in business investment  which made a 1 2 percentage point contribution to growth  In addition to greater spending on transportation equipment  the data also reflected more software spending  Nonresidential structures were revised to a bigger decline  While the first look at third quarter gross domestic income showed a pickup  the prior quarter was revised downward by 0 6 percentage point  reflecting a smaller gain in wages and salaries 
Price data in the GDP report showed inflation remains behind the Fed s 2 percent goal  Excluding food and energy  the central bank s preferred price index tied to personal spending rose at a 1 4 percent annualized rate last quarter  Gross domestic income  adjusted for inflation  rose 2 5 percent after a downwardly revised 2 3 percent gain in the prior three months  second quarter wages and salaries were revised downward by  26 5 billion 
The GDP report is the second of three estimates for the quarter  the third is due in December 
The pending home sales index  which measures signed contracts to buy existing homes  rose 3 5 percent for the month  but is still 0 6 percent lower than October 2016  That is the highest level since June  Sales were strongest in the South  jumping 7 4 percent for the month and 2 percent compared with a year ago  That was likely due to pent up demand after two major hurricanes 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen delivered her final testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill  Yellen said the country s economic expansion had broadened and strengthened  and that she expected the growth to continue  Yellen was careful to say that the economy could be doing better  She noted that the pace of economic growth remained slow by historical standards 
The two major determinants of growth  the number of workers and the productivity of the average worker  are rising slowly  She said   Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment and capital formation  improve the nation s infrastructure  raise the quality of our educational system  and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies  
She did not offer an opinion on tax policy but warned that debt to GDP ratios   around 75    were high  though not excessive  She added   It s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night   In response to a question  Yellen added   The equity of the tax code is important and should be taken into account  
She also said changes in fiscal policy could affect how quickly the Fed raises rates  Fed officials have drawn a careful distinction between tax cuts that increase economic capacity   for example  by encouraging business investment   and tax cuts that provide a short term sugar high  such as cuts in personal income taxes that would likely increase spending 
The Fed estimates that the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace  A short term stimulus  therefore  would likely raise inflation  In turn  the Fed could seek to offset faster inflation by raising interest rates more quickly 
Also  today  at the ASU Economic Forecast Luncheon in Phoenix  San Francisco Fed President John Williams delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy  and falling unemployment is expected to put pressure on inflation  eventually  Williams anticipates the Fed will keep raising interest rates gradually 
Williams said   The next time you see a headline about stubbornly low inflation  you can smile to yourself  knowing that the mystery isn t all that mysterious after all  With the economy doing so well this year and based on the historical pattern  I expect to see a rise in inflation in 2018   In a Q A session  Williams said the Fed does not have plans to issue digital currency  but the central bank is interested in the underlying technology and is actively researching it 
Yesterday  Bitcoin hit  10 000  This morning it hit  11 000   but by the end of the day it was back around  9 290  Wild ride doesn t begin to describe it  Trading volume was a whopping  9 75 billion over the last 24 hours  according to CoinMarketCap  compared to  2 26 billion for digital currency Ethereum  The heaviest selling came amid reports of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges  If it looks like a bubble  and walks like a bubble  and charts like a bubble  
If bitcoin is a bit too crazy for you  starting in 2018  investors can dump their money into deeply unBogle like  totally non passive Vanguard exchange traded vehicles with flavors like volatility  momentum  value  and  for some reason  low liquidity  That s right  actively managed ETFs 
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other key producers  including Russia  meet on Nov  30 to discuss whether to continue to limit production to drain global inventories to help push up prices  They cut production by 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  in January and agreed to hold down output until March  The market had expected OPEC to extend the limits by another six to nine months  but this is now less certain 
The Supreme Court heard arguments today on whether police need a warrant for cellphone location data in a case that could reshape digital privacy protections  The defendant in the case was convicted of participating in a series of robberies  based in part on records provided by his cellular carrier showing his movements over several months  The defense lawyer said prosecutors had violated the Fourth Amendment  which bars unreasonable searches  by failing to get a warrant for the information 
The court s decision in the case  Carpenter v  United States  will apply the Fourth Amendment  drafted in the 18th century  to a world in which people s movements are continually recorded by devices in their pockets and cars  by toll plazas and by transit systems  A ruling in Mr  Carpenter s favor could revise a fundamental Fourth Amendment principle  that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they voluntarily turn over information to a third party  like a phone company 
Recent Supreme Court decisions have expressed uneasiness with allowing the government to have unfettered access to vast amounts of digital data  By the end of arguments  at least five justices seemed prepared to limit the government s power to obtain records from cellphone companies showing their customers  locations over long periods of time  But there was no consensus about a rationale for a decision or about how far the court was prepared to go to reshape longstanding constitutional doctrines that allow the government to obtain business records held by third parties 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has advised Wells Fargo s board of directors that it is weighing a formal enforcement action against the bank over improprieties in its auto insurance and mortgage operations  In a letter this month  the OCC said Wells had willingly hurt customers in the two businesses and had until November 24 to respond  The OCC letter said Wells repeatedly failed to fix problems in a broad span of areas  not just auto insurance and mortgage lending

192481,413997,JNPR,Super Bowl Shock  How This Small Cap Stole The Show,opinion,"Oh  what a night 
Three weeks ago  Tom Brady marched his New England Patriots to perhaps the most thrilling comeback victory in Super Bowl history 
At halftime  pop diva Lady Gaga put on a captivating concert for the raucous in house crowd and millions watching around the world 
As you may know  the Super Bowl routinely draws more than 100 million viewers every year 
And from an investment standpoint  brand name companies that get  face time  on the tube   in the game or through commercials   often see a tangible boost in share price after the big game 
But this year  the biggest Super Bowl driven stock pop wasn t from a well known brand 
Instead  it s a tiny tech services company that trades for just under  6 a share 
Senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez brings you all the details below 
Data  The Backbone of Modern Civilization
In the developed world  data play an ever increasing role in people s daily lives 
Personal computers  cellphones  cars that connect to the internet   you name it 
But perhaps the only thing more critical to our data driven lives than the data are the speed and reliability to access them 
This is especially true for businesses that rely on networks to get their job done 
So as you can imagine  the providers of today s network technology are very valuable companies 
In fact  the enterprise network equipment market is expected to hit  30 6 billion by 2020  according to a report from Strategyr 
Most tech investors are familiar with the big names in the networking tech game  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO    Juniper Networks Inc  NYSE JNPR   and Arista Networks  NYSE ANET  
But these mature large caps won t provide you with the kind of explosive returns on which you can retire early 
Instead  here s a network tech company that could do the trick 
Unlock Extreme Profits in a Small Cap Package
Extreme Networks Inc  NASDAQ EXTR  is a networking solutions provider focused on enterprise clients 
Its products include modular ethernet switching systems  high density Wi Fi equipment and management software 
But what really gave the company visibility was Extreme s multiyear deal with the NFL for Wi Fi and analytics software 
Extreme not only provided the Wi Fi infrastructure for the Super Bowl in Houston  but also deep analytics on network usage to the NFL 
For instance  Extreme reported that a record breaking 11 7 TB of data were transferred over the network at NRG Stadium during the Super Bowl 
The company also managed to handle 27 191 peak concurrent users onto the network   another record 
Perhaps the most important record broken was that of speed  Extreme s network sustained a throughput of 3 5 GB for more than five hours  with spikes up to 5 2 GB and 4 8 GB during the pregame and halftime shows  respectively 
Extreme s successful second year as the NFL s Super Bowl network services provider has translated into positive results for shareholders 
In the last year  shares have gained a whopping 130   That s more than four times that gain of the Nasdaq in the same period 
And the price action is backed by solid fundamentals  too 
The company has generated earnings growth of 45    well above the 4 7  industry average 
Over the last three years  Extreme Networks has averaged 21  revenue growth  nearly double the industry rate 
And despite the rapid growth  the stock still trades at just 1 1 times trailing sales   a 35  discount to the peer average 
Not bad for a company sporting a market cap of just  622 million 
So if you re after  extreme  network tech profits  think small to earn big

Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Focus

Due to an upbeat earnings expectations  shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are currently trading near a 52 week high  The company is expected to report sales at  12 59 billion 
HP Enterprise is potentially looking at selling their software division to Thoma Bravo  The deal as of now will be valued between  8 to  10 billion  according to Reuters  and shares were up Thursday as a result  This looks to weigh on the report as well  though investors should also consider the industry rank heading into the release 
HP Enterprise s industry  Computer Integrated Systems  is currently ranked in the top 39  according to the Zacks Industry Rank  While the broader computer industry continues to face headwinds thanks to the growth of mobile and the decline of desktop use  HP Enterprise seems to be a more formidable spot since the company is relying on the growth of management software  infrastructure solutions  and technology services including cloud solutions to power its growth

192506,414022,JNPR,FireEye  FEYE  Q2 Loss Lower Than Expected But Stock Down,opinion,Shares of FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   lost over 17  in afterhours trading yesterday after the company s second quarter 2016 revenues and billion fell short of management s guidance  Furthermore  a weak guidance for the third quarter and a downbeat full year outlook raised investor concerns regarding the company s future prospects Nevertheless  FireEye s bottom line results were encouraging to some extent  The cyber security solution provider posted adjusted loss  excluding one time items but including stock based compensation  of 68 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 80 cents On a year over year basis too  FireEye s adjusted loss narrowed by 10 cents per share mainly on the back of cost optimization initiatives On a GAAP basis  the company reported a loss of 86 cents per share  marginally narrower than the year ago loss of 87 cents RevenuesFireEye s second quarter revenues surged 18 9  year over year to  175 million  The improvement was primarily driven by a large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter  Notably  the company closed 40 transactions with an individual value of over  1 million and added 308 new customers during the quarter However  quarterly revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  181 million as well as the company s own guidance range of  178  185 million  FireEye believes that the revenue miss was mainly due to slower than expected services growth resulting from changes in the threat environment  FireEye hinted that some organizations might be opting for good enough solutions instead of shopping for the best  which is dampening its sales Segment wise  Product revenues tanked 17 9  year over year to  40 8 million  Subscription and Services revenues  on the other hand  surged 37 7  to  134 3 million  driven mainly by continued transition to subscription and cloud based offering Billings increased 10  to  196 4 million but remained below management s guidance of  200 million to  215 million Operating ResultsAdjusted gross profit jumped 30 6  from the year ago quarter to  119 2 million  Gross margin improved 40 basis points  bps  to 68 1  Adjusted operating expenses increased 4 3  to  225 5 million  The company posted adjusted operating loss of  106 3 million  which was 8 9  narrower than the year ago loss of  116 6 million Adjusted net loss for the second quarter was  109 5 million  or 68 cents per share  compared with the year ago net loss of  119 million or 78 cents Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFireEye exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of roughly  916 8 million  Accounts receivable were  124 3 million  compared with  141 2 million at the end of first quarter  During the first half of 2016  the company used  35 6 million of cash for operating activities GuidanceFireEye has revised its guidance for the full year  It lowered its revenue guidance range to  716 million and  728 million  mid point   722 million  from the previous projection of  780  810 million  mid point   795 million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  794 7 million is higher than the mid point of management s guided range Non GAAP billings are now anticipated to be between  835 million and  855 million  down from the earlier guidance of  975  1 055 billion  Non GAAP operating margin is now projected to be  26  to  28  of revenues  which is worse than its previous guidance range of  22  to  24  The company now expects loss to be wider than its previous guidance  Non GAAP net loss per share is expected to be between  1 28 and  1 32  mid point  1 30   compared with the earlier projection of  1 20  1 27  mid point   1 235  For the third quarter  FireEye anticipates revenues in the range of  180 million to  186 million  mid point   183 million   much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  207 9 million  Non GAAP billings are expected in the range of  200 million to  215 million  Non GAAP operating margin is projected to remain in the range of  25  to  27  of revenues  The company expects non GAAP loss per share of 30 32 cents  mid point  31 cents  FIREEYE INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Our TakeFireEye  headquartered in Milpitas  CA  is a global provider of web  email  file and malware security to enterprises and governments  Although the company s bottom line results fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues fell short of the same due to changes in the threat environment and organizations opting for good enough security solutions instead of the best in class The company also lowered its full year revenue and non GAAP earnings guidance Despite persistent macro uncertainty  the company appears optimistic due to a healthy security market  strong product line up  deal wins and investment plans  which should boost results in the long run Furthermore  FireEye s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging  The latest of such transactions was the iSIGHT Partners buyout during the first quarter  The deal has beefed up FireEye s cyber security suite and enhanced its competitive dynamics FireEye has also taken over Invotas  a firm specializing in improving response times post a cyber attack  Its product  Security Orchestrator  is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs Furthermore  FireEye recently launched FireEye Essentials  a lower cost  simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management Platform  It is targeting smaller  mid market companies with the new offering All these moves indicate FireEye s efforts on moving beyond the enterprise level  end point protection products it had initially started with  These factors are also likely to aid the company s long term results However  an uncertain economic environment  competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks Inc    NYSE PANW   and Juniper Networks Inc    NYSE JNPR    and currency headwinds remain concerns Currently  FireEye carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Paycom Software Inc    NYSE PAYC   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ,2016-08-04,Zacks Investment

192520,414036,JNPR,Goldman Sachs Downgrades Blackberry To Sell ,opinion,"Shares of Blackberry  NASDAQ    fell slightly on the morning of March 9th after Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  analyst  downgraded her rating on the stock from Neutral to Sell and cut her price target from  10 to  9 BlackBerry Ltd  NASDAQ BBRY   has seen a huge positive turnaround since John Chen took over as CEO in November 2013  with share price having risen over 60   As a result  the company set expectations for itself to become cash flow positive this year One of the reasons for Blackberry s turnaround is due to its shift of focus from smartphones to software  Back in November  Blackberry launched its BES 12 platform that was designed for businesses that connects with all mobile devices  including all Blackberry phones  They even got 5 1 million licenses to sign up for a free trial of its platform until the end of January Jankowski s downgrade stems from her fear that it will be challenging for Blackberry to shift from cuttings costs to save money to actually driving revenue despite the success the company has seen over the last year  Accordingly  the analyst forecasts widening losses in fiscal 2016 and 2017 Jankowski lists two reasons for why she expects Blackberry s losses to widen 

 First   Goldman Sachs   surveys show very low buying intentions for BlackBerry s EMM solution  Second  its target implies that it would leapfrog the market leaders in just one year  which  she  view s  as unlikely given the competitors  much better traction  based on our survey    She added   While we see significant upside in Hardware revenues  those are  empty calories  as they are not profitable  Thus  we see widening losses based on the shortfall in high margin Software and Services revenues  

Simona Jankowski has an overall success rate of 64  recommending stocks and a  13 4  average return per recommendation  She has rated Blackberry 31 times since April 2009  earning an 88  success rate recommending the company and a  30 8  average return per BBRY recommendation Jankowski is known for rating stocks under the technology sector  such as Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  and Infinera  NASDAQ     She has rated Cisco Systems 15 times since April 2009  earning an 83  success rate recommending the company and a  16 2  average return per CSCO recommendation  Likewise  the analyst has rated Infinera 4 times since September 2010 with a 100  success rate recommending the stock and a  51 4  average return per INFN recommendation However  Jankowski is not always accurate with her recommendations  She has rated Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  8 times since March 2011 with a 20  success rate recommending the stock and a  29 7  average loss per JNPR recommendation There has been a lot of buzz surrounding Blackberry over the last year as to whether the company can turn things around  Do you trust Simona Jankowski s bearish recommendation based on her financial advice history ",2015-03-09,Carly Forster,https://www.investing.com/analysis/morgan-stanley-downgrades-blackberry-to-sell-amidst-speculation-of-turna-244417,244417
