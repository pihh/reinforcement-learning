177478,398994,AES,Australia s solar  wind boom to power past grid woes in 2019,news,"By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE  Reuters    Australia s wind and solar boom looks set to power through 2019 following a record year  despite grid constraints and extra scrutiny from network operators to make sure new projects don t spark blackouts like ones that hit two years ago   Abundant wind and sun  falling turbine and panel costs  and corporate demand for contracts to hedge against rising power tariffs have attracted dozens of international developers looking to build wind and solar farms Down Under   Even though the developers have met with flip flops on energy policy  a strained grid that has trouble integrating intermittent renewable power  and unexpected hook up costs  they still see Australia as a growth market    We believe that we have a great future in Australia  because we have the right answers   said Xavier Barbaro  Chief Executive of France s  Neoen   PA NEOEN   whose biggest market is Australia   Companies like Neoen  its compatriot Total Eren  PA TOTF   India s Adani  NS ADEL   U S  utility AES Corp  N AES  and Germany s Sonnen are expanding in Australia  looking to fill a gap as ageing coal fired plants are retired over the next two decades    Confidence is high as the industry enters 2019  with unprecedented levels of construction activity under way   said Anna Freeman  a director at the Clean Energy Council  an industry group   Australia generates nearly 20 percent of its electricity from renewables  This is forecast to jump to 75 percent over the next 20 years   A total of 14 7 gigawatts  GW  of large scale solar and wind projects worth A 20 billion   14 billion  were under construction or reached financial close last year  more than double 2017 s record  according to the Clean Energy Council    Graphic  Australia s renewable power     This rush of projects  with no clear guidance on where they best fit  led to an  element of anarchy   but that is changing  said Simon Currie  founder of advisory firm Energy Estate  The Australian Energy Market Operator  AEMO   the energy council and network companies are working out clear guidelines on where to build plants and how to connect them to the grid    We re moving from what was an opportunistic based approach     into something that will be much more planned   said Currie  whose company wants to develop Australia s biggest renewable energy hub  with 4 GW of wind  solar and pumped hydro capacity in New South Wales   Renewable projects added to the grid have grown from 22 with 1 2 GW of capacity in 2013 to a record 45 projects with 2 9 GW added in 2018  AEMO said  There are 114 more applications representing 15 9 GW pending  indicating plenty of potential congestion ahead   The biggest challenge is that developers are all vying to connect to a grid running 5 000 km  3 100 miles  from Queensland in the north to South Australia and Tasmania    See graphic    This grid was designed to deliver power mainly from always on coal fired plants near three big mining areas  while wind and solar farms generate intermittent power from more remote sites  where network capacity can be limited   To keep the grid stable  equipment such as  synchronous condensers  or batteries need to be added  which can increase costs by at least  20 million for a condenser alone  Batteries could be much higher   Developers who failed to account for these issues have run into delays on project approvals or grid hook up  bringing unanticipated costs  which in one case  led to the collapse of engineering firm RCR Tomlinson  AX RCR  last November    Graphic  Solar power needs the sun     HOOK UP HICCUPS  A Clean Energy Council survey of senior executives in December found grid connection is the biggest industry concern heading into 2019  Freeman said   UK based solar investor Octopus Investments said grid issues were what took it two years to choose its first investment in Australia  The Darlington Point solar farm is about to begin construction and will be the country s largest    The grid is the biggest issue where assets fail in our project filter   Octopus Managing Director Sam Reynolds told Reuters  declining to name projects the company rejected   Developers and project lenders said they need to consider grid congestion  which can curtail power that gets to the network from any one plant  intermittency of wind and solar power  which affects current flow  and transmission losses  called marginal loss factors  MLFs     There s a bit of nervousness around MLFs  curtailment  and then there s construction and commissioning risk   said Stephen Panizza  head of renewable energy at Federation Asset Management   MLFs measure energy lost over power networks and have been increasing  with renewable projects being on the outer reaches of the grid  weakening returns for some operators   Another factor is the cost of the extra technology to keep current steady on the grid as more intermittent power is added   In November  France s Total Eren  PA TOTF  agreed to buy a synchronous condenser to secure a connection agreement so it could build the A 330 million Kiamal solar farm in Victoria   Delays due to talks with AEMO about the condenser  however  led to Total Eren losing one of its power purchase agreements  PPAs    Total Eren s Asia Pacific director  Michael Vawser  says other projects will face the same trouble    I do think there are other projects     caught off guard by new grid regulations that will lose their PPAs through delays in being allowed to connect to the grid   Vawser told Reuters in an interview in November   Neoen  which has built 1 GW of wind and solar farms and the world s biggest battery in Australia over the past four years  said in a recent prospectus it had collected 14 million euros   16 million  in damages from a contractor building three solar farms because of hook up delays   Despite the challenges  Neoen  Total Eren and their rivals are still scouring Australia for more opportunities   Australia is still an attractive market for us   Vawser said

177479,398995,AES,Renova Energia CFO out after Light divestiture  failure to sell Brazil wind farms,news,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO  Reuters    The CFO of Brazilian renewable energy firm Renova Energia SA  SA RNEW11  resigned and a key shareholder gave up its stake after failed talks to sell heavily indebted wind farm projects 
Renova Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Corr a de Barros will temporarily assume the responsibilities of outgoing Chief Financial Officer Claudio Ribeiro  the company said on Monday 
Separately on Monday  Renova shareholder Light SA  SA LIGT3  said it had sold its 17 17  stake in the firm to an investment fund for a symbolic value of 1 real 
The exits of Light and Ribeiro follow years of unsuccessful talks to sell Renova s wind farm projects  which have racked up debt and raised concerns about their timely completion 
Negotiations to sell the projects to  AES Tiete Energia SA   SA TIET11   a subsidiary of AES Corp  N AES   broke down last week after six months of discussions 
Renova has been trying to sell some of its wind projects for more than two years  Before AES  the company was in talks with Canada s  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc  TO BAMa   which ended with no agreement in July 2018 
BTG Pactual analysts said  construction related risks  seemed to be the reason for AES Tiete to walk away from the deal  citing meetings with executives 
The result is negative for Light and state controlled power holding company Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais  SA CMIG4   Cemig   said the analysts led by BTG Pactual s Joao Pimentel in a note to clients written before Light sold its stake 
Cemig had a debt exposure of 768 million reais   186 million  to Renova  Light had 253 million reais  Analysts say that if no other buyer shows up  the only solution would be for Cemig and Light to step up and finish the projects 
But Light has signaled the intention of not taking over with the sale of the stake to a fund 
The projects owe 960 million reais   233 million  to state development bank BNDES  analysts said ",2019-10-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/renova-energia-cfo-out-after-light-divestiture-failure-to-sell-brazil-wind-farms-1995939,1995939

177520,399036,AES,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Valero  Marathon  Phillips 66  QUALCOMM And AES,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO    Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    QUALCOMM Inc    NASDAQ QCOM   and The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog 5 High Yield S P 500 Stocks to Buy for 2020U S  stocks have surged way beyond analysts  expectations so far this year  And as 2019 wraps up  the broader S P 500 index is up more than 20  and is headed for its biggest annual gain since 2013  A global shift in monetary policy coupled with progress in the U S China trade deal helped stocks scale upward But  the bull run may slow down next year  if history is any guide  According to research firm Bespoke Investment Group  the S P 500 index has been able to yield a muted return of 6 6   on average  in the year following a rally of 20  or more since 1928 Market pundits believe that there are quite a few reasons for the U S  stock market to not continue the double digit annual returns next year  This is primarily because the U S  stock market currently seems to be overvalued  trading at around 19 times earnings  and thus doesn t have much room to scale And how can we forget that the United States for most part of next year will face political uncertainty  eventually leading to gyrations in the stock market  But  it s not just political risks that should bother investors  Rapid increase in government borrowing along with threat of more taxes and stringent regulations may jeopardize the U S  stock market performance The U S  tech sector  in the meantime  has helped the broader U S  stock market climb north since the 2008 financial crisis and significantly outdo all other major equity markets  Thanks to the FAANG stocks and their adaptation of technologies  including AI and cloud computing  the tech sector has gained But now  FAANG stocks are facing increasing threat of regulation  leading to make us believe that such stocks may not perform well in the near future  And with it  the broader stock market may underperform  By the way  Joseph Davis  who serves as Vanguard s chief economist  sees a 50  chance of a stock market correction or a 10  drop in 2020 These S P 500 Dividend Players Should Make 2020 a

177548,399064,AES,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   December 11  2019  Revised ,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose AES    NYSE AES     which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 70 1 2 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs

177550,399066,AES,AES Or UTL  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Utility   Electric Power sector might want to consider either AES  AES  or Unitil  UTL   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  AES has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Unitil has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AES is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
AES currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 15  while UTL has a forward P E of 26 77  We also note that AES has a PEG ratio of 1 67  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  UTL currently has a PEG ratio of 6 14 
Another notable valuation metric for AES is its P B ratio of 2 33  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  UTL has a P B of 2 51 
Based on these metrics and many more  AES holds a Value grade of A  while UTL has a Value grade of D 
AES stands above UTL thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that AES is the superior value option right now ",2019-12-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-or-utl-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200492897,200492897

In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose AES  AES   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 70 1 2 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you

When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you arrive at age 70 1 2 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  To figure out a particular RMD  you should divide your earlier year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Example  Ann is 70 and must take her first RMD in the year she reaches age 70 1 2  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount of the RMD that Ann must withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 70 1 2

The AES is a member of our Utilities group  which includes 121 different companies and currently sits at  4 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst

177623,399139,AES,AES  AES  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
AES in Focus
Headquartered in Arlington  AES  AES  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 9 41  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 14 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 45   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 2 84   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 93  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 55 is up 5 8  from last year  In the past five year period  AES has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 35   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  AES s current payout ratio is 44   This means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for AES for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  1 34 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 8 06  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  AES presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-aes-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200472725,200472725
177627,399143,AES,AES  AES  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"AES  AES  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 97 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 68  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AES 
For AES  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 47  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AES will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AES would post earnings of  0 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 26  delivering a surprise of  3 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AES appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-aes-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200480247,200480247

177670,399186,AES,AES Vs  UTL  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Utility   Electric Power stocks have likely encountered both AES  AES  and Unitil  UTL   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both AES and Unitil have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
AES currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 43  while UTL has a forward P E of 26 32  We also note that AES has a PEG ratio of 1 35  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  UTL currently has a PEG ratio of 6 04 
Another notable valuation metric for AES is its P B ratio of 1 86  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  UTL has a P B of 2 44 
These metrics  and several others  help AES earn a Value grade of A  while UTL has been given a Value grade of C 
Both AES and UTL are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that AES is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-vs-utl-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200461972,200461972

177699,399215,AES,Why AES  AES  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
AES in Focus
Headquartered in Arlington  AES  AES  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 13 28  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 14 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 33   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 2 9   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 55 is up 5 8  from last year  In the past five year period  AES has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 19 62   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  AES s current payout ratio is 44   meaning it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
AES is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  1 34 per share  with earnings expected to increase 8 06  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  AES is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-aes-aes-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200431010,200431010
177700,399216,AES,AES  AES  Q2 Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"AES  AES  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 27 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 25 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 70   A quarter ago  it was expected that this power company would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 28  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
AES  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  2 48 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 03   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 54 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AES shares have added about 12 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 5  
What s Next for AES 
While AES has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AES was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 37 on  2 96 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 34 on  10 86 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Utility   Electric Power is currently in the bottom 37  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-aes-q2-earnings-and-revenues-miss-estimates-200451265,200451265
177701,399217,AES,AES  AES  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"AES  AES  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AES is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AES  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AES
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this power company is expected to earn  1 34 per share  which is a change of 8 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AES  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

177702,399218,AES,Is AES  AES  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today

AES is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 24  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AES s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 2 31  Over the past 52 weeks  AES s PEG has been as high as 1 75 and as low as 1 18  with a median of 1 42 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is AES s P B ratio of 1 79  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 89  AES s P B has been as high as 2 18 and as low as 1 53  with a median of 1 89  over the past year 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  AES has a P S ratio of 0 96  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 13 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in AES s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  AES looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-aes-aes-stock-undervalued-right-now-200456794,200456794
177703,399219,AES,AES Vs  UTL  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Utility   Electric Power sector have probably already heard of AES  AES  and Unitil  UTL   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both AES and Unitil have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
AES currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 48  while UTL has a forward P E of 25 68  We also note that AES has a PEG ratio of 1 35  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  UTL currently has a PEG ratio of 5 89 
Another notable valuation metric for AES is its P B ratio of 1 86  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  UTL has a P B of 2 39 
These metrics  and several others  help AES earn a Value grade of A  while UTL has been given a Value grade of C 
Both AES and UTL are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that AES is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-vs-utl-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200456777,200456777
177717,399233,AES,AES  AES  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects AES  AES  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 72 billion  down 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 6  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AES 
For AES  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AES will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AES would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AES doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-aes-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200413043,200413043
177719,399235,AES,Fed Keeps Rates Flat  Reaffirms Patient Stance  6 Great Picks,opinion,"At the end of its latest two day policy meeting  the Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates unchanged  The central bank acknowledged the improvement in economic conditions but also noted that inflation is running below its targeted level  The White House has said time and again that sluggish inflation necessitates further easing from the Federal Reserve 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quick to characterize sluggish inflation as temporary and reaffirmed the freedom of the central bank from political interference  However  the central bank also hinted that rates will likely remain unchanged this year    
Rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from a soft rate environment  This is why it makes sense to park your funds in real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utility stocks  which also offer attractive dividends  
Federal Funds Rate Remains Flat  Technical Cut Effected
The Federal Reserve has opted to keep the federal funds target rate unchanged in the 2 25 2 5  band  Such a move was in line with market expectations  though President Trump had urged the central bank to cut rates  citing sluggish inflationary conditions  At the same time  it made a key technical adjustment in order to keep the benchmark rate near the mid point of the target range 
The Fed reduced the interest paid on excess reserves of banks by 0 05  to 2 35   Before it embraced the new dovish stance  the central bank had been hiking the reserves and funds rate at the same time  This had caused the benchmark rate to move toward the ceiling of its target range 
Sluggish Inflation a Worry  Patient Stance in Place
The Fed s policy statement reflected current economic conditions  indicating that growth remains strong  At the same time it acknowledged that inflation remains sluggish  Per the statement   market based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months  
The central bank stated that overall and core inflation  have declined and are running below  its targeted level of 2   Powell believes that this level of sluggishness is transitory  predicting inflation will approach its targeted level over time  But the central bank remains comfortable with its current policy stance 
This is exactly why the Fed reiterated that it  will be patient as it determines  the path of benchmark rates  While the White House s wish for a near term cut may not come to a pass  chances of a rate hike taking place this year are nearly negligible 
Since the start of this year  Powell has stated that he is satisfied with the state of the U S  economy  However  the Fed Chair has argued that he was in  no hurry  to hike rates given the headwinds that the global economy is facing 
These risks have diminished somewhat recently  But indications from China that it will reduce stimulus  opting instead to implement structural changes indicate that they continue to linger in the background 
Our Choices
The Federal Reserve s latest policy statement provides enough reason to believe that rates will likely remain flat this year  Further  the central bank has reaffirmed that it will remain patient when taking a call on the future path of rates

177753,399269,AES,What Makes AES  AES  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on AES  AES   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for AES basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for AES imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AES
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this power company is expected to earn  1 33 per share  which is a change of 7 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AES  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

177777,399293,AES,Analysts Estimate AES  AES  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when AES  AES  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 71 billion  up 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 59  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AES 
For AES  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AES will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AES would post earnings of  0 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  20 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AES doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-aes-aes-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200390262,200390262

Both AES and OGE Energy have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
AES currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 04  while OGE has a forward P E of 17 64  We also note that AES has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  OGE currently has a PEG ratio of 3 41 
Another notable valuation metric for AES is its P B ratio of 1 71  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  OGE has a P B of 1 84 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AES s Value grade of A and OGE s Value grade of C 
Both AES and OGE are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that AES is the superior value option right now ",2018-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-vs-oge-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200354824,200354824
177797,399313,AES,AES  AES  Surpasses Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"AES  AES  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 35 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 29 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 24 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 20 69   A quarter ago  it was expected that this power company would post earnings of  0 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering a surprise of  10 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
AES  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  2 84 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 29   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 63 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AES shares have added about 39 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 4  
What s Next for AES 
While AES has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AES was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 39 on  2 71 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 21 on  10 90 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above  10 billion  Considered a more stable option  large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts 
While value stocks have lower than average price to earnings and price to book ratios  they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates  Considering long term performance  value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets  however  they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets 
Costs
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 07   making it one of the least expensive products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 4 02

What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes  a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment 
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency 
But  there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds  these funds track non cap weighted strategies  and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market 
This kind of index follows this same mindset  as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk return performance  non cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics  or a mix of such characteristics 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns

177858,399374,AES,Is AES Corporation A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AES Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AES Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AES Corporation has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AES Corporation stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AES Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  AES is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AES Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AES Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AES Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives AES a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The AES Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAES Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 24  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical

177905,399421,AES,Should You Sell AES Corporation  AES  Before Earnings ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because AES Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AES in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 22 cents per share for AES  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AES  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4 76  heading into earnings season The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that AES has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for AES Corporation  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-sell-aes-corporation-aes-before-earnings-200205340,200205340
177931,399447,AES,Is AES Corp   AES  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AES Corp  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 21  This level compares considerably favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 06 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts AES Corp  s current PE near its median  which stands at 11 16  over the observed period  Also  the current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the period  suggesting some level of undervalued trading in light of its own historical trend Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 06  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AES Corp  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 86  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AES Corp  stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AES Corp  has a P S ratio of about 0 54  This is lower than the Zacks categorized Utility   Electric Power industry average  which comes in at 1 20 right now If anything  LAZ is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AES Corp  currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AES Corp  a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for AES Corp  is just 2 17  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 28  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 63  which is far better than the industry average of 7 25  Clearly  AES is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AES Corp  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives AES a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  AES Corp  seems to have pretty striking prospects Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward revisions and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had no impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter and current year estimates have remained constant over the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The AES Corporation Price and Consensus   This stable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAES Corp  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past year  the Zacks Utilities   Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already

177998,399514,AES,5 Utility Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential,opinion,"With the S P 500 finally in positive territory year to date  we took a look at what s been working in 2016  Topping the list is the Utility sector  which has been the go to sector for income investors  and even non income investors in this volatile market 
Healthcare  formerly the leading sector for quite a while  has fallen out of favor  thanks to political headline risk due to prescription overpricing by some firms  meanwhile  the Utility sector is up over 12  in 2016  leading all others by a wide margin  Even the resurgent Energy sector  which is up 12  over the past month  trails Utilities by a wide margin 

With all of the strong price performance in the Utility sector  we wondered if there were any dividend stocks left that weren t already above their consensus analyst price targets  We came up with these 5 stocks  which range in size from small caps Otter Tail and Empire District  to large cap Dominion Resources 

Granted  these stocks aren t far from their average target prices  but compare where they re at to the overall Utility sector  which is nearly 6  above its average price target  All of them have outperformed the S P 500 year to date 

Dividends  Our High Dividend Stocks By Sectors Tables now tracks these 5 stocks and their current yields  in the Utilities section  NASDAQ OTTR has the highest dividend yield  at 4 36   with one of the lower dividend payout ratios in the group  All but NYSE EDE have higher than average dividend payouts  However  they do have a higher than average dividend payout ratio 

Options  Want some  sauce on the side  with your dividends  NYSE AES appears to have the most attractive covered call option yields  The AES May  12 00 call strike pays a bid price of   30  Couple that with the   11 share dividend which goes ex dividend around 4 29 16  and you get a 3 53  yield in around 2 months  or 21 11  annualized 

The  12 00 call strike  being   38 above AES s  11 62 price share  leaves you some room for potential price gains 

With the price gains these stocks have had  you might also want to consider selling cash secured puts below their price share  in order to get a lower breakeven 

Valuations  As usual in a group of stocks  it s a mixed bag for valuations  OTTR sports the lowest Price Book  whereas AES has the lowest Price Sales and Forward P E valuations 

Financials  OTTR also has the lowest Debt Equity ratio  and most of its other metrics are better than industry averages 

When it comes down to it  hiding out in a defensive sector may not be such a bad idea in 2016  which has the uncertainty of the US Presidential election  and the possibility of more Fed rate hikes  both of which could serve to continue rattling the market in the future  For now  the 5 week rally  inspired by crude oil s comeback   at least until the upcoming April 17th OPEC meeting   and the additional ECB stimulus  may possibly give you a pullback to take advantage of in some Utility stocks  as investors take on more risk
