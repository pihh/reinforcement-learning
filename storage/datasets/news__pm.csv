3769,225284,PM,Altria Focuses On Pricing   RRPs Amid Low Cigarette Volumes ,opinion,With cigarette volumes reducing due to stern regulations and consumers  rising health consciousness  Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   has been focusing on aiding its performance through strong pricing and reduced risk products  RRPs  Declining Cigarette Volumes a ConcernDeclining cigarette sales volume has been a concern for Altria   During the third quarter of 2019  total smokeable product shipment volumes declined 6 5  from the prior year quarter  Reported domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 6 6  year over year due to adverse trade inventory movements  the cigarette industry s rate of decline and retail share losses  Cigarette shipment volumes are being affected by anti tobacco campaigns and increased consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of tobacco consumption  Regulatory hurdles are also a vital factor limiting the marketing of cigarettes  thereby adversely impacting its sales volume The tobacco industry has been facing many challenges as governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies  which in turn are lowering cigarette consumption  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  In fact  per court orders  Altria along with other cigarette makers like Phillip Morris   NYSE PM   has been directed to put up self critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking To add to the woes  the FDA is now bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels  Apart from these  the FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended by the agency to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah   Moreover  the European Union and the FDA proposed a ban on menthol following the Tobacco Control Act  which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health  Additionally  the agency raised concerns regarding the consumption of e cigarettes among youth Growth Efforts UnderwayRising health consciousness has pushed consumers toward low risk  smokeless tobacco products  Altria has been responding to the changing market scenario by offering several RRPs  In this respect  the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Altria and Philip Morris  pertaining to the sale of IQOS in the United States  has been approved by the FDA  Additionally  Altria  through its subsidiary Helix Innovations  completed the acquisition of an 80  stake in certain companies of Burger Group  which is engaged in the commercialization of the oral tobacco derived nicotine  TDN  pouch product   on Further  Altria is making efforts to expand in the cannabis industry  This is evident from the acquisition of stakes in the Canadian cannabis company  Cronos Group  for nearly  1 8 billion  We expect Altria s efforts to strengthen presence in the nascent but booming cannabis space to boost growth in the forthcoming periods  Markedly  revenues from the smokeless product category have been steadily rising  During the second and the third quarters of 2019  revenues in the unit advanced 4  and 5 8  year over year  respectively Apart from this  Altria s strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry  even in the face of declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to a decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  In third quarter 2019  higher pricing aided performance of the smokeable and smokeless segments  In fact  higher pricing was a prime catalyst for top line and adjusted OCI growth in the quarter and is expected to boost performance in the days ahead All said  let s see how far these initiatives can help Altria completely offset the aforementioned woes  Notably  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has gained 13 8  in the past three months compared with the  s

7208,228723,PM,Philip Morris  life insurer Reviti looks to Japan s vaping market,news,"By Noor Zainab Hussain
 Reuters    Philip Morris   N PM  new UK life insurer  Reviti  is looking to take its  get a discount if you vape  model to Japan  where the tobacco giant has a more than 70  share of the heat not burn market 
Reviti Chief Executive Dan Pender told Reuters that the insurer was spending time looking at the Japanese market because it has a significant number of people who smoke and boasts many vaping products 
 We think the Reviti proposition would work extremely well for Japanese consumers   he said 
Most insurers have long treated smokers and vapers the same  meaning they can pay close to double the premiums of non smokers  Reviti  however  offers a discount of up to 15  for vapers in Britain  Customers who quit tobacco and nicotine altogether get a discount of up to 50  
Pender said the insurer was working with a number of established Japanese insurers and looking at how to launch 
Philip Morris  iQOS heat not burn product dominates Japan  which has emerged as a fertile test ground for the vaping industry  offering opportunities for the start up insurer to grow 
 British American Tobacco   L BATS  has said it would launch two new tobacco heating products in Japan 
Pender said Reviti could disrupt the market in Japan  where most life insurers work on aggregate rates  meaning they do not distinguish between smokers and non smokers in terms of prices 
 If you ve got somebody who is a heavy smoker and they say I kind of know smoking is bad for me  but my insurance premium is the same for someone who doesn t smoke  explain that to me   he said 
Reviti s move to Japan comes as deaths in the United States from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping have risen to 52 
Health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e cigarettes help smokers to quit  and have led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil ",2019-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/philip-morris-life-insurer-reviti-looks-to-japans-vaping-market-2041142,2041142
7209,228724,PM,Special Report  FDA targets e cigs that hook teens but don t help smokers quit,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    E cigarette makers face an existential threat  By May  they must submit applications to the U S  Food and Drug Administration proving that their products provide a net benefit to public health  If a company fails to make its case  the FDA has the power to order its products off the market  The agency will judge that benefit with a two part test  Are e cigarettes effective in getting smokers to quit  And  if so  does that benefit outweigh the health damage to new e cigarette users   including teenagers   who never smoked in the first place  That s a particularly high hurdle for the largest e cigarette maker  Juul Labs Inc  according to a Reuters analysis of the latest available data on trends in cigarette and e cigarette use from the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  The data show that e cigarettes are having little impact in reducing U S  cigarette smoking  while growth in vaping since 2015 has come entirely from users under 25 years old  including teenagers  Those trends present a special problem for Juul because of its dominance of the U S  market and its enormous popularity among teenagers  according to more than a half dozen tobacco researchers and medical experts who assessed the data at Reuters  request   I don t see it as a surmountable hurdle   Suzanne Colby  a tobacco researcher at Brown University  said of the FDA standard for public health benefits   The data look like their product differentially attracts youth instead of adults  in such great numbers   Between 2017 and 2018   the period when Juul rapidly grew to become the U S  market leader   e cigarette use among U S  adults grew from 2 8  of the population to 3 2   according to the CDC  But rates of cigarette smoking among adults barely budged  dropping from 14  to 13 7    not enough to be statistically significant  according to the CDC   For a graphic showing vaping trends for various age groups  see     Use of e cigarettes by high school students  by contrast  shot up by 78  over the same period   from 11 7  to 20 8  of students  data from the CDC and the FDA show  Juul is by far the most popular e cigarette among teens  with more than half of high school and middle school students naming it as their favorite brand in surveys by the CDC and the FDA  Moreover  the biggest growth in adult e cigarette use came among the youngest age cohort of adults  people aged 18 to 24  E cigarette use among young adults is nearly four times more common than among those aged 45 to 64  the CDC numbers show  Another dynamic that undermines the public health case for e cigarettes is the large proportion of  dual users   The most recent federal data show that 41  of adult e cigarette users continue to also smoke cigarettes   Some studies show dual use could be more harmful than smoking alone  A study last December found people who used both products tested higher than cigarette smokers for a range of volatile organic compounds and other toxins associated with tobacco related disease  A separate study last year of heart disease risk among e cigarette users found that dual use was  more dangerous than using either product alone   For the industry as a whole  the usage data cast serious doubts on whether e cigarettes are providing a clear benefit among adult smokers  said Brian King  a deputy director at the CDC s Office on Smoking and Health   When it comes to net public health impact  you have to consider both ends of the scale   King said   Right now it does appear the youth initiation is outweighing the adult use   Juul declined a request for an interview with executives including CEO K C  Crosthwaite  a veteran of Marlboro maker  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc who took the helm in September  on how it plans to pass the FDA s regulatory test  As pressure on the company has mounted  Crosthwaite has made the FDA application process a central goal  laying off 650 employees  including many in marketing  last month in an effort to restructure the company to focus on regulatory approval  In written responses to questions from Reuters  Juul said it believes its products  already are playing a critical role in transitioning adult smokers from combustible cigarettes and have the potential to convert tens of millions of smokers in the U S   The company cited studies it has commissioned showing that between 30  to 50  of adult smokers who use Juul  switch completely from smoking cigarettes within six months   Juul has said its customers are  the world s 1 billion smokers   but the company did not directly address questions about the disparity in youth and adult uptake in the United States  Juul acknowledged it must address any potential impact on nonsmokers who start using e cigarettes  It said it is  committed to working cooperatively with regulators  public health officials and other stakeholders to combat underage use and convert adult smokers   In October  Crosthwaite brought on another Altria executive  Joe Murillo  who helped navigate a successful FDA application for IQOS  a Phillip Morris International Inc product that heats up but doesn t burn packages of ground up tobacco  Altria has an agreement with Philip Morris  NYSE PM  to market IQOS in the United States  The IQOS device is one of only two tobacco products that have successfully made it through the FDA process  Juul s competitors in the U S  market face the same regulatory challenge  One rival  Japan Tobacco International  says it is confident in the FDA application it filed in August for its Logic products because it contains company data showing the brand   unlike Juul   is used overwhelmingly by older adults  Anthony Hemsley  an executive for Japan Tobacco International s U S  division  acknowledged the population wide trends in e cigarette and cigarette use  But he pointed out that the FDA s decision on net public health benefit will be made on a product by product basis   not across the entire industry  He added that Juul has  a significant challenge ahead of them  in overcoming the concerns that exist out there    The FDA declined requests for an interview with Mitch Zeller  who heads tobacco regulation at the agency  about its oversight of e cigarettes  In written answers to questions  the agency did not directly address the population level data on smoking and vaping trends but said it is  tasked with threading a public health needle  in crafting regulations on e cigarette firms  A Reuters investigation in November detailed how Juul s developers used tobacco industry research and patents to formulate its smooth but potent  nicotine salts  blend of liquid nicotine  a key factor in its popularity among teenagers  The report showed company leaders were aware of the product s popularity among teenagers soon after its 2015 launch  contradicting statements that Juul was caught off guard by teenage use last year  Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Reuters that he agreed with public health advocates and tobacco researchers that whatever benefits Juul may be having for cigarette smokers are offset by attracting children who otherwise wouldn t have tried other tobacco products  Before Gottlieb left the department in April  he and his staff explored the option of halting sales of Juul and similar high nicotine devices if their popularity continued rising among teens   We could take these products off the market tomorrow   he said   We don t need the applications     For a graphic tracking the rise of vaping amid regulatory delays  see     Juul and the FDA did not respond to questions on Gottlieb s assertion that the agency should immediately remove Juul and similar products from the market    MOUNTING PRESSURE ON THE FDA E cigarettes have been available in the United States since at least 2007  but the FDA did not formally get authority over the industry until nine years later  in 2016  The agency initially tried to regulate e cigarettes as a drug  which would have carried more stringent requirements for e cigarette firms  such as extensive clinical trials or animal testing  E cigarette makers sued the FDA and won  leaving the agency to regulate the devices as tobacco products  FDA officials started crafting a rule to regulate e cigarettes in 2011  but the industry pushed back and successfully delayed the rule until May 2016  in the final months of the administration of President Barack Obama  During that time  Juul and dozens of competitors introduced products that were grandfathered into the market because they were already being sold before the regulation took effect  The rule extended certain cigarette restrictions to e cigarettes  like requiring health warning labels  setting a minimum sales age of 18 and prohibitions on free samples  A key part of the new rule also required e cigarette makers to submit applications to the agency by August 2018   demonstrating why their products provide a net benefit to public health   along with studies and data on potential toxins in the products  When Gottlieb was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the agency in 2017  one of his first moves was to delay that deadline by four years  a decision public health advocates criticized  Just months later  school administrators  parents and politicians raised alarms about the rapid rise of vaping among high schoolers  who were particularly transfixed with the Juul device  Some public health advocates feared the new administration s commitment to the Obama era regulations after an initial three month delay  as the FDA faced litigation from the industry  Gottlieb declined to comment  on whether the some in the administration wanted to kill the regulations but said his effort to push them forward was  not an easy process   He said he delayed the deadline because the previous administration had not drafted guidelines that companies could follow for the application process  leaving the agency open to a legal challenge from the regulated industries   They would have sued me  and I would have lost   he said  But today s FDA could   and should   pull Juul and other products from the market  Gottlieb said   I thought that s where the agency would land   he said  In March  just before he left the agency  Gottlieb said publicly that the FDA was considering prohibiting sales of cartridge based e cigarettes like Juul from the market if teen usage rates went up for a second year in a row  Federal youth tobacco survey data first released in September showed that teenage usage did in fact keep rising  with the percentage of teenagers reporting they used e cigarettes in the last 30 days growing from nearly 21  to more than 27   In a statement  the FDA said it has sent more than 1 100 warning letters to retailers selling to minors  issued warning letters to companies marketing teen friendly e cigarette products  such as those with sweet flavors  and launched advertising campaigns aimed at e cigarette prevention in schools  
 Taken together  all of these efforts have had a wide ranging impact on the manufacturing  marketing and selling  of e cigarettes  the agency said   FDA s work is constant in its effort to keep these products out of the hands of kids  ",2019-12-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-fda-targets-ecigs-that-hook-teens-but-dont-help-smokers-quit-2043861,2043861
7210,228725,PM,Special Report  Why big business can count on courts to keep its deadly secrets,news,By Michelle Conlin  Dan Levine and Lisa Girion NEWARK  New Jersey  Reuters    In the dreary archives of a Newark  New Jersey  courthouse  Ronald Motley found a treasure map  It was an evidence log  a detailed inventory of documents and other exhibits that had been used in an injured worker s lawsuit  And it was freely available to anyone who bothered to look for it   for this was long ago in 1978  before the routine use of protective orders  sealed documents and other tools of concealment wrapped U S  courts in lethal secrecy  Motley  a lanky  deep drawling South Carolina lawyer  had been representing sick workers in lawsuits against companies that used asbestos  And he was losing  as defense lawyers convinced juries that the companies had only recently learned of the dangers of the cancer causing mineral  Now  the log might guide him to proof that the companies had long known that asbestos exposure could be deadly  The proof came in a carton of documents that had belonged to Sumner Simpson  once president of manufacturer Raybestos Manhattan Inc  The documents exposed a conspiracy of suppression and silence among multiple companies even as workers sickened and died   I think the less said about asbestos   Simpson wrote in a 1935 letter to a lawyer at another company   the better off we are   Motley shared the documents with other plaintiff lawyers and with Los Angeles Times reporter Henry Weinstein  who was with Motley in Newark that day in 1978 and recounted the lawyer s discovery to Reuters  A member of Congress got them  too  In a matter of months  the Sumner Simpson papers unlocked what one prominent plaintiff lawyer had dubbed a new  industrial Watergate   Congress held hearings  workplace safety rules were enacted  workers won more lawsuits  and scores of companies  including Raybestos  declared bankruptcy  The companies set up victim trust funds that have paid out more than  30 billion in settlements and that continue compensating victims even now  Today  there s little chance a lawyer   or a journalist or a concerned citizen   could do what Motley did  That s because in the intervening decades  big business and its legal lieutenants succeeded in a focused  concerted campaign that has ensured that secrecy cloaks lawsuits alleging that their products can kill or injure people   The federal judiciary s commitment to open justice has come under sustained attack by corporate lawyers and lobbyists   said Representative Hank Johnson  a Georgia Democrat and member of the House Judiciary Committee   Corporations are allowed to hide evidence that they sacrificed their customers  health and safety in the name of corporate efficiencies   The asbestos settlements   the biggest mass tort in U S  history by number of claims   ushered in a wave of product liability litigation  Suddenly  corporate America had a new problem  myriad demands from plaintiff lawyers for internal records that could expose executives to broad scrutiny for what they knew and failed to do about potential threats their products posed to public health and safety  A CLOSED SYSTEM In response  the corporate defense bar and its allies transformed the taxpayer funded courts into a much more closed system  according to a Reuters review of hundreds of judicial policy documents and court filings and dozens of interviews  The corporate lawyers found ready support from judges and court staff overwhelmed by all the litigation and the paperwork it produced  Over the years  they threw a blanket of confidentiality over discovery  the pretrial exchange of information between opposing sides  They turned protective orders into pro forma exercises to muzzle lawyers who might otherwise share pertinent information with regulators or the public  And they succeeded in getting judges to routinely seal court filings  thus ensuring that when lawsuits are settled before trial  as usually happens in product liability cases  the evidence remains hidden  The toll is high  Hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly harmful products after judges in recent years allowed litigants to file under seal  beyond public view  evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to the dangers  The secrecy allowed drug makers to market painkillers as safe while the body count from the opioid related epidemic mounted  auto makers to sell cars with lethally weak roofs that killed people in rollovers though tests had years earlier revealed the risk  gun maker Remington to knowingly sell rifles with bum triggers that killed scores of people  Had today s secrecy friendly court rules been in place 40 years ago  the evidence log Motley found in Newark wouldn t have been filed publicly  Even if he had found the Sumner Simpson papers by other means  he almost certainly couldn t have shared them as he did  And had he filed them in court to support his case  Raybestos would very likely have requested   and been granted   a court seal  The forces of secrecy wore down the longstanding norm of openness in the judicial system by exploiting a pivotal Supreme Court decision and lobbying Congress and the obscure but powerful panel that sets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  They argued that U S  businesses had a right to privacy similar to what individuals enjoy  and that limiting that right threatened the foundations of American free enterprise  They said it was the courts  responsibility to protect companies from the unfair and damaging publicity that can arise from unproven allegations that their products are dangerous  As a Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co lawyer told Congress in 1994  such allegations cause  substantial harm  not only to defendants  but also to the public because they are misleading  Among the most forceful fighters for secrecy was lobbyist Al Cortese  Companies defending against lawsuits need protective and sealing orders to contain costs  prevent negative publicity and safeguard trade secrets and intellectual property  Cortese said in an interview  Now retired  Cortese remains a true believer in the cause  Company files are not public information  even when they are a part of a public court case  he said   It s private information  and therefore there is a right to protect that information in litigation   It s a fundamental principle   As Reuters revealed earlier in this series  judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in dozens of the biggest defective product cases consolidated in federal court over the past 20 years  Those cases comprised nearly 250 000 individual death and injury lawsuits  involving drugs  cars  medical devices and other products used by millions of consumers  Broadly worded protective orders gave the parties the power to mark almost any document as confidential in 45 of the cases  After Reuters published its first report on court secrecy  U S  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said at a hearing on transparency in the courts that he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act  Prior versions of the bill would have allowed litigants to share evidence related to public health and safety with regulators  regardless of protective orders  Those earlier bills  introduced regularly over the past 30 years  stalled amid opposition from business groups that argued the legislation would increase the costs and burdens of civil litigation  Judge Richard Story  speaking for the federal judiciary at the September hearing  did not dispute Reuters  findings  He acknowledged that judges sometimes fail to scrutinize sealed documents  as required  to determine whether secrecy is justified   That can happen   he said   I will be honest with you   TRADITION OF TRANSPARENCY When plaintiff lawyers like Ron Motley started suing the asbestos industry on behalf of dying workers in the 1970s  the federal courts were radically different  They operated under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as drafted in the 1930s by a committee of lawyers and law school professors  They imbued the rules with the tradition of open trials that had evolved over centuries of Anglo American common law  The rules on public access to the courts also reflected the progressive politics of the era  said Stephen Burbank  a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School  Progressives believed that transparency was essential for public institutions to govern effectively and that secrecy impaired the public s ability to gauge whether the courts decided cases fairly  Burbank said   The spirit of the times calls for disclosure  not concealment  in every field   law professor Edson Sunderland  one of the drafters of the rules  wrote in 1925  When the original rules took effect in 1938  they required litigants to file key forms of pretrial discovery in court  This included witness depositions  which are interviews conducted under oath  and written answers and documents produced in response to requests for information from opposing parties  It was because of these rules that a New Jersey plaintiff lawyer publicly filed the evidence log Motley later found in Newark  Motley then went back to court and filed a motion that compelled Raybestos to turn over the Sumner Simpson papers  To address conflicts between the public interest in transparency and privacy rights  the rules allowed for protective orders  Originally  the rules allowed judges to decide on a case by case basis what deposition subjects could be shielded from scrutiny  The rules were refined in 1970 to specify that protective orders cover anything that could be a source of  annoyance  embarrassment  oppression   including trade secrets  such as the formula for Coca Cola  NYSE KO   By the late 1970s  some defendants sought protective orders  but the tactic was far from routine  A few courts had even begun to invalidate them  ruling that they ran afoul of the constitutional right to free speech by gagging plaintiffs and their lawyers from disclosing evidence of alleged malfeasance  Because no protective order stopped Motley from quickly making the Sumner Simpson papers public  the documents had immediate impact beyond the courtroom  At the time  the asbestos industry was lobbying in Congress for a bill that would have mandated that the government pay some workers  claims  essentially foisting the cost on taxpayers  The evidence that companies knew of the health risks for decades undercut their efforts  and the bill never advanced  said John Lawrence  former top staffer for then Congressman George Miller  Within months of Motley s discovery  the California Democrat featured the Sumner Simpson papers in hearings  HIGH COURT EFFECT Six years after Motley s discovery  an unexpected Supreme Court decision ended the legal debate over protective orders and handed the defense bar a new weapon to beat back a rising wave of product liability cases  The case  Seattle Times v Rhinehart  had nothing to do with defective products  An obscure religious group called the Aquarian Foundation had obtained a protective order to keep its membership rolls secret during discovery in a lawsuit it had filed against the Seattle Times  The newspaper appealed to the high court  and the case caught Justice Lewis F  Powell Jr s attention  Decades of work as a corporate defense lawyer had made Powell a rich man by the time President Richard Nixon named him to the high court in 1971  His clients had included the tobacco industry  and he had served as a director of cigarette maker Philip Morris  NYSE PM   grappling at the time with the release of research showing that tobacco causes cancer  Two months before his nomination  Powell s passionately pro business views informed a secret memo he wrote for the U S  Chamber of Commerce  titled  Attack on American Free Enterprise   In it  he warned that American capitalism was under attack not just from  the Communists  and  New Leftists   but also  perfectly respectable elements of society   including  the college campus  the pulpit  the media  the intellectual   as well as consumer advocate Ralph Nader  Powell urged the Chamber to build a roster of  attractive  speakers  scholars and media handlers to defend  our side   Civil rights  labor and consumer rights groups were winning cases  often at business  expense   Powell wrote   Other organizations and groups  recognizing this  have been far more astute in exploiting judicial action than American business   On the bench  Powell had been voicing concern about the growing burden of discovery on the U S  legal system   particularly in complex cases   when Seattle Times v Rhinehart came before the court in 1983  As Powell read the clerk s memo briefing the justices on the case  he saw the clerk had characterized all information received by a litigant in discovery as  protected in some way  under the First Amendment s guarantees of free speech and thus more difficult to shield from the public  Powell marked that sentence with a question mark  according to the justice s notes  housed at the Washington and Lee University Law School  He and four colleagues voted to hear the case  A few days after oral arguments  eight of the nine justices voted to uphold a judge s order blocking the discovery documents from public disclosure  The original discovery order was  extremely broad   compelling the Aquarian Foundation to disclose its membership and sources of financial support  the justices ruled  Powell was assigned to write the opinion  Over the next three months  the justices debated how broadly the court should interpret the constitutionality of protective orders  At one point  Justice William Brennan  one of the court s liberal leaders  asked Powell to remove language from his draft opinion that flatly stated that pretrial depositions  are not public components of a civil trial   Powell refused   and that single line of prose became part of the legal foundation for every protective order that followed  Powell s language allowed the corporate defense bar to institutionalize protective orders in litigation across the country   shutting the public out of pretrial investigations as a matter of routine  even when the concealed discovery material could alert the public and regulators to potential danger  And protective orders have become an excuse for secrecy beyond discovery  Litigants routinely cite protective orders themselves as an argument for filing evidence in court under seal  thus ensuring that secrecy endures for the life of a case  Judges rarely object when litigants file evidence under seal  In 115 of the biggest mass torts over the past 20 years  judges sealed public health and safety information in about half of them  Most of the time  they failed to explain  as they are required to do  how the need for secrecy outweighed the public interest in transparency  Nader said that during his 1960s investigation into safety issues around the Chevrolet Corvair sportscar   the work that made him famous   some of the best evidence came from depositions filed in court or obtained directly from lawyers suing General Motors Co  NYSE GM   material that today would typically be hidden behind a protective order   I d call the lawyers and say I want the information  They d say  Sure you can have it  Just pay copy costs and we ll give it to you     The protective order that has since then become the norm  he said   is an abuse of the judicial process  It limits the case for the plaintiff  tilts the case in favor of the defense and deprives the public of potential life saving information   It s censorship by another name   THE IDEAL CANDIDATE A year after the Supreme Court s 1984 ruling in support of protective orders  a judge overseeing a wrongful death lawsuit against  Ford Motor Co  observed that the courts were being  bombarded by an ever increasing number of requests  for them  The defense bar s leading trade group  the Defense Research Institute  published a 1987 guide citing the Supreme Court s decision and urging corporate litigators to seek protective orders  even where defense counsel can make no special claim of confidentiality   In a statement emailed to Reuters  DRI said it supports  the legal right of clients to seek protective orders when circumstances dictate   The drive to limit transparency wasn t without pushback  Newspapers published investigations about the harms of court secrecy in individual cases in the late 1980s  and some elected officials  supported by the plaintiffs  bar  began to resist  They devised what corporate lawyers called  the perennial Kohl bill   which Senator Herb Kohl  a Wisconsin Democrat  introduced in the Senate for several years starting in the early 1990s  This proposed legislation   the precursor to the Sunshine in Litigation Act that Representative Nadler has pledged to reintroduce   sought to limit protective orders in cases that raise broader concerns about public health and safety  At the same time  big companies were facing a litigation crisis in the states  Judges and juries in what plaintiff lawyers called  magic jurisdictions  that tended to favor consumers   in states like Texas  Mississippi  West Virginia and Illinois   were giving rise to  runaway verdicts   recalled Tom Gottschalk  a onetime partner and now of counsel at Washington  D C   law firm Kirkland   Ellis who served as general counsel of General Motors Co from 1994 to 2006  Corporations needed an advocate  Gottschalk and others had the ideal candidate  Al Cortese grew up in a working class South Philadelphia neighborhood and earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962  He made his name defending corporations in price fixing cases  transforming himself into an impeccably tailored oenophile whose elegant appearance belied his attack dog style in court  Gottschalk had hired Cortese in 1984 to work on tort reform and other legislative issues  And by the 1990s  Cortese was leading what he called a  defense bar coalition  to influence state and federal policy makers to protect corporate privacy in product liability litigation   LET ME GET VERY BASIC  To Cortese   and the defense bar he represented   the idea that courts were hiding fatal secrets in their files was  nonsense   Rather  Cortese viewed the drive for more transparency in the courts as a publicity ploy by plaintiff lawyers and the media  Public regulators  Cortese argued  had ample power to seek information needed to protect the public  In an interview at his vineyard in Solvang  California  Cortese  now 82  segued easily into the aggressive style for which he is known as he explained the ideas behind his advocacy  At first  he laughed   Let me get very basic   he said   What is the public right to observe the legal system  What is it   Cortese smacked the table on his poolside patio to underscore his point   The right of the public to observe the court system means that they have a right to show up in court when there is a public trial  That is the extent of the public s right to observe   Discovery and other information in court files   that is private information  and the right of privacy protects the information constitutionally   Told that this wasn t what U S  appeals courts say  Cortese grew angry   Yes it is   he shouted   Because you are focusing on   In every case  judges  have to make this 123456 analysis   No  They  Don t   In his September testimony before the House Judiciary Committee  however  Judge Story made clear that documents filed in court are presumed to be public and that judges are obliged to justify secrecy   Only the most compelling reasons justify the nondisclosure of court records   Story said   A judge that grants a request to seal court records must set forth specific findings and conclusions that justify nondisclosure to the public   even if there is no objection to the motion to seal   As head of the defense bar lobbying team  Cortese set about batting back sunshine in litigation movements in the states  as well as furnishing the judges who presided over the federal civil rules advisory committee with academic opinions from top scholars who were friendly to the defense bar s case  Most important were the writings of Arthur Miller  a professor then at Harvard Law School and one of the most widely respected U S  legal experts  He became a darling of the secrecy set with a seminal 1991 law review article in which he argued that critics of court secrecy relied merely on anecdote  There was no data  he wrote  to prove that secrecy caused widespread harm  After their first meeting  Cortese sealed his friendship with Miller by sending him a case of mixed Barolo  Armed with the arguments of intellectuals like Miller  Cortese set his sights on Senator Kohl s latest attempt to get his sunshine bill passed  In a 1994 Senate hearing  Kohl argued passionately for transparency   Because the courts are public institutions funded by hundreds of millions of tax dollars  and because justice is a public good  our court system must also do its part to help protect the public when appropriate   he said   Far too often  however  the court system allows vital information that is discovered in litigation   and which directly bears on public health and safety   to be covered up  to be shielded from mothers  fathers  and children whose lives are potentially at stake  and from the officials we have appointed to watch over our health and safety   While debating Kohl s bill  Congress sought the expertise of Judge Patrick Higginbotham  then chairman of the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure  Cortese said he got to know him  too  Higginbotham made many of the same arguments advanced by Cortese and Miller  Judges should be left to monitor protective orders themselves  Kohl s bill would multiply discovery disputes in mass torts and would eat up too much of judges  time  Republican Charles Grassley from Iowa repeated the same talking points while arguing against the bill on the Senate floor  Higginbotham said neither Cortese nor anyone else had undue influence on his views  Grassley declined to comment  His office noted that the senator voted for versions of Kohl s bill in 2008 and 2011 that contained language to guard against  frivolous litigation   Kohl s bill failed by two votes  It has been introduced in every Congress since  and has failed each time  INTO THE SIDE ROOMS Beyond the courts and Congress  Cortese and the cadre of secrecy proponents focused their efforts on the federal court rules committee  In the late 1990s  the committee held a series of meetings to address the rules on what types of discovery material must be filed publicly   like the evidence log Motley found in New Jersey  Judges and court clerks had been complaining for years about the voluminous paperwork produced in discovery  particularly in mass torts  Clerks struggled to store and manage documents that could amount to millions of pages in a single case  At first  the judges and lawyers on the committee were cautious  They remembered the backlash that 20 years earlier had sunk a proposal to bar deposition transcripts and other discovery documents from the courthouse  Back then  the New York Times editorial page and politicians like Senator Edward Kennedy had decried the so called  Green Tree Rule  because they feared it would undermine transparency in the courts  This time  facing scant opposition  the committee got tough  changing an early draft proposal that discovery material  need not  be filed to say it  must not   When the committee gathered in Gleneden  Oregon  to vote on the rule  the room was stocked with lawyers and lobbyists representing companies facing product liability lawsuits  Among them was Cortese  who had become a fixture at the meetings  testifying and advocating on issues dear to the defense bar  The rules committee voted in favor of the change  and no members of Congress pushed back  Without fanfare or controversy  the amended  Rule 5d  took effect in 2000  Discovery was now closed off from the public for good  While some transparency proponents had pushed back on the proposed rule during the public comment period  no one from consumer advocacy groups  First Amendment organizations or media companies showed up for the committee s vote  according to minutes of the discussion  The impediment was resources  Nader said  Public Citizen  the consumer advocacy group he founded in 1971  filed testimony opposing the rule change  he said  but consumer groups were outgunned by their opponents  backed by corporations that could pay an army of expensive lawyers   They wear you down   he said   There will be ten hearings  and all you can go to is two  if you can pay to travel   PAST AND FUTURE By the time he died in 2013 at age 68  Ron Motley was one of the most prominent plaintiff lawyers in the United States  renowned for his courtroom theatrics and lavish lifestyle  In addition to securing settlements for more than 100 000 asbestos victims  he also belonged to the team of lawyers that battled Big Tobacco  resulting in a record  246 billion settlement  and later represented victims of the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  One of the first things he did with the Sumner Simpson papers was to persuade a South Carolina judge to reopen the case of asbestos insulator Gordon Luther Barnett  who had died in his 60s from mesothelioma  an incurable cancer of the tissue surrounding the lungs and other organs that is caused by asbestos exposure  In his decision to grant a new trial   the case was eventually settled   the judge cited the Sumner Simpson papers  The documents Motley found  he said  exposed  a conscious effort by the industry in the 1930s to downplay  or arguably suppress  the dissemination of information to employees and the public for fear of the promotion of lawsuits   His words  describing the tactics of businesses in decades past  were prescient of what was to play out time and again in the years ahead as secrecy enveloped the courts

7214,228729,PM,Could life insurance go up in smoke for some vapers ,news,"By Carolyn Cohn  Suzanne Barlyn and Noor Zainab Hussain LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Global reinsurers are stepping up their warnings to life insurer clients about the potential risks of vaping  putting pressure on underwriters to charge certain vapers higher rates than smokers  or even exclude them altogether  U S  authorities said last month that there had been 47 deaths this year from a lung illness tied to vaping  The health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e cigarettes help smokers to quit  and has led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil   Reinsurers insure the insurers  and often have large research arms which help their clients by modeling risk  They give broad advice to insurers  rather than specific policy or pricing recommendations  but can potentially refuse to provide reinsurance or can raise premiums if their guidance is ignored  Most insurers have long treated smokers and vapers the same  meaning they can pay close to double the premiums of non smokers or non vapers  But three major reinsurers have provided updated advice on vaping in the past three months  with new warnings  while others are considering their approach   The new warnings focus on young vapers and the vaping of liquids containing marijuana ingredient THC  which is legal and prevalent in some U S  states and has been linked to lung illnesses in the country  The shift in the reinsurance and insurance sector represents a further blow to the vaping industry  which markets its products as healthier alternatives to smoking    Hannover RE  DE HNRGn   which already advised life insurers to treat vapers like smokers  has asked them to be particularly cautious about insuring people aged under 25 following the  epidemic  of lung injuries in the United States  said Nico van Zyl  the reinsurer s U S  medical director  The question of whether to offer coverage to this higher risk group should be a consideration for life insurers  he said   French reinsurer SCOR  PA SCOR  said in a paper on Oct  24 that e cigarettes contain nicotine which may have toxic effects  including on brain development in teenagers and young adults  SCOR recommends life insurers treat vaping like smoking  and exclude individuals who use vaping products considered by U S  authorities likely to cause lung issues   namely  those containing THC  tetrahydrocannabinol    Swiss Re   S SRENH  also treats vapers like smokers  In addition  Global Chief Medical Officer John Schoonbee said the reinsurer has told insurers in recent months to make extra checks on whether vapers are using cannabis products    GRAPHIC  Insurers increasingly nervous about e cigarettes      AMERICAN WARNING The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people not to use e cigarettes containing THC  some of which contain vitamin E acetate  a  chemical of concern  among people with the vaping associated lung injury EVALI   Stephen Cooley  Chief Medical Underwriter at PartnerRe Life   Health  N PRE pf   said more research on the long term effects of vaping was needed and that life insurance rates for vapers would be the same as smoker rates  at best   Munich Re  DE MUVGn  and Gen Re said they were monitoring the recent developments in EVALI   Proponents of vaping as a tool to stop smoking say the insurers  and reinsurers  approach is harsh   Getting insurance is really expensive for people who have taken steps to quit tobacco   said Simon Manthorpe  CEO of British vaping product manufacturer Vapemate   Vaping in Britain and elsewhere in Europe is more heavily regulated than in the United States  Vapes containing THC or cannabis oil of any kind are banned in Britain  and Public Health England says vaping is at least 95  safer than smoking    GRAPHIC  Worldwide adult e vapour users rise      VAPING SWITCH Twelve of 13 life insurers contacted by Reuters in Europe  South Africa and the United States said they already treated vaping like smoking   Most have taken this stance for years  but a handful have recently made the switch to treating vapers like smokers  U S  insurer Prudential Financial  N PRU  made the change in October  while the Irish subsidiaries of  Aviva   L AV  and Zurich  S ZURN  have switched in the past year   Zurich in Ireland said its new approach followed consultation with reinsurers  Explaining their caution on vaping  Britain s Aviva and South Africa s Discovery  J DSYJ  said there was a lack of objective evidence of the long term effects  Justin Harper  head of protection marketing at British insurer LV   highlighted recent evidence indicating that vaping damages the lungs  Harper said a 20 year policy for a 35 year old offering 100 000 pounds   128 300  of life cover and 100 000 pounds of critical illness cover would cost 11 89 pounds a month for a non smoker non vaper  and 20 56 pounds for a smoker vaper  The life insurers told Reuters they were not treating young vapers differently  though Zurich said it was monitoring statistics on increased deaths or illness among this age group   One exception among the life insurers in its vaping view is Reviti  a new insurer owned by cigarette and e cigarette firm Philip Morris  N PM   It is offering a discount of up to 15  for vapers in Britain  Customers who quit tobacco and nicotine altogether get a discount of up to 50

market tobacco product application pathway and the subsequent commercial launch in Atlanta and Richmond under our licensing agreement with Altria  IQOS is now commercially available in 52 markets worldwide Let me now take you through the main elements of our full year results  starting with volume  Industry total volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units declined by 2   broadly in line with the historical trend and slightly better than our prior forecast of around 2 5   Our shipment volume declined by 1 4   in line with our previously communicated forecast decline of 1  to 1 5   The out performance of the industry was driven by heated tobacco share gains of 0 6 points  which helped offset cigarette declines  partly impacted by heated tobacco unit cannibalization Focusing on the fourth quarter  I would also like to highlight that while the effect of inventory movements across the year was small  the greater shipment volume decline of 4 4  in Q4  2019 partly reflects unfavorable combustible cigarette inventory movements of 2 3 billion units compared to the prior year quarter  notably due to the European Union region and Japan  We anticipate a partial reversal of this effect in these geographies in the first quarter of 2020 Fourth quarter in market sales volumes declined by 3 1   As previously anticipated in our third quarter remarks  this in market sales decline primarily reflects the impact of recent pricing in Turkey and the Philippines  In Turkey  our cigarette volume decline was due mainly to the impact of two price increases during the year  taken in April and August totaling TRY5 per pack or 44   which disproportionately impacted our share given the timing of our pricing vis a vis the competition  in addition to the industry decline  In Q4  2019  our share improved on a sequential basis  but the total market was weak due to a rise in illicit cut tobacco consumption  In the Philippines  our cigarette volume decline mainly reflected a lower total market in the immediate aftermath of industry price increases  though from a volume mix perspective this was partly compensated by a strong share performance from Marlboro Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 44  to 60 billion units in 2019  This performance  including shipments of over 17 billion units in the fourth quarter  reflects broad based growth across our launch markets  with notable contributions from the EU region  Japan and Russia  and keeps us well on track to deliver our 2021 shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units  This excellent performance means that heated tobacco units now make up nearly 8  of our total shipment volume  as compared to almost nothing in 2015  We expect this proportion to grow further as our positive momentum of reduced risk products continues Turning to our 2019 financial results  net revenues increased by 6 4   excluding currency  driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio and growth in heated tobacco units  RRP net revenues reached  5 6 billion or close to 19  of PMI s total net revenues  with IQOS devices accounting for approximately  0 7 billion or 13  of RRP net revenues  As highlighted previously  this lower proportion of device revenues primarily reflects favorable geographic mix of heated tobacco unit volume  the longer lifespan of the latest IQOS devices and the impact of device retail price changes in select markets We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 6 5  in 2019  better than our initial expectations for the year  helped by a broadly rational excise tax and competitive environment  There were notable contributions from Germany  Indonesia and Russia  in addition to the aforementioned pricing in the Philippines and Turkey  This was in line with the average historical variance since the 2008 spin  On a currency neutral basis  adjusted operating income increased by 11 2   while adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 170 basis points  This margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for the heated tobacco units  Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles and the impact of our cost initiatives  where we are firmly on track to reach over  1 billion of efficiencies by 2021  helping to finance growth investments behind RRPs  To this point  we implemented all our  400 million planned incremental RRP investments in 2019  with the net increase in spend partly offset by higher efficiencies realized as part of our overall cost program Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased strongly  growing 9 9  excluding currency  and exceeding our prior forecast of around 9 5   As explained in our third quarter results  the lower currency neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share compared to adjusted operating income reflects higher non controlling interests and a higher like for like tax rate  Our strong operating cash flow of  10 1 billion increased by  0 6 billion  benefiting from a number of working capital initiatives and the timing of certain cash costs related to our Berlin factory optimization  Capital expenditures of  0 9 billion came in slightly below our full year assumption of around  1 billion  benefiting from production efficiencies Turning now to market share  our total international share grew by 0 1 point to 28 4  with lower share for cigarettes  including the impact of cannibalization  more than offset by higher share for heated tobacco units  which reached 2 2   The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 0 5 point  reflecting continued adult smoker out switching to IQOS  particularly in the EU region and Japan  coupled with lower share notably in Argentina  Indonesia  Korea and Turkey  Further  despite this out switching  Marlboro s share of the cigarette category increased by 0 3 points to an all time high of 10   driven by Indonesia  the Philippines  Saudi Arabia and Turkey IQOS is now commercially available in 52 markets  representing 44  of the total international market  where our weighted average geographic coverage within these markets is approximately 60   This follows the addition of eight new markets in 2019  including Hungary  Sweden  the United Arab Emirates  the United States and the fourth quarter launch in Mexico  initially focused in select areas of Mexico City  In the later part of the year  we took another important step in our journey toward a smoke free future with the launch of IQOS 3 DUO  which is now available in all of our international IQOS markets  supported by our new Simply Amazing brand campaign  The Simply Amazing campaign focuses on everyday relatable moments and emotions by showcasing to adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke the benefits of switching to IQOS  This latest addition to the IQOS family was designed with enhanced features to help adult smokers switch more seamlessly from cigarettes  IQOS 3 DUO allows two consecutive uses without recharging the holder  while its charging time is significantly faster compared to IQOS 3 and IQOS 2 4 PLUS  We have seen positive initial effects on rates of conversion and consumer satisfaction from the roll out of DUO  which offers us encouragement on consumers  response to innovation as we start 2020  We continue to nurture a strong pipeline of future product improvements and innovations for the core IQOS platform Turning now to a more detailed discussion of RRP performance  we estimate that there were nearly 14 million total IQOS users as of year end  representing the addition of 4 million adult users over the course of the year  Based on our current momentum  we expect this rate of acquisition to significantly increase in 2020  We further estimate that 71  of the total or close to 10 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS  with the balance in various stages of conversion  This reflects widespread user growth  with highlights including a near doubling of users in Italy and Germany  a near trebling in Poland  very strong growth in Ukraine and the addition of 1 7 million users in Russia to reach a total of 2 5 million Let me now take you through the performance of IQOS in 2019  The overall share performance of IQOS heated tobacco units continues to see excellent progress  Indeed  in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized  IQOS heated tobacco units were the third largest tobacco brand in the fourth quarter with 5 5  share  increasing from the Number 4 position in third quarter  This has been achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets  as mentioned earlier  The continued excellent growth of IQOS reflects progress across a broad range of markets  Our commercialization approach starts with a focus on the key cities within a market  building adult smoker awareness  trial and conversion  On this slide  we see the strong offtake share momentum in a number of key cities  This gives us further encouragement as to the potential future growth at the national level as we see increases in both our geographic reach and rates of consumer awareness and trial In the EU region  fourth quarter share for HEETS reached 3 2  of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume  an increase of 1 5 points or near doubling  compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  On a sequential basis  share growth accelerated in the quarter  increasing by 0 7 points  In market sales volume also grew 16 1  compared to Q3  2019  This growth reflects continued strength across a broad range of markets  as detailed in this slide  It is worth noting that IQOS is only present in geographic areas representing approximately 57  of industry total volume in the region  The quality of consumer acquisition is also high  with conversion rates and registration rates improving over time IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia in the fourth quarter  with HEETS share up by 3 3 points to reach 5   On a sequential basis versus the third quarter  HEETS share increased by 1 point  while in market sales increased by over 20  to reach 2 9 billion units  HEETS share growth in the quarter was consistent with the pace of adult smoker adoption and our geographic expansion  We are now commercializing IQOS in cities representing approximately half of the market by total industry volume  compared to an estimated 40  at the end of the second quarter  In Japan  our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2 4 points to reach 17 6  in the fourth quarter  supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line ups As we have previously mentioned  total industry and share metrics in Japan are currently somewhat distorted by the low priced cigarillo category  which grew rapidly over the past two quarters to reach a total tobacco share of 6  in December  These products presently enjoy a significantly preferential tax treatment  though the tax council of the ruling party has recently announced the closing of this gap over two steps in October 2020 and October 2021  While the growth of this category is likely to be temporary  we plan to enter with the Philip Morris brand in the current quarter to capture our fair share On a total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements  the share for our heated tobacco unit brands increased by 1 5 points versus the prior year quarter  and by 0 6 points sequentially to 16 9   2019 in market sales volumes for our heated tobacco unit brands grew 4 2  compared to a total tobacco market  including cigarillos  which declined just over 3  after adjusting for the estimated impact of trade inventory movement  This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a fourth quarter total tobacco share of almost 24   including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements In Korea  there remains a lingering impact on the heated tobacco category of the consumer confusion caused by the Korean FDA s 2018 communication on tar  The category also remains highly competitive  particularly in the area of non menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions that are also present in the cigarette category HEETS  share in the fourth quarter declined by 2 2 points  or by 1 4 points on an adjusted basis  However  on a Sequential basis  fourth quarter adjusted share was essentially stable  and our segment share continued to grow  supported by IQOS 3 DUO and recent launches that expanded the flavor line up  While we are encouraged by this trend  we still have a lot of work to do to reinforce the heated tobacco category s benefits and build upon IQOS  leadership position A key development in 2019 was the launch of IQOS in the US through our commercial arrangement with Altria  The first IQOS retail stores opened in the initial launch markets of Atlanta and Richmond  marking an historic milestone and providing better alternatives to the 40 million men and women in the United States  who continue to smoke  While it remains early days in the lead market commercialization  we are excited about this significant opportunity  As a reminder  IQOS is currently the only heat not burn product on the market authorized by the US Food  Drug Administration through the PMTA pathway as  appropriate for the protection of public health   We also plan to seek an additional marketing order for the IQOS 3 device in the coming months  which will further support the efforts to convert US adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke Building on the success of our heated tobacco portfolio  we plan to launch our e vapor product IQOS MESH 2 0 this year  Following consumer confusion around e vapor in the later part of 2019  we took the decision to postpone our initial commercial launch  Unfortunately  these misperceptions  although moderating  still persist and as such we now plan to launch in the third quarter of this year when we will also reach the optimal capacity to deploy at scale  As a result  we plan a faster acceleration of commercial roll out through the second half of 2020 It s worth pausing here briefly to consider the dynamics of the international e vapor market in which IQOS MESH 2 0 will operate  The existing market is concentrated in a small number of geographies  with 10 markets making up around 70  of the approximately 25 million international adult users  which despite numbering almost double that of heated tobacco contribute less than half its retail value  This reflects the heavy existing skew to open tank systems  a low degree of product differentiation and a low rate of full conversion relative to heated tobacco products  Of these 10 markets  seven also have a meaningful limit on nicotine concentration  The IQOS MESH product has been designed to address these dynamics and will be able to leverage our existing RRP commercial infrastructure and capabilities to drive consumer trial and repurchase In summary  we are optimistic that IQOS MESH will deliver a superior experience and drive further growth in our business over time Lastly  in terms of the commercialization outlook on RRPs  we also recently announced a global collaboration agreement with KT G for the commercialization of their smoke free products outside of Korea  The key rationale for this agreement is to accelerate the growth of the smoke free category  which will require multiple products providing a wide array of brand  taste  price and technology choices to adult smokers  The capabilities we have built around RRPs in term of commercial infrastructure and know how  technology  scientific substantiation and regulatory engagement are best in class  These capabilities can be leveraged to broaden our strong portfolio and innovation pipeline to further drive category growth  including partnerships with others when it makes strategic and economic sense to do so  KT G has a range of smoke free products  which we see as complementary to ours  We have responsibility for all elements of commercialization of products supplied under this agreement  and we intend to apply a market by market approach to deployment  The agreement will run for an initial period of 3 years  with the intention to expand the market footprint based on commercial success  While we don t disclose the financial terms of such arrangements  this is a royalty based agreement  Products sold under the agreement will be subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched  as well as PMI s high standards of quality and scientific substantiation of their harm reduction potential  We are now working toward the first launches later this year  There are no current plans to commercialize KT G products in the United States  With this agreement and our own IQOS MESH launch in 2020  we have an active and exciting year ahead Turning to 2020 guidance  we forecast reported diluted earnings per share to be at least  5 50 at prevailing exchange rates  compared to reported diluted earnings per share of  4 61 in 2019  On a like for like basis and excluding an unfavorable currency impact of approximately  0 04 at prevailing exchange rates  this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8  versus pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of  5 13 in 2019  In terms of quarterly phasing  we expect earnings per share growth and net revenue growth to be particularly strong in the first quarter and notably softer in the second quarter 2020  The first quarter will benefit from the timing of pricing in the Philippines  and a favorable comparison with first quarter  19  which included the absorption of a substantial excise tax increase in Turkey Conversely  performance in the second quarter will likely be impacted by both the comparison to a strong performance in the second quarter  19  and the most pronounced effect of the tax driven pricing in Indonesia  It s also worth noting that the higher weighting of growth to markets with significant non controlling interests seen in the second half of 2019 will continue into the first half of 2020 due to annualization effects Let me now explain the dynamics in Indonesia in more detail  As we said in December  the industry faces in a typical year of catch up on excise tax and pricing  The 2020 excise tax took effect on January 1st  implying a weighted average excise tax increase of 24  industrywide  with a 46  increase in the minimum banderole price  While the potential tax pass on is relatively steep at 14  of the weighted average price  in the context of a two year stack with no excise tax increase in 2019  the average percentage increase is broadly in line with historical levels  The tax increase and the higher banderole price should also give us the opportunity to address the price gaps  which impacted our 2019 share performance  So far between October and January  we have announced pricing of 8  on a weighted average basis  or approximately 60  of the pass on  To date  some of our competitors are lagging on pricing  and will require a larger catch up to comply with the new minimum retail price that is effective April 1st  We should also highlight the one time impact on our pricing variance from the lack of any excise tax increase in 2019  With minimal pricing taken in the first nine months of last year  we will not benefit this year from the usual annualization effect of increases taken in the prior year  This exceptional dynamic effectively creates a one off drag on our 2020 pricing variance of over  200 million  In line with our prior comments  we expect the total industry  measuring 307 billion units in 2019  to decline by around 6  to 7  in 2020  with the highest impact likely in the second quarter as the new minimum retail selling price takes effect and the new prices work their way through the trade  With the resumption of pricing this year  we expect market dynamics to improve in 2021 Our 2020 guidance reflects certain key assumptions  The most significant  as we noted  is the pricing roll out in Indonesia which at this stage we assume to dilute our combustible pricing variance to approximately 5  in 2020  While lower than our 2019 pricing variance  this is still very robust and is supported by a generally rational excise tax environment  In combination with the projected total market decline of 6  to 7  in Indonesia  at this stage we cautiously assume currency neutral net revenue growth of around 5   However  I would reiterate that we remain very confident in our guidance of at least 8  currency neutral earnings per share growth  One of the reasons for this confidence is the positive margin outlook  where our efforts to deliver over  1 billion in annualized cost efficiencies by 2021 are bearing fruit  led by important initiatives related to productivity  cost category management  a project based organization model and other cost efficiencies  In 2020  we expect cost efficiencies to fully offset expected net incremental RRP investments  With the growing scale and geographic reach of our RRP business  additional investments now primarily reflect variable costs linked to new consumer acquisition and existing user retention  plus new market entries  Consequently  the cost per user is improving  with an expected decrease of 25  in our acquisition cost per user in 2020  We expect the increasing leverage of our commercial platform to contribute to an increase in currency neutral operating income margin of at least 150 basis points in 2020 Moving to the industry volume backdrop  our estimated total market decline is around 3  to 4  for the year  While this is weaker than the historical average of 2  to 3   this very much reflects the temporary situation in Indonesia  which represents around 11  of total industry volume  An additional factor comes from the present growth of the cigarillo category in Japan  which is not included in the cigarette total market calculation  As shown on the chart  the assumed 6  to 7  market decline in Indonesia is an expected effect of around 0 7 points on the global industry  with a further 0 3 points from the growth of cigarillos in Japan  While there are the usual puts and takes elsewhere  together these two temporary impacts fully explain the deviation from the historical average  with underlying fundamentals remaining unchanged  An additional upcoming development included in our industry forecast is the Tobacco Products Directive ban on menthol cigarettes in the European Union  effective May 2020  Menthol and menthol capsule variants make up for around 10  of consumption in the region  and while we do not expect a significant impact on the overall industry volume decline of 1  to 2   there is a further opportunity for IQOS given that menthol HEETS variants are not covered by the ban  We expect PMI shipment volumes in 2020 to again outperform the industry trend  and anticipate a total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline of approximately 2 5  to 3 5   We expect our shipment volume trends to be slightly better in the second half compared to the first half due to the dynamics already mentioned in Indonesia and Turkey While we are not providing a specific 2020 target for heated tobacco unit shipment  we expect continued broad based growth and remain well on track to meet our shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021  We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23   consistent with last year  and a relatively stable net interest expense compared to 2019  We are targeting 2020 operating cash flow of approximately  10 5 billion  subject to year end working capital requirements and currency movements  This includes the expected one time adverse impact of new excise payment rules in Australia  and the timing of certain cash costs related to the Berlin factory restructuring  Together  these two factors account for an expected unfavorable cash impact of approximately  350 million  We project total capital expenditures this year to be approximately  1 billion Summing up a strong year  we made very significant progress in our transformation to a smoke free future in both our organization and our 2019 business results  Just over 4 years since the first full scale IQOS commercial launch in Japan in September 2015  we already have  5 6 billion in RRP net revenues  making up almost one fifth of our business  Importantly  RRP revenues are increasingly accretive to our profits  as evidenced by the strong margin growth seen in 2019  and expected in 2020  IQOS continues to perform strongly  with 35  growth of heated tobacco unit in market sales volumes from an increasing number of markets where close to 10 million adult smokers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS  We project the number of new users over the course of 2020 to be significantly higher than 2019 and at a cost per user that is lower  as the large RRP infrastructure investments of the past several years are mostly complete  We are also very focused on maintaining the leadership of our combustible tobacco portfolio  which is delivering robust performance and pricing power  Despite the temporary headwinds in Indonesia  we are confident in our 2020 guidance and remain well on track to deliver our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex currency growth targets of at least 5  net revenue growth and at least 8  adjusted earnings per share growth Finally  we are confident in our strategy for a smoke free future and are convinced that our current and future RRP portfolio continues to provide us with the single largest opportunity to accelerate our business growth and generously reward our shareholders over time Thank you  Martin and I are now happy to answer your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now conduct the question and answer session of the conference   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler Michael Lavery    Piper Sandler    AnalystCan you touch on IQOS and some of what s going on in really sort of two different ends of the adoption curve I guess  On the one hand  you see a market like Hungary  for example  that has 4 share points plus in just a year out of nowhere  But then you re also talking about the lower costs of acquisition per user that you ve mentioned in the past comes from scale and growing word of mouth  I guess I d love to just understand both dynamics a little bit more  One is  how are you driving some of the rapid adoption in select markets  And then second  what are some of the key drivers of your efficiencies as they get a little bit more mature Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Well  I guess as a learning organization  every time we launch in a new market we apply what we learned from the previous one  So the time when we start growing faster is shorter and shorter  And I think we showed a chart like this recently and we ll explain that in CAGNY next week  So it s a learning organization  The deployment of more digital skills that makes that every new market we open starts growing faster than the previous one  and that s a fact of organization knowledge  Now as we have also the infrastructure in place  clearly the cost per user will decrease and thus decrease this year in 2020  We have to invest a little bit more money in retention  I would say although the cost of retention will also go down as we have more people  But clearly    and the cost of acquisition is higher So it makes sense now that we have enough people in our CRM base to invest a bit more there because losing a consumer they have acquired is much bigger loss than not acquiring someone by definition  OK  And also because now we have the digital infrastructure  we can start enlarging beyond over time the offering beyond accessories in just special editions and normal products  two more things that can help us build a different type of business over time as we have data on consumers and so on  So I m optimistic that although we will continue investing  Michael  incrementally in the RRP  So if we grow the number of users  this cost per user is going to go further and further down  and  obviously  we retain more consumers  So that s all on the positive side  and that s how I see it  if I was clear Michael Lavery    Piper Sandler    AnalystOne just quick follow up related to that  when you look at the evolution of IQOS usage of consumers  you ve shown the charts that pretty consistently show around 70  of users who fully convert  But obviously  you re also adding new users constantly as well who have  obviously  just gotten started  What amount of time does it typically take for somebody to transition and maybe related to saying it kind of a different way for users that began using the product  say  a year or two ago  is the amount that s fully converted more like 75   80  or 85  or how should we think about that dynamic Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  for the new users  clearly on average  we say two weeks to a month depending on the individual sometimes  people take much more time to fully switch  OK  They start using the products immediately  obviously  because they bought it  Now regarding retention over time  it s fairly stable I would say  and I think with the new programs we have in our CRM will increase this retention  Now depends also on the market as you know  in markets where you have a lot of competitive activity  we get some dilution of consumption because people buy other devices  typically vastly cheaper from competition and they try a few products  but if I compare markets where the competition is not yet successful  I think we have very good retention  And I think we can further enhance this retention as we now deploy a much better CRM program during the year  So I am pretty happy with what we have and we can improve from here OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS Robert Rampton    UBS    AnalystHello  three questions for me  The first would be in outside Korea and in Japan  are there any markets where IQOS volumes have declined sequentially and then on the flip side  are there any markets where sequential growth has accelerated Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I mean  except for Korea  I would say we have growth in every market  OK  Korea is a particular phenomenon because they    a confusion of consumers around the heat not burn category that is not dissimilar to what happened in many markets from the e vapor category and that happened at the beginning of last year in June when the Korean FDA  although they found a very significant reduction in the toxicants of heated tobacco product compared to cigarettes  very similar to what we have communicated  they kind of confused consumer by say  yes  but the power of this product is very similar to cigarettes  although we re comparing apples with oranges because there s two different paths  The one is water and glycerine and the other is but chemical  o this has stalled the category and I think will take a bit of time to restart the process  I think sooner or later  there is a realization by the authorities in Korea that that s not the right thing to do with consumers and the alignment we have now much more with KT G after the agreement I think that will help grow the category  But except for Korea  I don t see any other place where we have an issue Robert Rampton    UBS    AnalystAnd then just in terms of the margin expansion  So if we re thinking about how much of your 2020 expectation is driven by say cost saves  pricing and IQOS  is it fair to think that the impact of IQOS is offset by cost savings and the incremental increase is pricing or how should we think about that Martin King    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the margin expansion is driven by a number of factors  first of all  it s partly mix in that we re growing very rapidly now in the EU  which has very good margins on IQOS heated tobacco units  The second piece is  as you point out  our cost saving initiatives have stepped up significantly  At this point  the investments that we re making  behind RRP are now fully offset by these cost savings initiatives and that s where you get the big benefit for margin expansion and the cost saving breaks down into a couple of buckets  In the operations area  we have various productivity especially as we get better and better at producing the consumables for heated tobacco units with scale  better up time on the equipment for waste  We re improving the footprint across the whole manufacturing area You saw the factory optimizations we ve done in the last year  which begin to pay off in 2020 and beyond and we also have initiatives across all of our spending categories to find ways to become more efficient intelligently and rotate money out of less efficient areas and be able to put it into reduced risk products  So that whole effort started to pay off  for the last year you saw our margin expansion  last year was very strong at 1 7 percentage point increase and then this year we re committing to at least 1 5 percentage increase  and this is something that we will continue to focus on in the out years going forward as well Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerAnd regarding pricing  I would say  as I explained  we foresee pricing to be a bit below this year than 2019  that is essentially due to Indonesia  OK  Because if we took 2019  we had annualization of pricing from  18 in Indonesia  which at this stage we assume is not going to happen  Obviously  one  there was no real pricing in  19  So you have no annualization in  20 and we have to be a bit cautious about pricing and how it rolls out in Indonesia  there s a pretty steep increase  but we assume that this situation will resolve during 2020  So in 2021 we have annualization of pricing in Indonesia and come back to normal Robert Rampton    UBS    AnalystApologies  Just one follow up on that  In terms of IQOS operating margins  can you give us some color on how it compares to cigarettes in say Italy at one end and Russia at the other Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  IQOS margins are higher than cigarettes  OK  So that s basically clear and a lot of the margin improvement is coming  as Martin explained  from IQOS essentially OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen Vivien Azer    Cowen and Company    AnalystSo you guys sound very constructive on the momentum on IQOS  that is clear  I was hoping that you could comment on your key competitors  commentary this morning for the RRP category in Japan  Specifically  they may be have a different view than you  specifically saying that they re looking for more moderate growth to capture 25  of industry volumes as competition intensifies  can you comment on that Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerI think it s very difficult to comment at this stage what is going to be the precise growth of the category  maybe I see it higher than them  but we see both growth and that s the important part  And I think we are well positioned with all the initiatives we have to capture the largest part of the growth  So we ll see at the year out call where exactly we end  But the key thing is that we remain focused  IQOS still has a lion s part of the segment share and the momentum is positive and accelerating  We re increasing segment share and overall market share  So that s the key thing to retail Vivien Azer    Cowen and Company    AnalystJust a follow up on Japan  Can you offer any color on what your HTU mix is between HEETS and Marlboro at the end of 2019 Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerI don t have the exact numbers in my head  but I would say the cannibalization is stable  We had a little bit of down trading I would say after the price increase because Marlboro increased prices more than HEET but now it s back to stable  And they are both growing but Marlboro is growing again Martin King    Chief Financial OfficerI think  Vivien  we haven t given the exact split  but I think it s safe to say that Marlboro s share  Marlboro HeatSticks share ended up being more than we had originally expected  We thought that HEETS would a bigger component by now  and Marlboro HeatSticks has held up better than we expected given the pricing  On the other hand  HEETS did its job of expanding their category and making the offering available to a broader array of consumers that were more price sensitive  So we re satisfied with its performance and an overall it did its job  However  more heated tobacco users opted to stay with the Marlboro HeatSticks than we originally planned  which is positive  of course  for our margins and for the profitability Vivien Azer    Cowen and Company    AnalystNow that s a great outcome  Last one from me  Andre  I appreciated your commentary on some of the e vapor concerns that are spreading seemingly to the EU  That s certainly consistent with what we heard from one of your competitors yesterday  Are there any principal markets that we should be watching out for  in particular  where consumer concern or confusion around e vapor risk is taking hold most dramatically Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think the maximum was after the unfortunate cases in the US with the lung disease and death that were spun by some people in the wrong way as you know  I think this is getting better  but we are not there out yet  because there are still people that spread confusion despite all the efforts  Myself and others are making to explain that this had nothing to do with the vapor category and more with misuse with Cannabis oils and so on  My    our perspective on this was in any case  our plan on e vapor was to build the capacity and go into the bulk of the market  that is the European Union toward the year end  OK  because then we have capacity at scale  We had planned a couple of markets earlier on a trial basis  I think it s better not to put more oil in the fire  especially since we will put the e vapor under the IQOS brand So to minimize confusion  I prefer that we let a little bit time fly  we build capacity and it doesn t move in reality  our plan for the European Union  which was toward the end of this year  So that s my perspective  And I think that it s about time there are more voices here to stop misleading people  And I was reading the recent Q A by the World Health Organization and it s not my commentary  but It is so much of misleading  And I would say malicious statements in there that some of the top advocates in public health came out and say this is unacceptable  So they modified their version  but they are still misleading  So I think short term that may appear not a good thing  but long term the more people say insane things  the more credibility they lose and the more the alternatives will become more credible because they lose their credibility  And I think we are in this phase now where frankly speaking  you see more and more of these nonsensical things and more and more voices saying let s stop this  have a reset now of the situation and stop talking seriously because these alternatives are better for people who would otherwise smoke  But as far as the commercial part is concerned  that s it  That s    it s what I said and I explained just now  Hope I am clear OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman from Citi Adam Spielman    Citi    AnalystAs Vivien was asking about Japan  can I just ask one quick question there before turning to IQOS  The question on Japan is whether in your pricing variance  you re baking in any assumption for the    around the tax rise that we re  obviously  going to get in October this year  So that s the first question Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  any  pricing is all in the guidance  obviously  Adam  So we ll always hope there is an opportunity in Japan when there is a tax increase to get pricing  we make some assumptions  we ll see how much they materialize or not Adam Spielman    Citi    AnalystSo the real question  the core question is  obviously  around IQOS  And so  one     so thinking about the European to begin with  the European Union to begin with  in Q3  you had 0 1  quarter on quarter market share growth and then you ve had a much higher  really  really strong growth in Q4  And I was just wondering how you should think    how we should think about EU market share progressing going forwards  whether there s any sort of seasonality in that and how you think we should sort of smooth out those few things  slightly disappointing in my view in Q3 and then a really strong performance just in Q4 Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  It s in broad strokes  OK  there is seasonality in summer  pretty obviously that s favoring cigarettes  hence a little bit less market share on the heated tobacco unit  The second thing although IQOS was very marginally affected by the whole situation of e vapor in the US  it was just the moment in the quarter  we had a bit of a slowdown in September I would say but we recovered as of October  November  and I think we re entering 2020 with a pretty good momentum  Number of users is increasing  as I explained  I think the menthol is an opportunity for us at the    toward the second half of the year  So I m very optimistic about the momentum and outcomes in the European Union Adam Spielman    Citi    AnalystAnd so just to summarize  I think you ll say  you expect to get more new users in the EU in 2020 than you did in 2019  partly because of a medical issue  but also the CRM that just the whole momentum is so good Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  that s what I m saying Martin King    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Adam  I would also just    around the IQOS heated tobacco unit share in the EU  there is seasonality there  If you look at  for instance  in 2018 you see the same basic dynamic where the increase from Q2 to Q3 is relatively small with a bigger increase from Q3 to Q4 and then again in 2019 you see the same dynamic  In addition  this year we had even more pronounced effect that Andre mentioned with the other news flow  but this is back to the seasonality piece  Cigarettes in EU are going to be higher because it s warm weather  people go outside and they could can use it more and then lower in the winter months  whereas IQOS you could use much more easily  frequently without any worry as far as what the weather outside is  so you don t see the volume changes quarter to quarter as much as you do on cigarette  So it s really the cigarette seasonality that s driving these share numbers to be impacted Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerAnd overall  I would say  Adam  we see a significant increase in the number of users overall across the market  OK  And I think it s also due to the fact that we re getting scale  getting momentum  We see more word of mouth happening in the markets and the tools we use now are most scalable  So I hope we will see this accelerate Adam Spielman    Citi    AnalystAnd then quickly turning to Russia  which is  obviously  a very large market and you are gaining share very fast  Roughly speaking  well  in Q3 last year you had roughly 1  market share  You ve now got 5   so in five quarters you ve gained 4 percentage points of market share  I guess the question is  do you think that rate of growth can continue  or would you expect it to slow slightly Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  first of all we need to compare comparable things  OK  We are still growing in cities where we started before  there is some  obviously  some expansion in there that helps  And we still have scope for expansion  Now it s pretty clear in my mind that at a certain stage  we would need probably a second price point in the portfolio in Russia because in certain cities  we will be getting the essence of the premium and somehow a large part of the more  I would say  wealthy part of the mid price segment  I don t know but we will need this in 2020  but we have to plan at least for 2021  OK  And that s how I see it  So we don t see a slowdown  but we need to prepare for reaching the limits in terms of affordability over time in the big cities  Now in the cities  we just started  clearly we have more runway in front of us OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley Pamela Kaufman    Morgan Stanley     AnalystSo over the last several years  you ve quantified a level of incremental IQOS investment in each year  How much incremental investment do you anticipate in 2020 relative to 2019 Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  in my view it s going to be a bit less than 2019  And it s all variable  At the end of the day  it all depends on the number of new consumers you acquire  So I would say  would be between 300 and 350 depending on the number of new users that we have because there are certain costs that are purely variable but as Martin clearly said  all this is offset on a comparable basis by all the savings we have from our cost saving initiatives  So that helps clearly the margin expansion  plus the geographic mix of IQOS  That is helpful Pamela Kaufman    Morgan Stanley     AnalystAnd I wanted to better understand your decision to partner with KT G and how you see their products competing with IQOS and given that this partnership expands your portfolio to e vapor and hybrid products  do you also see a need to fill the gap in modern oral Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think at the end of the day  I ve said many times  I don t think we will do all the new products on our own or invent everything and we re very open to partnership  and this is a very simple principle  it s what can we add to the partnership  I think we have technology  we have IP that s complements  we have the scientific assessment capabilities and  obviously  the route to market  And in my view  KT G has an interesting product like the Hybrid product  which by the way is a peripheral heated tobacco product that vaporizes at the same time  When we think there is potential in certain markets and certain consumer segments  their heated tobacco product is the second more performing heated tobacco product and it s also heating from the inside and I think with the know how we have  if necessary we can improve this product  And I think we decide market by market what are the right price points for this product  so that they are complementary to our IQOS strategy  And as we discussed in Japan  for Japan  there may be some cannibalization  but from Japan  for example  we did two price points with our own products  We didn t see much cannibalization  We re still much more incrementality  So that s how I see it For the e vapor product  we have not major plans at this stage  but are much more interested in their hybrid and the heated tobacco with the team that has potential in these markets and that s how I see it  We also have more alignment I would say  overall  in Korea  that s important for the Korean market  And we also have access from a technology point of view to a country like Korea that is one of the centers for electronics  So I think it s a win win for both companies  It s a license agreement  the financial works for both of us  So I look forward to working with them and expanding in the right markets  offering consumers a much more wide range of products Pamela Kaufman    Morgan Stanley     AnalystAnd can you give an update on the impact on new user adoption in Japan from your device price reductions and other initiatives to accelerate IQOS growth in this market over the last year  Are you seeing increasing heated tobacco adoption and trial among the harder to convert later adopters Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerCertainly  we see some  I think the IQOS DUO will help because consecutive use for some people is important  We addressed this problem with the MULTI  but now we address it also with the main product and we see better adoption The pricing is also in general to avoid all these promotions and promotional money  we think that s the right price of the product and we always prepare the portfolio for the next generation that will always come at a premium  So we always reduce the previous version price in view of the forthcoming new version  And as I explained many times  we have a strategy of having a major innovation every two  three years and significant upgrades every year in the portfolio and that s what we re doing in Japan  So say that there is enormous reduction    reaction just because we reduced the device prices  it helps  but there is a whole mix that works  We see actually more reaction in Russia where disposable income is really an issue  By having still the 2 4 Plus on the market and IQOS 3  when still a lot of consumers buy the 2 4 because they are more price sensitive market  I think the answer is not only pricing  it s much more resolving constantly the consumer pain points that are a barrier to entry in the category and that s why we re working on the current version and the forthcoming one  So that s a little bit the philosophy we apply OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel Chris Growe    Stifel    AnalystJust had a question for you and a bit of a follow on from a earlier question  As you said  your cost per user and acquiring users in IQOS is going down  and I guess I m interested in that scale effect you have in RRPs  You  obviously  had to spend more money this year but I think at the same time  I m just trying to understand how you can leverage that infrastructure you have as you think about the launch of Platform 2 or MESH  Is a lot of the same or are a lot of the same resources being used for that  Are those    I assume they are figured as part of that  300 million to  350 million you cited for this year as you think about the launch cost of those new products Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  obviously  these new products  if they go through our infrastructure  which means our own retail  third party retail that is kind of franchises  our own digital platforms now that are put in place  our coaches  obviously you can use the infrastructure you have in a much more efficient way So I would say that still the vast majority of the investment during the year is still on IQOS heat not burn and we assume even when roll out a bit more massively P4  it s going to be on a per user basis much cheaper compounded by the fact that we don t have to explain the category to people  We just need to explain to people what the difference is and what the benefits of MESH are compared to existing e vapor product  So there is no category explanation effort behind  So it will be much cheaper in my view or less expensive than the heat not burn product Chris Growe    Stifel    AnalystAnd then I had one of the follow up question  And this gets to a question    a bit of a question earlier and your response  But you have seen this    a number of markets in the EU  where IQOS market share has really accelerated and we talked in the    couple few years ago about in Japan when you got over that 2  to 2 5  threshold  you start to see market share really accelerate  Are we at that point in the EU  Do we see that in the fourth quarter  Because some of those market share increases are quite notable  Are we at that stage is my question and are you seeing that in more markets  or do you hope to see that in more markets in 2020 Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  we hope we ll see in more and more markets in 2020  As I said  we expect the number of users to grow  which means compared to    we had 4 million users  we expect a much higher number than that  So I call this acceleration on a same market basis  OK Look  it s the beginning of the year  we feel good about the fourth quarter  We have good momentum going into 2020  We ll keep you up to date on how we progress and that comes at a much lower cost  So I think we re building it pretty nicely OperatorWe have time for one final question and that is from Gaurav Jain from Barclays Gaurav Jain    Barclays    AnalystMy question is on that Canadian subsidiary  so can you tell us where we are with the RBH creditor protection negotiations which are happening Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerWell  they are progressing  but I cannot give you more details  OK  Still  there is a stay of all litigation and there are discussions to resolve the issue  Once we have something concrete  I can give you more details  but things are progressing Gaurav Jain    Barclays    AnalystA follow up on the IQOS MESH launch  so would you consider applying for a PMTA considering Altria changed some of the language around their JUUL agreement  if JUUL is not allowed in the market for a year and other things Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerI think we have a lot of plans for P4  So one day  we will probably apply for PMTA in the US  but we still have to finalize a few studies on P4  for we have the same type of file as we had for IQOS  but that s important also for many other countries  And in due time  we will discuss if and when we want to enter the US market  Now the FDA is going to be very busy in the US over the next few months on all the PMTAs  I don t think that s the appropriate moment to do anything Gaurav Jain    Barclays    AnalystAnd if I can ask one last question  can you comment on the sell in versus sell through trends for IQOS  both in the last quarter and for the full 2019 Martin King    Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  the in market sales versus the shipments or in your words  sell in versus sell out  were approximately equal  If anything actually the IMS was a little bit more than the shipments  So there was no inventory change on the year Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s in line with what we said for beginning of the year OperatorThat concludes the Q A session of today s call  Presenters  do you have any closing remarks Andre Calantzopoulos    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would like to thank you all for joining first of all  I would say we had a pretty good 2019  We re entering 2020 in a very good shape  We outlined the one unusual thing that is Indonesia  We think we d see how this unfolds  We prefer to be cautious about this at the beginning of the year  And just something that is in the air just now  I mean  this whole    this issue around the coronavirus  We have no problem today But clearly if that continues  there may be some impact on travel and the duty free and in terms of supply chain  I think we re in pretty good shape for a few weeks  But if that persists for a very long period of time like everybody else  we may have some issues with device supply  Now that s not a continuation of this like in any company  is not baked into our guidance  but we all hope this is going to be soon resolved  So we put it behind So  thank you again and I look forward to a pretty good 2020 Nicholas

190129,411645,PM,Philip Morris  IQOS Still Hot Despite a Cigarette Sales Drop,news,"Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  continued to smoke analyst estimates  reporting fourth quarter revenue and earnings that came in higher than Wall Street s projections 
As the IQOS heated tobacco device grows in popularity  Philip Morris looks for it to help the company easily meet sales and profit growth forecasts for the next two years 
Although it is expecting some country specific headwinds  CEO Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement   We enter 2020 with favorable momentum  and expect to deliver like for like currency neutral net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth this year consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual growth targets of at least 5  and 8   respectively   as well as further margin expansion  

Smoking alternatives heat up the market
There are now 13 6 million users of the IQOS  4 million more than a year ago  and Philip Morris estimates 71  of them  around 10 million people  have stopped smoking and permanently switched to the device 
The heated tobacco units have become the third biggest tobacco brand behind Philip Morris  industry leading Marlboro and Imperial Brands  Winston  IQOS now has a 5 5  share of the global tobacco market  even though it hasn t been fully rolled out in a number of the 52 markets it s been introduced into  
The real growth opportunity continues to be the U S   where Philip Morris is working through partner Altria to get IQOS available to customers  Right now  though  it s still only in just two cities    Atlanta  and Richmond  Virginia    as Altria slow walks its debut  Philip Morris says it will also seek out another marketing order from the Food and Drug Administration for its upgraded IQOS 3 device 
Under FDA rules  manufacturers have to seek out pre marketing approval from the agency for every new device and accessory  even if mostly cosmetic  The IQOS 3 is an updated design of the original  based on consumer feedback  with a speedier recharge  And Philip Morris also developed the IQOS 3 DUO where the battery charge lasts through two uses and charges even faster than the IQOS 3 
Delayed gratification
One slight hiccup Philip Morris encountered was the introduction of its new IQOS Mesh 2 0 e vapor product  which is more like regular electronic cigarettes in that it heats an e liquid to create a vapor 
Because of the health scare last summer surrounding some vape products that caused dozens of deaths and thousands of lung injuries  Philip Morris held off on introducing the device and postponed its launch  
The FDA had advised all e cig users to stop vaping even though it had narrowed down the culprit to illicit e liquids purchased over the internet containing vitamin E acetate from THC  the psychotropic compound in marijuana  No association with traditional e cigs or vaping devices was found 
Yet as Calantzopoulos noted during the earnings conference call   Unfortunately  these misperceptions  although moderating  still persist  and as such we now plan to launch in the third quarter of this year when we will also reach the optimal capacity to deploy at scale   The company expects the back half of 2020 to see a large uptake of the devices 
Mostly clear sailing
It was a solid earnings report that showed Philip Morris  focus on a smoke free future is progressing  even though it still has a large underpinning of sales based on traditional cigarettes 
While volumes continued to decline  they were at rates less than the industry  and because of its pricing power  revenue was able to rise in the quarter for the segment  It may face some turbulence in Indonesia  however  where the industry must deal with a massive 24  tax increase 
It hurt Philip Morris  share performance  but the company looks to be able to address it by eventually passing along all the hikes  which when viewed over time  will actually be in line with historical averages 
Shares of the tobacco giant have gained about 25  since hitting a low last September  and with a still profitable legacy business and a burgeoning smoking alternative  Philip Morris International seems able to meet the challenges ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptcb1,2080645

have the market they used to  but there s still money to be made Altria Name Took It Away From Tobacco ScandalsFor decades  cigarette manufacturers presented smoking as healthy  Since that was never the case  the industry began to face lawsuits as early as the 1960s  By the 1980s  the suits were piled high enough that cigarette giant Philip Morris was fighting for its life  financially  The issues of public health had created a firestorm the company could no longer escape Several lawsuits resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in judgment against Philip Morris  Its board of

companies via a major M A strategy  The largest investment it made was in Kraft Foods  That diversified it substantially away from tobacco and allowed it to start a string of operating companies  Altria Group  the new parent  reached the point where it was no longer considered a cigarette stock It also took positions in John Middleton  Chateau Ste  Michelle Wine Estates and brewer AB InBev  In the meantime  it spun out its overseas operations into Philip Morris International Inc   NYSE  PM   while Philip Morris USA stayed with the Altria parent  Oddly  Altria and Philip Morris International may merge again Much more recently  Altria took a position in e cigarette maker Juul Labs  Juul rode the boom in e cigarettes  which has been largely halted recently because a number of studies show e cigarettes are nearly as dangerous for health as smoking A major study out of Harvard recently confirmed that toxins in e cigarettes can cause long term lung damage  Juul has also been hit by a ban on flavored cigarettes  Very recently  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  banned the sales of products with cigarette pods How Has Altria Shaped Up Financially After Altria spun out Kraft to shareholders  it became almost exclusively a cigarette company again  Its revenue comes almost entirely from the United States  Other than its huge domestic cigarette business  it owns several other companies  These include Nat Sherman  U S  Smokeless Tobacco and Philip Morris Capital  Altria remains the largest American company in the tobacco industry Over the past year  Altria s stock price has been relatively flat  while the S P 500 has been up 27   However  many people do not invest in Altria entirely for its share price movement  Altria stock yields  3 36  against a share price of  49 58

Cigarettes and the WorldPerhaps the largest challenge Altria has is that the United States is no longer among the largest users of tobacco in the world  That has changed almost completely as the sales of cigarettes in the nation have declined  The United States now ranks 69th in the world in terms of tobacco consumption  That is based on a figure of 1 017 cigarettes consumed per person per year In the Chinese market  the world s largest  the level is 2 043  In 2015  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 15  of Americans smoked daily  That is down from 21  a decade earlier  The biggest existential problem for Altria is that its customers may disappear Altria TodayAltria has 8 400 employees now  This is down from two years ago  Cost cutting took out 800 people  Smokable

190135,411651,PM,An Altria Philip Morris Merger Is Still a Possibility,news,"Amid growing scrutiny over Altria s  NYSE MO  investment in leading electronic cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs  global tobacco giant Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  squashed the idea of merging the two cigarette companies 
Philip Morris CEO Andre Calantzopoulos said the two companies were better off concentrating solely on distributing Philip Morris  IQOS heated tobacco device  It is the only e cig to receive FDA marketing approval  and Altria has the rights to market  distribute  and sell the device in the U S   After much deliberation  the companies have agreed to focus on launching IQOS in the U S  as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke free future   Calantzopoulos was quoted as saying in a press release 
But Bloomberg earlier this week reported that the two might not have totally written off the idea of a union  At a gathering of global political and business leaders in Davos  Switzerland  Philip Morris COO Jacek Olczak reportedly said in answer to a question about whether Philip Morris would revisit the idea of merger   the chapter is closed  but not the book   

Still mired in muck
It s not likely investors will see any action right away  however  as Altria is still trying to untangle regulatory umbrage over its  12 8 billion investment in Juul  
More than a year after taking a 35  stake in the e cig maker  the Federal Trade Commission still has not signed off on the deal  Adding to the probes already underway over the investment and the way that Juul has marketed its devices to teens  there s also concern over what  if any  influence Altria exerted in the resignation of Juul s CEO and having one of its own former executives inserted in his place 
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the FTC is still investigating antitrust issues stemming from the transaction  looking closely at retail shelf space Altria acquired for e cigs despite winding down its own MarkTen e cig business  That shelf space was subsequently given to Juul  
Other opportunities are on the horizon
Yet Philip Morris apparently still sees the value of joining the two companies together  Because Altria and Philip Morris International were once one company  and the Marlboro brand is common to both    Altria sells it in the U S   Philip Morris sells it to the rest of the world    there would indeed be efficiencies that could be realized 
Calantzopoulos told Bloomberg he sees consolidation in the e cig industry s future  and that is undoubtedly true as the FDA s deadline for electronic cigarette companies to submit pre market tobacco product applications is fast approaching and few e cig manufacturers will be able to meet the high hurdle the FDA has set by themselves  So far  only Philip Morris and British American Tobacco have had the resources to file their applications  and have done so at great expense  For those companies unable to comply  their products will be pulled from the market  giving the biggest players a chance to scoop them up at significant discounts 
Bigger and better
Calantzopoulos says Philip Morris wants to be the e cig leader with its IQOS device  and is getting ready to launch a new version called IQOS Mesh  The device uses a metallic mesh to heat a pre filled  pre sealed  cap  containing an e liquid  Called VEEV  the caps contain nicotine  flavors  and a heater  
Because they re all self contained and produced by Philip Morris  they solve the problem of third parties concocting e liquids that may contain harmful additives  The CDC says an outbreak last summer that saw thousands of vapers injured and dozens killed from lung injuries is likely linked to  tetrahydrocannabinol  THC  containing e cigarette  or vaping  products  particularly from informal sources like friends  family  or in person or online dealers   So a closed system has benefits 
Although keeping Altria and Philip Morris separate made sense for a lot of investors  as it gave them the choice of whether they wanted to be exposed to the litigious U S  tobacco market  there are good arguments to be made for joining them together again ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmser,2067759
190136,411652,PM,Never Mind  Philip Morris CEO Says Altria Merger Is Dead,news,"And just like that  Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  has slammed shut the door on a merger with Altria  NYSE MO   a door it had propped open just days before 
In an interview with CNBC  CEO Andre Calantzopoulos said the merger conversation between the global tobacco giant and its domestic counterpart  is finished   Philip Morris has moved on  and the two companies are now focused solely on commercializing the IQOS heat not burn tobacco device 

While that is similar to comments Calantzopoulos made recently  it was only a couple of days ago that Philip Morris COO Jacek Olczak seemed to hold open the possibility that that the two companies might yet join forces 
 The chapter is closed  but not the book   he said  when asked whether the cigarette company might revisit the merger  Now it appears Calantzopoulos has thrown the book onto the fire 
Inching closer and closer
There are good arguments in favor of and against reuniting the two cigarette companies that separated in 2008  
Altria  of course  is the U S  based tobacco giant that markets its cigarette brands like Marlboro while Philip Morris has the rights to sell Marlboro and other brands in foreign countries  The two separated over a decade ago as a means of walling off the company s foreign assets from the lawsuits that have dogged the tobacco company for decades 
Yet over the years the two companies have increasingly forged closer ties  especially on the subject of reduced risk products like the IQOS  An agreement between the two companies made several years ago gave Altria the right to market  distribute  and sell the IQOS in the U S  under its Marlboro banner 
Last year the Food   Drug Administration  FDA  approved Philip Morris  application to sell the device in the U S   though the tobacco company is still awaiting word on whether it can earn a reduced risk designation  Altria has begun rolling out the IQOS into several markets 
In the spotlight
However  the e cig industry was thrust into turmoil by what the FDA called a rising  epidemic  of teen use of the devices  particularly those made by Juul Labs  At one point it owned around 80  of the market  though FDA agitation against the company and an outbreak of lung illness related to vaping marijuana has peeled back some of its market share 
Altria had made what at the time seemed like a smart investment  taking a 35  stake in the e cig company for  12 8 billion  That  however  preceded the FDA s railing against the popularity of the Juul device with teens and it calling both companies on the carpet for supposedly reneging on their promise to limit teen access to e cigs by joining forces 
It was during this period that Philip Morris and Altria began discussing the possibility of reuniting their companies  However  with the FDA routinely pillorying Juul and the e cig maker coming under more intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission over its marketing tactics  Philip Morris announced that while the two tobacco companies had been in early talks about a merger  that was over and the two would instead  focus on launching IQOS in the U S  as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke free future  
And then there was one
They may soon have the entire market virtually to themselves  The FDA s deadline for e cig companies to submit their applications to market their products is fast approaching  If companies don t submit  their products are subject to being removed from store shelves  Few companies will likely be able to comply 
Philip Morris  application was several million pages long  including supporting documentation  and cost millions of dollars to produce  The application for British American Tobacco s Vuse e cig was several hundred thousand pages long  There are very few manufacturers that will be able to afford to file an application with the agency  so Philip Morris concentrating solely on the IQOS without distraction makes sense 
It also returns to Philip Morris investors the ability to decide for themselves if they want to be exposed to the litigious and highly regulated U S  market  That was also one of the primary arguments against the two companies merging 
In business  like politics  it s often a case of never say never  but investors would probably be better off not making investment decisions based on the idea that a merger may one day happen  This is a story that seems to have come to an end ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnwbo,2069353

190138,411654,PM,Look for Heated Tobacco to Lift Philip Morris International in Q4,news,"Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  is in the unique position of trying to disrupt not only its industry but its own business as well  CEO Andre Calantzopoulos maintains that vapor  not smoke  will define its future even as some analysts begin to express skepticism that electronic cigarettes will have the long lasting impact they once thought they would 
While Philip Morris heated tobacco device IQOS is still new to the U S     which is the world s biggest e cig market  meaning it may very well upend the order of things one day    that s not going to be the case for when the global tobacco giant reports its fourth quarter earnings results on Wednesday  Feb  6 


A surprise in the making
Analysts are looking for Philip Morris to post a 2 4  rise in sales  but with a similar decline in earnings  However  there s good reason to suspect it could offer up a positive surprise 
The tobacco company reported that third quarter shipment volumes fell  primarily because of sales volumes shortfalls in three markets  with two of those being timing related  Price increases were the main reason for the third 
It was those higher prices  however  that allowed Philip Morris to see profits rise  and management forecasts earnings per share to grow at least 8  annually through 2021  On a currency neutral basis  it forecasts that its earnings for 2019 will be up 9   and its performance will be widely bolstered by the growth of IQOS and the consumable heated tobacco units that are marketed as HEETS and HeatSticks 
Sales are  heeting  up
Across all of Philip Morris  markets  the IQOS has a combined 5 1  market share even though the heated tobacco device isn t even available yet in many places  It says that with that kind of broad market acceptance  it would be considered the fourth largest tobacco brand in these countries  a two spot gain over the year ago period  
The European Union represents the largest market where IQOS has been commercialized  accounting for 57  of the industry s volume  and HEETS share doubled year over year to 2 5  while in market sales volume jumped more than 9  sequentially over the second quarter 
Russia is another market where IQOS is gaining adoption  with its market share hitting 4  and sales surging 40  sequentially to hit 2 4 billion units 
Japan  of course  represents Philip Morris  most advanced market  as IQOS was introduced there first  so its market share of 17  in the country  up 1 5 percentage points year over year  was not surprising  even though it initiated price bumps and faced tax increases  too 
Still grounded in tobacco
As much as Philip Morris touts its commitment to a smoke free future  the tobacco giant still has a sizable traditional cigarette portfolio that continues to generate most of its sales and profits 
Like its peers Altria and British American Tobacco  Philip Morris commands significant pricing power that  while causing it to lose some customers over time  still finds the vast majority of them willing to pay up for its brands  Over all of its markets  it saw prices rise nearly 6  in the third quarter for its combustible tobacco products 
It s also able to use the inelasticity of demand for cigarettes to offset higher excise taxes that countries are fond of imposing  so that where other products would have to absorb some of the cost of higher taxes  tobacco companies are able to pass them along to customers 
A future of innovation
Still  the driving force for Philip Morris  future is in reduced risk products like IQOS  and it has spent billions of dollars developing a portfolio of different options  Most recently  it partnered with South Korean e cig firm KT G to distribute the company s vaporizer equipment outside its home market 
KT G sells products that vaporize traditional tobacco under the Lil brand  as well as e liquids  Philip Morris won t extend that distribution to the U S   though  as it prepares for the national rollout of IQOS under Altria s direction 
IQOS is currently just in two U S  markets    Atlanta and Richmond  Virginia    but more will be coming soon  As the device is the only e cig to which the Food and Drug Administration has granted marketing approval  there s a good chance it will have much of the U S  market to itself when the agency s deadline for submitting applications expires in a few months 
Staying focused
Like the analysts  Philip Morris International does have concerns about the regulatory environment surrounding e cigs  particularly in the U S   which underscored its decision to kill any more talk of a possible merger with Altria  Both companies  says Calantzopoulos  are focused on commercializing IQOS instead 
Even so  the IQOS in the U S  won t be a contributor to Philip Morris International s fourth quarter and full year results in any appreciable scale  That s coming  but investors betting on a big score on that front should look to 2020 and beyond for its role to become magnified ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqw39,2075417

190142,411658,PM,Special Report  Juul disregarded early evidence it was hooking teens,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    The San Francisco startup that invented the groundbreaking Juul e cigarette had a central goal during its development  captivating users with the first hit  The company had concluded that consumers had largely rejected earlier e cigarettes  former employees told Reuters  because the devices either failed to deliver enough nicotine or delivered it with a harsh taste  Developers of the Juul tackled both problems with a strategy they found scouring old tobacco company research and patents  adding organic acids to nicotine  which allowed for a unique combination of smooth taste and a potent dose  Employees tested new liquid nicotine formulations on themselves or on strangers taking smoke breaks on the street  Sometimes  the mix packed too much punch   enough nicotine to make some testers  hands shake or send them to the bathroom to vomit  a former company manager told Reuters  In the end  it worked  The formula delivered nicotine to the bloodstream so efficiently  in fact  that the company s engineers explored features to stop users from ingesting too much of the drug  too quickly  Juul s founders applied for a patent in 2014 that described methods for alerting the user or disabling the device when the dose of a drug such as nicotine exceeds a certain threshold  One idea was to shut down the device for a half hour or more after a certain number of puffs  said Chenyue Xing  a former Juul scientist who helped patent its liquid nicotine formula  The concern stemmed in part from the fact that a Juul   unlike a cigarette   never burns out  Xing said in an interview   You hope that they get what they want  and they stop   she said   We didn t want to introduce a new product with a stronger addictive power    The company never produced an e cigarette that limited nicotine intake  Xing was not directly involved in the engineering of the device and said she didn t know why the firm did not adopt a dosage control feature  Juul Labs Inc is now the central player in a broader controversy sweeping the United States over the safety of its products along with those of a wave of high nicotine imitators  The rise of Juul sales tracks closely with an epidemic of teenage nicotine use that has brought a hail of criticism and regulatory scrutiny on the company   Congressional investigators  state attorneys general and health advocates have so far focused on whether Juul targeted young people through its marketing and the dessert like flavors of some Juul nicotine liquids  such as creme brulee or mango     But a Reuters investigation has found that  from the company s earliest days  insiders discussed and debated concerns over more fundamental attributes of the product  its potency and addictiveness   The breakthrough  nicotine salts  formula that made the Juul e cigarette so addictive   and ignited the company s explosive market share growth made Juul especially attractive to teenagers and other new users who otherwise would never have smoked cigarettes  according to interviews with more than a dozen tobacco researchers  pediatricians  and a Reuters review of Juul patents and independent research on nicotine chemistry     The device delivers the drug more efficiently than a cigarette   according to emerging academic research into Juul s formula and the company s own patent documents   In written answers to questions from Reuters  Juul said that it never intended to attract underage customers  The company acknowledged it needed to  earn back the trust of regulators  policymakers  key stakeholders and society at large  in light of a surge in youth vaping to  unacceptable  levels  Juul declined to comment on why it never installed the features it considered to limit nicotine intake  It said it designed its products to mimic the experience of cigarettes because that was key to getting smokers to buy them  Citing studies it commissioned  the company said Juul users have far more success in quitting smoking than those who tried earlier e cigarettes  The firm seldom mentioned nicotine in early consumer marketing  which featured young  hip models and sold the product as a stylish alternative to cigarettes  But the company s sales force   tasked with convincing reluctant retailers to give Juul shelf space   emphasized the device s unique addictive power by showing store owners charts depicting how the Juul device delivers nicotine to the bloodstream as efficiently as a traditional cigarette  said Vincent Latronica  who headed sales and distribution for the company on the U S  East Coast from 2014 until early 2016  That argument became a central selling point  Latronica said  allowing the young company to overcome retailer skepticism of early e cigarettes and to break into sales channels long dominated by tobacco companies   Everyone wanted it   Latronica said  Juul did not answer questions from Reuters on why the company emphasized the addictive qualities of its product to retailers and downplayed them in advertisements to customers  Inside the company  the first signs that Juul had a strong appeal to young people came almost immediately after the sleek device went on sale in 2015  according to the former company manager  who spoke on condition of anonymity  Employees started fielding calls from teenagers asking where they could buy more Juuls  along with the cartridge like disposable  pods  that contain the liquid nicotine  The calls and other early signs of teenage use kicked off an internal debate  the manager said in an interview  Some company leaders  including founder James Monsees  argued for immediate action to curb youth sales  Monsees served as chief executive and a company director at the time  The counter argument came from other company directors  including healthcare entrepreneur Hoyoung Huh and other early investors  the former manager said  They argued the company couldn t be blamed for youth nicotine addiction because it did not intentionally advertise or sell to teens  said the manager  who had direct knowledge of the internal discussions   Clearly  people internally had an issue with it   the manager said  referring to sales of Juuls to teenagers   But a lot of people had no problem with 500 percent year over year growth   Company leaders also clearly understood the long term benefit of young users on its bottom line  the manager said  It was well known that young customers were  the most profitable segment in the history of the tobacco industry  because research shows that nicotine users who start as teenagers are the most likely to become lifelong addicts  In its written answers to Reuters  Juul said that Monsees  did not recall  the internal debate in 2015 over whether to take action to stop youth sales  Huh and other board members who served at the time of the company s product launch did not respond to requests for comment  Board member Harold Handelsman declined to comment  citing pending lawsuits against the company  Juul declined to make Monsees or company co founder Adam Bowen available for interviews  Following the product s launch  it took nearly three years   and pressure from regulators and U S  senators   before Juul in April 2018 announced what it called a  comprehensive strategy  of measures to curb youth sales  By that time  a leading U S  government youth tobacco survey showed that more than 3 million U S  high school students   one in five   had tried an e cigarette in the prior month  More than a quarter of those vaped at least 20 days a month  The latest available data from the same survey  in September 2019  shows yet another increase  More than one in four high schoolers   27 5    reported using e cigarettes in the previous month   The measures to prevent youth sales and use came two days after the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  announced a nationwide crackdown on underage sales of Juul products  The company committed  30 million for youth prevention efforts  including distributing educational materials to retailers and conducting research into technologies to prevent youth sales  Asked why the company did not act sooner  Juul noted two measures to curb youth sales that it took half a year earlier  in August and September of 2017  raising the minimum age for online purchases through Juul s website to 21 even though some states allow retail sales to anyone over 18  and starting a  retail monitoring program   The company repeated that it now needs to earn back the public s trust and said the firm  reacted to the information that it had  and increased its youth prevention measures as more data came out over the years   The former manager s account of the early debate over young users contradicts repeated statements from executives that the firm was caught off guard by teenage addiction beginning last year    completely surprised   as Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould put it in a CNN interview  That narrative is further undermined by two prominent tobacco researchers who told Reuters that they explicitly warned Juul s founders and a top company scientist about the potential for youth e cigarette abuse  Neal Benowitz at University of California San Francisco  said he told Gal Cohen  the company s director of scientific affairs  that widespread teen use could wreck the company s business   Look  the one thing you have to do is make sure that this doesn t get into the hands of young people   Benowitz recalled telling Cohen about a year after the product launch   If it spreads among kids  this product could be dead   Juul declined to comment on whether tobacco researchers warned company leaders about youth e cigarette addiction  Cohen and Gould did not respond to requests for comment   This inside account of Juul s early inaction on youth addiction comes as the company faces mounting pressure from regulators  CEO Kevin Burns departed in September after a dizzying series of bad headlines for Juul and the industry  an outbreak of mysterious lung illnesses tied to vaping  an FDA warning about the company s unauthorized health claims  and a proposed Trump administration ban on all e cigarette flavors except those mimicking natural tobacco  Juul last month voluntarily halted online sales of flavors such as mango and fruit in the United States after earlier pulling them from retail stores  The company still sells the controversial flavors in many other markets globally  The firestorm around Juul also led to the abandonment of merger talks between Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  and  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  which has a 35  stake in Juul after a  12 8 billion investment last year  Altria last week had to write down that investment by  4 5 billion  citing the regulatory risks   Altria declined to comment for this story  noting that it purchased its stake about a year ago  well after Juul developed its products  Several state attorneys general and a U S  congressional oversight committee are also investigating whether Juul marketed its products to underage users  Monsees and other company leaders have said they regret some of the company s early marketing but maintain it targeted customers in their mid 20s to early 30s  As youth e cigarette use continues to rise   after a long decline in teenage cigarette smoking   doctors  scientists and researchers are grappling with how to treat nicotine addiction among teenagers  Emerging research suggests serious risks to the developing adolescent brain  The combination of a  very  very addictive  product and a developing brain has dangerous implications  said Bonnie Halpern Felsher  a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University s medical school   Rather than your brain getting pleasure from exercising or relationships  your brain becomes rewired to get pleasure from nicotine   she said  Juul did not comment on the research into how e cigarettes harm teenagers  It said it has launched a  robust scientific program to assess the harm reduction potential of Juul products  including their impact on the individual user  as part of a larger effort to comply with FDA regulations  For William Smith  a high school senior in Newburyport  Mass   Juul became an obsession that occupied most of his waking hours  leading to near failing grades and wild mood swings  He first tried it in the summer of 2017 while playing video games at a friend s house and soon couldn t shake the craving  A year later  he was vaping a pod or more every day   an amount of nicotine equivalent to a pack of 20 cigarettes   It honestly controlled me   Smith said   It s almost like I was going insane   TAPPING CIGARETTE INDUSTRY RESEARCH One late night in 2004  company founders Monsees and Bowen were brainstorming for their master s thesis in product design at Stanford University  They went to smoke cigarettes outside the design school studio  as they often did  and started questioning how such a successful yet low tech consumer product   a burning stick of plant material   could have changed so little over time  according to the origin story the founders have told in speeches  interviews and promotional videos  There must be a better  less harmful way to smoke  they figured  so they focused their thesis on creating a new kind of cigarette  Monsees and Bowen went on to start the company Ploom Inc  which was renamed Pax Labs Inc and later became Juul Labs Inc  The Bay Area is a hotbed of tobacco industry research  both at Stanford and the University of California San Francisco  UCSF houses a trove of internal tobacco industry documents made public as part of a 1998 settlement between the largest U S  cigarette manufacturers and 46 state attorneys general   Public health advocates and researchers called the mandated release of millions of formerly secret tobacco industry documents among the most impactful public service legacies of the settlement  The records unmasked the companies  marketing tactics and informed research globally into the dangers of cigarettes  They are credited with laying the groundwork for the first global treaty on tobacco regulation  Juul s creators found another use for the records  product development  Monsees and Bowen started digging into those documents for their thesis research  an endeavor that would continue over the next decade as they drew on knowledge from R J  Reynolds Tobacco Co and others who had spent decades and billions of dollars searching for the optimal balance of flavor and addictive power  During their thesis presentation in 2005  Monsees and Bowen showed a familiarity with research into  safer  cigarettes that tobacco companies had tried  with little success  to develop and sell in the 1980s  Those efforts  however  gave Juul a critical base of research   We had so much information that you wouldn t normally be able to get in most industries   Monsees said during a 2015 interview with entertainment website Social Underground  That allowed the company  he said  to catch up to a  huge  huge industry in no time   They also visited experts in the history of cigarettes and addiction  seeking endorsements for their early concepts  One of them  UCSF s Stanton Glantz  wrote a book drawing extensively on the tobacco documents made public after the 1998 settlement  Glantz recalled a meeting about a decade ago at which Bowen and Monsees told him they aimed to fight back against  the tobacco epidemic   He said he warned them that e cigarette popularity among young people was a big risk  citing the long history of teen addiction to cigarettes   What they told me was they didn t think that was a problem   Glantz said   because they weren t designing this as a product for kids   Juul declined to comment on whether Glantz and other researchers warned the company about the danger of addicting teenagers  In 2010  Monsees and Bowen started selling their first vaping device  the Ploom  It was shaped like a pen and at first used butane to heat metal cylinders filled with tobacco  It wasn t particularly effective at delivering nicotine  said Kurt Sonderegger  one of the first marketing employees at the fledgling company  But it drew interest from Japan Tobacco International  one of the world s largest cigarette makers  which made an early investment  In 2012  the founders introduced a line of vaporizers called Pax  They were designed to heat up loose leaf tobacco but instead became enormously popular as discreet devices for using cannabis  Sleek and fashionable  the Pax products were a hit  but were also expensive  running  200 or more  Pax s popularity with pot smokers helped put the company on the map with consumers  retailers and investors while it continued working on the larger goal of competing with tobacco cigarettes  Pax became  really a play to make money in the shorter term  to fuel their next ambitions  with what would become the Juul device  the former manager said  Latronica  the East Coast sales chief  recalled   We always knew we had this game changer in the background    For a graphic on the evolution of the Juul e cigarette  see    FOCUS ON THE FIRST HIT Monsees and Bowen continued to mine the tobacco industry documents in the years leading up to Juul s 2015 launch  At the time  e cigarettes had been available in the U S  market for a few years but hadn t gained much traction  They used a type of liquid nicotine then sold by wholesalers called freebase nicotine  which had a caustic taste if used at concentrations high enough to mimic a cigarette  The founders hired engineers and scientists drawn from places including Stanford and pharmaceutical companies  Among them was Xing  a research scientist who had previously worked to develop inhalable drugs for conditions such as asthma and migraine headaches  She was intrigued by the opportunity to take a product quickly to market  avoiding years long regulatory drug approval processes  When she joined in 2013  Xing said  Bowen and others at the company were experimenting with the chemical properties of nicotine  They drew on tobacco research from companies such as R J  Reynolds  which had experimented with nicotine s chemistry in the 1980s to create a smoother  light  cigarette with less tar  Xing said  Tar is a chemical substance left behind by burning tobacco  and it contains most of the carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke   We had consultants who were veterans of the big tobacco companies   said Xing  who recalled poring over tobacco company records and research   We learned all the history   Xing and others started to research the smoother type of nicotine that naturally occurred in the tobacco plant  known as  nicotine salts  or  protonated nicotine   This form of the drug was highlighted in a cache of documents from R J  Reynolds in the 1980s as part of an experiment called  Project XGT    R J  Reynolds aimed to make the nicotine in low tar  light  cigarettes more palatable to smokers  The company showed that adding organic acids to cigarettes could neutralize nicotine s bitter taste by reducing its pH  or acid base scale  while also delivering more nicotine  The addition would please customers wanting  a cigarette that is smooth  mild  highest quality  and very refreshing   according to the R J  Reynolds documents  The records do not make clear whether or how the company used the research in its cigarettes   The use of acids to reduce harshness was  a key   Xing said   It was an avenue we could try to go down   When Juul s predecessor company in 2014 filed patent documents describing its nicotine salts formula  it referenced the R J  Reynolds patent on using acids as a cigarette additive   Xing and others tested different kinds of acids to create a nicotine liquid with the optimal blend of smoothness and potency  They ultimately settled on benzoic acid after a series of blind trials  Juul  in its statement to Reuters  said that the development of its nicotine salts formula  did not directly stem from a review of tobacco industry documents   The company acknowledged it consulted R J  Reynolds research  along with a  variety of published sources   but said it discovered through its own experimentation that adding organic acids to liquid nicotine resulted in more efficient delivery of the drug  Xing said the goal was to provide  a similar level of kick and satisfaction  as a cigarette  Blending benzoic acid  a common food preservative  into e cigarette nicotine liquids provided another advantage  a more direct path to the lungs  in which the stimulant is then propelled to the brain through the bloodstream  The freebase nicotine in earlier e cigarettes was more easily absorbed in a user s mouth and throat  a much slower path to the brain  nicotine researchers have found  That means the freebase formulation  never delivers the head buzz or kick   Xing said  The company s goal was to deliver instant satisfaction to skeptical users  said the former manager  Surveys at the time showed that more than half of cigarette smokers had tried e cigarettes but less than 10  became regular users  That s why the first hit was so crucial  the former manager said   We knew there might be a second or third draw  but not necessarily   the person said   Xing left Pax Labs in 2016 and has since started her own e cigarette company in China called Myst Labs  She said she was surprised at how many teenagers gravitated toward Juul  She said her new company takes care to avoid appealing to young people and welcomes tougher regulations to prevent youth sales   We are targeting mature male users   she said   We didn t want to get into similar trouble with the teenagers   PITCHING ADDICTION TO RETAILERS In the leadup to Juul s launch  the breakthrough nicotine blend was crucial to convincing distributors and convenience stores to carry their products  Many large retail chains had been burned by earlier e cigarettes  which sat unsold on shelves   It was very  very difficult to get into doors with e cigarettes  because a lot of these e cigarettes were inferior products   said Latronica  the former East Coast sales chief  The retailers  he said   were sitting on thousands and thousands of dollars of product   Latronica said he started showing owners of vape shops and bodegas in New York City the chart comparing Juul to cigarettes as a way to assure them of repeat business  The chart plotted a line resembling a hockey stick  showing a rapid boost of nicotine to the bloodstream in less than five minutes  Juul s patent contains a chart showing how its nicotine salts formula can deliver more nicotine to the bloodstream than a Pall Mall cigarette  In its statement to Reuters  Juul now says its product delivers slightly less nicotine than a cigarette  To reassure retailers after the 2015 product launch  Juul offered to buy back any unsold devices  Latronica said  It also pitched retailers on profit margins of 36  on Juul pods  the cartridges of nicotine juice it makes  he said  more than three times what stores were netting on cigarettes  Juul pods also carried taxes that were  3 50 less than the levy on comparable cigarette products  making them generally more affordable  according to a document produced by a Juul investor   We were relentless   Latronica said of the sales teams  efforts to reach out to every possible retailer  A pack of four Juul pods costs about  16  with each pod carrying the nicotine equivalent of a pack of 20 cigarettes  The price of a pack of cigarettes in most states is between  6 and  9  but more than  11 in states such as New York and Illinois  The pressure to ramp up sales got more intense when the company announced a major investment right after the product launch  according to another former manager at Juul s predecessor company  The company announced a  46 7 million funding round that included investments from stalwarts like Fidelity Investments and Tao Capital Partners  a fund run by former Hyatt hotels chain executive Nicholas Pritzker  who served on the e cigarette startup s board of directors and remains in that role today  That investment round came in far higher than the amount anticipated by the company  the former manager said  creating immense pressure for swift growth  Adding more pressure  Juul s first year was plagued by production backlogs  Former sales employees recalled the company often couldn t keep up with orders because of faulty devices or leaking nicotine pods   Early advertising around Juul featured fluorescent colors and young models  Customers were urged to  share a  Juulmoment  and revel in its iPhone like design with mottos such as  Simple  Smart  Satisfying    The early advertising and social media campaigns eventually spawned an avalanche of user generated content on Instagram and Twitter  with young people posting photos of themselves using the devices  often under hashtags such as  doit4juul or  juullife  Some teenagers posted YouTube videos of themselves reviewing the device or its pod flavors or performing stunts such as smoking multiple Juuls at once  After regulators cracked down on the company in April 2018  Juul asked social media networks to take down any content promoting youth use of its products  Last fall  the company ended its own social media marketing efforts  MORE NICOTINE THAN A MARLBORO In 15 puffs  a Juul emits about 15  more nicotine than a Marlboro Red cigarette  according to research from the American University of Beirut  Researchers at Portland State University will soon release research into the chemistry of Juul s nicotine blend that finds it is an almost exact match for the addictiveness and ease of inhalation found in a Marlboro  James F  Pankow  a chemistry and engineering professor at the school  told Reuters  The Portland State researchers found that Juul s addition of benzoic acid smoothed out the harshness common in earlier e cigarettes while retaining the  kick  that smokers loved in a Marlboro  The researchers noted that Juul had rapidly duplicated   and improved   a formula that it took tobacco growers and purveyors centuries to perfect   If you think Marlboros are bad because they re addictive  then this is like a Marlboro on steroids   said Pankow  who has long studied the chemistry of nicotine and tobacco smoke   You re taking away the smell  you re putting it in a more discreet and sexy package  you re not lighting it on fire  It has all of the positive points and it takes away a lot of the negative points   Cigarettes also deliver nicotine efficiently to the lungs  the most direct path to the brain  research shows  But some of the smoke is absorbed into the mouth and throat  giving users a so called throat hit that s pleasurable but also harsh enough to slow the intake of smoke and nicotine  Unlike a cigarette  a Juul delivers  high doses of nicotine without it hurting the mouth and throat  at the moment when a user inhales  said Ted Wagener  a tobacco researcher at Ohio State University  Juul s patent documents highlight that its nicotine aerosol  is more readily delivered to the user s lung   as opposed to the mouth or throat  where nicotine would absorb more slowly  with a  less satisfying effect   YOUR BRAIN ON JUUL Addiction can set in quickly among young vapers  Susanne Tanski  a pediatrician and former chair of the tobacco consortium at the American Academy of Pediatrics  said she and colleagues are observing first time Juul users becoming addicted within two months  compared to two years or more for a smoker to become dependent on cigarettes  Young Juulers may also be taking in more nicotine than young smokers  according to a study last year by scientists at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and Stony Brook University in New York  They found that the levels of a nicotine indicator in the urine of young regular users of Juul or similar e cigarettes was nearly 60  higher than that of regular cigarette smokers of the same age  Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital surveyed more than 1 600 high school students in the Boston area and found that 58  of those who had ever tried Juul or similar high nicotine devices continued to use them  compared to just 17  of teenagers who had ever tried cigarettes   The person who is becoming addicted to cigarettes has to be more determined  they almost have to want to become a smoker   said Dr  Jonathan Winickoff  a pediatrician at MassGeneral Hospital for Children in Boston  who was involved in the survey   With Juul  you get trapped much more easily  There s nothing about it that s telling your body that it s harmful   There s a surprising lack of long term research on nicotine s health effects  mostly because other toxins in cigarettes  which cause cancer  have always been the primary concern  But emerging studies suggest serious harmful effects on the developing brains of teenagers  Throughout childhood and into the mid 20s  the human brain is in constant flux  forming new neural pathways that govern how people learn  control impulses and form emotions  Early exposure to nicotine hijacks that process  studies suggest  training the young mind to fixate on acquiring nicotine instead of forming connections that control mood disorders and impulsive behavior  This interruption has a particular impact on parts of the brain that control risk taking  one reason why nicotine addiction is correlated with later use of drugs such as cocaine  Beyond nicotine  other compounds in e cigarette aerosols have been shown to increase the risk of heart attacks and lung disorders  There s little long term clinical research on exposure to e cigarettes  however  because the products are so new  That research gap has frustrated efforts to pinpoint a root cause of more than 1 800 cases of severe lung illnesses tied to vaping in recent months in the United States  E cigarette enthusiasts and some researchers point to studies showing far fewer carcinogenic compounds in e cigarettes than traditional cigarettes  which result in preventable fatal diseases in up to half of all lifetime users  according to the World Health Organization  The U K  Royal College of Physicians  for example  has concluded that e cigarettes are 95  less harmful than traditional cigarettes  citing a reduction in the risk of serious disease and death  For Smith  the Massachusetts high school senior  a hit of a Juul was at first  relaxing and soothing    until it wasn t  Last school year  he often took multiple bathroom breaks during class to sneak vape hits   The second you re done hitting it  you want to use it again   he said  Taking tests and completing homework became difficult because the urge for a Juul hit interfered with his focus  he said  His grades slipped  He nearly failed his second year of algebra after earning an  A  the year before  William s father  Christopher Smith  said it seemed like  no time at all  between first finding his son s nicotine stash and the family s decision to seek help  Since March  Smith has been seeing Winickoff  the Mass General pediatrician  in an attempt to shake his Juul habit  He s planning to take off a year between high school and college  in part to restore his ability to concentrate   It s hard to sum up   he said   It s something that s made my life worse  made my life terrible  I wish I had never started it   Smith wears a prescription

190143,411659,PM,Special Report  How plaintiff lawyers help corporate America keep its secrets,news,"By Jaimi Dowdell and Benjamin Lesser
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Paula Lawlor was sifting through piles of internal General Motors Co  NYSE GM  documents in a hotel room outside of Los Angeles when she hit pay dirt  Company records showing that GM knew for years that stronger roofs on its vehicles could save lives 
The year was 2000  and the researcher was helping a lawyer prepare a case on behalf of a young man who had been paralyzed when the Chevrolet Blazer he was driving flipped  It was one of thousands of lawsuits GM and other automakers faced over the years that claimed that the roofs of their vehicles easily crumpled in rollovers  resulting in severe injury and death 
GM invariably denied the allegations  arguing that roof strength made little difference  Now  Lawlor had in hand evidence to the contrary  Among other documents were 1980s test results showing that people wearing seatbelts in vehicles with stronger roofs were likely to suffer less severe injuries in a rollover 
Such evidence helped persuade a jury to award the plaintiff  15 4 million  But something continued to trouble Lawlor  Only a small fraction of the evidence was aired publicly at trial  Worse  to her mind  was that while dozens of plaintiff lawyers suing GM over roof crush deaths and injuries had seen much of the same evidence over the previous decade  most of it remained hidden under court mandated secrecy the lawyers had accepted 
In those 10 years  more than 5 000 seatbelt wearing passengers died in GM rollover accidents  many more were injured  and the company was still pumping out new vehicles with similar roofs 
As Lawlor saw it  the plaintiff lawyers should have raised alarms   If you see something so egregious  don t you think you have a responsibility to do something   she said 
Lawlor did do something  She embarked on a years long campaign in and out of the courts to expose the evidence about GM vehicles  roof strength   a personal mission that culminated in 2016  when tougher federal standards for vehicle roofs took effect 
The secrecy that prompted her to action  however  has remained pervasive in U S  courts  And as Reuters found  plaintiff lawyers in big product liability cases are often complicit in perpetuating it  Their willing participation in a process that hides critical information about potentially harmful and even deadly products prevents consumers from making informed choices and regulators from taking corrective action 
 Far too many plaintiff lawyers miss the big picture about the good that can be done  by pushing for more transparency in court  said Drew Ashby  a plaintiff lawyer with The Ashby Firm in Atlanta 
That clashes with the image plaintiff lawyers cultivate as champions of transparency  fighting to hold corporate America accountable for making and selling harmful products  As the then president of the American Association for Justice  the plaintiff bar s main lobbying group  said in 2014   Whether it s dangerous cribs  defective drugs or exploding tires  court secrecy endangers consumers and allows corporations to hide wrongdoing  Americans have a right to know about hazardous and defective products  
COMPETING OBLIGATIONS
Dozens of plaintiff lawyers told Reuters they feel compelled to go along with entrenched court secrecy  The main reason  they said  is their duty to their clients  as spelled out in state bar association rules  Many plaintiffs have suffered catastrophic injuries and other hardships and literally can t afford to wait for disputes over what can and can t be made public as bills mount  Of course  such delays can also be costly to the lawyers  who get paid only when a case is settled or decided in their favor 
 You have to balance the need   for an attempt at prompt resolution for the people who are actually the victims of the defendants  conduct  and the need for public disclosure   said Ellen Relkin  a New York plaintiff lawyer who has litigated several high profile product liability cases 
Plaintiff lawyers  interests are thus aligned with those of judges who want to keep the wheels of justice moving and of defendants   usually big companies   that prefer to keep details of their inner workings hidden 
As Reuters reported in June  judges regularly allow information pertinent to public health and safety to be filed under seal  even though court documents are  by law  presumed to be public  In nearly all jurisdictions  judges are required to provide an on the record rationale for allowing litigants to file information under seal   to protect trade secrets  for example  or an individual s medical records   but they rarely do that 
In its analysis  Reuters found that information pertinent to public health and safety was filed under seal in 55 of the 115 biggest product liability cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years  These mega cases  known as multidistrict litigation  MDL   involved products used by millions of consumers 
The secrecy exacts a heavy toll  In just a handful of cases Reuters analyzed  hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products   including cars  drugs and guns   after judges allowed litigants to file under seal evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger 
It s a measure of their role in maintaining court secrecy that in nearly all of the 55 big cases  it was plaintiff lawyers who filed the information under seal  That s because of the way secrecy is baked into the process early on 
During pretrial discovery  when the opposing sides request information from each other to prepare their cases  the defendant usually won t give plaintiffs any information until they agree to a protective order  In theory  these agreements are meant to keep under wraps potentially damaging proprietary or personal information  But in many cases  nearly everything ends up being stamped  confidential   and plaintiff lawyers often just agree to the secrecy without complaint 
Later  when plaintiff lawyers begin filing motions or presenting their cases in court  the standard for imposing secrecy moves higher  Material obtained through discovery that is later submitted as evidence becomes part of the court record  as a matter of law  litigants must provide a reason for submitting such evidence under seal  and the judge must approve 
In most of the big MDLs  however  plaintiff attorneys actually cited the defense s earlier claims of confidentiality to justify filing evidence under seal  Since judges rarely ask for a more specific rationale for the secrecy  documents marked as confidential remain so 
That s true when the parties settle  which is how most product liability cases end  It can also be true after a jury decides in favor of the plaintiff  Sometimes  plaintiff lawyers even agree to keep evidence confidential that has already been aired in open court in other cases 
Lawyers who do fight secrecy seldom succeed  They challenged defendants  claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 23 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed  Judges nearly always refused to unseal the evidence 
A FAILED CHALLENGE
In a GM roof crush case in the 1990s  Donald Friedman  a former GM engineer  served as an expert witness  analyzing the company s crash test data  That and most of the other evidence cited in court was marked confidential  After a jury awarded the plaintiff  8 8 million  Friedman determined that everyone should be able to see what he had seen 
Acting on Friedman s request  Thadd Llaurado  a lawyer on the case  challenged the sealing of GM s records  After nearly a year of briefs and hearings  the judge turned down Llaurado s request to lift the protective order 
 GM has shown that the testing information is of value to GM s competitors   the judge said in his 1993 decision  Among the records the judge kept under seal were about 10 exhibits that had been cited openly in the trial 
GM declined to comment on past roof crush litigation  It said that in general  confidentiality safeguards under the law  have not been an obstacle to continuous improvements in safety  
Yet potentially harmful flaws in many products remain secret years after the first lawsuits are filed  Overly broad protective orders are a big part of the problem  legal experts and plaintiff lawyers said  In 45 of the 55 big MDLs Reuters analyzed  the protective order allowed most any document to be marked as confidential 
One solution is for plaintiff lawyers to push for protective orders that more narrowly define what can be kept confidential 
The strategy worked for Eric Holland  In July 2018  his legal team won a huge victory when a St  Louis jury ordered Johnson   Johnson to pay  4 7 billion to 22 women who had alleged that their ovarian cancer was caused by Baby Powder and other J J talc products tainted with carcinogenic asbestos  J J has appealed the verdict 
Holland told Reuters that many of the documents he thought revealed the full story about talc and asbestos hadn t come out in the trial and were still deemed confidential  He thought they should be made public  In a separate talc case  he negotiated a protective order with J J that limited what the company could mark confidential to trade secrets  personal information and the like 
The more specific order made public internal J J documents showing that the company knew its talc had sometimes tested positive for asbestos  Scientists used that information in a presentation to U S  Food and Drug Administration officials earlier this year  The agency has since said it may consider new rules to improve talc safety 
J J  in a statement to Reuters  noted that it has made thousands of documents available for use in the courts and on its website  The company also said it  has continued to work with plaintiffs  counsel to negotiate appropriate protective orders to protect documents that contain confidential information  
For help drafting the narrower protective order  Holland turned to Public Justice  a nonprofit organization that intervenes in cases to get court records unsealed  The group has developed a model protective order that lays out narrow definitions of what can be marked confidential and makes clear that simply marking a document as confidential is not a sufficient reason to later file the information under seal during court proceedings 
As the first and sometimes only people to know that potentially life saving documents are being sealed  plaintiff lawyers should be the  first line of defense  against harmful secrecy  said Jennifer Bennett  a lawyer with Public Justice 
MASTERING ROOF CRUSH
Court secrecy wasn t on Paula Lawlor s radar when she stumbled into a job as a researcher for Michael Piuze  a Los Angeles personal injury and product liability lawyer who has notched big court victories against cigarette maker Philip Morris  NYSE PM   Lawlor had been helping him on several different cases when he asked her in 2000 to focus on roof crush 
Piuze s client was Robbie Lambert  who in 1990 fell asleep at the wheel of his Chevrolet Blazer  which veered off the road and flipped  Lambert was wearing a seatbelt  but the SUV s roof crumpled inward  The then 18 year old Lambert  who had just been named to the training team for U S  Olympic hockey  was left a quadriplegic 
Lambert s was only the latest among hundreds of lawsuits alleging that roofs on some GM vehicles were too weak to prevent serious injuries and deaths in rollovers  By then  thousands of people had died or been seriously injured in GM rollovers  though it s impossible to determine whether roof crush was responsible 
Lawlor  a then 47 year old mother of seven with no college degree  set to work transforming herself into an expert on all things roof crush  She networked with lawyers across the country  some of them sending her documents they had obtained in discovery in their own lawsuits against GM  Her home became a library of binders  She pulled all nighters poring over documents  She talked about little else with her family 
 Coming home and not thinking about work  that s not for her   said Jennifer Preston  Lawlor s daughter 
As Lawlor pieced together the material  a damning picture emerged  In the 1970s  GM and other automakers persuaded the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  to weaken its originally proposed roof strength standards   after GM vehicles failed to meet those standards in crash tests   but by 1990  GM had conducted its own tests showing that stronger roofs were safer 
The more she read  the more she came to  really understanding how they totally misled everybody all of those years   Lawlor said 
As the trial date approached  Piuze s team set up a  war room  where they met to discuss strategy  prepare motions and review discovery material to be used as evidence  And thus Lawlor found herself in that hotel room outside of Los Angeles in 2000  going through piles of more GM documents 
After her work helped Piuze win the  15 4 million verdict against GM in 2001  Lawlor still felt she had to do something   People were dying   she said 
 Paula knew more about roof crush than most experts and almost all lawyers   Piuze said  The two had discussed challenging the protective order in the Lambert case  but  I didn t have time to get involved in the crusade  I had a lot of clients to satisfy   Piuze said  Still  Lawlor  had my blessing  to bring the full story to light  he said 
In 2003  she got her chance when she began working on a case for Los Angeles lawyer Garo Mardirossian  In 1999  Bing Lin Duan suffered traumatic head injuries when the Chevy Aerostar van his family had rented for a vacation rolled four times on a road near California s Sequoia National Forest  The roof caved in by 10 inches  Duan persisted in a vegetative state for about two years before dying from his injuries at age 65 
When Lawlor came to the case  NHTSA was seeking public comments on a proposal to strengthen its vehicle roof strength standards  The agency  analyzing its own data  had found that rollovers were the most dangerous types of crashes from 1995 to 1999 
Lawlor approached Mardirossian about using the Duan case to challenge the secrecy shrouding the GM litigation  He agreed with her plan 
She knew what to request from GM during discovery  She also knew that some of that information had already been used as exhibits in other trials  which should make them public  This included detailed results of tests GM conducted in the 1980s on Chevrolet Malibu cars   film  data and analysis showing that roofs stronger than the NHTSA standard resulted in less severe injuries in rollovers 
In court  GM and other automakers cited summaries of the Malibu tests that GM engineers published in 1985 and 1990 to argue that roof strength doesn t matter in rollovers  The automakers also used the partial summary results to convince NHTSA that roof standards on the books since 1971 were sufficient 
GM continued to mark all of it   the published summaries and the test details   confidential under protective orders issued in other cases across the country 
 We all knew in the industry  about the tests  Madirossian said   We just couldn t talk about it freely   Under the protective orders  lawyers could discuss the discovery material only with expert witnesses and others involved in the litigation 
In a motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2004  Madirossian argued for sharing the information with safety advocates and NHTSA   The documents are fifteen to forty years old and are of no commercial value  Finally  all of them are of such paramount importance to the health and safety of the public as to outweigh any interest GM might have in keeping them confidential   the motion said 
Judge Mel Red Recana ruled in favor of Mardirossian s motion  Mardirossian estimates that the months long effort to challenge the confidentiality cost about  100 000 in staff time  As the jury entered its second week of deliberation  the two sides settled  Terms weren t disclosed 
Recana declined to comment 
The judge s ruling freed Lawlor  With copies of GM s records  she left Los Angeles in 2004 and  with her two youngest children  moved to be near the beach in San Diego to focus on her mission  On one of her frequent seaside walks  it hit her  Take the fight to Washington  D C 
Money was tight  and she worried about how to pay for her efforts  Then  in 2006  her back was injured in a minor traffic accident  resulting in a legal settlement that paid her  70 000   When I got the money  I was sure it was meant for me to do something big   Lawlor said 
DELIVERED BY HAND
She flew to the capital to deliver more than 1 000 pages of GM s records in person to a NHTSA clerk  In 2007 she gathered engineers  politicians  academics  victims  safety advocates and more for a meeting about roof crush in Washington  She launched a public information campaign that included strategically placed billboards 
In 2007  she co wrote  Deadly by Design   a self published study on how automakers fended off stronger roof strength standards  She sent it to NHTSA and lawmakers  and it was later quoted in a hearing before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science and Transportation 
She also volunteered with the Center for Auto Safety  a Washington based consumer safety group  putting together reports detailing the history of the roof crush controversy  The center was joined by Public Citizen and other advocacy groups in pushing NHTSA to upgrade roof strength standards 
In 2009  NHTSA published a new minimum standard mandating that the roofs of all passenger vehicles be able to withstand three times their empty weight in tests  doubling the earlier requirement  The agency also changed testing procedures to more closely resemble real world crashes 
At the time  the agency said the upgraded standard would prevent 135 deaths and more than 1 000 injuries a year  In 2010  the agency published a study that  confirms a relationship between greater roof strength and fewer injuries  
In a statement to Reuters  NHTSA did not address Lawlor s efforts or the importance of the documents she shared with the agency   Safety related information developed or discovered in private litigation is an important resource for NHTSA   the regulator said 
After the 2009 rule change  Lawlor took some time off and traveled to France  where she had a religious epiphany  These days  she leads pilgrimages to a holy site in southern France 
Starting in September 2016   16 years after Lawlor first came across the documents that launched her campaign   every passenger vehicle sold in the United States was required to adhere to the new roof strength standard ",2019-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-how-plaintiff-lawyers-help-corporate-america-keep-its-secrets-2014807,2014807

190148,411664,PM,Juul boss exits in vaping crisis as Philip Morris  Altria axe merger talks,news,"By Siddharth Cavale and Nivedita Balu  Reuters    The chief executive of e cigarette maker Juul stepped down on Wednesday as merger talks between its biggest investor Altria and Philip Morris collapsed in the face of a regulatory backlash against vaping that could reshape the industry  Juul Labs  in which tobacco giant  Altria Group   N MO  owns a 35  stake  is facing intense scrutiny in its home market as teen use of e cigarettes surges  The company  which faces a U S  ban on some products  said on Wednesday that it would suspend all advertising in the country   Marlboro makers Philip Morris International  N PM  and Altria  announcing the end of their  187 billion merger talks  said they would instead focus on the joint launch of tobacco heating product iQOS in the United States   It appears to us the talks fell apart over Juul    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note  adding she was not surprised  given the litany of negative health headlines  Philip Morris and Altria did not mention the e cigarette firm  however  Vaping devices such as Juul s  which vaporize liquid containing nicotine  have borne the brunt of the regulatory crackdown globally   The iQOS  which heats but does not burn tobacco  is a rival non smoking technology and  crucially  has been authorized by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   When the talks were announced last month  the potential for Juul and iQOS to dominate the biggest vaping markets globally was seen as central to the logic of a deal  It would have seen the tobacco companies reunite a decade after their split and created an industry heavyweight with a combined market value of  187 billion  triple its closest rival  British American Tobacco   L BATS    However  some investors were skeptical of the synergies the deal would generate and a steady rise in number of vaping related deaths and illnesses reported in the United States may also have changed the companies  thinking    After much deliberation  the companies have agreed to focus on launching iQOS in the U S  as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke free future   Philip Morris CEO Andr  Calantzopoulos said   SURGE IN YOUNG VAPERS The Trump administration in the United States has announced plans to remove all flavored e cigarettes from store shelves due to the rising appeal among teenagers   The share of high school students using e cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years  with 27 5  reporting they had tried an e cigarette in the past month  according to preliminary federal data released this month   U S  health officials are also investigating an outbreak of hundreds of severe lung illnesses and nine deaths linked to vaping   In its announcements on Wednesday  Juul also said it would not lobby the administration over the proposed ban on flavored products   The FDA earlier this month warned the company about marketing its products as safer than traditional cigarettes and requested more documents and information within 30 days  Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe into e cigarette maker Juul  the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday  though the focus of the probe was unclear   Elsewhere in the world  South Korea and India last week became the latest countries after Brazil and Thailand to ban or warn about the sale of e cigarettes  dealing further blows to the still young industry  Factbox on global backlash   FULL FORCE  IQOS LAUNCH Stifel analyst Chrisopher Growe said Altria  which holds the license to sell iQOS in the United States  would embark on a  full force  effort to launch the product  taking advantage of being the only tobacco heating product approved for sale   The company is expected to launch the product in Atlanta  imminently  and then quickly broaden distribution  he said  Philip Morris will sell iQOS in all other markets   San Francisco based Juul said it was replacing CEO Burns with K C  Crosthwaite  a longtime Philip Morris USA veteran and most recently the chief strategy and growth officer of Altria  a sign of Altria s growing influence over Juul after its  12 8 billion investment in the e cigarette maker last December  Burns  a former private equity executive who came to Juul in late 2017 from yogurt maker Chobani  presided over meteoric growth at the company  as it morphed from a 300 person startup to an international operation employing thousands  His tenure also coincided with the sharp rise in teenage e cigarette use and a regulatory crackdown on the industry   Altria has many more years of experience than Juul dealing with regulators such as the FDA   Shares in Philip Morris were up 5 7   while Altria was down 2 5  in afternoon trading

190150,411666,PM,StockBeat  Up Day Punctured by Big Falls in ABN  Imperial,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    The stench of money laundering is hanging over Europe s banks again 
ABN Amro  AS ABNd  fell 8 5  Thursday after it said Dutch prosecutors were investigating it for possible breaches of anti money laundering law  an investigation which reports said encompassed years of transactions by ABN clients 
That put it at the bottom of the local AEX index  on a day when most indices in Europe were enjoying an up day as they bob helplessly up and down on the tide of inconsistent news out of the U S  and China about their trade dispute 
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0 7  by 5 AM ET  0900 GMT   while the U K  FTSE 100 was up 1 1  and the German Dax was up 0 6  
Domestic investors are in no mood to trust to the leniency of the authorities  who slapped ABN s bigger rival   ING Groep    AS INGA  with a  900 million fine for missing years of illegal payments by its clients   a fine that also reflected the breadth of public hostility to pay levels at the top of the bank 
As a result  ABN shares are now back to within 6  of the three year low that they hit in August 
The news comes only a day after police confirmed the death of Aivar Rehe  who had overseen the suspected laundering of over 200 billion euros through the Estonian branch of   Danske Bank    CSE DANSKE  between 2006 and 2015   Rehe was a witness  but not a suspect  in Estonian prosecutors  investigations 
Danske shares have fallen by more than 60  since the scandal erupted early last year  So much bad news has now been priced into the share price that news of Rehe s death failed to move it   
Sub par behavior isn t limited to banks  of course  Ericsson  BS ERICAs   the Swedish maker of telecoms network gear  fell 0 4  after setting aside  1 billion to cover the cost of settling historical corruption allegations  The company had warned about the potential costs some months back but had so far failed to put a price on them  The final price could be more or less than the provision announced late on Wednesday 
Elsewhere  software group   TeamViewer    DE TMV  got off to a labored start after its IPO in Frankfurt  the biggest tech IPO in Germany since chipmaker Infineon in 2000  The company s shares were down 1 0  at 25 05 euros  after listing on Wednesday at a price of 26 25 
TeamViewer s problems paled in comparison to those of tobacco giant Imperial Brands  LON IMB   which fell 10 3  after it cut its sales forecast for this year due to  challenging  conditions for its non traditional products  The merger of Altria  NYSE MO  and Philip Morris  NYSE PM  fell apart on Wednesday as Juul labs  the maker of vaping products in which Altria has invested heavily  lost its CEO and suspended U S  advertising in response to a widening health scare around its products ",2019-09-26,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-up-day-punctured-by-big-falls-in-abn-imperial-1986608,1986608

The concern stems from rising instances of breathing problems experienced by otherwise healthy users of e cigarettes that they use for vaping  At least six have died  and more than 450 cases have been recorded across the country this summer 
The health issues appear related to the presence of THC oil in vaping products smoked in the Juul e cigarette  THC is the compound in marijuana that creates a high  Privately held Juul s cigarette normally packages nicotine salts from leaf tobacco into one time use cartridges 
The Food and Drug Administration is finalizing plans to pull all flavored e cigarette cartridges from the market  leaving only the tobacco flavor  in an effort to discourage youth vaping    Altria Group    NYSE MO  fell 1   while Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  lost 0 4  ",2019-09-11,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/general/trump-says-hes-looking-into-banning--nontobacco-products-1975791,1975791
190155,411671,PM,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com    Markets rise as Donald Trump makes a goodwill gesture to China on trade  while Europe waits to see if the European Central Bank will cut interest rates and restart quantitative easing  And OPEC gets a warning that there s a new oil glut in the offing  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  12th September 
1  Trump delays China tariff hike as goodwill gesture
President Donald Trump said he would postpone the planned 5 percentage point increase in tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports by two weeks as a gesture of goodwill 
As a result  the Chinese Communist Party s celebration of taking power 70 years ago will not be overshadowed by the latest episode in a trade war that has slowed the country s economy   It also means that there will have been no further escalation of the dispute by the time U S  and Chinese trade negotiators meet in early October 
Separately  Bloomberg reported that China is also considering allowing imports of U S  agricultural products including soybeans and pork to resume  although there was no confirmation of that from either side 
2  Draghi expected to go out with all guns blazing
The European Central Bank will hold a regular policy meeting and is expected to announce a package of measures to support a eurozone economy which is slowing down under the impact of U S  trade policy  but which still grew at an annual rate of 1 2  in second quarter 
The bank is expected by many analysts to lower its deposit rate  currently at  0 4   even further into negative territory  and to extend its current commitment not to raise rates until the middle of next year  While some expect it also to resume quantitative easing  several ECB officials have argued against it in recent weeks  Measures to soften the impact of negative rates on bank profitability are also expected 
The ECB will announce its rate decision and forward guidance at 7 45 AM ET  1145 GMT   and outgoing President Mario Draghi may announce further actions at his press conference at 8 30 AM ET 
3  Stocks set for higher open
U S  stock markets are poised to open higher on the back of Trump s gesture to China 
By 6 AM ET  Dow futures were indicated up 64 points or 0 2   while S P 500 Futures were up 0 1  and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0 3  
The bond market has settled into a holding pattern ahead of the ECB meeting  as the meeting in Frankfurt could raise the pressure on the Federal Reserve to act if outgoing president Mario Draghi manages to talk the euro down any further at his press conference  The 30 year Treasury bond yield fell back to 2 20  after hitting an overnight high of 2 23  in response to Trump s trade tweeting 
Weekly jobless claims data and August s consumer price inflation numbers are both due at 8 30 AM ET  1230 GMT  
Stocks likely to be in focus include Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   which is reportedly planning to revive plans for an IPO of its Asian business 
4  U S  aims to ban most vaping products
President Trump said the U S  intends to ban most vaping products on public health concerns  highlighting their popularity with teenagers and young adults 
The Food and Drug Administration intends to ban fruit flavored vaping products  as well as menthol and mint e cigarettes 
The move could severely crimp a fast growing markets valued at an estimated  9 billion this year  one that Big Tobacco had seen as their salvation given the decline of traditional cigarettes  It also puts another big question mark over the mooted recombination of Altria  NYSE MO  and Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   given the importance of market leader Juul Labs  in which Altria has a 35  stake  to that deal  The Juul stake currently accounts for 16  of Altria s market value 
5  OPEC  no closer to deeper output cuts as IEA forecasts  daunting  market
Officials from the so called OPEC  group of oil exporters in Abu Dhabi wagged a finger at those members who are over producing but chose not to recommend changes to the current deal on output restraint 
Russia  Iraq and Nigeria all pumped above their agreed ceilings in August  and OPEC s own members alone produced some 240 000 barrels a day more than OPEC s own forecasts say the world needs going forward 
Elsewhere  the International Energy Agency warned that the recent decline in world oil stocks was temporary and that rising non OPEC production would tip the world market well into surplus through 2020  putting fresh downward pressure on prices and creating a  daunting  prospect for OPEC

190157,411673,PM,India bans e cigarettes as global backlash at vaping gathers pace,news,"By Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI  Reuters    India banned the sale of electronic cigarettes on Wednesday and warned of an  epidemic  among young people  in the latest and potentially biggest move globally against vaping over growing health concerns 
The ban cuts off a huge future market from e cigarette makers at a time when the number of people smoking worldwide is declining  It could dash the expansion plans of companies such as Juul Labs and Philip Morris International  N PM  in the country 
 These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavours and their use has increased exponentially and acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries  especially among youth and children   India s health ministry said 
The ban also covers the production  import and advertising of e cigarettes   but not the use of them  It comes at a time when vaping is facing increased scrutiny in other countries 
The United States last week announced plans to remove flavoured e cigarettes from stores  warning that sweet flavours had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction 
The Indian prohibition will be imposed through an executive order and will include jail terms of up to three years for offenders 
India has 106 million adult smokers  second only to China in the world  making it a lucrative market for companies making vaping products such as U S  based Juul and Philip Morris  which manufactures a heat not burn tobacco device 
The ban was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a news conference  where she showed various types of products to the media  including a Juul vaping device  which resembles a USB flash drive 
Juul had plans to launch its e cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months  Philip Morris also has plans to launch its heat not burn smoking device in India  Reuters has reported 
A spokeswoman for Juul in India declined to comment  Philip Morris did not respond to a request for comment 
Juul  in which tobacco giant Altria group  N MO  owns a 35  stake  is already facing government scrutiny in its home market and elsewhere  In China  Juul said on Tuesday its products were not currently available on e commerce websites  days after it entered the market 
HEALTH DISPUTE
India s vapour products market was valued at  57 million in 2018  according to data from Euromonitor International  Before the ban  the research group estimated the market in India would grow by nearly 60 percent a year up to 2022 
Shane MacGuill  head of tobacco research at Euromonitor in London  said the India ban could push other countries to follow suit  hurting the global vapour industry 
 India is obviously a market of huge potential for vapour products   he told Reuters   This ban would decisively cut off access to that potential growth cohort for companies like Juul Labs and PMI  Philip Morris International   
The global market for e cigarettes is still small compared to cigarettes  but is growing rapidly  Last year global cigarette sales totalled more than  713 billion  compared to  15 7 billion for vapour products  according to Euromonitor  By 2023  the vapour category is projected to more than double to  40 billion  while cigarettes are expected to decline slightly 
Advocates for e cigarettes say vaping  which usually involves inhaling a vapour formed from heating up a liquid containing nicotine  is far less harmful than smoking tobacco 
But many tobacco control activists are opposed to the devices  saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people towards consuming tobacco 
More than 900 000 people die each year due to tobacco related illnesses in India  home to about 1 3 billion people 
The Association of Vapers India  an organisation that represents e cigarette users across the country  attacked the government s decision  saying it would deprive millions of smokers of a safer solution to cut back on smoking 
COURT CHALLENGE 
The ban order will impose a jail term of up to one year and a fine of 100 000 rupees   1 404  for first time offenders  A repeat violation would attract a jail term of up to three years and a penalty of up to 500 000 rupees  the government said 
The ban would cover the manufacture  import  sale  advertisement and distribution of e cigarettes  But it would not apply to the end users of such devices  Vikas Sheel  a senior official at India s health ministry  told Reuters 
 Over a period of time  people will not get their  vape  refills  so they will become responsible   he said 
The government expects the ban order to be challenged in court  but was prepared to defend its decision  Sheel added 
Shares in  ITC   NS ITC   India s top cigarette maker  ended up nearly 1   while its rival Godfrey Phillips  NS GDFR  surged 5 2   E cigarettes form just a tiny part of their product range 
The ban order needs to be approved by the president before it takes effect  but this is typically a formality 
Such executive orders are typically issued as an emergency measure when Indian parliament is not in session  The ban order could lapse if it is not approved when lawmakers convene against in the next session of parliament  which will most likely be held in November ",2019-09-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/india-bans-ecigarettes-as-global-backlash-at-vaping-gathers-pace-1980895,1980895

190162,411678,PM,Philip Morris and Altria in merger talks as Marlboro fades and e cigs light up,news,By Uday Sampath Kumar and Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    Marlboro maker Philip Morris International Inc  N PM  said on Tuesday it was in talks to reunite in a merger with  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  following its 2008 spin off  as the tobacco giants seek to pool resources in the fast growing e cigarette market  The merger between the two companies  the biggest ever in the consumer sector and the fourth largest deal of all time  would create a tobacco giant with a market capitalization of approximately  200 billion  It would come two years after  British American Tobacco  Plc  L BATS  bought out Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI  for  49 billion  underscoring how the decline in cigarette smoking globally is pushing tobacco companies to seek scale and pool resources in their development of alternative products   Under the terms of the all stock merger being discussed  Altria shareholders would receive no premium and own between 41  to 42  of the combined company  with Philip Morris shareholders owning the remainder  according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the details publicly  The board of the combined company would be split evenly between Philip Morris and Altria directors  the source said  If the deal negotiations prove successful  an agreement could be reached by the end of September  the source added  The two U S  headquartered companies separated 11 years ago to focus on different geographic markets  at a time when tobacco stocks generated steady yields  Since then  the industry has been disrupted by a move away from traditional smoking into e cigarettes and vaping   The two have responded with new offerings  Philip Morris  which operates outside the United States  has developed a heated tobacco product called iQOS  Altria  which operates in the United States and still sells Marlboro in the country  acquired a 35  stake in vaping company Juul Labs Inc last year for  12 8 billion  Some analysts and investors fretted that the lack of geographic overlap between the two companies could limit the value of operational synergies  Philip Morris and Altria shares ended trading on Tuesday down 7 8  and 4   respectively  giving the companies market capitalizations of  112 billion and  84 5 billion   There currently is no overlap in operations of both companies other than the IQOS licensing agreement in the U S  As such there would be little in the way of cost synergies other than corporate overheads and better leafbuying power   Jefferies analysts said in a research note   Philip Morris and Altria see scope in consolidating their manufacturing operations to generate annual synergies of more than  800 million  according to the source  Industry wide cigarette sales volumes tumbled 4 5  on an adjusted basis in 2018  according to analysts at Cowen  Global sales of cigarettes were estimated at  714 billion last year  according to Euromonitor International  GRAPHIC  Market Shares of Tobacco Companies Worldwide    In contrast  the e cigarette market was worth about  11 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at more than 8  annually over the next five years  according to research firm Mordor Intelligence  In April  Philip Morris won approval from the U S  Food and Drug Administration to sell iQOS in the United States    With disruption facing the world of tobacco  we can see some merit in a re merger   Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott said in a note   The combined entity   Philip Morris 2 0   could present a united front  on next generation products such as iQOS  and  go about a coordinated global brand building exercise the same way Philip Morris originally built Marlboro    SIMPLIFYING PARTNERSHIP  Unlike combustible cigarettes  iQOS devices heat tobacco filled sticks wrapped in paper  generating an aerosol that contains nicotine  They are different from e cigarettes such as the popular Juul device  which vaporizes a nicotine filled liquid  Altria already can market iQOS in the United States under a licensing agreement  which includes royalty payments to Philip Morris  A merger between the two companies would simplify that agreement  The source close to the deal talks said the merger negotiations started as an extension of this partnership  At the same time  Altria could tap into Philip Morris  global sales force to aid in Juul s international expansion   In a note to clients on Tuesday   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Bonnie Herzog said a deal would create the leading global nicotine company by improving cash flow and accelerating the worldwide rollout of Juul and iQOS  Philip Morris has annual revenue of nearly  30 billion  while Altria generated about  20 billion last year  Both companies said there could be no assurance a deal would be reached   Any deal would need to be approved by the companies

190167,411683,PM,BAT launches more vaping products in Japan to take on Philip Morris,news," Reuters     British American Tobacco   L BATS  said it would launch two new tobacco heating products in Japan under its glo brand  as it seeks to close the gap with market leader Philip Morris International Inc  N PM  in the country s fast growing vaping industry 
The new products  glo pro and glo nano  come with new heating technologies and slimmer sizes and will be available in Japan from October  the company said  a month after it launched another product   glo sens   in Tokyo  The glo brand was introduced in Japan in 2016 
The introduction of these vaping devices  known as  heat not burn  products  is part of new Chief Executive Jack Bowles  plan to slim down the company s  new categories  business to just three brands  including glo 
Unlike combustible cigarettes  heat not burn products heat tobacco filled sticks wrapped in paper to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine  They are different from e cigarettes such as the popular Juul device  which vaporizes a nicotine filled liquid 
Philip Morris leads the heat not burn  HNB  market with its iQOS product in Japan  which has emerged as a fertile test ground for vaping products since e cigarettes using nicotine laced liquid are not allowed under the country s pharmaceutical regulation 
According to analysts at Nomura  the HNB market nearly doubled in Japan in 2018 from the year earlier  with iQOS commanding a 71 8  share of the market  followed by BAT s glo products with 20 1   Local player Japan Tobacco Inc s  T 2914  Ploom TECH comes third with 8 1  
The urgency for BAT to strengthen its business in Japan comes on the heels of Philip Morris  announcement last week that it was in talks to merge with Altria  NYSE MO   which has a stake in U S  e cigarette market leader Juul

1  Stocks set for higher opening
Wall Street is set to open the week modestly higher after a relatively drama free weekend  at least as regards the key issues of trade and monetary policy 
By 6 AM ET  Dow Futures were up 65 points or 0 2   while the S P 500 futures contract was up 9 points or 0 3  and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 22 points or 0 3  
Neither the dollar nor the bond markets are showing any clear direction in the wake of a labor market report on Friday that showed slowing payrolls growth but solid wage gains and  in the words of Harvard economist Megan Greene  allowed everyone to project their existing prejudices onto it

2  Everybody hurts  especially Chinese exporters
China s economy is hurting from the imposition of U S  tariffs  Fresh data overnight showed exports down by 1  on the year in August  well short of the 2  rise expected  Imports fell by a slightly smaller than expected 5 6   while the country s trade surplus fell by nearly a quarter to  34 8 billion from  45 billion in July 
The figures come only days after others showing that the U S  s trade deficit with China is clearly narrowing  even though its overall trade deficit hasn t fallen that much 
Elsewhere  there were signs of life from the stricken German economy  with exports eking out a gain of 0 7  on the month in July and defying expectations for another drop 
3  Tobacco  cannabis stocks in focus after CDC warning on vaping products
Tobacco stocks may be in focus later after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention warned late on Friday that vaping products may be responsible for a wave of sudden and acute health problems 
The CDC said that its investigation is ongoing and has not identified a cause  but all reported cases have a history of using e cigarette products 
The news comes barely a week after reports that Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  and Altria   NYSE MO  were looking at re combining  with a view to reviving growth through e cigarette products 
4  U K  Parliament set to debate new elections
Another crucial week for sterling started with Prime Minister Boris Johnson being told by his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar that he has seen no acceptable substitute for the so called  backstop  arrangements designed to safeguard smooth trade across the Irish border after Brexit 
Over the weekend  Amber Rudd  a senior minister  had resigned from Johnson s government saying she saw no evidence that he wanted to secure a deal with the EU before the Oct  31 deadline  while other ministers had to deny rumors that they would soon follow suit 
The bill passed last week that requires Johnson to ask for a three month extension of the Brexit deadline is set to receive royal assent and become law Monday  The House of Commons will then debate the possibility of a snap General Election  which is now widely seen as the only way of breaking the current logjam  The British pound rose 0 6  against the dollar and 0 3  against the euro after a modest upside surprise from July s industrial output and construction data  
5  Saudi Arabia fires oil minister
Saudi Arabia replaced Khalid al Falih as Energy Minister with Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman  an energy ministry veteran and the half brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  the kingdom s de facto ruler 
The appointment breaks with tradition  in as much as Saudi Arabia has generally not entrusted the all important oil ministry to a single member of the royal family before  As such  the move appears to be more of an attempt to consolidate power by  MBS  

Abdulaziz told reporters Monday there would be no radical change to Saudi output policy  Some saw his appointment as more concerned with speeding up the timeline for the initial public offering of national oil company  Saudi Aramco 
Oil prices have ticked up over the weekend  supported by Iran s final break with the UN agreement limiting its nuclear enrichment limits  and by Baker Hughes  rig count which showed the number of active oil rigs falling to the lowest in two years last week  By 6 AM  WTI crude futures were up 0 9  ta  57 05 a barrel  while Brent futures were up 0 8  at  62 05 a barrel ",2019-09-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-1973248,1973248

The Swiss School of Public Health  a foundation of eight universities offering post graduate health education  told Cassis in an open letter made public on Wednesday that Philip Morris was among firms that long downplayed smoking s risks  including early death 
Taking tobacco money contradicts  all ethical principles  of the health sciences  the group wrote 
 This industry has deceived the public for decades  spread lies about the effects of smoking and passive smoking  and with massive investments misled the population into believing that science was not unified on these questions   the foundation said in a three page letter urging Cassis not to take the money 
Cassis  a medical doctor and former president of the national health association Public Health Schweiz  is now reviewing the sponsoring deal  Swiss media including the Aargauer Zeitung and tabloid Blick have reported

    Among other things  the MOU includes prohibitions on advertising  sales  promotion and sponsoring through tobacco products  WHO spokesman said  After Philip Morris s support of Switzerland s pavilion in Dubai became public  the WHO has begun communicating with BIE  as well as Swiss officials in Bern  over the apparent conflict 
     Obviously  any sponsorship or sales of tobacco products would not be in agreement with the memorandum   WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said   The WHO has always been very strong on its messaging about tobacco products  About 8 million people a year die from smoking related disease

ZURICH  Reuters    Switzerland scrapped a 1 8 million Swiss franc   1 8 million  sponsorship deal with Philip Morris International  N PM  for the country s pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai after being widely criticized for taking tobacco money to promote its image abroad 
Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis made the decision so as  not to undermine the primary objective of the Swiss presence in Dubai  which is to convey a positive image of Switzerland   the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday 
 After examining the case  he decided that the work on this sponsorship should not be continued  
The World Health Organization  WHO  had criticized the deal for violating agreements it had struck over Expo sponsorships 
Eight Swiss universities offering health education also told Cassis  a medical doctor  in a letter last week that taking money from a cigarette maker contradicted ethical principles 
Cassis has ordered revisions to the ministry s sponsorship policy by the end of the year to prevent similar situations from re occurring 
Philip Morris  which during the controversy had emphasized its efforts to promote heated tobacco products as an alternative to traditional smoking  said it was disappointed 
 We regret not only this decision  but also the circumstance that the foreign minister was brought into this position by activists and organizations  especially since these actors say they want to end smoking but apparently don t have any interest in an open dialogue about grounded science  innovation and better alternatives for smokers   it said in a statement 
The WHO  in a report on the global tobacco epidemic  said last week that e cigarettes and heated tobacco products were not helping fight cancer

a 21 year old woman in Russia  The company s internal  marketing standards  prohibit it from promoting tobacco products with youth oriented celebrities or  models who are or appear to be under the age of 25   The company told Reuters of the decision late Friday  saying it had launched an internal investigation into marketing posts and photographs that Reuters sent to the company for comment earlier this week  They included a paid post plugging the tobacco product by social media  influencer  Alina Tapilina in Moscow   who listed her age as 21 on Instagram   alongside often seductive photos of herself drinking wine  swimming and posing with little clothing in luxurious settings   We have taken the decision to suspend all of our product related digital influencer actions globally   the company told Reuters   Whilst the influencer in question is a legal age adult smoker  she is under 25 and our guidance called for influencers to be 25  years of age  This was a clear breach of that guidance    No laws were broken   the company told Reuters   However  we set high standards for ourselves and these facts do not excuse our failure to meet those standards in this instance   The company added   We were deeply disappointed to discover this breach and are grateful that it was brought to our attention   The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  last month decided it would allow sales of the IQOS device in the United States after a two year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product  The FDA declined to comment Friday evening on Philip Morris s decision to suspend the marketing campaign  The agency earlier said it would  keep a close watch on     how the company is marketing its products   While most of the social media influencers hired by Philip Morris overseas did not list their ages on Instagram  a Reuters review of the firm s social media marketing of IQOS in Japan  Italy  Switzerland  Russia and Romania shows that Tapilina s online persona was typical of what the company called its social media  ambassadors  for the device   rail thin young women who revel in the high life  The company did not directly respond to additional questions Friday night regarding the intended audience for its digital influencer campaigns  Many of the messages contained the hashtag   IQOSambassador   tying them into a network of social media influencers that the international tobacco giant has relied on to brand the IQOS as a safer alternative to cigarettes and a sexy fashion accessory   I finally have the new IQOS 3  and I can confidently say yes to change   the level of harmful substances is on average about 90 percent lower than in smoke   Tapilina wrote in an April post   You haven t yet switched to IQOS   One Romanian IQOS marketer is 25 years old  according to a separate actress biography  but did not list her age on Instagram  Tapilina and nine other IQOS marketers did not respond to requests for comment  Philip Morris  in its statement to Reuters  said its suspension of the social marketing campaign is  concrete proof  of its  conviction to achieve a smoke free world through socially responsible practices   Matthew Myers  president of The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  had a different take upon hearing of the suspension Friday night  The advocacy group collected some of the IQOS marketing images reviewed by Reuters  Philip Morris  he said   is changing their behavior only when caught red handed   The company  Myers said  has historically been  the single most successful across the globe in making cigarettes fashionable to young people   HAPPY VALENTINES DAY  Over the past year  Philip Morris has increasingly publicized its  mission  to prevent young people from using tobacco products  Last month  it issued a release calling on  all tobacco and e cigarette companies to do their part to guard against youth nicotine use    Let me be clear  We at Philip Morris International do not  and will not  market or sell our products to youth   CEO Andr  Calantzopoulos said during a speech in Boston earlier this month   For Philip Morris International  age matters   When Philip Morris submitted marketing plans with an FDA application for IQOS in 2017  its sample advertisements featured models appearing at least a decade older and wearing modest  professional clothes  That application  which is still pending before the FDA  seeks approval to market the IQOS as less harmful than smoking and outlines company plans to ensure it doesn t market the device to  non intended audiences   The device heats up but does not burn packages of ground up tobacco  which resemble small cigarettes  to create a nicotine filled aerosol  In Japan  the intended audience for IQOS marketing includes the Instagram followers of Ayame Tachibana  a 27 year old DJ and model  In one post  she shows off a Valentine s Day message for the IQOS device  lovingly scrawled with multicolored pens   Happy Valentine IQOS  Love you sooo much   reads the Instagram post from February  Alina Eremia  a Romanian actress and singer  holds a gold colored IQOS in front of a Christmas tree   My list of resolutions contains 95  fewer moments without a smile   says Eremia  who is 25 according to her actress biography on multiple movie and celebrity information websites  Philip Morris says the IQOS   an acronym for  I quit ordinary smoking    contains up to 95 percent fewer toxic compounds than cigarettes  Vlad Parvulescu  a manager for Eremia  confirmed she had been hired to promote IQOS and said she had been contacted by a Romanian public relations agency  He did not respond to additional questions about the financial arrangement  Marketing deals between companies and social media influencers vary widely  according to industry experts  But typically a company will work through third party public relations or advertising firms that have relationships with online personalities  Compensation typically ranges from  20 to  25 000 or more for each post  Corporations have become increasingly sophisticated in how they approach their social media campaigns in the past two years  said Joe Gagliese  co founder of Viral Nation  a marketing and talent agency that works with influencers  He once had to explain the basic concept of an  influencer  in pitch meetings  Now  companies approach him with  tailor made decision briefs saying   this is exactly what we want    Reuters reviewed dozens of social media posts featuring the IQOS device  Many included hashtags such as  IQOSAmbassador   paidad  and  notriskfree  indicating that they are IQOS marketing posts   Many of the Instagram influencers featuring the products had tens of thousands of followers  and a few had more than a million  VIRAL CAMPAIGNS  BLURRED LINES Devices such as IQOS and Juul hold potential as a way for cigarette smokers to transition to less harmful nicotine products  but some public health advocates worry the sleek new devices are addicting young people who would have never smoked cigarettes  Among traditional cigarette smokers  90 percent start smoking before the age of 18  according to federal data  Philip Morris said there have been  no reports  of  worrisome levels  of unintended use of IQOS  As part of the FDA review process  Philip Morris pledged to market only to adult cigarette smokers once it begins selling IQOS this summer through a partnership with  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the U S  IQOS delivers about the same level of nicotine as a traditional cigarette  Altria did not respond to requests for comment  Social media marketing has become a flashpoint in the debate over regulation of tobacco products  particularly the newest generation of products such as the wildly popular Juul e cigarettes  Some of Juul s early social media and YouTube marketing included images of attractive young people  particularly at a 2015 product launch party  Twitter images from that time on Juul s official account featured sensual images of a young woman breathing out Juul vapor in a group  next to the slogan   Share a  Juulmoment   Those early campaigns sparked an explosion of video and photo posts from young people showing themselves using the product at school or with friends  often under the hashtags  doit4juul or  juullife  Juul Labs Inc has since said it stopped using social media influencers and requires anyone in its ads to be a former cigarette smoker older than 35  Juul Labs Inc said in a statement it recognizes that  some of our earliest marketing initiatives did not fully reflect the goal of our company   which it describes as helping cigarette smokers transition to its products    As a young company  we learned from our experiences and instituted changes to help ensure that we are only reaching current adult smokers   the company said   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL U S  laws governing tobacco advertising   which is banned on radio and television   were drawn up long before social media and digital advertising became a dominant force in consumer marketing  Although no current state or federal law restricts tobacco advertising on the Internet   including for e cigarettes and devices such as IQOS   the FDA can use its authority over new devices to assert sweeping control over a company s marketing  As a condition for allowing the device to be sold  the FDA is requiring Philip Morris to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches through digital advertising  Philip Morris is also required to submit any new advertising campaigns  including digital and social media efforts  to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them  Any paid influencers promoting the product also must disclose  any relationships between you and entities that create labeling for  advertise  market  and or promote the products  on your behalf  or at your direction   Those rules aim to restrict youth access to tobacco marketing  the FDA said in a statement   especially in shared digital properties such as social media sites  ,2019-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-philip-morris-suspends-social-media-campaign-after-reuters-exposes-young-influencers-1865142,1865142
190199,411715,PM,Citing Reuters report  health groups push tech firms to police tobacco marketing,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    More than 100 public health and anti tobacco organizations are calling on  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   Instagram  Twitter and  Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP  to take  swift action  to curb advertising of tobacco products on their platforms  The organizations  letter to the firms cited a recent Reuters report  documenting how cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  has used young personalities on Instagram to sell a new  heated tobacco  product called IQOS   The groups said social media firms are not doing enough to regulate  influencers  on their platforms who are hired by companies to promote nicotine products  No law specifically prevents online tobacco or e cigarette marketing  but social media firms have policies limiting it  The health groups said in their letter that the use of online personalities creates a  loophole  in those policies and allows  rampant marketing  of tobacco and other nicotine products to youth   Instagram and its parent company  Facebook  are studying the issue  to understand how we can improve   said spokeswoman Stephanie Otway  The platforms currently ban brand advertising of tobacco products  Otway said  Their policies require any sponsored  influencer  posts that explicitly recommended buying tobacco products be restricted only to people over 18   But the same restriction would not apply to posts by paid influencers that depict tobacco products favorably without explicitly saying that people should buy them  Otway said  In making policy for a billion users  the company has to draw lines between advertising  promotional posts and  someone having an opinion   Otway said   Twitter spokeswoman Elizabeth Luke said the company prohibits  the promotion of tobacco products  accessories and brands worldwide  but declined to comment on whether that includes influencers paid to feature tobacco products on their accounts  A Reuters review of Twitter policies shows that its tobacco promotion ban does not include such marketing posts by individuals   Reuters identified several Twitter posts over the last two years from influencers who posted photographs with IQOS devices or linked back to Instagram accounts promoting the product  Twitter did not comment on the posts identified by Reuters   Snap Inc did not respond to requests for comment   The more than 100 organizations from 48 countries that signed the letter   which was sent to the companies Friday and publicly released Wednesday  included the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  the Japan Society for Tobacco Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics  Reuters earlier this month documented how Philip Morris had used young social media influencers  including a 21 year old woman in Russia  to promote its IQOS device  The company s internal marketing standards prohibit it from using youth oriented celebrities or  models who are or appear to be under the age of 25   Philip Morris said May 10 that it launched an internal investigation and suspended all  product related digital influencer actions globally  after Reuters sought the company s comment on examples of Instagram posts and photographs depicting young  hip women advertising IQOS  PHILIP MORRIS SUSPENDS MARKETING  THEN DEFENDS IT All of the posts referenced in the Reuters report remained online as of Tuesday evening  In addition  Reuters has identified new examples of Instagram content featuring young people with the IQOS posted in the days since Philip Morris said it had suspended its influencer campaigns  Several posts under the Instagram account  iqos egypt over the past week have featured young men and women  using the device at bars or cocktail events  Other posts from accounts using the IQOS name in Poland  Armenia  Italy and Iran over the last week also showed  trendy men and women using the devices  Other posts emerged over the last week from a photographer who documented an IQOS sponsored VIP lounge at an April music festival in Colombia  A representative for an IQOS store in Sarno  Italy  said employees found the recent photos of women using IQOS elsewhere online and reposted them on the store s Instagram account  A representative of an IQOS branded Instagram account in Armenia denied being paid by Philip Morris to promote the product  Other Instagram account owners promoting IQOS did not respond to requests for comment  None of the influencers mentioned in the May 10 Reuters report responded to requests for comment on whether they had been asked to stop posting or remove posts marketing Philip Morris products  Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the firm had  directed that there should be no new posts  by influencers  Sparrow did not respond to questions about whether the company had stopped paying influencers or attempted to remove existing posts  Sparrow said some of the new posts  seem to originate from third parties  not PMI  and in countries where we do not sell IQOS   noting Eqypt and Iran  Sparrow defended the suspended marketing campaign as a vital way to inform adult cigarette smokers about safer options  He blasted the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids for  trying to pressure us     to effectively block these channels  and  in effect perpetuating the consumption of tobacco in its most harmful form  combustible cigarettes   Caroline Renzulli  a spokeswoman for the anti tobacco campaign  called it  laughable  that Philip Morris used social media to market to adults  Philip Morris International has licensed  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc to market the IQOS device in the United States beginning this summer   Altria  which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States  has previously said it has a policy of not advertising on social media  However  an online job posting from the company in March seeks a  digital marketing specialist  for the  IQOS brand team   The ideal candidate will develop marketing strategy for  e commerce  owned websites  social media and influencers   Altria spokesman David Sutton said the company has no plans to use social media influencers to market IQOS but did not respond to questions about the job posting mentioning an influencer strategy  REGULATORY GRAY AREA The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  last month decided to allow U S  sales of the IQOS device after a two year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product  Digital advertising of tobacco products remains a gray area for regulators globally  Tobacco advertising regulations in the United States and elsewhere were written before the rise of social media marketing   The FDA  however  can exert authority over the digital marketing of new devices it clears for sale  As a condition of allowing Philip Morris to sell the IQOS device  the agency requires the company to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches with online marketing  Philip Morris  through Altria  is also required to submit information on any new U S  advertising campaigns to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them  A global treaty governing tobacco regulations  under the umbrella of the World Health Organization  urges countries worldwide to entirely ban tobacco advertising  A 2018 WHO report about tobacco promotion in entertainment and social media channels acknowledged the challenges of regulating it

Social media marketing has come under increased scrutiny as part of attempts by health regulators to control the marketing of tobacco products  particularly the newest generation of products including the wildly popular Juul e cigarettes 
Posts on social media on behalf of Solace Technologies LLC  Hype City Vapors LLC  Humble Juice Co LLC and Artist Liquids Laboratories LLC had content touting the flavored e liquid products by not including the required nicotine warning statement  the agency said 
 These letters are a reminder that companies who use social media influencers to promote their products must comply with all applicable advertising requirements   Andrew Smith  director of the FTC s Bureau of Consumer Protection  said

190209,411725,PM,Exclusive  India trade ministry says no legal basis to ban e cigarette imports   document,news,"By Aditya Kalra and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI  Reuters    India s trade ministry says it cannot impose a ban on electronic cigarette imports as there is no legal basis for doing so  an internal government memo viewed by Reuters shows  in a boost for those looking to tap into the country s growing vaping market 
This comes amid repeated calls for a ban from the country s health ministry  which urged states and government agencies last year in an  advisory  to step up efforts to halt sales and imports  warning vaping devices pose a  great health risk  
The country has 106 million adult smokers  second only to China  making it a lucrative market for firms such U S  based Juul Labs and Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  that plan to launch e smoking devices in the country 
India s Jubilant group  one of whose units has the franchisee for Domino s Pizza and Dunkin  Donuts outlets in the country  is already exploring importing Juul s vaping device  a company letter shows 
Halting imports of e cigarettes into India will be against multilateral commitments with the World Trade Organization  according to the internal government memo dated March 18 
The country must first prohibit local sales through federal regulations that  can stand the scrutiny of law   the memo adds 
Once that is done  the Directorate General of Foreign Trade  DGFT  can announce an  import ban   the memo said 
As of now  the health ministry s  advisory  cannot be a legal basis for a ban  the trade ministry  which has the power to impose import bans  said in the memo that is not yet public 
The DGFT did not respond to a request for comment 
A health ministry official said the ministry will work with the DGFT to explore how a ban can be imposed 
JUBILANT   JUUL
India s  12 billion cigarette market is dominated by companies such as ITC and Godfrey Phillips  both of which also sell e cigarettes 
Its vapor products market was valued at  15 6 million in 2017 and is seen growing nearly 60 percent annually in the next few years  Euromonitor International estimates 
Keen to tap into this growth  Juul has hired new executives in India and plans to launch its products in the country by late 2019  Reuters has previously reported 
But India s health ministry has called to block Juul s entry  saying its product was  harmful  and could undermine India s tobacco control efforts 
A Jubilant unit  however  said in a letter to the health ministry dated Jan  11  that it had identified Juul as a  highly safe  product which has  benefited millions of consumers  
Jubilant Offshore said in the letter it was in  advanced stages  of importing and selling e cigarettes in the country 
A Jubilant spokesman said  we believe there is demonstrable scientific evidence  that such products are a viable alternative to cigarettes and that the group is  exploring the category  
Juul said it was in the process of evaluating India by having conversations with stakeholders 
The benefits of e cigarettes  most of which vaporize a liquid containing nicotine  have been a topic for much debate in the global public health community 
Some say it helps shift smokers to less harmful products  but others argue it could create a new generation of addicts 
As of 2016  e cigarettes were banned in 30 of World Health Organization s 195 member states  In India  about a third of its 29 states currently ban e cigarette sales

190222,411738,PM,Exclusive  Philip Morris paid for India manufacturing despite ban on foreign investment   documents,news,"By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI  Reuters    Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  has for years paid manufacturing costs to its Indian partner to make its Marlboro cigarettes  circumventing a nine year old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry  internal company documents reviewed by Reuters showed  The Indian government in 2010 prohibited foreign direct investment  FDI  in cigarette manufacturing  saying the measure would enhance its efforts to curb smoking  Restricting foreign investment leaves cigarette manufacturing largely in the hands of domestic players  and is supposed to prevent any foreign funded expansion  A year after the government s decision  Japan Tobacco exited India  citing an  unsustainable business model   Philip Morris  though  stayed in India and used another route  according to company documents dated between May 2009 and January 2018  A year before the FDI ban  it struck an exclusive deal with India s Godfrey Phillips to locally manufacture the world famous Marlboro cigarettes   Ever since then  Godfrey has publicly acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India  while Philip Morris s majority owned local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand  But dozens of internal company documents   including invoice bills  legal agreements  e mails and accounting statements   show Philip Morris has for years indirectly paid costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India  Some former Indian enforcement officials said the practice of indirectly paying for manufacturing related costs violates regulatory rules  However  some lawyers such as Pratibha Jain  a partner at Nishith Desai Associates  disagreed  pointing out that the federal rules did not explicitly prohibit such payments  Philip Morris  director for corporate affairs in India  R  Venkatesh  in an e mail  said the company s  business arrangements with Godfrey Phillips India comply with Indian Foreign Direct Investment Rules   He did not elaborate   The company did not answer detailed questions for this article and did not offer any executive for interview  despite repeated requests from Reuters over the past month  MANUFACTURING CHARGES Six invoices issued by Godfrey showed billing of 45 5 million Indian rupees   644 200  to Philip Morris between December 2013 and January 2018 for manufacturing related charges  Philip Morris paid for items ranging from large cigarette making machines to costs of smaller equipment such as barcode scanners and printers deployed in Godfrey s factories   One invoice from January 2018 sent from Godfrey to Philip Morris showed the Indian company had spent 206 million rupees   3 million  on capital expenditure for Marlboro related manufacturing activities since 2009  though it was not clear how much of that was paid by Philip Morris   Godfrey Phillips  head of corporate affairs  Harmanjit Singh  said in an email that all the commercial arrangements  are in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the Indian Foreign Direct Investment and other applicable laws  and  incidentally  all transactions are in Indian Rupees  Also  it is our considered view that no illegality can be impugned to these commercial transactions between the parties   Philip Morris  local unit and Godfrey arranged a mechanism for such transfer of funds around the time they struck the 2009 deal  A 94 page  procurement agreement  signed between the two sides that year  which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters  said that Godfrey may acquire new machinery for solely manufacturing Marlboro cigarettes and will then  invoice PM  Philip Morris  India  for charges in a phased manner  Philip Morris  shall pay such invoice by bank transfer   the agreement said  The agreement specified Philip Morris would make periodic payments calculated according to the normal depreciation charge of the machinery  plus 10 percent per annum on its net book value  Other than those regular payments  Philip Morris also signed off on one time expenses and refurbishment costs incurred by Godfrey on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014  according to internal e mails and accounting records  It then accounted those transactions internally under a heading  Packaging   Research   accounting records showed   THEY ARE CAMOUFLAGING  Three former officials and one former head of India s main financial crime fighting agency  the Enforcement Directorate  reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India s foreign investment rules   One of the former officials said that paying for machines to manufacture cigarettes essentially resulted in the promotion of cigarettes  and the government s intent of banning foreign direct investment in 2010 was to deter that  Bhure Lal  a former head of India s Enforcement Directorate  said the companies  should be investigated     they are camouflaging    The current chief of India s Enforcement Directorate  Sanjay Kumar Mishra  did not respond to a request for comment  If the Enforcement Directorate investigates a company and finds it to be in violation of the rules  Indian law allows it to impose a penalty of up to three times the amount contravened  Jain of Nishith Desai Associates  which also advises global companies on foreign investment rules and reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters  said the company was able to circumvent the FDI prohibition in cigarette manufacturing by paying for the machines through invoices  That s because the Indian regulations only restrict direct foreign investments into a company and were silent on such indirect payments for machines  she said   The company can argue in its defense that it is only funding the equipment purchases and not investing directly in an Indian cigarette manufacturing company  and they would be technically correct   Jain told Reuters  INDIA CIGARETTE MARKET The Indian journey of Philip Morris  which is one of the world s largest international tobacco companies  began in the late 1960s when it acquired a majority stake in the London based parent of Godfrey Phillips  It gradually reduced its stake in Godfrey over the years  in part due to regulatory changes  and currently holds a 25 percent equity stake  Though India banned foreign investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010  it still allowed tobacco companies to invest through technology collaboration and licensing agreements  Investments could also be made by forming a trading company   Ahead of the 2010 ban  Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey  The New Delhi headquartered local unit  named IPM India Wholesale Trading Pvt  Ltd  is 50 1 percent owned by the global tobacco giant  with the rest owned by Godfrey and an investment firm  Among the payments outlined in the documents  Godfrey in January 2018 sent an invoice to Philip Morris s local unit for 10 2 million rupees   144 500   billing for charges for the preceding six month period  an invoice showed  In August 2017  Godfrey sent an invoice for manufacturing related charges of 9 5 million rupees   134 600   The documents also showed that Philip Morris at times would discuss with Godfrey which type of equipment should be used for Marlboro manufacturing  and then sign off on related payments   In July 2016  the head of Philip Morris s India supply chain operations  Nilay Mehta  asked a Godfrey Phillip executive in an e mail to raise a purchase order for an embossing roller  a type of equipment used in cigarette manufacturing  Given the equipment had to be used only for Marlboro manufacturing   IPM will be picking the cost for this   Mehta said in an email to a Godfrey executive on July 26  2016   Mehta did not respond to an e mail from Reuters   India has 106 million smokers  second only to China  and a young demographic makes it an attractive market for tobacco companies   
Philip Morris is a small player in India s estimated  12 billion cigarette market but has seen its market share rise steadily in recent years  That was aided by its marketing activities  such as advertising at roadside kiosks and free distribution of cigarettes at parties  Both tactics were described as illegal by health officials in a Reuters investigation published in 2017    ",2019-03-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-philip-morris-paid-for-india-manufacturing-despite-ban-on-foreign-investment--documents-1798960,1798960

NEW DELHI  Reuters    Indian cigarette manufacturer Godfrey Phillips on Monday said it was in compliance with the country s foreign direct investment  FDI  rules  following a Reuters article that alleged it circumvented the laws 
Philip Morris  NYSE PM  has for years paid manufacturing costs to Godfrey Phillips to make its Marlboro cigarettes  circumventing a nine year old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry  Reuters reported last week based on a review of dozens of internal company documents  which were dated between May 2009 and January 2018    
After the story was published  a senior official at India s main financial crime fighting agency said Philip Morris and Godfrey were being probed for alleged violation of the country s laws  The scope of the investigation  the source added  was much broader than the alleged law violations highlighted in the Reuters story 
On Monday  Godfrey told India s National Stock Exchange  the suggestion of alleged violation of the FDI laws of India is completely misconceived and misplaced  
Godfrey s stock rose as much as 10 percent from Friday s close 
India in 2010 prohibited FDI in cigarette manufacturing  saying this would enhance efforts to curb smoking 
Ahead of the ban  Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey  Since then  Godfrey has acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India  while Philip Morris s local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand 
Godfrey told the stock exchange on Monday it had entered into a commercial arrangement with Philip Morris  local unit to manufacture Marlboro cigarettes in May 2009  a year before the May 2010 FDI ban 
 The commercial arrangement referred to above is in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the FDI laws in India   the company said

190240,411756,PM,Altria to buy  12 8 billion minority stake in e cigarette company Juul,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Harry Brumpton and Liana B  Baker  Reuters    Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  will buy a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc for  12 8 billion  a marriage between an old line tobacco giant and a fast growing electronic cigarette rival looking to make inroads among smokers  The deal  announced on Thursday  values San Francisco based Juul at  38 billion  more than double the roughly  16 billion valuation it achieved in a July private funding round  highlighting what Altria sees as a growth path in the face of declining cigarette sales   We are taking significant action to prepare for a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose non combustible products over cigarettes   Altria Chief Executive Howard Willard said in a statement  The connection to Altria is expected to get Juul  which has risen swiftly over the last three years to become the U S  market leader in e cigarettes  more prominent distribution in convenience stores and other traditional retail channels  as well as such promotion as advertisements in traditional packs of cigarettes   Altria brings decades of lobbying expertise in Washington that could benefit Juul as the company navigates heightened federal scrutiny of its products  popularity among teenagers   Our success ultimately depends on our ability to get our product in the hands of adult smokers and out of the hands of youth   Juul Chief Executive Kevin Burns said in a statement Thursday  adding that Altria s expertise will aid in those efforts   Tying up with a tobacco company  however  carries reputational risks for the e cigarette startup  which has formed a company culture around  disrupting one of the world s largest and oldest industries   according to its recruiting materials  Under terms of the deal  Altria may not buy additional Juul shares or mount a takeover attempt for four years  Nor can Altria sell or transfer any Juul shares for six years or participate in the e vapor category except through Juul for that period  The deal  which is subject to antitrust clearance  would give Altria the right to nominate directors representing a third of Juul s board  the cigarette giant said   Juul s devices  which vaporize a nicotine laced liquid and resemble a USB flash drive  have grown from 13 6 percent of the market in early 2017 to more than 75 percent this month  according to a  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysis of Nielsen retail data  In its release Thursday  Altria said Juul represented approximately 30 percent of the U S  e cigarette space  when factoring in online sales and products in specialty stores such as vape shops  The vapor products market  which includes e cigarettes  is still just a small fraction of the size of the market for cigarettes  Vapor products was a  4 6 billion market in the United States last year  according to data firm Euromonitor International  compared with the nearly  94 billion cigarette market   Euromonitor projects the U S  vapor market will nearly triple in size to  11 7 billion by 2022  E cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community  offering an alternative to the nicotine in cigarettes without the same toxic and cancer causing chemicals  But there are concerns around creating new nicotine dependence  as teens are drawn to appealing candy and dessert flavor varieties  A study released by the National Academy of Sciences this year cited evidence that vaping among young people increases the risk of eventually smoking tobacco   Federal data released last month showed a 78 percent year on year increase in high school students who reported using e cigarettes in the last 30 days  coinciding with the rise in Juul s popularity  which equates to more than 3 million students  On a conference call with investors Thursday  Altria CEO Willard said he believes underage purchases are a  small contributor  to Juul s overall sales  The U S  Food and Drug Administration last month announced new curbs on sales of flavored e cigarette products  including Juul s mango and cool cucumber  amid concerns of widespread underage use  Juul has boosted its own lobbying spending  spending  890 000 so far in 2018  according to the Center for Responsive Politics  That is still far less than Altria s more than  7 million toward lobbying this year  making it the biggest spender in the U S  tobacco industry  MARKETPLACE REPUTATION One unknown is how the deal could affect Juul s reputation in the marketplace  In many ways the company positioned itself as the foe of big tobacco  saying in job postings that it was  driving innovation to eliminate cigarettes   Juul CEO Burns called Altria a  seemingly counterintuitive  investor but said the company is convinced the deal could  help accelerate our success switching adult smokers    Tobacco companies including Altria have been investing in e cigarettes as U S  smoking rates decline  but those products have lost significant market share over the last year as Juul s popularity has surged  Altria said this month it would discontinue some of its e cigarette brands  based on their financial performance and will take a related pre tax charge of  200 million in the fourth quarter  Federal data from earlier this month showed 14 percent of U S  adults smoked cigarettes  the lowest level ever recorded  Altria s cigarette volumes declined by 6 3 percent in the first nine months of 2018  from a year earlier  The company s share price has fallen by nearly 30 percent over the last year  Some analysts on Thursday expressed concern that Altria was paying too high of a price  A note from Stifel said the deal should help Altria  address the changing consumer attitudes toward nicotine  but that  the price paid offsets most of the future potential benefit  from a Juul investment  The Juul investment marks one of several bets Altria is making to position itself in a world with fewer cigarette smokers  It has an agreement with Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  to sell a heat not burn device called IQOS in the United States  where the product is still under review by the FDA  Earlier this month  Altria announced a  1 8 billion investment in Cronos Group Inc  which could give it up to 55 percent ownership of the Canadian cannabis producer   Altria on Thursday also announced a cost cutting program that includes workforce reductions and reduced third party spending  to save  500 million to  600 million annually by the end of 2019

190245,411761,PM,Philip Morris aims to revive Japan sales with cheaper heat not burn tobacco,news,"By Taiga Uranaka and Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO  Reuters    Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  released cheaper versions of its IQOS  heat not burn  products in Japan on Tuesday as it tries to revive sales and ward off competition from other alternatives to conventional cigarettes 
As regular e cigarettes with nicotine laced liquid are effectively banned in Japan  the country has become the main market for  heat not burn   HNB  products  which emit less smoke and smell less than conventional cigarettes 
Philip Morris  maker of Marlboro cigarettes  was first to start selling HNB products in Japan in 2014  But after an initial surge in sales last year  it has run into competition from  British American Tobacco   LON BATS  and Japan Tobacco Inc  and its market share has stopped growing in recent quarters 
The companies slashed prices of their heating devices earlier this year  as competition intensified 
 Clearly IQOS sales have slowed down  since their launch in Japan  Philip Morris CEO Andre Calantzopoulos told reporters on Tuesday 
But he said the increased competition was not necessarily a bad thing in the long run if the increased choice made the products more popular among consumers 
A new  HEETS  line priced at 470 yen   4 18  a pack would be available from Tuesday  he said  That is cheaper than Philip Morris s current HeatSticks  tobacco rolls used with IQOS devices  which are priced at 500 yen per pack 
 Clearly  for some people  spending 30 yen more  40 yen more per day is expensive   Calantzopoulos told Reuters in a separate interview 
In mid November  the company will also release newer versions of its  IQOS 3  and  IQOS 3 MULTI  devices  The existing versions will still be available at current prices 
Philip Morris  the world s largest publicly traded tobacco company  has seen weaker than expected growth in IQOS recently  after building a leading position in the global HNB market 
Japan accounts for about 85 percent of the  6 3 billion HNB market  according to Euromonitor 
Philip Morris says IQOS has a 15 5 percent share in Japan s overall tobacco market  including conventional cigarettes  but market share has stabilized 
 I think it s natural in any category that you have slowdowns   Calantzopoulos said   We have people who adopted earlier and people who are more conservative  
Philip Morris has also made a marketing application to the FDA for IQOS  which would allow the company to sell it with a claim of reduced risk 
Philip Morris was spun off from  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc nearly a decade ago  and Altria will commercialize IQOS in the United States 
Calantzopoulos said permission for commercialization would come hopefully before the end of the year and Altria was  ready to launch  
A Reuters report in December identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris

Key Insights

Adjusted Ebitda missed an average analyst estimate of 282 million euros   321 million  by 1 5 percent  New Chief Executive Officer Luis Camilleri is pushing for more limited edition sportscars that can top 1 million euros to boost profit margins in the next five years 
Currency headwinds  mainly from the dollar s depreciation versus the euro  resulted in a 19 million euro drag on third quarter profit  Ferrari sold 34 percent of its cars in the Americas during the third quarter 
Profit was also held back by strong demand for the  200 000 Portofino model  just as sales of the LaFerrari Aperta  which costs about ten times that amount  is nearing the end of a limited series run 
Ferrari earlier this year picked 499 of its most loyal customers for a chance to buy the 1 6 million euro Monza supercar  The focus on high priced models helped the manufacturer lift margins to 33 percent

Shares fell as much as 2 6 percent to 101 50 euros  before making up most of the price drop 
The stock has lost 15 percent since Camilleri  a veteran of Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM    replaced Marchionne as CEO  a few days before the Italian Canadian manager died in July

190249,411765,PM,Exclusive  Juul sounds out Indonesia for expansion  other Asian countries in its sights,news,"By Fanny Potkin and Chris Kirkham JAKARTA LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Juul Labs Inc is exploring selling its compact vaping devices in Asia and has sounded out government officials in Indonesia  one of the world s most smoker friendly countries  although gaining approval there could face significant hurdles  Expansion into Asia would provide the fast growing firm with new markets at a time when it faces increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Israel over the potential health risks of its products  high nicotine content  Juul representatives held discussions with the Indonesian government last month about introducing its vaping devices  the country s finance ministry officials told Reuters  Indonesia has one of the world s highest rates of smoking among adults and teenage boys and imposes no penalties for selling cigarettes to minors  It also has a population of 260 million  making it a highly attractive market for tobacco and vaping firms  A person familiar with Juul s plans said executives for the San Francisco based company are concerned authorities may be reluctant to grant approval due to likely opposition from the traditional tobacco industry  which provides much of Indonesia s tax revenue  Tobacco taxes accounted for nearly 150 trillion rupiah   10 2 billion  or about 11 percent of national tax revenue in 2017  government data showed  Each province also imposes taxes on cigarettes  Juul is also worried its argument that vaping is healthier than smoking will not hold much sway in Indonesia  which is not as concerned as other countries about health issues  said the person  declining to be identified as the discussions were not public  Juul representatives reached out to the finance ministry to discuss how it would be taxed on any sales of devices there  the Indonesian officials said  The government needs to examine the domestic e cigarette market to determine how a foreign player such as Juul could hurt local small and labour intensive e cigarette firms  said Sunaryo  a senior official in Indonesia s customs and excise office  who like many Indonesians uses only one name   We will need it to study it   he said  adding he wasn t sure Juul would comply with a regulation that requires e cigarette devices and liquids to be sold separately  Juul also would need approval from Indonesia s Food and Drug Agency  Officials at the agency said Juul had yet to be in touch  Other Asian countries the three year old firm is actively considering for expansion include India  South Korea and the Philippines  the person familiar with Juul s plans said  In addition to Indonesia  Juul filed trademark applications for those countries between April and October 2018  as well as in Malaysia and Singapore  according to a Reuters review of government filings  It opened its first Asia office in Singapore in July  So far Juul  currently valued at  16 billion  is available only in the United States  Canada  the UK and Israel  It has plans to enter Russia later this year  Juul said in a statement to Reuters it is  proactively learning more  and engaging with local officials in Asia  to understand and hear their views   It does not have immediate plans to launch in any Asian country  it said  Juul spokeswoman Victoria Davis declined to elaborate  A TAXING QUESTION Indonesia is one of only a handful of United Nations member states that has not signed on to the World Health Organization s global treaty that sets standards for tobacco control  Roughly two thirds of Indonesian men smoke tobacco daily  and more than 21 percent of boys aged 13 15 smoked cigarettes regularly  according to a WHO report last year  E cigarettes  available in Indonesia since at least 2013  are a small but growing market  The customs office estimated there are about 300 unsupervised liquid makers known as brewers in Indonesia  producing various liquid products to more than 4 000 vape stores and 900 000 smokers  Philip Morris International Inc  N PM   maker of Marlboro cigarettes  which now controls about a third of Indonesia s market through its stake in Sampoerna  does not offer any of its non combustible cigarette products in Indonesia  That includes its IQOS device  a heat not burn tobacco product  according to a company spokesman  who declined to comment on why it has not introduced the product  In October  the government imposed a 57 percent tax on electronic cigarette liquids  on par with taxes on traditional cigarettes  But tax collection  particularly from smaller companies  is difficult in Indonesia and new rules are often ignored  Juul now commands nearly 75 percent of U S  e cigarette market share  up from 13 6 percent in early 2017  according to a  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysis of Nielsen retail data   Its products  like most electronic cigarettes  vaporize a liquid containing nicotine  One Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a traditional pack of 20 cigarettes  according to the company s U S  marketing  Juul liquid in the U S  has a nicotine concentration of 59 milligrams per milliliter  much higher than the liquids typically sold in earlier versions of e cigarettes and nearly three times the allowable limit in the European Union  In August  Israel banned Juul devices with nicotine concentration of more than 20 mg mL  citing  a grave risk to public health   Juul is appealing that decision and currently offers a lower nicotine strength electronic cigarette in Israel  In September  the U S  Food and Drug Administration opened an investigation into Juul and other electronic cigarette companies  citing the rising number of teens who appear to be using Juul and other vaping devices  This week it is expected to issue a ban on fruit and candy flavoured e cigarettes sold in convenience stores and gas stations  In its statement to Reuters  Juul said its products are intended for adult use only  and that it aims to  improve the lives of the world s one billion adult smokers  by providing an alternative to cigarettes

190275,411791,PM,Ferrari bets on tobacco veteran in post Marchionne era,news,"By Agnieszka Flak and Martinne Geller MILAN LONDON  Reuters    Ferrari s  MI RACE  new boss Louis Camilleri has big shoes to fill but the tobacco industry veteran may have just what is needed to steer the luxury sportscar maker through its next lap  analysts and industry insiders said   Camilleri was appointed  Ferrari   NYSE RACE  chief executive on July 21  succeeding Sergio Marchionne who fell seriously ill and later died after suffering complications following surgery  The sudden change jolted investors who had expected Marchionne  who nearly tripled Ferrari s value since taking it public in 2015  to stay on as CEO and chairman until 2021   It also left Camilleri  63  to finish scripting a midterm strategy that is due only in September and is meant to show how the company known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines would shift towards making an SUV and electric cars  Those who followed Camilleri s career at tobacco group Altria and later at Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   PMI  said he has proven himself in an industry with a tough legal and regulatory environment   Like Marchionne  he s known for growing shareholder value via spin offs  he hived off Altria s stake in Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC  and later PMI to remove it from the U S  stub s litigation risks    He understands the consumer  branding and premiumization  He is a strong executor    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog said  But at Ferrari he has a tough act to follow   Marchionne had orchestrated Ferrari s spin off from parent  Fiat  Chrysler  MI FCHA   positioned it as a luxury icon rather than a car manufacturer and managed to do what few thought possible  sail through a self imposed cap of 7 000 vehicles per year without sacrificing its pricing power and exclusive appeal  When its share price hit a record high of 129 90 euros last month  the company that sold just under 8 400 vehicles last year was worth around 24 billion euros   28 billion   almost as much as Fiat Chrysler  which shipped 4 7 million cars   With profit margins of 30 percent  strong pricing power and a healthy customer waiting list of well over a year  Camilleri inherits a business that is firing on all cylinders  Ferrari has clocked up several years of record earnings  helped by a number of special edition models   But maintaining the high valuation will not be easy as emissions rules tighten  capital spending increases and the diverging interests of investors  racing fans  owners and collectors are increasingly more difficult to balance    For a graphic on  Ferrari share performance since Wall Street debut   click   Camilleri will face investors and analysts for the first time on Wednesday  when Ferrari reports second quarter earnings  But while Camilleri is not a car man  he is no stranger to Ferrari  as chairman and former CEO of PMI  a longtime Ferrari Formula One sponsor  he has been attending Grand Prix for years   Born in Egypt to a Maltese family  Camilleri has sat on the board of the Maranello  Italy based company since 2015 and is said to be a Ferrari collector himself  He was close to Marchionne  who in turn sat on the Philip Morris board   His familiarity with Marchionne s plans was one of the reasons behind his appointment to ensure continuity  a person familiar with the company said  But it is Camilleri s track record at PMI  where he has proven to be a pioneer in guiding the company towards reduced risk cigarette alternatives that make him a good choice to lead Ferrari into its next phase  analysts said    He was talking about risk free products long before we ever heard of IQOS   said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham  referring to PMI s electronic smoking gadget which heats tobacco instead of burning it   Ferrari said in February it would double core earnings to 2 billion euros by 2022 by pushing into hybrids  SUVs and new special editions and by expanding a customisation program  At the time of the IPO  Marchionne had promised to expand Ferrari into other luxury categories beyond cars  but the plan was put on ice to focus on vehicles first  It is yet to be seen whether Camilleri will resurrect that   One of Camilleri s toughest challenges will be alleviating fears that any push into new territories   like an SUV   would happen on Ferrari s terms without sacrificing its exclusivity   Marchionne had sought to calm fears by saying any utility vehicle with the prancing horse logo would be  Ferrari style  for  the selected few  and its claim to fame would not be  being able to climb rocks    Investors said they were confident Ferrari would continue powering ahead over the next 12 24 months because its fundamentals were strong  but it might be difficult to grow a stock that already rides on multiples higher than any other auto company and above many luxury goods makers    Like any jewel  Ferrari is extremely tricky to manage and that makes me nervous   said Michele Pedroni  a fund manager at Decalia Asset Management  
 With a push into SUVs  an electric car or a further volume expansion  the room for error is high     we need to see a strategy that ensures the exclusive appeal is not compromised  Even Marchionne would have found that challenging     Graphic by Danilo Masoni  Editing by Jane Merriman ",2018-07-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ferrari-bets-on-tobacco-veteran-in-postmarchionne-era-1551584,1551584

In seeking regulatory approval for a new smoking device called iQOS  Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  is claiming the electronic gadget is less likely to cause disease than traditional cigarettes  But the iQOS holds another  less obvious advantage over regular smokes  the ability to harvest personal data about users  smoking habits  The tobacco giant is already building a database of iQOS customers who register with the company  And it has developed a software application that could take things a step further  The initiative  if allowed by regulators  could extract information about a user s smoking routine from the device and use it for marketing purposes  said a former project manager at the company who tested the software in Japan  That data would include the number of puffs and average consumption per day  said Shiro Masaoka  who worked at Philip Morris in Japan from 2012 to 2016  Asked about Masaoka s comments  Philip Morris said the software in the device that controls temperature and duration of use  is not used for marketing purposes whatsoever   A Canadian firm that specializes in reverse engineering tech devices says the iQOS is equipped with two microcontroller chips  including one that  with modifications to the device  could support the storing of usage information that could then be transmitted back to Philip Morris  From the product description of the chips used  the data could include details like the number of puffs by a user and how many times a person smoked the device in a given day  according to Ottawa based TechInsights Inc  which examined the iQOS  innards for Reuters  The firm s inspection included the hardware and components  it did not test the functionality of the device s software  Reuters is publishing TechInsights  teardown report as part of a searchable repository  The Philip Morris Files  which includes internal company documents  Presented with the TechInsights findings  Philip Morris said in a statement   No data information from the device is linked to a specific consumer  only the device   A patent filed by a Philip Morris subsidiary in 2009 suggests how communication with the smoker would work  It describes an iQOS like device as having  an interface for establishing a communications link for uploading data to and downloading data from an Internet enabled host   Gregory Connolly  a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who has studied iQOS technology and patents  said Philip Morris  ability to gather user data could give the device remarkable power   What they re going to have is a mega database of how Americans smoke   he said   Then they ll be able to reprogram the current puffing delivery pattern of the iQOS to one that may be more reinforcing and with a higher addiction potential   Told about those comments  Philip Morris referred to remarks in January by its vice president for scientific and public communications  Moira Gilchrist   I can reassure that there s no technology in there that s intended to manipulate in any way what is delivered from iQOS   Gilchrist told a panel of scientific advisers for the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   The only time the company extracts data from the device  Philip Morris says  is when trying to figure out why there s been a malfunction   CAPTURE DATA  Gilchrist told the FDA panel that iQOS delivers roughly the same level of nicotine as a standard cigarette  Philip Morris says the device s nicotine delivery cannot be altered  Gilchrist did say  though  that the company is able to  capture data   such as the number of puffs taken on an iQOS  but doesn t do so unless it s necessary to examine a device that has a technical problem  The number of puffs by a user and smoking time per tobacco insert are automatically regulated by the device  she said  The company says that by heating tobacco instead of burning it  the iQOS significantly reduces a user s exposure to the levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in a regular cigarette  As a result  the company claims  the device  is likely to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases   The iQOS system uses cigarette like inserts containing tobacco  branded in some markets as HeatSticks  They slide into a pen size holder  equipped with a heating component called a  blade   The device comes with a USB cord  and has Bluetooth wireless communication availability in some markets  Philip Morris says iQOS is for smokers who would otherwise not quit  It is applying to the FDA for permission to market the device in America as being less harmful than cigarettes  The panel of advisers at the FDA hearing in January voted its approval of a finding that scientific studies show switching completely from cigarettes to iQOS significantly reduces a smoker s exposure to harmful chemicals  But it also found that Philip Morris had not demonstrated that the reduction is  reasonably likely  to result in a  measurable and substantial  reduction in disease and or death  A Reuters investigation published in December identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant s application to the FDA  Former Philip Morris employees and contractors described irregularities in those studies  Reuters did not find any evidence that the outcome of the experiments was manipulated or falsified  Philip Morris said in a statement to Reuters that  all studies were conducted by suitably qualified and trained Principal Investigators   researchers who oversee a clinical trial  PATENTS FILED In a letter in February  which mentioned Reuters  findings  a group of 10 U S  senators asked FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to  avoid rushing  the approval of products such as iQOS  without requiring strong evidence that any such product will reduce the risk of disease  result in a large number of smokers quitting  and not increase youth tobacco use   The company has filed a series of patents related to electronic smoking devices  One such patent published in 2016 describes a mouthpiece with a sensor to measure the amount of nicotine byproduct in a user s saliva and allows for remote adjustments to the device  Such changes would allow for the monitoring and controlling of the  maximum threshold  for the amount of nicotine that a user receives  according to the patent  In a statement in December  Philip Morris said that patent  is not used in any of our products and we have no plans for it in the foreseeable future   At the January meeting of the FDA advisory panel  Gilchrist was quizzed on how the company is using Bluetooth  which provides for greater connectivity with iQOS users  She replied that it is used to remind consumers  for instance  when they have to clean their device or re order HeatSticks so they didn t run out and have to revert to regular cigarettes   You know  for example  a message may come up   Hey  you haven t used your iQOS device today    Gilchrist said   Have you stopped smoking  or is it because you ve gone back to combustible cigarettes   In Japan  which has more permissive tobacco marketing laws than many countries  Philip Morris is collecting user information through registrations for the device  At a flagship boutique in Tokyo s fashionable Harajuku district  where the word iQOS stretches down the side of a glass encased building  customers were offered a discount on buying the device in exchange for signing up on the company s iQOS website  The company offered incentives on the website for people to register  including the iQOS discount  In doing so  potential customers were asked to enter a list of smoking preferences as well as the user ID for their Instagram social media account  Philip Morris said in a statement that it does so  to ensure that these consumers can follow the iQOS Instagram account  which is closed and limited to age verified consumers registered in the Philip Morris Japan iQOS consumer database   An internal Philip Morris handbook dated 2016 discussed approaches to social media  It gave examples of possible

190287,411803,PM,Fast growing e cigarette maker Juul to launch in UK,news,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON  Reuters    Silicon Valley e cigarette start up Juul Labs is bringing its small flash drive sized vaping device to the United Kingdom this week  aiming to reproduce its break neck U S  growth overseas 
Since launching in 2015 Juul has transformed the market in the United States  where it now accounts for nearly 70 percent of tracked e cigarette sales 
Juul says it targets adult smokers  but it has faced scrutiny over the popularity of its products with teenagers  In April the U S  Food and Drug Administration launched a crackdown on the sale of e cigarettes and tobacco products to minors  particularly those developed by Juul Labs 
A day after the FDA s announcement  Juul revealed several initiatives to address the issue  such as earmarking  30 million to support government initiatives to raise the minimum tobacco buying age 
Grant Winterton  Juul Labs  president for Europe  the Middle East and Africa  told Reuters that its activities in Britain would adhere from the start to its new  social and public policy   which calls for using only adults in its marketing and making sure its brand ambassadors are older than 28 
 It s true there are too many teens using our product  but they are far the minority   Winterton said 
Public health advocates are still debating whether e cigarettes represent a health risk or potential benefit 
The Juul device will be available in 250 vape shops across the UK by the end of this week  A starter pack  including the device and four nicotine pods  will cost about 29 99 pounds   39 66  
Winterton said Britain was Juul s third market after the United States and Israel  partly because it has the world s  most supportive government  when it comes to encouraging smokers to vape  Also on the radar are France  Germany and Italy 
The San Francisco based company recently raised  650 million in equity financing as part of an investment round aimed at raising  1 25 billion  a securities filing showed last week 
A source familiar with the matter said the round would be completed by the end of July and that it valued Juul at more than  15 billion 
Winterton and co founder James Monsees declined to comment on company valuation  revenue or growth 
Juul s main rivals are tobacco companies such as Altria  N MO   Philip Morris International  N PM  and  British American Tobacco   L BATS   who also sell e cigarettes 
Despite many meetings with big tobacco companies  Monsees said he was not interested at the moment in partnerships or a takeover  saying their missions were at odds 
If Juul ever believed that a partnership with one of those companies would help to eliminate cigarettes  then it would take it very seriously  he said 
Apart from increased scrutiny and competition  Juul also faces potential U S  tariffs on its electronic devices  which are made in China 
 We have a number of different options  but we re still looking at the implications of the tariffs so we can understand what strategy would be best for us   Monsees said 
The empty pods are made in China but more of their manufacturing process is moving to the United States  he added ",2018-07-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fastgrowing-ecigarette-maker-juul-to-launch-in-uk-1532137,1532137

190300,411816,PM,Exclusive  With Roman law doctrine  India moves to stub out tobacco industry rights,news,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI  Reuters    The Indian government is pushing the Supreme Court to apply a rarely used doctrine that would strip the  11 billion tobacco industry s legal right to trade  an effort aimed at deterring tobacco companies from challenging tough new regulations 
New Delhi has for the first time asked the top court to classify tobacco as  res extra commercium   a Latin phrase meaning  outside commerce   according to a Reuters review of previously unreported court filing by the Health Ministry on Jan  8 
If applied  the doctrine   which harkens back to Roman law   would have far reaching implications  in denying an industry s legal standing to trade  it gives authorities more leeway to impose restrictions 
For example  the Supreme Court s application of the doctrine to alcohol in the 1970s paved the way for at least two Indian states to ban it completely and allowed courts to take a stricter stance while regulating liquor   something constitutional law experts say could happen with tobacco if a similar ruling was made 
 The effects of tobacco are much more than even alcohol     It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco   said government lawyer R  Balasubramanian  who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation 
Balasubramanian  however  said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry s legal rights 
CURBS AND RESTRICTIONS
With an aim to curb tobacco consumption   which kills more than 900 000 people each year in India   the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes  started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings 
But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labeling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was  unreasonable  and violated its right to trade 
The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order  The top court will next hear the case on March 12 
In its filing  the government included  res extra commercium  because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again  said Balasubramanian 
Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco  the government argued it should have the power  to regulate business and to mitigate evils  to safeguard public health  the court filing showed 
Sajan Poovayya  a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  Inc s Indian partner  Godfrey Phillips  said the industry s legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco 
Poovayya said he would fight the government s argument  tooth and nail  and make a case that taking away the industry s right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living  The industry estimates 45 7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living 
 India is a tobacco growing country and there s a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector   Poovayya said 
 Tobacco is not destructive to health  If tobacco is  sugar is as well  
ITC and Godfrey Phillips  as well as India s health ministry  did not respond to requests for comment 
In a statement to Reuters  Philip Morris International said the company  is not a party to the lawsuit challenging India s warning labels  and that it complies with labeling rules in the country 
SET A PRECEDENT
India s tobacco labeling rules  which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack s surface be covered in health warnings  have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016 
That year  the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules 
The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill effects  A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets 
Mary Assunta  a long time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance  said she had never heard of a country applying the  res extra commercium  doctrine to tobacco  but hoped India would set a precedent 
 Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged  particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are   Assunta said 
The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished  said Pratibha Jain  a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law

190346,411862,PM,Exclusive  Philip Morris jolted by Indian proposal to ban foreign tobacco investment,news,"By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI  Reuters    Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  is fighting to keep a toehold in India s  11 billion tobacco market  as the government considers further tightening foreign investment rules in the sector  according to documents seen by Reuters  In previously unreported letters from Philip Morris to the trade minister and an influential government think tank  the U S  based company said the  discriminatory  and  protectionist  proposals would represent a blow to its plans to launch new products and make further investments in India  The two letters dated May and October last year followed local media reports of a possible change in government policy  While the warnings may be part of the firm s negotiations  they show the level of concern the proposals are causing   The proposed ban will impact our future investments in India and also force a review of our overall operations  including tobacco crop purchases   Martin G  King  Philip Morris  Asia president  wrote on Oct  13 to NITI Aayog  India s most influential government think tank that has a say in federal policies  including those related to foreign investments  India banned foreign investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010  but it still allowed tobacco companies to invest through technology collaboration and licensing agreements  Investments could also be made by forming a trading company  Over the past year  the government has been considering whether to stop these  in a bid to safeguard public health interests  according to the documents and a senior government official  The new proposal was being discussed by the health and trade ministries at least as early as April last year  according to a government memorandum dated June 3  Neither ministry responded to requests for comment  A Philip Morris spokesman said the company had  nothing further to add  when asked about the company s view on foreign investment  The final decision on the rules  based on recommendations from various ministries  will be taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s cabinet  BLOW TO PLANS Philip Morris entered India in the late 1960s by acquiring a majority stake in the London based parent of Godfrey Phillips India Ltd  It gradually reduced its stake in Godfrey over the years  in part due to regulatory changes  Ahead of the 2010 ban on investments into cigarette manufacturing  Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey and an investment firm  Under the current arrangement  Godfrey manufactures Marlboros while Philip Morris  trading firm helps promote them  That part of its operations would not necessarily be impacted by the foreign investment changes being considered  as such changes usually do not apply to previous arrangements  However  if the new rules were implemented  Philip Morris  future investment plans in India would be in jeopardy  as any form of new investment or collaboration would be outlawed  Those plans  the company says  include the possible launch of its heat not burn electronic cigarette called iQOS  an alternative product which Philip Morris sees as a key step towards a smokeless future that could also bring health benefits to India  Godfrey did not respond to a request for comment  India is a key market for Philip Morris  Even before the company contemplates introducing alternative products there  demand is strong for conventional cigarettes that still account for most of the company s  74 billion in global annual revenues  The number of male cigarette smokers  aged between 15 and 69 years  almost trebled in India to 40 million between 1998 and 2015  according to BMJ Global Health estimates  Another 48 million smoke traditional hand rolled cigarettes  called beedis  Marlboro faces stiff competition from premium brands of India s largest cigarette maker  ITC Ltd  which is part owned by  British American Tobacco   LON BATS   BAT  as well as several state run firms  Still  its market share has doubled between 2012 and 2015 to 1 percent  data from Euromonitor International show  LOBBYING DRIVE Outlining the firm s importance to India s economy  Philip Morris said in its letters that it spent  460 million on tobacco leaf over the previous five years and more than  200 000 on corporate charities each year  It says it has employed more than 90 people in its India unit  The company does not give country by country figures for revenues or market share  Philip Morris  King wrote to the trade minister in May  saying the reported proposals would  dent India s credibility as a reliable investment destination   He also said the move would unfairly favor the domestic industry   It is discriminatory in its application since it will provide undue leverage to the domestic industry at the expense of international products   King wrote  ITC  which has a market share of almost 80 percent  did not comment on the proposed new policy  King s letter was redirected by the trade ministry to the federal health ministry for further comment  The health ministry rejected the company s arguments  citing India s obligations under an international tobacco control treaty and domestic laws  The health ministry said allowing foreign tobacco money was against public health

190353,411869,PM,BAT offers to buy U S  tobacco firm Reynolds in  47 billion deal,news,"By Paul Sandle and Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters     British American Tobacco   L BATS  has offered to buy out U S  cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc  N RAI  in a  47 billion takeover that would create the world s biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport  Lucky Strike and Pall Mall  The cash and stock deal would mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated U S  market after a 12 year absence  making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets   It would also give the British company   which has been bolstered by a strong share price since the country voted to leave the European Union   more premium brands such as Camel  which it can sell in countries like Russia and Turkey where demand for Western cigarettes is still growing  The marriage would also unite each company s efforts in the fast developing world of e cigarettes  which the companies say are less dangerous than smoking   a habit that kills about six million people worldwide each year   A Reynolds takeover by BAT  which already owns 42 percent of the U S  group  has long been seen as part of an inevitable wave of global consolidation in a mature industry  Yet the timing  less than three weeks before a U S  presidential election  was unexpected   This proposed deal manages to be both entirely expected and a surprise   Euromonitor analyst Shane MacGuill said   The completion of last year s purchase by Reynolds of Lorillard and the current relative valuations of the two companies  shares were the main triggers  two sources close to the situation told Reuters   They referred to a gain in BAT s stock since Britons opted for Brexit in June and a fall for Reynolds  which brought their trading multiples closer together  However in dollar terms  BAT s share performance is less pronounced   This is simplifying the structure by taking out the majority stake BAT doesn t already own   one source said  adding   It s always been on the cards    After the Brexit vote  shares in BAT soared to all time highs as investors bet the falling pound would lift the value of overseas revenue for UK based companies like BAT  which do most of their business outside the country  The pound has lost about a fifth of its value against the dollar since the EU referendum on June 23  pushing up the cost of the cash element of overseas purchases by UK based firms  But between the referendum day and Thursday this week  when BAT decided to act  its shares had gained 12 percent  while Reynolds s stock was down 7 percent  This has increased the value of the share element of the offer  With little geographic overlap and therefore limited antitrust issues  this deal is also a lot simpler than another oft speculated deal   that BAT would take over British rival Imperial Brands  L IMB   the source added  Imperial shares were up 3 percent  with one analyst saying a general reignition of consolidation in the industry may be outweighing the fact that BAT is now unlikely to bid for its rival in the near term  CASH AND STOCK Reynolds  based in Winston Salem  North Carolina  acknowledged receipt of the unsolicited offer  which a different source said was decided on last night  It was made public immediately  as required by U S  securities regulators in cases where the buyer is a big shareholder   Reynolds said it would review the offer and respond in due course  The British group said its offer valued Reynolds s shares at  56 50  of which  24 13 would be in cash and  32 37 would be in BAT shares  representing a premium of 20 percent over the closing price of Reynolds stock on Thursday  The total price for the remaining 57 8 percent of Reynolds would be  47 billion  of which approximately  20 billion would be in cash and  27 billion in BAT shares  BAT said  BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante  a long distance runner who hails from Sao Paolo  Brazil  said the deal would create a U S  market leader and the world s largest listed tobacco company by net turnover and operating profit   The strategic rationale makes perfect sense   Guy Ellison  an analyst at Investec Wealth   Investment  said  He cited a BAT pivot toward the large U S  market  whose profit pool is protected by high barriers to entry  and improved scale in vapor products like e cigarettes  which all big tobacco companies are investing in to offset declines in smoking   BAT said the deal would add to earnings in the first year after closure and estimated cost savings of about  400 million  COMING TO AMERICA The stock s strength is also due to geopolitical uncertainty in recent months leading investors to seek out stable  dividend yielding stocks like tobacco and other consumer staples   Shares in Reynolds fell to a 12 month low on Wednesday of  43 38 after its third quarter earnings were 6 percent short of market forecasts  Jefferies analysts said  on the back of a 1 5 percent fall in domestic cigarette volumes   BAT shares  which reached a high of 51 35 pounds in July  were trading up 2 4 percent at 49 20 pounds at 1308 GMT  If successful  the takeover would be one of the biggest this year globally  BAT stopped operating in the United States in 2004  when it merged its U S  subsidiary Brown   Williamson with R J  Reynolds to form Reynolds American   Due to a series high profile U S  lawsuits against tobacco firms  the big four have all limited their exposure to the market  Marlboro maker Phillip Morris International  N PM   the world leader  was spun off from the U S  business Altria  N MO  in 2008  Yet several cases have now been settled  which has led analysts to speculate that international players could return  Imperial Brands waded into the U S  market last year with its  7 billion purchase of certain brands from Reynolds to ease the  25 billion purchase of Lorillard   Smoking rates in the United States and other western markets are declining due to increasing health consciousness  and greater regulation and taxes  Yet their addictive nature and high profit margins make them a profitable business  MacGuill said he expects the Reynolds deal to be followed in the coming years by the reunification of Philip Morris and Altria to create two huge players in global tobacco  BAT is being advised by Centerview   Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  and UBS  BAT also said on Friday it had performed well in the first nine months of the year  raising both revenue at constant rates of exchange and cigarette

While Philip Morris  diluted earnings per share fell slightly by 0 02 to 1 16 for the period  the New York based company beat estimates for the quarter by 0 15 a share  The company s preponderance of international smokers also tamped earnings  as unfavorable exchange rate losses stemming from a stronger dollar led to a 0 31 decrease in earnings per share  according to Philip Morris 
In total  Philip Morris posted a net income of  3 0 billion  down by 2 2  on a year over year basis  The inauspicious effects of foreign exchange rates abroad were responsible for creating  585 million less in net profit compared with the same period in 2014  Philip Morris calculated 
Although Philip Morris increased sales in Latin America and Canada by 14 2  for the quarter  it only reported a spike of 1 8  when currency fluctuations were factored  Philip Morris is looking to maximize sales in Mexico  after its total cigarette market increased by 4 7  during the quarter to 7 5 billion units  Philip Morris sales also rose by an adjusted total of 14  on a currency neutral basis in Eastern Europe  the Middle East and Africa  but were down 8 3  without the adjustment 
 Our strong first quarter results are an excellent start to the year   CEO Andr  Calantzopoulos said in a statement   Our organic volume and market share performance was better than we originally forecast  underpinned by the investments we made in 2014 and an improving operating environment this year  
 While currency volatility persists  we remain focused on managing our cash flow prudently and are steadfast in our aim to return around 100  of our free cash flow to our shareholders   he added 
Since its spin off from  Altria Group   NYSE MO  in 2008  Philip Morris said it has increased its regularly quarterly dividend by 117 4  from an initial annualized rate of  1 84 per common share 
Philip Morris is also counting on its newly acquired e Cigarette division to boost sales for the remainder of the year  Last July  the company acquired Nicocigs  the largest e Cigarette brand in the United Kingdom  Nicocigs is projected to earn  560 million in revenue in 2015  up from a projected total of  417 last year

190374,411890,PM,In twist  scientists join tobacco companies to fight cancer,news,By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON  Reuters    Scientists who have devoted years developing medicines to cure disease are now working for tobacco companies to make e cigarettes      Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  has hired more than 400 scientists and technical staff at its research facility in Neuchatel  Switzerland  including toxicologists  chemists  biologists  biostatisticians and regulatory affairs experts      Altria Group Inc  makers of Marlboro  has recruited dozens of scientific and healthcare experts  as have independent e cigarette companies such as NJOY  They bring experience developing inhalation devices and navigating the U S  Food and Drug Administration  valuable knowledge in the new world of electronic cigarettes        They say they re trying to improve public health       We were looking at drugs that make people very ill and maybe extend their life by 12 to 14 weeks   said Gizelle Baker  a PMI biostatistician based in Neuchatel who previously worked at the cancer drug developer Poniard Pharmaceuticals   If you have a product that prevents cancer in the first place you can have a much bigger impact on public health      The goal is to improve the current generation of e cigarettes and  where possible  provide evidence that they reduce the risk of disease  Companies that succeed could have an advantage in a market that Bonnie Herzog  an analyst at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities  sees surpassing combustible cigarettes in the U S  within the next decade      Products declared reduced risk by the FDA could be treated with a lighter regulatory hand           If tobacco companies can prove there is reduced risk  e cigs are likely to remain less regulated and taxed than cigarettes   said Philip Gorham  an analyst at Morningstar who views PMI as leading the way in the industry   If they can t  they will likely be subject to the same restrictions       SOPHISTICATED SCIENCE     PMI has poured more than  2 billion into developing and assessing reduced risk products  Next year it plans to apply for a modified risk claim with the FDA for its iQOS product  a tobacco stick that is heated just enough to produce an aerosol but doesn t combust  Burning tobacco produces most of its toxic chemicals  The company is betting the presence of real tobacco may make it more satisfying to smokers than existing e cigarettes  It is also developing next generation e cigarettes        But proving a product reduces risk requires sophisticated science  and the FDA wants to see health benefits for both individual smokers and the population as a whole      Manuel Peitsch  a professor of bioinformatics at the University of Basel and former senior official at Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc  helps lead a effort at PMI to analyze the constituents in vapor  assess their effect on cells and model how likely the products are to cause disease       The company is also conducting clinical trials in humans to assess whether the products reduce a person s exposure to harmful constituents and  if so  whether that reduction corresponds to a lower risk of developing lung cancer  heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder      Tobacco companies have not historically had these skills in house  But they are the life blood of the pharmaceutical industry and that is where tobacco companies are turning for talent       They have in essence been preparing for this for 20 years   said Dr  David Kessler  the former FDA commissioner who led the agency s investigation into the tobacco industry in the 1990s   They have understood for a long time that they are in the nicotine delivery business           RECRUITING STAFF     Tobacco executives say they have found willing recruits from the pharmaceutical industry  thanks in part to a wave of mergers and acquisitions that left many researchers looking for work  The 2008 financial crisis led to tens of thousands of job cuts and rattled even those who retained their positions      Not all companies have the resources to conduct the kind of clinical trials being run at PMI  but many are looking for medical device experts who can help make higher quality products       Chenyue Xing is a chemical engineer who worked for MAP Pharmaceuticals and cancer drug company Genentech  Two years ago she joined the San Francisco based vapor company Pax Labs Inc  where she mixes and tests potential liquid nicotine formulations      The work is similar to that at MAP  where she tested ingredients for use in the company s inhaled drug devices  But she likes the entrepreneurial atmosphere at Pax and the idea of creating a smoke free alternative to cigarettes       I grew up in China where there were far fewer smoke free areas   she said   I am very sensitive to smells and for a long time if people were smoking next to me  I shut off half of my breath        Dr  Joshua Rabinowitz  the interim chief executive of NJOY  said he too was drawn the public health potential of e cigarettes  Rabinowitz co founded Alexza Pharmaceuticals Inc  which makes an inhaler that allows drugs to be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream     Some sought after experts help companies comply with FDA regulations and steer new products through the approval process     Altria hired James Dillard to head its regulatory affairs division  Dillard holds a degree in biomedical engineering from Tulane University and spent 13 years at the FDA  eventually becoming director of its cardiovascular and respiratory devices group  PMI hired Bruce Clark in a similar role  as vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs  a position he previously held at drugmaker Apotex Inc        Some healthcare recruits are willing to develop reduced risk tobacco products but not for a company that also sells cigarettes       The whole set up is schizophrenic   said Dr  Lars Erik Rutqvist  an oncologist and former professor at Sweden s Karolinska Institute who has been approached by big tobacco companies before   I wouldn t want to be part of that because they still make most of their money from cigarettes        Rutqvist works instead for Swedish Match AB  which sells smokeless tobacco products known as snus  The company was the first to file a modified risk application with the FDA for its snus products  A panel of advisors to FDA recommended in April that the agency reject the application     PAST SINS    The tobacco industry has recruited healthcare experts before  but not on today s scale  Past veterans and many public health experts question the motives behind the current recruiting  They fear e cigarettes will do nothing to benefit smokers and may instead simply introduce a new generation to nicotine at a time traditional cigarette smoking rates are falling      With each new generation of products there s a temptation to believe they got it wrong before but they ve got it right now   said Matthew Myers  president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids      Victor DeNoble  an experimental psychologist specializing in the impact of drugs on the brain  joined Philip Morris in 1980 to create a cigarette that caused fewer heart attacks  a challenge he found exciting  But when his work showed that nicotine is addictive the company closed down his lab and suppressed the research  A decade later  DeNoble became the first whistleblower to testify against the industry before Congress      The tobacco industry now says  we made mistakes and we want to correct them  and that s why we want you to join us    he said   The lure is still public health  But I m older and wiser and I can t trust an industry that has repeatedly broken its promises

190382,411898,PM,WHO urges stiff regulatory curbs on e cigarettes,news,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA  Reuters    The World Health Organization  WHO  stepped up its war on  Big Tobacco  on Tuesday  calling for stiff regulation of electronic cigarettes as well as bans on indoor use  advertising and sales to minors 
In a long awaited report that will be debated by member states at a meeting in October in Moscow  the United Nations health agency also voiced concern at the concentration of the  3 billion market in the hands of transnational tobacco companies 
The WHO launched a public health campaign against tobacco a decade ago  clinching the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  Since entering into force in 2005  it has been ratified by 179 states but the United States has not joined it 
The treaty recommends price and tax measures to curb demand as well as bans on tobacco advertising and illict trade in tobacco products  Prior to Tuesday s report the WHO had indicated it would favour applying similar restrictions to all nicotine containing products including smokeless ones 
In the report  the WHO said there are 466 brands of e cigarettes and the industry represents  an evolving frontier filled with promise and threat for tobacco control  
It urged a range of regulatory options  including banning e cigarette makers from making health claims such as that they help people quit smoking  until they provide convincing supporting scientific evidence 
Smokers should use a combination of already approved treatments for kicking the habit  it said 
While evidence indicates that they are likely to be less toxic than conventional cigarettes  the use of e cigarettes poses a threat to adolescents and the fetuses of pregnant women using them  it said 
 NOT MERELY WATER VAPOUR 
E cigarettes also increase the exposure of bystanders and non smokers to nicotine and other toxicants  it said regarding Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems that it calls ENDS 
 In summary  existing evidence shows that ENDS aeorsol is not merely  water vapour  as is often claimed in the marketing for these products   the WHO said in the 13 page report 
E cigarettes should be regulated to  minimise content and emissions of toxicants   and those solutions with fruit  candy like and alcohol drinks flavours should be banned until proven they are not attractive to children and adolescents  it said 
Adolescents are increasingly experimenting with e cigarettes  with their use in this age group doubling between 2008 and 2012  it said 
Vending machines should be removed in almost all locations  it added 
Scientists are divided on the risks and potential benefits of e cigarettes  which are widely considered to be a lot less harmful than conventional cigarettes 
One group of researchers warned the WHO in May not to classify them as tobacco products  arguing that doing so would jeopardise an opportunity to slash disease and deaths caused by smoking 
Opposing experts argued a month later that the WHO should hold firm to its plan for strict regulations 
Major tobacco companies including Imperial Tobacco  L IMT   Altria Group  N MO   Philip Morris International  N PM  and British American Tobacco  L BATS  are increasingly launching their own e cigarette brands as sales of conventional products stall in Western markets 
A Wells Fargo analyst report in July projected that U S  sales of e cigarettes would outpace conventional ones by 2020 
Uptake of electronic cigarettes  which use battery powered cartridges to produce a nicotine laced inhalable vapour  has rocketed in the last two years and analysts estimate the industry had worldwide sales of some  3 billion in 2013 
But the devices are controversial  Because they are so new there is a lack of long term scientific evidence to support their safety and some fear they could be  gateway  products to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking 
The American Heart Association said in a report on Monday that it considered e cigarettes that contain nicotine to be tobacco products and therefore supports their regulation under existing laws on the use and marketing of tobacco products 
 Although the levels of toxic constituents in e cigarette aerosol are much lower than those in cigarette smoke  there is still some level of passive exposure   the AHA said

190383,411899,PM,Exclusive  American Red Cross pressured to rid itself of tobacco money ,news,"By Jilian Mincer  New York  Reuters    The American Red Cross risks damaging the reputation of the global Red Cross brand because of its refusal to stop accepting donations from tobacco companies  a top official with the humanitarian network said   These concerns are prompting the International Red Cross and public health organizations to press the U S  group to end its longtime policy of taking tobacco money  Reuters has learned   The International Red Cross  which recently rolled out a global disease prevention program with a strong anti smoking component  hasn t accepted tobacco donations since 2008  Most of the group s 189 national affiliates don t accept money either  but the powerful U S  member does  as do about half a dozen other countries  including Germany  Russia and Vietnam   While precise figures are not available  the American Red Cross and its U S  affiliates have received at least  12 million from tobacco companies such as Altria Group  Reynolds American and Philip Morris International since 2001  according to Red Cross tax records and tobacco company press releases and annual reports   An American Red Cross spokeswoman  Laura Howe  declined to comment on the dispute with its parent body   whose guidelines are not binding on its affiliates   but said it was happy to accept any funds that support its efforts to assist disaster victims  She also declined to say how much it received from each company   International Red Cross officials say that by accepting the donations  the U S  group risks damaging not only its own reputation but that of the entire global humanitarian network  Some public health advocates agree  saying there is a contradiction between the Red Cross s mandate to aid the vulnerable and its acceptance of money from an industry whose product may cause death   Matthias Schmale  under secretary general for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  said officials have talked with American Red Cross officials and asked them to drop the tobacco funding    We have been very clear about the potential reputational damage not just for them but for all of us   Schmale said in a telephone interview from Geneva   So far we have not taken the route of public condemnation  We want to respect that they are an important supporter of ours     He said the parent body would continue  to put pressure  on the American Red Cross to change its policy  although he would not say what form that pressure would take   Despite the controversy  there has been little public debate about the donations  And the dispute between the American Red Cross and its parent body has not been reported until now   How the dispute is resolved could be felt beyond the American Red Cross  Anti tobacco activists hope that if the U S  group bows to pressure  it could influence other nonprofits to reject millions of dollars in donations   John Stewart of Corporate Accountability International  a watchdog group  said if the American Red Cross stopped accepting tobacco money it would undercut the tobacco industry s global public relations strategy to gloss over its  tarnished image    PUBLIC RELATIONS BOOST   Critics argue that by accepting donations from tobacco interests  the organization  one of the largest charities in the United States with 2013 revenue of  3 4 billion  is muddying its public health mission while providing the tobacco industry with a public relations boost   Major U S  and European tobacco companies including Reynolds American  Altria and Lorillard as well as Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco  LONDON BATS  Plc acknowledged the donations and said they were among some of the millions of dollars they give away    When there are important disasters  and people have significant needs  that is the right thing for corporations to do   said Altria spokesman David Sylvia   Howe  the American Red Cross spokeswoman  said in an email that all donations  are important to the American Red Cross and the disaster victims they assist    Collectively  donations of all amounts allow us to provide disaster victims with food  shelter and emotional support     Asked about any pressure from the international body to stop taking money from tobacco interests  Howe said   As a matter of practice  we don t share the details of private conversations between Red Cross officials    GROUPS SEND LETTER   The International Red Cross has been encouraging its U S member to drop the funding since 2008  but it stepped up the pressure in 2014 after implementing a new healthy living program that includes smoking cessation   Pressure on the American Red Cross is coming on other fronts as well  On Dec  19  some of the largest U S  public health advocacy organizations  including the Public Health Law Center and Action on Smoking   Health  wrote to American Red Cross President Gail McGovern  urging the organization to stop taking tobacco donations    The Red Cross Red Crescent Movement is respected around the world for protecting life  health and human dignity   the letter said   To lend its enormous credibility  connection and influence to an industry that sells and promotes a product that kills 6 million people a year is a serious violation of the most basic principles of public health    The American Red Cross would not comment on the letter  which has not been made public before   WHY TAKE THE MONEY   The tobacco money represents a steady but small percentage of the American Red Cross s annual contributions   it took in more than  1 billion in donations in fiscal 2013   Tobacco companies have been donating to the American Red Cross in some instances as far back as the 1960s  but confirming the size and dates of donations made before 2001 is difficult because historical documents are not easily obtainable         The Red Cross may take the money from tobacco companies because like most nonprofits it is under pressure to raise money each year for its general fund whether or not there is a disaster that brings in donations  said Ken Berger  president and CEO of Charity Navigator  which rates charities for donors    One reality is no matter what size a nonprofit is  they are usually strapped for cash   he said   To have money that is unrestricted and could be used for general operations are the most precious  donations      Altria s Sylvia said it has donated to the organization for decades and now contributes  500 000 annually to the American Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program  It also has provided many one time donations after specific disasters   
Reynolds American  its foundation and subsidiaries have given more than  1 million to the American Red Cross during the last five years  according to the company  Philip Morris International has given  123 000 since 2008 ",2015-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-american-red-cross-pressured-to-rid-itself-of-tobacco-money-322485,322485
190385,411901,PM,Marlboro Maker Philip Morris Cuts Earnings Outlook ,news,"By    A stronger U S  dollar and the growing popularity of e cigarettes forced tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  to cut its earnings outlook for the full year on Thursday 
The company also said weak sales in Australia  which three years ago tightened advertising rules for cigarettes contributed to the revision 
The company now expects to report a  4 87 to  4 97 per diluted share profit  compared to a forecast of  5 09 to  5 19 a share that it provided the market on May 7  The company also will take a  495 million charge during the year to shut down its Dutch production operations

190393,411909,PM,Altria  MO  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Altria  MO  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 95 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 99   A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of Philip Morris  NYSE PM  USA  the nation s largest cigarette maker would post earnings of  1 14 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Altria  which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry  posted revenues of  4 80 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 94   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 79 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Altria shares have added about 0 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Altria 
While Altria has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Altria was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 99 on  4 50 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 41 on  20 29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Tobacco is currently in the top 45  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-mo-q4-earnings-top-estimates-200503030,200503030
190394,411910,PM,Philip Morris  PM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Philip Morris  PM  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  7 68 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 89  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris 
For Philip Morris  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Philip Morris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of  1 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering a surprise of  5 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Philip Morris appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/philip-morris-pm-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200503261,200503261

190407,411923,PM,Tobacco Industry Outlook Cushioned By RRP Strength   Pricing,opinion,The Zacks industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as other tobacco and nicotine based products such as cigars  snuffs  oral tobacco and e cigarettes  Some firms are also engaged in making vaping and tobacco heating devices  Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers  distributors  convenience stores  wholesalers and grocery chains Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Strict protocols issued by the FDA have been weighing on cigarette sales volumes  Health hazards stemming from the use of nicotine have led to regulatory whips on tobacco players  Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self critical advertisements  Such stringent regulatory barriers are likely to stub cigarette sales  Moreover  campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness  which has  in turn  resulted in lower smoking rates  Such trends are likely to continue build pressure on tobacco industry participants  revenues  To make up for the receding cigarette demand as well as high taxes  companies are increasingly resorting to price hikes  As smokers tend to absorb higher prices due to their addiction  this strategy is likely to support players in the tobacco space in the near term  E cigarettes and other vaping products are gaining immense popularity  courtesy of their low risk claims  In fact  consumers are increasingly taking to such products in a bid to quit cigarettes  Driven by the growing enthusiasm  tobacco companies are making substantial investments in the reduced risk products  RRPs  arena  In fact  RRPs are viewed as

190408,411924,PM,Here s What You Should Note Ahead Of Altria  MO  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   is slated to report fourth quarter 2019 results on Jan 30  This tobacco giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 5 3  in the last reported quarter  Further  its earnings have underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 6   on average  in the trailing four quarters The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been stable at  1 01 per share over the past 30 days  This suggests an increase of 6 3  from the year ago period s reported figure  The consensus mark for revenues stands at  4 897 million  indicating a rise of 2 3  from the figure reported in the year ago period The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings per share stands at  4 21  suggesting a rise of 5 5  from the year ago period s reported figure  The consensus mark for revenues stands at  19 9 billion Altria Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Stern Regulations Dent Cigarette VolumesAltria has been battling declining cigarette volumes for a while owing to stern government regulations and rising health consciousness  Notably  the tobacco industry has been facing many challenges as governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies  which in turn are lowering cigarette consumption  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  In fact  per court s orders  Altria along with other cigarette makers has been directed to put up self critical advertisements on television and newspapers to discourage smoking To add to the woes  the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels  Apart from these  the FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended by the agency to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah   Battered by such factors  Altria s total smokeable product shipment volumes declined 6 5  year over year in the third quarter of 2019  Further  reported domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 6 6  due to adverse trade inventory movements  the cigarette industry s rate of decline and retail share losses   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter smokeable product shipment volumes growth is pegged at a decline of 6 3   Further  the consensus mark for cigarette shipment volumes growth stands at a 6 4  drop  The consensus mark for total smokeable product revenues is  5 249 million compared with  5 302 million recorded in the same period last year Pricing   RRPs  Key DriversNevertheless  Altria has been responding to the changing market scenario by offering reduced risk products or RRPs  In this respect  the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Altria and Philip Morris   NYSE PM    pertaining to the sale of IQOS in the United States  has been approved by the FDA  Additionally  Altria  through its subsidiary Helix Innovations  acquired an 80  stake in certain companies of Burger Group  which is engaged in the commercialization of the oral tobacco derived nicotine  TDN  pouch product   on  Altria is also making efforts to expand in the cannabis industry  Backed by such upsides  revenues from the smokeless product category have been rising The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter smokeless product revenues is pegged at  601 million  up from  572 million reported in the year ago period Apart from this  Altria s strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry  even in the face of declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to a decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  In third quarter 2019  higher pricing aided performance of the smokeable and smokeless segments  In fact  higher pricing was a prime catalyst for top line and adjusted OCI growth in the quarter  Solid pricing and strength in RRPs bode well  In its last earnings call  management guided adjusted earnings per share of  4 19  4 27 for 2019  which suggests 5 7  year over year growth What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Altria this time around  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of an earnings beat  But that s not the case here Although

190424,411940,PM,Earnings Preview  Philip Morris  PM  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Philip Morris  PM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 35 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 3  
Revenues are expected to be  7 61 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris 
For Philip Morris  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Philip Morris will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 46  delivering a surprise of  9 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Philip Morris doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-philip-morris-pm-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200472287,200472287

Incorporated in 1987 and headquartered in New York City  Philip Morris International manufactures and sells cigarettes and other tobacco products outside the US in more than 180 countries 
The cigarette industry remains in decline  Philip Morris  year to date shipment volume for cigarettes is down 1 9   and it was off 2 8  for all of 2018  As cigarette sales continue to struggle  the tobacco giant has put its future into its heated tobacco product called IQOS 
The IQOS device uses sophisticated electronics that heat specially designed heated tobacco units  IQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release a flavorful nicotine containing tobacco vapor without burning the tobacco 
Tobacco in cigarettes burns at around 1112 degrees Fahrenheit whereas the IQOS device heats the tobacco to about 662 degrees Fahrenheit without combustion  fire  ash  or smoke  Since the tobacco is heated instead of burned  the levels of harmful chemicals users are exposed to are significantly less than those in cigarettes  Philip Morris has seen their heated tobacco unit shipments climb 29 2  in the first six months of 2019 
Company Outlook 
After talks between Philip Morris and Altria   NYSE MO   about a potential merger fell through  the company s Q3 report takes on more importance as investors gauge where the company may be headed 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast the tobacco firm to see a 6 16  decline in earnings to  1 35 per share and for sales to jump 1 41  to  7 61 billion  Geographically  revenue in Eastern Europe EEMA and East Asia   Australia is expected to lead the pack with respective Y Y hikes of 24 3  and 78 1  
The European Union is expected to rise 13 2  while sales in the South and Southeast Asia region pop 12 3   Total cigarette shipment volume is projected to drop 5 2  in the third quarter  Looking ahead to the company s full fiscal 2019 figures  estimates anticipate a bottom line hike of 2  to  5 20 per share on the back of a slight 0 91  sales jump to  29 89 billion 
Philip Morris continues to bet on the steady emergence of the electronic cigarette market with the marketing of its IQOS product  The company believes that the industry will be moving towards the smokeless tobacco trend and that its IQOS product is in the best position to seize control of the emerging market 
Philip Morris  IQOS product has a distinct advantage over other smokeless products in the industry  IQOS is FDA approved  which puts it ahead of the game as manufacturers scramble for the approval before next year when it will be mandated  Altria began marketing the IQOS under its Marlboro brand in the Atlanta area  and will use the results from the trial run to see how to best introduce the product to the rest of the US 
Bottom Line 
The lead it has over e cigarette competitors gives Philip Morris the opportunity to snag market share while other manufacturers are busy meeting regulations  However  investors are worried that the general public will clump IQOS with the rest of e cigs as public and regulatory scrutiny rains down on the industry 
Investors should keep tabs on the ongoing investigation into the health effects of e cigs  In the meantime  PM stock boasts a hefty 6 0  dividend yield that can provide reassuring payouts while the company figures out how best to incorporate its product in the US  which represents the world s largest e cig market  PM sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

190426,411942,PM,Philip Morris  PM  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Philip Morris  PM  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 35 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 44 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 93   A quarter ago  it was expected that this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 46  delivering a surprise of 9 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Philip Morris  which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry  posted revenues of  7 64 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 42   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 50 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Philip Morris shares have added about 18 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 3  
What s Next for Philip Morris 
While Philip Morris has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Philip Morris was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 30 on  7 73 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 20 on  29 85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Tobacco is currently in the bottom 28  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/philip-morris-pm-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200474475,200474475
190427,411943,PM,Altria  MO  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Altria  MO  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Philip Morris  NYSE PM  USA  the nation s largest cigarette maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 28 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Altria 
For Altria  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Altria will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Altria would post earnings of  1 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 10  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Altria appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-mo-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200477626,200477626

190447,411963,PM,Altria s Dividend Yield Is Approaching A Hefty 8   Time To Buy ,opinion,"With the U S  Federal Reserve skewing more dovish and the risks to economic growth still elevated  2019 is proving to be a year when investing in quality dividend stocks isn t a bad idea 
In general  dividend stocks rallied strongly in 2019  on signs that the Fed s next moves will lower borrowing costs  After delivering a quarter percentage point cut in July  the Fed is widely expected to slash rates again at the upcoming Sept  17 18 meeting 
The central bank s path to lower interest rates means bond yields  which compete directly with dividend paying stocks  won t be offering attractive returns as yields continue to sink  As such  any short term capital risk inherent in buying high quality equities that also pay a dividend is offset by the logic of betting on dividend payers that have a history of producing solid income   Altria Group   NYSE MO  is a high yielding dividend stock that  we believe  is offering particular value in this falling rate environment 
Attractive Yield  Tough Operating Environment
Altria s rich 7 68  dividend yield is unquestionably attractive  The parent company of Philip Morris USA  which owns such high profile brands as Marlboro  Skoal and Nat Sherman  cigarette maker Altria has lost a quarter of its value over the past 12 months as new government regulations and declining adult consumption of traditional tobacco products damaged the company s growth potential 
With that downward move  however  the company s dividend yield has become extremely appealing  At 7 68   its annual yield is much higher than the company s five year growth average of 4 21  





The bearish spell that pressured Altria shares over the past two years  seems to have run its course after news of a potential merger between Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   which sells Marlboro cigarettes in overseas markets  with Altria was released 
Both companies  which last week confirmed the merger talks  will benefit if the unification materializes  more than 10 years after the tobacco giants split their operations  The biggest advantage that analysts see will come from the unification of the most popular smoking alternative products that both companies have invested in heavily 

Philip Morris has been spending huge sums promoting IQOS  a heat not burn product used by millions outside the U S  Altria  on the other hand  has invested  12 8 billion in e cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc  in December  to acquire a major stake in the company which has  in just a short time  captured the biggest share of alternatives to smoking market in the U S 

Those who favor the deal argue that products stand to benefit from global integration and distribution  As Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a recent note  this move  would make a lot of sense  especially now given Altria s stake in Juul and IQOS coming to market shortly in the U S   He added that the combined company would have a  stronger and more predictable stable cash flow profile  

Besides the obvious benefit of this potential merger  Altria is also active in the fast growing cannabis industry  In last December  Altria paid  1 8 billion for a 45  stake in Canadian cannabis company   Cronos  Group  NASDAQ CRON   one of the nation s largest marijuana producers  with a footprint in many countries and increasing production capabilities 

With its existing 10  stake in Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   the largest beer producer in the world  along with its sizeable positions in both Juul and Cronos  Altria is a good long term bet  especially when its dividend yield is at a multiyear high 

Over the past decade  Altria has consistently delivered high single digit percentage hikes to its quarterly payout  The company now pays an  0 84 a share dividend every three months  a sum that has grown every year over the past 49 years 
Bottom Line

High yielding stocks  such as Altria  certainly carry added risks  The tobacco company is facing a more stringent regulatory environment in the U S   at a time when its tobacco sales are on a perpetual downslide 

That being said  the company is aggressively diversifying its revenue base to meet that challenge  The recent merger initiative with Phillip Morris International will add additional strength to its business  In our view  the timing is right for investors to buy Altria  shares  if they re interested in adding value to their portfolios ",2019-09-05,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altrias-dividend-yield-is-approaching-a-hefty-8-time-to-buy-200461714,200461714

190449,411965,PM,Trump May Ban Flavored E Cigarettes  Who Wins  Who Loses,opinion,Teenagers have been using flavored e cigarettes as a trendy alternative to the paper rolls  But  President Trump and his administration  on Sep 11  threatened to ban flavored e cigarettes citing health hazards This alternative vaping industry has skyrocketed in the last few years and created a huge teenage fan base thanks to sweet and fruity flavors  But with recent reports on lung illness from chemicals used in vaping  officials have decided to remove the fuming sticks  Now  is this good news for the traditional cigarette makers  Let s have a look  Threat to Ban Non Tobacco Flavored E CigarettesThe Food and Drug Administration  FDA  along with public health officials and U S  Health and Human Services is investigating more than 450 cases of pulmonary illness potentially caused by vaping products  In fact  to date  there are six cases of death associated with illness caused by vaping Public officials have reported that sweet and fruity flavors attract teenagers  Juul one of the U S  market leaders in vaping products offers mint  mango and other fruity flavors that account for more than 80  of its total sales Though doctors are still not sure if flavored vaping is the cause of recent lung illnesses  they are sure that  some sort of chemical exposure related to vaping or e cigarette use may be causing inflammation or injury in the lungs   per a Wall Street Journal report  In fact all the 450 cases and six deaths are related to use of ingredients like tetrahydrocannabinol  the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana and flavors Public officials are also running enquiry if the standard e cigarettes are being tampered and have warned users not to tamper the device or buy products off the street  Meanwhile  the FDA is finalizing instructions to remove all non tobacco flavors of e cigarettes within 30 days  Companies can reintroduce the products in the market after they receive approval from the FDA The flavored e cigarettes industry has been skyrocketing in recent months  with flavors like mango and cr me that attract the younger lot  As per the annual survey of teens by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  more than a quarter of high school students have used e cigarettes within the past 30 days  These teens also mentioned that they vaped fruit and menthol or mint flavors Tobacco giant  Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   has purchased a 35  stake for  12 5 million in Juul Labs  But Trump s threat has pushed its stock down by 1   As of last year  Juul s marketing was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for misguiding young people to buy vaping products  On Sep 9  the FDA issued a warning letter to Juul stating that it has broken law by promoting its vaping products as less harmful than traditional tobacco products Similarly  Turning Point Brands   NYSE TPB   that owns rolling paper maker Zig Zag and holds a few vaping companies in its portfolio  saw its shares decline 6 5  on Sep 11  While tobacco makers like Philip Morris International   NYSE PM   and British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   were not much affected  they are definitely in a tight spot as the FDA keeps removing flavored vaping products Is Traditional Tobacco Still the Winner In 2014  the Royal College of Physicians after a study stated that  e cigarette aerosol contains far fewer carcinogens than tobacco smoke  and concluded that e cigarettes  impart a lower potential disease burden  than traditional cigarettes  This had not only boosted the vaping industry but also dampened the traditional cigarettes as prolonged tobacco smoking could lead to lung cancer  breast cancer  emphysema and heart disease  But now with vaping products being held responsible for causing lung illness it seems that they are no good compared to traditional sticks During 2015 2017  nearly 2 035 e cigarettes have exploded or caused burns in the United States alone  The lithium ion battery in the device at times overheats and explodes  States like California  Massachusetts and New York are planning to ban e cigarettes  while Michigan and San Francisco have already barred sale of vaping products   It may be good news for the traditional tobacco makers and related industry as people will be switching back to paper rolls  Shares of Schweitzer Mauduit International  Inc    NYSE SWM    Vector Group Ltd    NYSE VGR   and 22nd Century Group  Inc    NYSE XXII   rose 2 5   3 7  and 4 7   respectively  on Sep 11 Vector Group  currently  carries a Zacks

  Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  rose 5  on Wednesday  after it announced that merger talks with  Altria Group   NYSE MO  had ended  
  However  our view is that the stock will fail  as the current market cycle matures   
Philip Morris  PM  Stock Weekly Chart 
Philip Morris announced that its talks with Altria had ended  as the two firms could not come to an agreement on how to merge into one company  Interestingly  Altria spun off Philip Morris a decade ago with the understanding that the latter would focus on international markets  
However  the latest innovation in the cigarette industry is vaping and Altria has a stake in the most important provider  Juul  The companies had hoped that PM could add value through an improved international focus  
In any case  our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis shows a negative pattern  with PM having previously broken its cycle low  It is now trading just below our resistance zone between  77 80  Yet as the current cycle matures  we expect sharp selling through year end

190456,411972,PM,What To Expect From Altria Earnings As MO Stock Continues To Struggle ,opinion,"Altria Group   NYSE MO   stock is up just 1 5  so far in 2019 to lag behind the tobacco market s nearly 16  climb  Let s see if we should expect this underperformance to continue following the release of Altria s earnings report before the market opens on Tuesday  July 30  or might MO shares get a boost 
Overview
Altria is one of the largest tobacco products manufacturers in the world  with many divisions and offerings for a wide range of consumers  Altria operates in a number of different market segments under different brands  these include Philip Moris U S   Copenhagen  Skoal  and John Middleton  Altria also owns a small wine business called Chateau Ste  Michelle Wine Estates  which it received as part of an acquisition  The tobacco market is currently worth about  130 billion a year 
Altria has been on a shopping spree the past year  with two equity investments and an acquisition  First  Altria announced in December 2018 that it would invest  1 8 billion in Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON    a Canadian cannabis company with plans to expand to the U S  once cannabis is legalized  Altria clearly wants to jump into the marijuana market as cigarette sales slow  However  it is not likely that this investment will pay off big in the near term as the U S  is still at least a few years from nationally legal cannabis sales 
Soon after  Altria made a  12 8 billion investment in JUUL Labs for a 35  stake in the company  This may seem counter intuitive  as JUUL is one of the largest threats to traditional tobacco sales  Yet  JUUL sees this partnership as a way to accelerate the company s ability to convert adult cigarette smokers to e cigarette users  Meanwhile  Altria sees this as a way to hedge against declining cigarette sales 
In June  Altria also paid  372 million for 80  ownership of Swiss tobacco company Burger Sohne  As part of the deal  Altria will distribute Burger Sohne s oral nicotine pouch line called  on   Burger Sohne s product is another attempt to diversify as cigarette sales fall  since nicotine pouch sales climbed 250  in 2018 to  60 million 
Industry Worries
The cigarette industry has been declining more quickly in the past few years  making tobacco companies like Altria very nervous  This is why many have companies have started branching out into new product areas 
Philip Moris U S  sells Marlboro  the most popular cigarette brand in the world  which is part of the reason it maintains massive market share in the U S  The company currently holds around 50  of the U S  cigarettes market  However  Philip Moris held 50 9  of the market in Q2 2017 and just 50 2  by Q2 2018 
The broader cigarette market has been on the   In October of 2017  cigarette sales volume dropped 3  year over year  while in March 2019 sales volume dropped more than 8  year over year  This makes companies like Altria increasingly worried that their cigarette runways are quickly running out 
Outlook
Altria s diversification has help prevent its revenue estimates for the current quarter from dropping despite slowing cigarette sales  In fact  our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for revenue to grow by 3 45  over Q2 last year  Estimated revenue growth for the fiscal year is low  at just 0 37  growth  but this number compared to U S  tobacco sales decline is promising 
Earnings numbers are more attractive  especially compared to the industry  This quarter  estimates show 8 91  earnings growth  while next quarter s estimates call for a 6 48  increase over Q3 2018 
Fiscal 2019 shows earnings estimates of  4 18 per share  constituting 4 76  growth  Next year is even more promising as analysts expect some of Altria s investments to start turning more profit  and therefore call for 7 21  growth above our current year projection  
Altria is also currently undervalued compared to the industry  which contains players such as Philip Morris International   NYSE PM    British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI    and Imperial Brands   OTC IMBBY    Yet  since Altria s earnings are expected to grow faster than the industry in the coming quarters  MO stock could start to trade at a premium against the Tobacco Market average  As you can see below  whenever Altria s forward P E drops below that of the tobacco industry  it comes back up within a quarter 
 
Bottom Line
Altria looks set to continue growing despite shrinking demand for its main product  Recent investments have made it likely that Altria will be able to diversify into new  growth heavy markets and use its experience to help its partners come out on top 
Altria currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   as earnings estimates have remained steady for the past 90 days  The firm has been a giant player in one of the original American industries since the 1985  so don t expect it to go down without a fight  However  investors should look for surprises in the earnings report out Tuesday before the market opens  due to new investments possibly turning larger than expected profits

190470,411986,PM,Altria  MO  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Altria  MO  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Philip Morris  NYSE PM  USA  the nation s largest cigarette maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 10 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 05 billion  up 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 43  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Altria 
For Altria  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Altria will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Altria would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Altria appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-mo-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200443173,200443173

190479,411995,PM,Philip Morris  PM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"The market expects Philip Morris  PM  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  7 35 billion  down 4 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris 
For Philip Morris  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 38  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Philip Morris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  10 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Philip Morris appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/philip-morris-pm-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200438974,200438974

Nielsen released data Tuesday showing the worst falloff in four years in terms of cigarette sales and volume  Sales fell 6 9  and cigarette volume  the number of packs of cigarettes sold  slipped 11 2  
New Lawsuits
This report came a week after Brazil s attorney general s office sued both British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International  who shares the Marlboro brand and works closely with Altria  The lawsuit seeks compensation for the costs of treating patients with 26 diseases related to tobacco and cigarette smoke exposure  The results of this lawsuit could have severe implications as a verdict against the companies could be the start of lawsuits from many countries across the globe 
 
 
Shrinking Markets
To add to the problems for big tobacco companies  smoking worldwide is decreasing as many people realize the health hazards  Meanwhile  e cigarettes have taken over as a less hazardous alternative  Altria has capitalized on the growing e cig market by taking a 35  stake in Juul Labs for roughly  13 billion  Juul currently makes up over 70  of the US e cig market  which makes it difficult for any of the traditional cigarette companies to capture a large share of this newly coveted market   
Although these companies are primarily kept alive by traditional cigarette sales  they have tried to establish e cig revenue streams  British American Tobacco has the second largest US market share with their e cig brand Vuse  The firm may have the second largest market share  but this share is not very big and may continue to shrink as Juul dominates the market 
Philip Morris International has found some success in cigarette alternatives as its tobacco heating product  IQOS  has taken over the Japanese market  This device heats tobacco rather than burning it  making it theoretically less harmful than traditional smoking 
Philip Morris International has started to bring the product to other Asian and European countries  The FDA has also approved the product to be sold in the US  It will be sold by Altria as Philip Morris USA is a subsidiary of Altria  Altria and Philip Morris International await approval by the FDA to sell the product with a  Modified Risk  label which would significantly boost its appeal to consumers 
Outlook
Historically  big tobacco companies have been a pretty safe investment and have provided a solid ROI  That may not be the case for much longer as cigarette use worldwide is decreasing and many countries are adopting stricter policies for both smokers and tobacco companies  The outcome of the Brazil lawsuit will provide a lot of information as to the future of tobacco companies as a verdict against them could be devastating 
Big tobacco companies are losing many of their customers to e cig companies and many would be customers now take up e cigs instead of cigarettes  The shrinking market  increased pressure from governments  and a potentially litigious future may make big tobacco companies a risky part of a portfolio  And with cigarette alternatives slowly becoming their main source of revenue there is skepticism about these tobacco firms  futures 
Altria seems to be the company best set up to succeed of the three as its investment in Juul and relationship with Philip Morris means it has two different stakes in the cigarette alternative market

190497,412013,PM,Big Tobacco Takes A Big Hit  MO   PM   BTI ,opinion,"Since Friday  Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO    Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM    and British American Tobacco  LON BATS  PLC   NYSE BTI   have all fallen 5 1   5 9   and 5 7  respectively as of market close on Wednesday  May 29  And all three firms opened with little change on Thursday 
Nielsen released data Tuesday showing the worst falloff in four years in terms of cigarette sales and volume  Sales fell 6 9  and cigarette volume  the number of packs of cigarettes sold  slipped 11 2  
New Lawsuits
This report came a week after Brazil s attorney general s office sued both British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International  who shares the Marlboro brand and works closely with Altria  The lawsuit seeks compensation for the costs of treating patients with 26 diseases related to tobacco and cigarette smoke exposure  The results of this lawsuit could have severe implications as a verdict against the companies could be the start of lawsuits from many countries across the globe 
 
 
Shrinking Markets
To add to the problems for big tobacco companies  smoking worldwide is decreasing as many people realize the health hazards  Meanwhile  e cigarettes have taken over as a less hazardous alternative  Altria has capitalized on the growing e cig market by taking a 35  stake in Juul Labs for roughly  13 billion  Juul currently makes up over 70  of the US e cig market  which makes it difficult for any of the traditional cigarette companies to capture a large share of this newly coveted market   
Although these companies are primarily kept alive by traditional cigarette sales  they have tried to establish e cig revenue streams  British American Tobacco has the second largest US market share with their e cig brand Vuse  The firm may have the second largest market share  but this share is not very big and may continue to shrink as Juul dominates the market 
Philip Morris International has found some success in cigarette alternatives as its tobacco heating product  IQOS  has taken over the Japanese market  This device heats tobacco rather than burning it  making it theoretically less harmful than traditional smoking 
Philip Morris International has started to bring the product to other Asian and European countries as it awaits approval by the FDA to be sold in the US  If the FDA were to approve the IQOS  it would be sold by Altria under its Marlboro brand  There is also the possibility of the FDA approving the device to be sold with a  reduced risk  label  which would most likely help its success in the US 
Outlook
Historically  big tobacco companies have been a pretty safe investment and have provided a solid ROI  That may not be the case for much longer as cigarette use worldwide is decreasing and many countries are adopting stricter policies for both smokers and tobacco companies  The outcome of the Brazil lawsuit will provide a lot of information as to the future of tobacco companies as a verdict against them could be devastating 
Big tobacco companies are losing many of their customers to e cig companies and many would be customers now take up e cigs instead of cigarettes  The shrinking market  increased pressure from governments  and a potentially litigious future may make big tobacco companies a risky part of a portfolio  And with cigarette alternatives slowly becoming their main source of revenue there is skepticism about these tobacco firms  futures 
Altria seems to be the company best set up to succeed of the three as its investment in Juul and relationship with Philip Morris means it has two different stakes in the cigarette alternative market

190504,412020,PM,Can Altria  MO  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Altria  MO   which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry 
This owner of Philip Morris  NYSE PM  USA  the nation s largest cigarette maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1  
For the last reported quarter  Altria came out with earnings of  0 95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  representing a surprise of 1 06   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 08 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 93  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Altria lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Altria currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 09   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-altria-mo-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200405598,200405598

190509,412025,PM,6 Bizarre Dividend Plays Yielding Up To 16 7 ,opinion,"Almost every corner of the market is overpriced today  That includes dividend stocks  which cost too much and yield too little 
The S P 500 is at multi year highs in almost every valuation metric  P E  P B  P S   you name it  And a lot of that froth is coming from traditional income sectors  Yardeni Research s latest sector study shows that utility stocks  for instance  trade at 18 times estimates  at the very high end of its 10 year range  The sector s typically high yields  meanwhile  have dried up to a mere 3  
Hey  Where d The Dividends Go 
The real estate industry is getting pricey  too  with the iShares U S  Real Estate ETF  NYSE IYR  yielding a five year low 3 1   Many closed end funds are no longer trading at the nice discounts to NAV that they were even a year ago 
Thus  my hunt for significant sources of yield has taken me to some interesting  and even downright odd  corners of the market that the financial media has largely ignored  and that most investors haven t even heard of 
Their yields are eye catching  sure   who isn t going to notice yields of 6   14 3   16 7   But their unique business models are just as captivating  These companies deal in odd businesses which not only make them difficult to properly value  but in many cases also means they re dealing with far less competition than more mainstream stocks 
Let s take a look at a half dozen of these high yield anomalies 
The Tobacco Hybrid
All my readers are no doubt familiar with the dividend power of tobacco stocks  Just look at the mainstays of the group 
Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   5 0 
Altria Group  NYSE MO   5 6 
British American Tobacco  LON BATS   6 6 
Of course  none of these hold a candle to the massive 14 3  dividend being thrown off by Vector Group  NYSE VGR   a unique tobacco real estate hybrid that truly has no equal in the publicly traded world 
Vector Group is actually a holding company that features two very disparate arms  Its Vector Tobacco and Liggett Group subsidiaries include brands such as Even  Pyramid  Liggett Select and Eagle 20 s discount cigarettes  However  VGR also owns New Valley  which owns real estate investments in California and New York  among other places  real estate brokerages in several states  and a 100  ownership in Douglas Elliman Realty LLC  New York City s largest real estate brokerage 
To Vector Group s credit  the company has kept revenues growing for years despite pressures on the tobacco industry  But net income dropped precipitously from 2017 to 2018  from 56 cents per share to 37 cents per share  And perhaps importantly is that an ongoing dividend concern   a payout that wildly outstrips its means   persists  just as it did two years ago when I last covered the stock  The company paid out  1 54 per share in dividends last year   more than 4x its profits   as it stubbornly continued to increase its quarterly dole  The cash situation is technically better but not good  with dividends at 124  of operating cash flow for 2018 
Vector Group  VGR  Is Burning Out
Particularly concerning is the company s debt  which ballooned from  633 million in 2013 to  1 2 billion in 2017 and  1 7 billion at the end of 2018  and the company itself points out that   230 million due in January 2019   was repaid using proceeds of an offering of  325 million unsecured notes we issued in October 2018  
While VGR s combination of tobacco and real estate would seem to be a can t miss dividend play  its risky financials make it a clear yield trap 
Niche Real Estate
Speaking of real estate  investors also are plenty familiar with the income potential from real estate investment trusts  REITs   which have to take 90  or more of their taxable income and deliver it right back to investors as dividends 
Many of these REITs are in pretty straightforward industries   retail  hotels  warehouses  But sometimes it pays to delve into areas that few other operators are interested in 
For instance  there s Gladstone Land  LAND    part of the Gladstone family of investment vehicles   which owns 83 farms primarily dedicated to growing food  spanning 68 777 acres across nine states  It s a no brainer investment as the world population  and its demand for food  grows but arable land per capita continues to shrink  While it sounds boring  it s a high potential category   revenues have expanded by 6 6x since Gladstone Land s 2013 IPO  cash flows and adjusted funds from operations have exploded  too  LAND yields 4 4  at the moment

There s also EPR Properties  NYSE EPR   which generates a roughly 6  yield off an interesting mish mash of real estate  A quick breakdown 
Entertainment  48  net operating income   This includes 158 megaplex cinemas under the Regal Cinemas and Cinemark  NYSE CNK  brands  among others  and a few family entertainment centers and entertainment retail centers 
Recreation  32    This is EPR s most interesting category  containing not just traditional entertainment venues such as water parks and ski areas  but also innovative TopGolf driving ranges  upscale  multi deck ranges that  gamify  golf and boast an almost nightlife esque atmosphere  and iFly indoor skydiving facilities 
Education  19    Includes public charter schools  private schools and early childhood education centers   EPR designates the remaining 1  of NOI under  other   
EPR appeared to hit a bit of a growth wall in early 2018  but FFO have rebounded  and the dividend keeps growing  With few disruptors in sight  EPR s fate is mostly in its own hands

3  Trader  Funds Yielding Up to 16 7 
Gold doesn t pay a dividend  Neither does silver  Neither does oil  Commodities don t generate profits or cash flow  and they never pay out a single dime to shareholders 
And yet  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Group  NYSE CS  still offers a few products that can squeeze dollar bills out of metals and crude 
The X Links family of exchange traded notes  ETNs  don t hold any physical assets  but instead are just debt tossed into an ETF wrapper  Three of these ETNs replicate the returns of a strategy that involves selling covered calls against popular commodity ETFs to generate high amounts of income  They are 

The problem  Despite yields of more than 5  on the low end and nearly 17  on the high end  these products have a hard time justifying their existence  As you can see below  GLDI and SLVO actually underperformed the ETFs their tracking indices trade on a total return basis over the past few years despite their yield advantage  And while USOI outperformed here  

  it s actually been a significant underperformer  7 percentage points   in the past year 

That s because while selling covered calls does generate a high amount of income  it can put a significant cap on price performance upside  Moreover  these indexed products use very limited options trading techniques that make it difficult to maximize the utility in trading covered calls  The result  Flashy yields with very little substance to set them apart from cheaper plain Jane commodity funds 
How To Retire Entirely On Dividend Checks Alone
If you re getting a three year return of 16 7  from a fund that yields 16 7   something has gone terribly  terribly wrong 
And that something is your retirement 
If you want to meet your financial goals  you need to identify high yielders that can not only sustain high payouts over time  but also grow them  to outpace inflation  and give you some price performance on the side  Remember  If your nest egg isn t growing in retirement  and you have to raid your account to cover an emergency  you ll cripple your ability to generate income 
So  let s recap  The stocks and funds you need to retire have to offer  
An average 8  portfolio yield that includes a couple of double digit payouts 
The potential for 7  to 15  in annual capital gains
Robust dividend growth that will keep up with  and beat  inflation
That might sound ambitious  but you can check off all three boxes with the  triple play  stocks in my 8  yielding  No Withdrawal  retirement portfolio 
There are far more dangerous dividend stocks out there than you d think  You probably already know that a lot of super high yield stocks only deliver that level of income because of battered share prices that reflect deteriorating businesses  But you should also beware a lot of big name blue chips that seem safe  but whose no growth businesses and modest yields can actually set your portfolio back years  The financial media tells you these stocks are protecting you  but really  they re quietly pulling you underwater 
Consider this  If you re earning a 3  yield on your portfolio  that s 50  more than the S P 500   and what you ll typically get from  high yield  blue chips  you ll earn just  30 000 a year in dividends on a million dollar nest egg 
If that made your heart skip a beat  good   it should  That s your wake up call 
You need almost three times that income  plus dividend growth to beat back inflation  not to mention capital appreciation to keep building your nest egg  That s not easy to find  but a handful of winners in this market have what it takes 
My  No Withdrawal  portfolio is an all star cast of stocks that will deliver an average yield of 8  that will also grow your nest egg   an important aspect of retirement investing that most other strategies leave out  If disaster strikes and you have to take a chunk out of your nest egg  you re also taking a chunk out of your income potential  You need income and growth 
This portfolio will give you exactly that  You ll be able to live off your regular dividend checks alone  and you ll never have to touch your nest egg just to pay the bills Disclosure  Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks funds across the U S  markets  Click here to learn how to profit from their strategies in the latest report   7 Great Dividend Growth Stocks for a Secure Retirement  ",2019-03-22,Brett Owens,https://www.investing.com/analysis/6-bizarre-dividend-plays-yielding-up-to-167-200400060,200400060

Let s take a look at the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank 2  Buy  company  You can see  Moves to Boost RRPs Bode Well Tobacco companies are placing their bets on reduced risk products  RRPs  such as e cigarettes  With radical investments for undertaking research and development in this category  Phillip Morris is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to low risk alternatives  In fact  the company s IQOS  a smokeless cigarette  is among one of the leading RRPs in the industry 
In October 2018  the company launched additional versions of IQOS in Japan  These next generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research  The company expects such advanced and high quality products to aid adult smokers to switch from traditional cigarettes to smoke free options  IQOS users at the end of fourth quarter 2018 totaled 9 6 million Going ahead  the company expects consistent growth in IQOS and Heated Tobacco category  Further  to cater to the rising demand for such products  Phillip Morris is undertaking plant conversions  This was witnessed in the company s Papastratos factory in Greece  for the production of HEETS   a unit used with IQOS Moreover  the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group   NYSE MO   is expected to boost business for the players  Currently  the agreement is under FDA review 
Additionally  Phillip Morris has inked a deal with Canada based Parallax that provides low risk alternatives of tobacco  Other tobacco companies like British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR   are striving to expand in e cigarettes and other low risk tobacco options 

Pricing Is a Key Upside Strong pricing is propelling Philip Morris to generate substantial revenues in the combustible category  Moreover  the price hikes enable the company to maintain margins at the desired level  As smokers tend to absorb price increases due to their addiction  this strategy could be of some help in the near term Wrapping Up In addition to the aforementioned upsides  this well known tobacco giant is likely to continue gaining from a strong brand portfolio that comprises popular names such as Marlboro  L M  Bond Street  Parliament  Chesterfield and Virginia Slims among others  We expect such factors to continue aiding Phillip Morris and help it sustain in investors  good books Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more effectively safeguard your retirement with a new Special Report   4 Warning Signs Your Investment Advisor Might Be Sabotaging Your Financial Future  ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/philip-morris-looks-alluring-on-gains-from-rrps--pricing-200401221,200401221
190511,412027,PM,Why Philip Morris  PM  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Philip Morris  PM   which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry 
This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 13  
For the last reported quarter  Philip Morris came out with earnings of  1 25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 16 per share  representing a surprise of 7 76   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 28 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 44 per share  delivering a surprise of 12 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Philip Morris lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Philip Morris has an Earnings ESP of  0 29  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

190542,412058,PM,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Philip Morris  PM  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Philip Morris in Focus
Philip Morris  PM  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Consumer Staples sector  The stock has seen a price change of 14 93  since the start of the year  The seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is paying out a dividend of  1 14 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 5 94  compared to the Tobacco industry s yield of 5 43  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 98  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 56 is up 1 6  from last year  In the past five year period  Philip Morris has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 50   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Philip Morris s current payout ratio is 88   This means it paid out 88  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 31 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 12  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  PM is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-philip-morris-pm-could-be-a-great-choice-200385754,200385754
190550,412066,PM,Analysts Estimate Philip Morris  PM  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Philip Morris  PM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 16 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 5  
Revenues are expected to be  7 35 billion  down 11 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 47  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris 
For Philip Morris  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Philip Morris will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 44  delivering a surprise of  12 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Philip Morris doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-philip-morris-pm-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200381927,200381927

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 76   A quarter ago  it was expected that this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 44  delivering a surprise of 12 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Philip Morris  which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry  posted revenues of  7 50 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 05   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 29 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Philip Morris shares have added about 13 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for Philip Morris 
While Philip Morris has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Philip Morris was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 07 on  6 78 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 31 on  30 12 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

190564,412080,PM,Altria  MO  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Altria  MO  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of Philip Morris  NYSE PM  USA  the nation s largest cigarette maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  4 81 billion  up 22 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 82  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Altria 
For Altria  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Altria will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Altria would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  0 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Altria doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-mo-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378923,200378923

190581,412097,PM,Will RRPs Curate A Comeback For Philip Morris  PM  In 2019 ,opinion,"Like most tobacco companies  it has been a tough year for Philip Morris International   NYSE PM    This renowned tobacco stock has lost 33 2  on a year to date basis compared with the  s plunge of 37 9   Matters look grim due to declining cigarette sales volumes stemming from stern government regulations and consumers  rising health consciousness Amid such hurdles  the reduced risk products  RRPs  platform has emerged as the much needed ray of hope for tobacco companies  In fact  Philip Morris  e cigarettes are performing well in several key markets  Moreover  higher pricing strategies bode well for the company  Let s take a closer look at the company s efforts to stay afloat and see if there are any chances of revival ahead Impressive Strides in RRPs SpaceWith dim prospects in the cigarette category  Philip Morris is exploring opportunities in e cigarettes  Notably  the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low risk alternatives by undertaking investments for research and development 
The company s flagship brand IQOS  a heat not burn product  is among one of the leading RRPs in the industry  Recently  the company launched additional versions of IQOS in Japan  These next generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research  The company expects such advanced and high quality products to facilitate adult smokers to switch from traditional cigarettes to less harmful options Further  to cater to rising demand for such products  Phillip Morris is undertaking plant conversions  transforming them from cigarette to RRPs manufacturing facilities  Also  the company s marketing and technology sharing agreement with Altria   NYSE MO    which is currently under FDA s review  is likely to enable the companies to tap greater opportunities in this space 
We note that e cigarettes and similar RRPs are viewed as the future products for tobacco companies  However  the FDA is keeping close tab on the manufacturing and marketing policies of RRPs to regulate usage among youths  Other tobacco companies such as British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR   have been expanding their presence in this arenaHigher Pricing Aids GrowthApart from declining volumes  rising taxes on cigarettes are also a worry  To counter such limitations  Philip Morris is resorting to higher cigarette pricing  Evidently  higher pricing in the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year over year net revenue growth during the second and the third quarters of 2018 
Moreover  the price hikes enable Philip Morris maintain margins at the desired level  As smokers tend to absorb price increases due addiction  this strategy could be of some help in the near term 

Can Efforts Shield Against HurdlesWe note that Philip Morris  cigarette shipment volumes have declined 1 7   1 5  and 5 3  during the third  the second and the first quarters of 2018  respectively  Going ahead  management anticipates tobacco industry volumes to decline almost 2 5  in 2018  This is likely to dent the company s overall shipment volumes  In fact  Philip Morris  total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume are expected to drop 2  in 2018 With increasing vigilance on tobacco products  it is hard for Philip Morris to escape from the impacts of deteriorating cigarette sales  Against such backdrop  RRPs have emerged as a game changer and are expected to support the company s growth in some of the key international markets  However  it has yet to be seen if such strategies can help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to make a comeback in 2019

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is PM due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Philip Morris Q1 Earnings Beat  Sales MissPhilip Morris delivered a beat in first quarter 2018 after missing earnings estimates five straight times  Moreover  the top and the bottom lines grew year over year  Also  management raised its bottom line view for 2018  encouraged by tax reforms  However  these factors were not enough to placate investors  who were let down by the fifth consecutive sales miss and drop in constant currency  cc  earnings  This could be largely accountable to soft volumes 
Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of  1 00 per share rose 2  year over year and it came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents  Excluding the positive impact from currency fluctuations  the bottom line dipped 1  from 98 cents reported in the year ago period 
Net revenues were  6 896 million  which increased 13 7   up 8 3  on a constant currency basis  in the quarter  However  net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 024 million  Favorable pricing of combustible products and greater volumes of heated tobacco units and IQOS devices drove currency neutral revenues 
During the quarter  revenues from combustible products inched up 2 5   down 2 5  at cc  to  5 769 million  Revenues from RRPs doubled  also on a cc basis  to  1 127 million  largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices 
Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 2 3  to 173 8 billion units  due to declines across most regions other than S SA and EA A  While cigarette shipment volume declined 5 3  to 164 3 billion units in the quarter  heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9 6 billion units  increased 5 1 billion units year over year 
Adjusted operating income inched higher by 0 4  year over year to  2 426 million  while it slipped 2 7   on a cc basis  due to adverse volume mix  especially in GCC  and escalated marketing  research and administration expenses  These hurdles couldn t be fully compensated by favorable pricing  Adjusted operating margin  on a cc basis  fell 4 0 points to 35 8  
Also  during the quarter  Phillip Morris announced a quarterly dividend of  1 07 
Region Wise Performance
Net revenues in EU climbed 0 2   on a cc basis  to  1 988 million  courtesy of favorable pricing  somewhat offset by adverse volume mix  Total shipment volume fell 5  to 40 599 million units 
In EE  net revenues jumped 4 3  to  567 million  courtesy of the same factors that drove EU revenues  Total shipment volumes tumbled 8 3  to 22 603 million units 
Net revenues slipped 1 5  to  961 million in ME A region as adverse volume mix more than offset gains from pricing  Total shipment volumes dropped 6 5  to 29 957 million units 
Moving to S SA  a 5 6  rise in revenues to  1 081 million was witnessed  which was backed by improved pricing  though it was also somewhat countered by unfavorable volume mix  Shipment volumes grew 6 1  to 40 218 million units 
EA Asaw its revenues surge 27 5  to  1 591 million  owing to solid pricing  Total shipment volumes climbed 0 2  to 21 433 million units 
Finally  revenues at LA C advanced 17  to  708 million  on the back of favorable pricing  However  total shipment volumes were down 1 4  at 19 036 million units 
Guidance
Management is confident about delivering solid results in 2018  along with being committed toward making shareholder friendly moves  The company is optimistic about strength its IQOS devices and favorable pricing of combustible products  While soft volumes in GCC  difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan pose hurdles  the company is on track to double its worldwide in market heated tobacco unit sales from 2017 
That said  management projects revenues in 2018 to grow about 8   on a cc basis   Also  it expects the recent tax reforms to boost bottom line growth  Incidentally  management now expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be roughly 26   down from 28  projected in February 
Consequently  earnings are envisioned in the range of  5 25  5 40 compared with the previous forecast of  5 20  5 35  The updated guidance reflects year over year growth of 35 39   up from the previous projection of 34 38   Excluding a favorable currency impact  the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 8 11   up from the previous forecast of 7 10  
Additionally  management expects capital expenditures of roughly  1 7 billion in 2018  while operating cash flow is envisioned to be more than  9 billion

190605,412121,PM,The Secret To  Second Level  8  Dividends,opinion," Hey Brett  what do you think of telecom  
 Well  let s take Verizon  NYSE VZ   It pays a 5  dividend  It s growing that dividend by about 2  or so per year  So I d expect the stock to return 7  or so in the years ahead   I replied 
 What about profitability metrics like return on invested capital  ROIC   Or margins  Or    my investor friend rebutted 
 If it doesn t flow through to a higher dividend  then it doesn t really matter  
I was  grilled  with many thoughtful dividend related questions while speaking to subscribers and fellow income hounds at Denver s AAII  American Association of Individual Investors  chapter last week  One popular question was what I thought of a popular dividend stock   like Verizon  or AT T  NYSE T   or Philip Morris  NYSE PM  
I explained that it s actually pretty easy to project the future returns for any dividend payer 
How to Forecast Returns for Any Dividend Payer
If you told me 10 years ago that Verizon was going to boost its dividend by 37  over the next decade  I d have told you that the stock s price would rise by that same amount  I wouldn t have been far off   it rose 32   not bad for a decade long forecast  
Dividend Up 37   Price Up 32  
 Shortly  we ll discuss how to predict dividend growth  For now  let s get back to this example  
The steady staircase of Verizon s payout  orange line above  sure makes its price  blue line above  look manic  There were months and even years where the share price shot well above and later plunged below the stocks  dividend curve  
But over time  the payout acts as a magnet  It simply pulls the stock price back to it  Investors buy Verizon for its dividend   which means that it is likely to underperform when its yield is low  on a relative basis  and outperform when its yield is high 
We can see this clearly by looking at Verizon s yield versus its price history  They are near mirror images of each other 
When Yield is High  Price is Low 
Of course Verizon investors didn t only receive price gains since 2008  Most of their returns came in the form of cash dividends  The stock actually pays exactly the same today as it did on this date in 2008  4 9    But Verizon investors more than doubled their money during that time period  thanks to dividends 
Verizon Doubles  Thanks to Dividends 
What will VZ shares return over the next ten years  It s a pretty simple formula 
5  Current Yield   2  Dividend Growth   7  Total Returns Per Year
Can shares beat these projections  They can  but only if the company is able to accelerate its dividend from here 
This is where our  second level  dividend analysis comes in  We need to look past the obvious metrics such as stated yields and paper profits to identify  inflection points  in payouts  In other words  we need to find the disrespected dividends   and buy them 
Interest rate worries are helpful here  Over the past few years  they ve sent more solid dividends to the bargain bin that most other headline fears combined  Let s talk about an obvious win that was available thanks to these concerns 
A Reliable 8   Payer Produces Double Digit Gains Every Year
Two and a half years ago my Contrarian Income Report subscribers purchased Medical Properties Trust  NYSE MPW   the ultimate  hospital landlord   It was paying nearly 8  at the time   discarded to the bargain bin because the first level types fretted that higher rates would harm its ability to collect rent checks from its hospital operators 
Those fears were silly  MPW continued to  play Monopoly  in the hospital space  acquiring more and more valuable assets  Its higher rent income helped it generate higher and higher funds from operations  FFO    which it then paid to us in the form of three dividend increases 
MPW Rises 15  Thanks to 3 Dividend Increases 
And here s where it gets better  Not only is MPW growing its dividend faster than Verizon  but it also pays nearly double the popular telecom  Once again it paid to be contrary and buy a perfectly safe  solid stock that the mainstream media simply hadn t heard of  We banked the capital gains above plus 7  to 8   yields along the way  resulting in 40  total returns that beat the broader market to boot 
Have Your Big Yield and Beat the Market  
Who says we can t have yield and growth  We can easily have both   when we look beyond the brand name dividends and buy the underrated payers 
Like These Plays  The 8 Best 8  Dividends with Big Upside to Buy Today
Most Wall Street spreadsheet jockeys say we investors can t have both the income and safety of bonds and the upside of stocks  We have to choose  or allocate  or whatever 
They re wrong  They don t realize that the nine bond funds in my Contrarian Income Report portfolio have delivered average annualized returns of 23 9   including dividends  
My three top picks today are poised to continue the tradition  These funds are a cornerstone of my   which lets retirees rely entirely on dividend income and leave their principal 100  intact 
Well that s not exactly right  Their principal is more than 100  intact thanks to price gains like these  Which means principal is actually 110  intact after year 1  and so on 
To do this  I seek out closed end funds that 

Pay 8  or better 
Have well funded distributions 
Trade at meaningful discounts to their NAV 
And know how to make their shareholders money 

And I talk to management  because online research isn t enough  I also track insider buying to make sure these guys have real skin in the game 
Today I like three  blue chip  closed end funds as best income buys  And wait  til you see their yields  These  slam dunk  income plays pay 8 5   8 7  and even 8 9  dividends 
Plus  they trade at 10 15  discounts to their net asset value  NAV  today  Which means they re perfect for your retirement portfolio because your downside risk is minimal  Even if the market takes a tumble  these top notch funds will simply trade flat  and we ll still collect those fat dividends 
If you re an investor who strives to live off dividends alone  while slowly but safely increasing the value of your nest egg  these are the ideal holdings for you

Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Phillip Morris International   NYSE PM    Altria   NYSE MO   and British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   Are Cigarettes Finally Dead  Philip Morris PlungesPhillip Morris International shares are in free fall this morning after announcing Q1 earnings that were actually slightly higher than analyst estimates  Revenues were lower than expected however  and the future of the industry looks grim The stock is currently trading down over 17  on the day at  84 49 after closing yesterday at  101 20 The international producer of Marlboro cigarettes and other tobacco based products    which was spun off from U S  producer Altria almost exactly ten years ago    reported earnings of  1 00 share in Q1 versus a Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 88  Revenues came in lower than estimates with the company posting  6 89B in sales  while analysts were expecting  7 02B  Most of the increase in earnings was due to currency fluctuations and favorable tax rates rather than improved operations Sales in regions Eastern Europe  Africa and the Middle East  East Asia and Australia  and Latin America and Canada all saw a decrease in sales by unit volume  Only Southeast Asia saw mild sales growth  Guidance for 2018 remained basically the same  though the range was adjusted slightly from  5 25    5 35 share to  5 25    5 40 share Industry wide CarnageOther industry players are falling today as well on the news as investors ruminate on an uncertain future for tobacco  U S  Marlboro producer Altria is down over 7  and British American Tobacco   owner of R J Reynolds   is down almost 6  Philip Morris has missed the Zacks Composite Earnings estimate in each of the last 4 quarters due to regulation  increased taxation and an overall decline in demand for tobacco products The 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris from Altria was intended to take advantage of international demand for tobacco products outside the purview of onerous U S  regulation and it worked for a while  Now however  facing the same pressures worldwide as they once did in the U S   Philip Morris is scrambling to replace traditional cigarette sales with alternative tobacco products  Reduced Risk   Really In the face of declining market  tobacco companies have embraced  Reduced Risk Products   RRPs  to attract customers  They are betting on heated tobacco products like vaporizers and smokeless tobacco as less unhealthy choices for those who choose to continue to use tobacco Unfortunately for Philip Morris  sales of its iQOS vaporizer device were disappointing in Asia  the device s primary market   as were sales of the  Heatstick  cartridges used in the iQOS Heated tobacco devices were seen as a potential savior for Philip Morris and the industry as a whole  but demand seems to have leveled of globally faster than expected Investing in an industry whose potential savior is a group of products that still have the word  risk  in their name seems potentially unwise Income PlayThe real  savior  of Philip Morris and the whole industry   at least from investors  point of view   has been a healthy dividend  Philip Morris and Altria both pay a dividend of just over 4  and British American pays 3 7  With interest rates on the rise  however  dividend paying stocks look relatively less attractive  and with the future of tobacco so significantly uncertain  the ability of these companies to continue paying juicy dividends long term is in doubt Philip Morris does have over  8B on the balance sheet  so the dividend looks safe for

190623,412139,PM,How MO   3 Others Are Placed In A Challenging Tobacco Space,opinion,The multi million  industry has been treading on shaky ground  thanks to stringent FDA regulations to curb cigarette consumption  Well  authorities can t be blamed for brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer  However  in an attempt to navigate rough waters  a few tobacco players have resorted to reduced risk tobacco products  RRPs   a less fatal alternative to cigarettes Headwinds Plaguing Tobacco MajorsCigarette sales have been deteriorating  due to several marketing regulations imposed by the FDA  Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product  companies are also required to mandatorily use precautionary labels on cigarette packets  Additionally  these companies have been directed to put self critical advertisements on television and newspapers  particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes To add to the woes  the FDA is now bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels  The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed  thanks to ongoing research and opposition from several interest groups  If acted upon  lowering nicotine levels will undoubtedly be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies  Moreover  increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of smoking The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on receding cigarette sales volumes of tobacco industry majors such as Altria   NYSE MO    Philip Morris   NYSE PM    British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR    Also  owing to these hurdles  the tobacco industry  ranked among the bottom 12  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  has dropped 6 3  in the past six months  as against the S P 500 that gained 3 2  On the flip side  tobacco companies have been exploring opportunities provided by RRPs  Incidentally  Philip Morris  one of the companies leading this revolutionary shift to RRPs along with Altria  has been investing to strengthen their smoke free products portfolio Let s take a closer look at the performance of these companies and how they are placed amid the ongoing chaos as well as the efforts they have been undertaking to survive A Look Into Major Tobacco Players PerformancePhilip Morris International Inc  s cigarette shipment volumes declined 2 1  during the fourth quarter of 2017  This marked the company s fourth consecutive period of earnings and sales miss  Moreover  the company s shares declined 9 1  over the past six months  wider than the industry s fall In an effort to boost performance  Philip Morris has been radically expanding its RRPs portfolio  The company seems to stand firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future  evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS   a unit used with iQOS  In fact  with investments close to  4 5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and product development in the RRPs category  the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low risk product alternatives Buoyed by such efforts  management expects earnings for 2018 in the range of  5 20  5 35  depicting a growth of 34 38  over the prior year figure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earning for 2018 also falls within management s guidance and is pegged at  5 27  Moreover  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company carries a  of B and has a long term growth rate of 10 1   You can see  Altria Group  Inc  saw its domestic cigarette volumes decline almost 8 9  year over year during the fourth quarter 2017  Moreover  due to consistent declines in the cigarette category  Altria s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters  The company carries a VGM Score of D Additionally  dismal cigarette sales performance led to Altria s shares to decline 0 7  in the past six months  which compares favorably with the industry s fall  Well  this Zacks Rank  3 company has been managing to stay afloat on the back of its Smokeless product category  In fact  revenues in this category advanced 11 1  in the fourth quarter  Moreover  in e vapor  Altria s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume  which expanded 60  in 2017  Altria s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris is also expected to boost the businesses of the companies  Per the agreement  Phillip Morris will market Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally  Also  Altria will distribute two of Phillip Morris  heated tobacco products in the United States Buoyed by the prospects in the smokeless category  management expects 2018 earnings to surge 5 19  year over year to  3 90  4 03  The Zacks Consensus for 2018 earnings trended upward over the past 30 days and is pegged at  4 01  The company also has a long term growth rate of 8 6  Another tobacco industry major  British American Tobacco plc  saw its shares decline almost 8 2  over the past six months  Moreover  the company s preliminary results for 2017 depict a decline of 2 6  in organic cigarette volumes  The company carries a VGM Score of D Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank   3 company has been gaining significantly from the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI   British American has also been striving to expand in the RRPs realm with its Next Generation Products lineup Vector Group Ltd   a Florida based tobacco company  witnessed a decline 2 8  in tobacco unit sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017  The company  which has seen its shares dip 1  in the past six months  carries a VGM score of F  Although Vector Group has not ventured out into RRPs  the company relies upon the real estate segment to offset tobacco sales related hurdles Wrapping UpWhile RRPs seem to be one of the most viable options for tobacco players to offset declining cigarette volumes  there are other factors that need to be taken care of  Advancements in the reduced risk category are yet to completely offset cigarette sales decline for most of the aforementioned companies  That said  let s wait and watch what lies ahead for companies operating in the tobacco space and what additional efforts they can undertake to sustain in the industry Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now ,2018-03-28,Zacks Investment

190624,412140,PM,Philip Morris  PM  Q1 Earnings  Can RRPs Pare Cigarette Woe ,opinion,Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   is slated to release first quarter 2018 results on Apr 19  before the opening bell  The company s earnings have lagged estimates in each of the past four quarters  with an average miss of 6 1   Lately  Philip Morris has been treading on shaky grounds  thanks to the jolts from receding cigarette consumption stemming from strict government regulations and rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of tobacco  However  the company has been combating such challenges with strength in Reduced Risk Products  RRPs   That said  let s see what this earnings season has in store for this tobacco giant Cigarette Segment to Stay a WorryGovernment authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer  Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product  the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets  Additionally  these companies have been directed to put self critical advertisements on television and newspapers  particularly emphasizing on the addictive nature of cigarettes  To add to the woes  the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels  The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research  If enacted  low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies  Moreover  increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption  motivating them to quit smoking The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on Philip Morris s receding cigarette shipment volumes  Shipment volume in this category declined 2 1   4 1   7 5  and 11 5  during the fourth  third  second and the first quarters of 2017  respectively  The decline is expected to continue in the forthcoming quarters as well  Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total cigarette shipment volumes to dip 0 16  in first quarter 2018 Further  the effect of such headwinds is visible on Philip Morris s shares that have declined 10 3  in the past six months  compared with the  s fall of 7   Well  apart from Philip Morris  performances of other industry majors such as Altria Group   NYSE MO    British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR   have been negatively impacted by such factors as well   Hopes on Reduced Risk ProductsKeeping the headwinds aside  Philip Morris has been exploring opportunities through RRPs to stay afloat  The company stands firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future  evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS   a unit used with iQOS  In fact  with investments close to  4 5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and development in the RRPs category  the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low risk alternatives Buoyed by such efforts  the company generated revenues of  1 643 million from RRPs during fourth quarter 2017  significantly higher than  343 million in the year ago quarter  Notably  RRP revenues for 2017 represented 12 7  of the company s overall net revenues  with major contributions from iQOS and accessories The company expects consistent growth in this category in the forthcoming periods  which encourages it to undertake constant investments  In fact  management expects strength in RRPs  especially iQOS  to drive the company s currency neutral revenue growth of more than 8  in 2018 Cigarette Pricing to Aid RevenuesApart from RRPs  higher cigarette pricing has also been an upside in Philip Morris s performance for a while  Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption  it has been noted that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  Evidently  favorable pricing in the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year over year net revenue growth in 2017  Moreover  the price hikes enable the company to maintain margins at targeted levels  The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term All  said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement  Philip Morris International Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Estimates for the QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2018 earnings is currently pegged at 88 cents per share  which reflects an improvement of a cent  over the last 30 days  However  earnings are anticipated to depict a decline of 10 2  from the year ago quarter s level Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 952 million  depicting a growth of 14 6  from the prior year period A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Philip Morris is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to

190626,412142,PM,Can Smokeless Unit Aid Altria  MO  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   is slated to release first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  before the opening bell  While Altria s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter  it has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters We expect the company to gain from sturdy advancements in the smokeless products category  which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results  However  softness in its smokable unit has long been a challenge to the company s top line  That said  let s see how things are shaping up for this tobacco giant  prior to the quarterly release Smokeless SegmentSmokeless products  also popularly known as reduced risk tobacco products  RRPs   are rapidly gaining traction  considering their less detrimental impacts on health  Altria has been promptly responding to this trend and offers several RRPs which helped it maintain market share  The company s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e vapor products are some of the products performing strongly in the smokeless category  In fact  MarkTen is now a leading e vapor brand in the United States  Also  Altria s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris   NYSE PM   to market MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost businesses of the companies Buoyed by efforts to strengthen RRPs  revenues  net of excise taxes  from the Smokeless product category advanced 11 1  to  542 million in the fourth quarter of 2017  Given Altria s impressive strides in this regard  we expect such trends to continue  Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect net revenues  net of excise taxes  of approximately  471 million from this unit during the first quarter  indicating an improvement of 8  from the year ago quarter s figure Pricing Also a Growth DriverAltria s strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry amid declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  In fourth quarter 2017  higher pricing led to a rise in adjusted operating company s income  OCI  and margins in its segments  The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term Industry Headwinds Mar Cigarette VolumesAlthough Altria has been strongly progressing with its smokeless products  things look gloomy when it comes to the company s cigarettes category and smokeable products as a whole  Well  unfortunately  persistent decline in cigarette volumes has been a hindrance for Altria s smokeable segment for a while  This in turn  can be attributed to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing  anti smoking campaigns and higher excise duties  Apart from this  rising health consciousness among consumers has lowered cigarette consumption globally  Together  these factors have been weighing on cigarette sales volumes  As a result  shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 2 6   2 7   6 1  and 8 7  respectively in the preceding four quarters  In fact  during fourth quarter 2017  total cigarette retail share declined to 50 3   representing a 0 8 percentage point slip  This was largely due to a 0 7 share point drop in Marlboro s retail share  which stemmed from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California  On account of such headwinds  the consensus estimate for smokeable segment revenues is currently pegged at  5 349 million for the first quarter   reflecting a drop of nearly 2  from reported smokeable revenues in the year ago period Apart from Altria  declining cigarette sales volumes have been hurting other tobacco players like Philip Morris  British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR    Nevertheless  we believe that favorable pricing and rising demand for smokeless products will help Altria overcome the aforementioned hurdles  Additionally  the company s consistent focus on making investments in core growth areas  improving retail fixtures and making enhancements to brands like Marlboro will lift its market share and aid the firm to maintain its leading position in the tobacco space All  said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement  Altria Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Estimates Bode wellThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at 93 cents  which represents a 27 3  growth from the year ago quarter  This estimate has declined by a cent over the last 30 days  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  4 619 million for the impeding quarter  reflecting a rise of almost 0 7  from the year ago quarter Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Altria will beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can see  Although Altria s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  its Earnings ESP of  0 31  makes us less confident about an earnings surprise You may uncover the best

190627,412143,PM,Philip Morris  PM  Stock Loses 5  Despite Q1 Earnings Beat,opinion,After missing earnings estimates five straight times  Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   delivered a beat in first quarter 2017  Moreover  top and bottom lines grew year over year and management also raised its bottom line view for 2018  courtesy of the tax reforms  However  these factors were not enough to placate investors  who were let down by the fifth consecutive sales miss and drop in constant currency  cc  earnings  This could be largely accountable to soft volumes Evidently  shares of the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company are down about 5  in the pre market trading session  In fact  Philip Morris  shares have gone down 6 2  in the past six months  wider than the  s decline of 4 8   This can primarily be attributable to the company s dismal past record   Coming back to the earnings announcement  management stated that from Jan 1  2018  it started operating through the following six reporting segments  the European Union Region  EU   the Eastern Europe Region  EE   the Middle East   Africa Region  ME A   the South   Southeast Asia Region  S SA   the East Asia   Australia Region  EA A   and the Latin America   Canada Region  LA C   Notably  the ME A region also include PMI Duty Free Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of  1 00 per share rose 2  year over year and itcame ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents  Excluding the positive impact from currency fluctuations  the bottom line dipped 1  from 98 cents reported in the year ago period Net revenues were  6 896 million  which increased 13 7   up 8 3  on a constant currency basis  in the quarter  However  net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 024 million  Favorable pricing of combustible products and greater volumes of heated tobacco units and IQOS devices drove currency neutral revenues During the quarter  revenues from combustible products inched up 2 5   down 2 5  in cc  to  5 769 million  Revenues from Reduced Risk Products  RRPs  doubled  also on a cc basis  to  1 127 million  largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell2 3  to 173 8 billion units  owing to declines across most regions other than S SA and EA A  While cigarette shipment volume declined 5 3  to 164 3 billion units in the quarter  heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9 6 billion units  increased 5 1 billion units year over year Adjusted operating income inched higher by 0 4  year over year to  2 426 million  while it slipped 2 7   on a cc basis due to adverse volume mix  especially in GCC  and escalated marketing  research and administration expenses  These hurdles couldn t be fully compensated by favorable pricing  Adjusted operating margin  on a cc basis  fell 4 0 points to 35 8  Also  during the quarter  Phillip Morris announced a quarterly dividend of  1 07 Region Wise PerformanceNet revenues in EU climbed 0 2   on a cc basis  to  1 988 million  courtesy of favorable pricing  somewhat offset by adverse volume mix  Total shipment volume fell 5  to 40 599 million units In EE  net revenues jumped 4 3  to  567 million  stemming from the same factors that drove EU revenues  Total shipment volumes tumbled 8 3  to 22 603 million units Net revenues slipped 1 5  to  961 million in ME A region as adverse volume mix more than offset gains from pricing  Total shipment volumes dropped 6 5  to 29 957 million units Moving to S SA  a 5 6  rise in revenues to  1 081 millionwas witnessed  which was backed by improved pricing  though it was also somewhat countered by unfavorable volume mix  Shipment volumes grew 6 1  to 40 218 million units EA A saw its revenues surge 27 5  to  1 591 million  owing to solid pricing  Total shipment volumes climbed 0 2  to 21 433 million units Finally  revenues at LA C advanced 17  to  708 million  on the back of favorable pricing  However  total shipment volumes were down 1 4  at 19 036 million units GuidanceManagement remains confident about delivering solid results in 2018  alongside remaining committed toward making shareholder friendly moves  The company remains encouraged about strength of its IQOS devices and favorable pricing of combustible products  While soft volumes in GCC  difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan pose hurdles  the company remains well placed to double its worldwide in market heated tobacco unit sales from 2017 That said  management projects revenues in 2018 to grow about 8   on a cc basis   Also  it expects the recent tax reforms to boost bottom line growth  Incidentally  management now expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be roughly 26   down from 28  projected in February Consequently  earnings are envisioned in the range of  5 25  5 40  in comparison to  5 20  5 35 forecasted earlier  The updated guidance reflects year over year growth of 35 39   up from 34 38  expected earlier  Excluding a favorable currency impact  the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 8 11   better than the previous forecast of 7 10  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is currently pegged at  5 28 Additionally  management

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand  RBNZ  kept its policy unchanged yesterday  while the tone of the accompanying statement was somewhat more cautious than previously  The Bank noted that the nation s growth profile is now weaker in the near term  but stronger in the medium term  while it also acknowledged the softness in the latest set of inflation data 
As for the kiwi  officials said that it has firmed recently  mostly due to the weak US currency  Importantly  they now assume that the trade weighted exchange rate will ease over time  Moreover  in the press conference following the decision  assistant Governor McDermott indicated that if the trade weighted index moves up  then investors should expect more aggressive language on the NZD  The two key takeaways from this meeting were that any rate hike in New Zealand is still a long way off  and that any further strengthening of the NZD would probably see the Bank threaten FX intervention  as it did multiple times in the past  Kiwi dollar fell on the decision and continued lower in the following hours 
German political leaders finally managed to strike a coalition deal yesterday  after several months of negotiations  The deal must now be approved by the members of the SPD  Even though Germany will now most likely have a stable and pro EU government  the euro remained on the back foot yesterday  before rebounding somewhat today  The weakness is being attributed to disappointment that SPD leader Martin Schulz will not be taking over the finance ministry  given his anti austerity views 
In the US  Congressional leaders struck a two year budget deal that will raise federal spending by  300 billion  If approved by Congress  this plan would add further to the rising US deficit  that has been a major concern for investors lately as the nation s long term debt sustainability appears to be in jeopardy  Bond markets took notice of this  with the yields on longer term US Treasuries rising notably  Interestingly enough  the dollar managed to rise alongside yields  reviving a relationship that had largely broken down in recent months 
In terms of economic data  Chinese exports and imports beat expectations  with the latter surging by an impressive 36 9   almost four times the amount analysts projected  This resulted in a much narrower trade surplus  exports minus imports  than expected and led to a considerable decline in the yuan relative to the US currency  USD CNY was up by more than 0 4   On Wednesday  the pair touched 6 2548  its lowest since August 2015  It should be mentioned that the release was likely distorted by seasonal effects owed to the Lunar New Year festivities  Day ahead  BoE meeting the day s highlight  US jobless claims due
The European Central Bank s Economic Bulletin will be released at 0900 GMT  The report contains statistical data that policymakers use when deciding on interest rates  while it also offers an analysis on current and future economic conditions from the central bank s perspective 
Without a doubt the highlight of the day will be the Bank of England meeting on monetary policy  The Bank s decision on rates will be made public at 1200 GMT  No change in rates is expected  with attention falling to the central bank s quarterly inflation report which will include updated forecasts on economic growth and inflation  this will also be released at 1200 GMT  The vote count could also attract attention  While forecasts point to a unanimous 9 0 vote to hold rates unchanged  investors may look at whether notorious policy hawks such as Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders will choose to dissent and vote for a hike instead  potentially increasing expectations that such an action may occur in the near future  Shortly after  at 1230 GMT   Governor Mark Carney will be holding a press conference  His comments have the capacity to spur volatility in sterling pairs  with market participants placing bets on the timing of the next interest rate hike by the BoE 
An appreciating British currency in 2018 is supportive of inflation moving lower towards the BoE s target for annual inflation of 2  and allowing the central bank to proceed more aggressively with its policy normalization plans  This is an issue that Carney might comment on during today s press conference 
Canadian housing starts for the month of January are scheduled for release at 1315 GMT 
US weekly data on initial and continued jobless claims are due at 1330 GMT  First time unemployment benefit claimants are anticipated to increase by 2k relative to the week ending January 27 when they stood at 230k  A number below 300k is linked to a healthy jobs market  Should claimants stand below this level as expected  it would mark the 153rd such week  this being the longest streak since 1970 
Beyond the BoE press conference  other policymakers  appearances include  ECB chief economist Peter Praet and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan   a non voting FOMC member in 2018   will be speaking at a conference in Frankfurt at 0950 GMT  ECB executive board member Yves Mersch will be giving a lecture touching  among others  on central banks and digital currencies  at 1000 GMT  Other FOMC policymakers talking today are Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker  1300 GMT  and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  1400 GMT    neither holds voting rights within the FOMC during the current year  Lastly  Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins will be giving a speech at 1800 GMT 
In equities  the earnings season continues with Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and Philip Morris  NYSE PM  getting in line to release quarterly results  Technical Analysis  GBPUSD in wait and see mode ahead of BoE
GBP USD has lost ground after posting a more than a one and a half year high of 1 4344 on January 25  The RSI has been falling in previous days  pointing to negative short term momentum  However  at the moment it is hovering around the 50 neutral level  This could be an indication that markets are in a wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of England meeting and subsequent press conference by the Bank s Governor 
Any signs that the BoE will tighten policy sooner than earlier thought  are anticipated to lead the pair higher  In this case  resistance could come around the middle Bollinger  line   a 20 day moving average line   at 1 3991  The area around this level also encapsulates the 1 40 handle  a level of potential psychological importance  An upside break would turn the attention to 1 41  this being another level that may be of psychological significance 
On the other hand  a dovish message by the BoE is expected to lead to weakness in the pair  Immediate support might come around Tuesday s three week low of 1 3835  Price action is currently taking place not far above this level  with a violation bringing into view the 50 day MA and lower Bollinger band  both at 1 3662 ",2018-02-08,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kiwi-records-losses-as-rbnz-appears-cautious-all-eyes-on-the-bank-of-england-200288274,200288274
190637,412153,PM,Opening Bell  Volatility Rules As Yields Rise  Yuan Drops  USD Pops,opinion,"VIX goes wild  closing at 1 year high
Stocks  bonds correlate
Equities sold off at end of day  signaling more selling ahead
NASDAQ Composite underperforms
US oil production jump pushes WTI down
Key Events
US equities were pressured again yesterday after Tuesday s miraculous recovery  which featured the S P 500 s strongest rally in 15 months and the Dow s biggest rally in 2 years 

But that was then  During yesterday s session  volatility  as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index  more commonly referred to as the VIX  extended Tuesday s fall from a 2   year high  reaching an intraday low of 21 22  its highest level since November 9  when markets reacted to the initial shock of an unexpected Trump victory in US elections  However  volatility rebounded as the day progressed to close higher  at 27 73  its highest level since February 2016  The index remains about 40 percent above its average since 1990 

The turbulence was spurred by the auction of US 10 year Treasury notes which found little demand  provoking bond traders still licking their wounds from last week s reversal of the supply demand balance that s been in place since late 2014 to increase supply  pushing the yield back above 2 8 percent 

In turn  equity traders  still nervous from the worst selloff in 6   years only two days earlier  joined bond traders and increased supply  The selloff  which began at 11 15 EST  was replaced by the two groups acting in harmony 
Prices ranged between 13 15 and 15 45  However  equity traders didn t want to remain exposed overnight and  as the close neared  inundated exchanges with sell orders  Volume spiked  topping 9 billion shares for a fourth straight day  the highest in seven months 
The rush to sell before the close ended the harmonious range and tipped the balance over to supply  pushing it below its uptrend line  suggesting a negative outlook  This pattern is true for all major US indices  save the Russell 2000  the only major index yesterday that was able to eke out a 0 1 percent advance 
Global Financial Affairs

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a bit below a rising channel  but not far enough to render a rebound unlikely  However  the daily volatility increases risk  as it swung 500 points from peak to trough 

The S P 500 dropped 0 50 percent  led by the Energy sector which fell 1 67 percent  Technology followed  down 1 28 percent  The only two sectors that eked out any gains were Industrials  which rose 0 18 percent  followed by Financials  which advanced 0 12 percent  The S P 500 erased an uptick that reached 1 2 percent at its highest  to close lower by 0 5 percent  It was the biggest reversal for the index since 2015 

The NASDAQ Composite  which is heavily weighted towards information technology companies  fared even worse  The heavy selling of mega cap technology shares pushed the index down by 0 9 percent  forming a bearish Rising Wedge  in which the harmonious range following the initial selloff is considered a downside breakout 
After yesterday s highly volatile 10 year Treasury yield activity  in which yields rose as high as 2 861 but fell as low as 2 758  only to close with much ado about nothing at 2 808  today yields have resumed their rise  sitting at 2 83  as of 04 20 EST  Exacerbating the aftershocks from the global equity selloff  the rising yield continues to confuse intermarket analysis  with European shares falling  Asian equities rising and US futures swinging from losses to gains 
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index Index opened lower this morning  with miners leading the retreat  Earlier  shares listed on Japan s TOPIX closed higher after a turbulent session while China stocks listed on the Shanghai Composite slumped for a third day even as Hong Kong equities listed on the Hang Seng climbed  S P 500 Futures were up after dropping earlier in Asian trading 
The yield surge sparked concern the Federal Reserve would accelerate its tightening schedule  slowing the economy and eroding corporate profit margins  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans signaled as much Wednesday  saying sustained inflation could force more hikes 
The reason the selloff wasn t worse is that investors have been trained to buy the dip  Many buyers are insisting that this time they re motivated not just by greed but by the continued solid fundamentals synchronized growth and strong corporate earnings 
Still  we can t help but wonder how much of this confidence is coming from investors who ve grown used to a Fed whose looser monetary policy has been nursing markets along  What will happen to those same investors once the Fed shuts off much of that liquidity  How many investors will continue to buy 
At the same time  an extended selloff will slowly but surely exhaust liquidation  leaving sellers with no buyers at current price levels  That would force them to seek willing buyers  at any price  or put more broadly  at any cost 

The dollar extended its rally into a 5th straight day  As of this writing it was trading at the height of the session  nearing the top of a falling channel 
Bloomberg s Basic Materials Index fell for a fourth day  its biggest drop since November 

WTI crude fell the most in two months  nearing an uptrend line since September  after government inventories data showed a jump in production  Gold futures slid  and copper futures tumbled more than 3 percent 
The pound was flat ahead of a Bank of England rate decision 

In Asia  the yuan fell the most since the currency s devaluation in August 2015  after China reported a much narrower than expected trade surplus as imports jumped  The country has resumed its Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership plan after a two year hiatus  granting licenses to about a dozen global money managers able to raise funds in China for overseas investments   on Thursday  citing unidentified sources  Increasing imports and overseas investment both contribute to a weaker currency 

Bitcoin s rebound remains under pressure since it fell from its uptrend line from the  6 000 low on Tuesday

190639,412155,PM,Altria Loses 15  In A Year  Can Strategic Efforts Aid Growth ,opinion,Cigarette consumption rates have been charring down  which in turn has been choking the performance of major tobacco players like Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO    Evidently  these hurdles have caused shares of this Virginia based company to plunge close to 15  in the past year  wider than the  s decline of 10 5   Nevertheless  Altria is trying all means to find a breather in reduced risk tobacco products  RRPs    which have been gaining traction Receding Cigarette Volumes Raise ConcernsAltria and other tobacco industry majors received quite a jolt last year when the FDA came up with the proposal to drastically lower nicotine content in cigarettes  This along with the FDA s norms to display self critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking and using precautionary labels on cigarette packets  have been weighing on the tobacco segment  Moreover  in the process of adhering to previous regulatory policies  tobacco manufacturers are required to seek marketing authorization for the introduction of any tobacco product  Additionally  the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act  Per the Act  menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health  That said  Altria and other companies in the multi billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR   have quite a lot to worry about when it comes to cigarette products Thanks to the aforementioned challenges  Altria s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters  In fact  Altria s domestic cigarette shipment volume fell 8 9  year over year during the fourth quarter of 2017  due to lower cigarette industry volumes  unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share  Total cigarette retail share declined to 50 3  during the period  representing a 0 8 percentage point slip  Moreover  declines of 6 2   2 7  and 2 6  in Altria s cigarette shipment volumes were incurred during the third  second and first quarters of 2017  respectively With little or no hopes of attaining growth in cigarettes  Altria is focusing on its smokeless or reduced risk products  Let s take a look at the efforts undertaken in this segment and other factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  You can see  Reduced Risk Products  The New Growth MantraThe future for tobacco companies seems to be smoke free  given the growing popularity of RRPs  Altria has been promptly responding to this changing market scenario  To this end  it has offered several reduced risk tobacco products which helped it maintain market share  In e vapor  Altria s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume  which expanded 60  in 2017  courtesy of greater distribution and category growth  MarkTen s full year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12 5  in mainstream retail channels  Further  it forms nearly 70  of e vapor volumes in those channels  Notably  Altria s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e vapor products are performing strongly in the smokeless category  In fact  MarkTen is now a leading e vapor brand in the United States Backed by efforts to strengthen RRP portfolio  revenues  net of excise taxes  from the Smokeless product category advanced 11 1  to  542 million in the fourth quarter  This was mainly buoyed by better pricing and improved Copenhagen volumes  We expect such trends to continue fueling Altria in the forthcoming periods  Also  Altria s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris   NYSE PM   to market MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost the businesses of the companies Positive on the Journey AheadDespite the headwinds plaguing the cigarette category  Altria has managed to stay afloat in this segment on the back of strong pricing  It has been witnessed that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes  We expect the company to continue reaping benefits from such effective pricing strategies in the forthcoming periods   Additionally  the recent tax reforms favorably impacted Altria s 2017 earnings  and are expected to benefit the company going ahead  Evidently  management expects lower corporate tax rate and lower taxes on AB InBev dividends to augment the company s bottom line in 2018 Apart from this  management is focused on making investments in core growth areas like undertaking innovations  coming up with launches like iQOS  improving retail fixtures and enhancing brands like Marlboro to boost market share  Moreover  on the back of these efforts and expected gains from tax reforms  management provided a positive earnings outlook for 2018  That said  we hope such well chalked endeavors to aid the company to offset the hurdles and continue as one of the prominent names in the tobacco industry The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for

190640,412156,PM,This  Billionaire s Secret  Lets You Buy Stocks For 19  Off ,opinion,"One of the greatest things about  is that they often cost less than they re really worth 
And no  I m not basing that on some obscure metric I m literally talking about the difference between the market price of the assets the fund owns and the market price of the fund itself 
It works like this  a CEF can trade for  say   9 90  even though all the assets the fund holds  known as the net asset value  or NAV  are worth  10  Believe it or not  this happens a lot it s exactly how billionaire investors make big money in CEFs 
Take  for instance  Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management  He s a pretty big name on Wall Street for one reason  he was the guy who took down the so called  London Whale   a reckless trader with JPMorgan Chase   Co  who racked up  6 billion in losses on phenomenally dumb bets 
Weinstein was the guy on the other side of those bets 
And now Weinstein has another lopsided Wall Street mistake in his crosshairs  and it has everything to do with closed end funds 
  Weinstein stated that he was betting big on CEFs  spotting an opportunity to buy these funds  which were heavily discounted at the time  and waiting for the market to clue in to the big profits they offered 
Here s how our CEF Insider equity indexes have done since Weinstein s big bet

Even after the recent volatility  these funds are up around 15  from a year ago  The best news is that there are still a lot of discounted CEFs floating around  despite this gain  so if you want to get in on the action  you re not too late 
Which brings me to the 2 CEFs I ll show you now 
2 CEFs Selling for Up to 19  Off
Let s start with the Eagle Growth and Income Opportunities Closed Fund  NYSE EGIF   which is a tiny   111 5 million fund trading at a huge 16 8  discount to NAV  If you think this is because EGIF is holding dangerous stuff  think again  many holdings are value stocks with strong cash flows  like AT T  NYSE T   Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  and Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  
Buy these stocks on the open market or hold them through a value stock mutual fund or ETF and you ll get  100 worth of stocks for every  100 you put in 
But with EGIF  you ll get  100 of stocks for  83 20  thanks to that absurd discount to NAV 
Why else should you consider EGIF now 
Simply put  its discount has gotten a lot bigger thanks to the recent market volatility 
Cheap Fund Gets Cheaper 
So if you were to buy now and wait for the fund to trade at par  you d be looking at a 20  return  Or if you re more impatient  just wait for this CEF to go back to where it was less than a year ago  You ll still get a nice 5 6  return  And while you wait  you can enjoy EGIF s 5 6  dividend stream 
A second fund to consider is the GDL Fund Pref  NYSE GDL pb   run by famed value investor Mario Gabelli  Mario is a seasoned Wall Street billionaire not unlike Warren Buffet  using time tested value investing principles  his team looks for discounted stocks around the world and bets big on them 
But despite all that expertise  GDL trades at a ridiculous 18 6  discount to NAV 
GDL s Absurd Markdown 
The bottom line 
With  81 40 you ll get  100 worth of stocks in high quality global companies like Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX   which is likely to pop soon when it merges with AT T  as well as Parmalat  MI PLT   the Italian dairy producer  which has a large share of the EU market  and Advanced Accelerator Applications SA  NASDAQ AAAP   which drug making giant Novartis AG ADR  NYSE NVS  is seeking to acquire 
Obviously  Gabelli s team knows their stuff 
Buying now would get you this value portfolio at a huge discount  Wait for its discount to revert to where it was a few months ago  and you ve got 8 1  upside  Keep holding on and collecting the 4 2  dividend stream and you ll likely rack up even more gains  thanks to GDL s strong and underappreciated portfolio 
Revealed  My 4 Best Buys for 7 6  Dividends and FAST 20   Gains

190650,412166,PM,Can Smokeless Unit Help Altria  MO  Make A Comeback In 2018 ,opinion,Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO    which has a solid base in the tobacco industry  has been bearing the brunt of receding consumer enthusiasm toward tobacco products as well as stern regulations by government bodies Nevertheless  Altria is not all out of hopes and has been leaning on reduced risk tobacco products to remain afloat in the market  We expect this category to be a major growth driver in 2018 Well  let s delve deep into the troubles looming over this tobacco giant  and see if its strategic endeavors can help it witness a turnaround in 2018 Major Deterrents in Altria s Growth StoryPersistent declines in cigarette volumes have been dragging down Altria s smokeable category s performance  This has led to a fall in the company s retail market share  In the preceding four quarters  shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 6 1   2 7   2 6  and 4 7   respectively  In fact  Marlboro  one of Altria s prominent cigarette brands  registered a 6  decline in volumes in third quarter 2017 Regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing  anti smoking campaigns and higher excise duties are the primary reasons for the unit s drab performance  Battered by these factors  Altria s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the last nine quarters Government Initiatives to Control SmokingSince smoking isn t a proud practice  regulatory bodies have been chalking out plans to lower this habit  Per the November 2017 court order  companies manufacturing cigarettes must make consumers aware of the health implications of smoking through advertisements via television channels  newspapers  websites  store displays and cigarette packs  The directive was issued after the federal authorities came to a conclusion that companies need to be proactive in informing consumers about the hazards of tobacco consumption  Moreover  in July 2017  the FDA directed companies to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non addictive or minimally addictive levels Further  the FDA declared that companies manufacturing tobacco products must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco products introduced after Feb 15  2007  In May 2016  the FDA amended this restriction to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah alongside traditional tobacco products  Moreover  the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health Such actions have been a curse for a number of firms in the multi billion tobacco industry such as Altria  Philip Morris   NYSE PM    British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   and Vector Group   NYSE VGR    The aforementioned moves along with rising health consciousness among consumers have resulted in lower cigarette consumption globally  Notably  shares of the company have lost 4 3  in the past six months  faring somewhat better than the  s decline of 7 8    Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our  Can Smokeless Unit Offer Respite in 2018 FDA s strict regulations have compelled Altria to resort to smokeless tobacco products to remain afloat in the industry  Smokeless tobacco products are considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes  Owing to greater acceptability for such products  Altria has introduced several reduced risk tobacco products  Its flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e vapor products have been performing well in this category  Incidentally  MarkTen is now a leading e vapor brand in the United States  with a retail market share of approximately 13 5  in mainstream retail channels  as highlighted in the company s third quarter 2017 results Encouragingly  during the second and third quarters  revenues  net of excise taxes  from the Smokeless tobacco category advanced 8 6  and 4 5   respectively  Also  total smokeless products retail share grew 1 1 percentage points to 53 8  during the third quarter Further  Altria s marketing and technology sharing agreement with Philip Morris  which is currently under the FDA s review  can prove to be beneficial for both companies for tapping greater opportunities in the e cigarette realm  Upon FDA clearance  Altria will gain exclusive rights to distribute two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products or iQOS in the United States  We note that iQOS products have been a great hit in foreign markets  especially in Japan  This underscores the potential held by reduced risk products  which is expected to improve Altria s market share going ahead Wrapping UpWhile it s not quite apparent how Altria s cigarette line up will perform post the new marketing and nicotine regulations  the company s advancements in the reduced risks products category appears quite noteworthy  However  it remains to be seen if the strength in the smokeless category can help this

190660,412176,PM,What Impact Will Self Critical Ads Have On Tobacco Stocks ,opinion,"The Tobacco industry has evolved dramatically over the last two decades  It is closely regulated by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  as rising cases of cancer and heart diseases due to cigarette smoking is a serious concern  Smoking causes more than 480 000 deaths annually in the United States 
Amid this scenario  governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption  Such restrictions have severely dented businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM    Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO    British American Tobacco  LON BATS  p l c    NYSE BTI   and Vector Group Ltd    NYSE VGR   
In a recent move  Winston Salem based Reynolds American  NYSE RAI   which is being acquired by British American  along with Richmond  Va based Altria and other cigarette makers is set to put up self critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking per court orders 
Apart from this  the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been intentionally made addictive through the issuance of corrective ads starting Nov 26  Per the Wall Street Journal  the move comes in the wake of settling a 1999 lawsuit which accused the industry for several health hazards 
Notably since 2009  the FDA has been imposing restrictions on cigarette companies over selling and packaging  In July  the FDA urged tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes  as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health 
Not only this  the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act  Per the act  menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product 
Recently  the state government in India s capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city  warning them of legal action if they do not comply 
Switch to Cigarette Alternatives
Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates  tobacco giants have introduced e cigarettes and switched to less harmful  Reduced Risk Products  to boost their business and mitigate loss  However  the FDA has imposed several restrictions on e cigarettes as well 
The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah  The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e cigarettes until 2022 
Share Price Performance  Industry Versus S P 500
Given the aforementioned turmoil  it is not at all surprising that the  is currently placed at the bottom 28  out of the 265 Zacks Classified Industries  The industry has slumped 7 5  in the last six months  against the S P 500 market s 8 4  growth 

Bottom Line
Stricter regulations have adversely impacted tobacco makers  revenues  However  the FDA s role to lower cigarette consumption is worth praising  keeping in view the rising deaths due to smoking  The latest initiative to provide statements against smoking is a significant step and is expected to have a great impact on consumers  Companies  reduced focus on cigarettes and shift toward e cigarettes is expected to reduce the rate of cigarette consumption in the long run

The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah  The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e cigarettes until 2022

these  77 3  delivered positive earnings surprises  while 70 3  surpassed the top line expectations  In fact  total earnings for these companies were up 7  from the year ago quarter  while revenues increased 4 2  Total second quarter earnings for the S P 500 companies are projected to rise 7 2  from the year ago period  with total revenue increase of 4 5   according to the  of Jul 19  While this looks encouraging  we note that the earnings and revenue growth pace is still tracking below the first quarter 2017 level  Thus  with this initial growth picture we cannot conclude that the second quarter earnings cycle is going to be outstanding The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector  and of the 16 Zacks sectors  six are expected to witness an earnings decline in the second quarter  Of these  Autos and Conglomerates are likely to be the major drags Tobacco Stocks form part of the  sector  The second quarter earnings  numbers for the sector looks decent  with year over year earnings growth of 3 9  and revenues increase of 1 5   In fact  the sector is currently placed at top 13  of the Zacks Classified sectors  2 out of 16  Conversely  we observed that the

queued up for second quarter earnings releases on Jul 27 Leading tobacco maker  Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   is scheduled to report before the market opens  We note that the company s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 4  in the first quarter  but delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0 7  in the trailing four quarters Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Altria this quarter  This is because a company needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Altria has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents  Moreover  the company carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which further makes surprise prediction difficult In fact  Altria has been witnessing declining demand for

four quarters Vector Group Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    The company is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  as it has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 18 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise  You can see  We note that Vector Group s earnings estimates have been largely stable ahead of the earnings release Tobacco Industry s HeadwindsThe tobacco industry has been facing many challenges  which have been weighing upon the companies  performance  Furthermore  the restrictions imposed on tobacco companies are lowering cigarette consumption  Also  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  have made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  These regulations

190676,412192,PM,Tobacco Stocks Fall After FDA Announces New Nicotine Regulation Plan,opinion,"The U S  Food and Drug Administration announced a plan on Friday to reduce tobacco related disease and death by increasing regulations on tobacco and nicotine products  The FDA is seeking to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to non addictive levels 
In reaction to this news  Tobacco stocks plunged in morning trading  Shares of Altria Group   NYSE MO    which makes Marlboro and Parliament brand cigarettes  fell 11  after the announcement  Shares of Gillia   OTC GLLA   tumbled 7  while British American Tobacco   NYSE BTI   stock plunged 9   Meanwhile  Vector Group   NYSE VGR   shares fell 5  and Philip Morris   NYSE PM   stock was down 1  in the same time frame  
The FDA s regulation targets the addictive nature of cigarettes  which could hurt the profitability of tobacco companies  However  the FDA views these regulations as a way to encourage development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes 
 The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes the only legal consumer product that  when used as intended  will kill half of all long term users   FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement 
 Envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction  and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources  needs to be the cornerstone of our efforts and we believe it s vital that we pursue this common ground  
The agency also announced plans to delay a policy that requires makers of e cigarettes  or electronic nicotine delivery systems  ENDS   to get agency approval for their products  To help spur industry innovation  products that were on the market as of August 8th  2016  do not need to submit applications until 2022 
The agency said it will issue guidance to describe a new enforcement policy  shortly  as it begins a public discussion around lowering nicotine levels  The FDA has not said what level of nicotine it is aiming for

190677,412193,PM,Can Philip Morris Stay Strong Through FDA Cigarette Crunch ,opinion,"You can t say that Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  isn t persistent  If you re more than a couple of decades old  you ll recall numerous attacks to the tobacco giant and their competitors   Attacks  doesn t imply these events were unwarranted 
Big tobacco companies like PM had the gall to claim that it was impossible to know if cigarette smoke was linked to cancer  Since then  the company has faced a cultural backlash against smoking  This  combined with the fact that it must be hard to stay in business when you kill your own customers  makes  s endurance and growth seem all the more remarkable 
Which brings us to the latest major development in the battle against Big Tobacco  The FDA has announced that it will consider limiting nicotine content in cigarettes to levels that will not cause addiction  Implicit in this statement is that a cigarette that doesn t cause addiction can scarcely cause the stimulant high that smokers need to get through the day  If all goes as the FDA wishes  cigarettes could become little more than cancer sticks  with no medical psychoactive stimulant properties at all  By taking the drug out of the drug  how could a tobacco company possible stay in business 
Philip Morris competitors took a dive following the announcement  Altria Group  NYSE MO  stock  9 4   British American Tobacco  LON BATS   7 8   Vector Group Ltd  NYSE VGR   4 4    PM fell too  but only for a few minutes  Since then it has recovered to cruising altitude as if nothing ever happened  The question is  can it stay that way  or even grow 
This depends upon a number of factors  Here s how I see it 
Philip Morris has extensive international penetration  and this is only going to grow  Even as cigarettes go out of fashion in the United States  there are nations all over the world that PM is just beginning to pursue with intensive marketing efforts  America is a big market  but it is far from the biggest on the world stage  Even if the FDA was successful in essentially sterilizing American cigarettes  there are billions of people worldwide who are  potentially  still in the market for the real thing 
On the other hand  the FDA could really pull this off  By placing Nicotine under the   they could easily restrict its use in cigarettes  Don t think they would just  look the other way  either  The American tobacco industry is heavily regulated  with a history of paying substantial fines for corporate misdeeds  A major loss of American customers would not be good for this American brand 
A third issue is time  It s likely that these  Conversations  within the FDA will happen slowly  and that further regulation  if it happens at all  will be far off  It s hard to imagine new policy getting legs under the current administration  as well  much more so than to consider the policy under a liberal government 
This is just my own opinion  but I see Big Tobacco as an industry screaming for disruption  Their product is  at its core  a central nervous system stimulant called nicotine that grows in the leaves of tobacco plants to protect the plants from pests and sun damage  It s a natural product  but it s not the most efficient CNS stimulant on the market by a long shot  An ever growing array of pharmaceutical stimulants  anti depressants  and mood stabilizers can scratch the itch for which nicotine used to be the only remedy  Even the growing vape industry is seeing massive uptake in the US  and elsewhere  as nicotine users find a healthier way to smoke or to quit smoking 
PM is a giant  with an impressive financial history  and excellent dividends  I would not recommend it for the long term holder  however  The price is likely to jump around in the coming weeks and months  so if you are the kind of person who likes to buy the dip  PM is likely to recover from volatility more reliably than their immediate competitors  Buy and sell accordingly 
That s it from me  What do you think about PM or the tobacco industry in general ",2017-07-30,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-philip-morris-pm-stay-strong-through-fda-cigarette-crunch-200204437,200204437
190678,412194,PM,Will Tobacco Troubles Really Char Staples ETFs  Safety ,opinion,"On July 28  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  proposed to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non addictive or minimally addictive levels  due to its perilous effects on health  Since  FDA s regulation is aimed at the addictive nature of cigarettes  the latest restriction could lower cigarette consumption and the profitability of tobacco companies 
In any case  governments around the world have been proactive in applying restrictive enforcements on tobacco companies  For example  the  for all tobacco makers to seek marketing approval for any tobacco product introduced after February 15  2007  Moreover  the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act 
Following the proposal in late July  stocks of cigarette makers including Altria Group  NYSE MO     British American Tobacco  LON BATS  Plc   NYSE BTI    Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   and Vector Group Ltd    NYSE VGR   fell  However  Philip Morris shares were less hurt in the lot  Most of the stocks were in the red in the last five days  as of August 3  2017  with MO  BTI  PM and VGR sliding about 11 4   6 7   3 1  and 6 8   respectively 
Tobacco s ETF Exposure
Two tobacco companies   Altria and Philip Morris   has huge exposure to consumer staples ETFs  Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund   Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF   LON FSTA   and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF  invest about 8 10  of their holdings in Philip Morris  read    
In fact  the three ETFs have about 17 20  of their exposure targeted at the tobacco industry  On the other hand  Altria has considerable exposure to FSTA  iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF  XLP  VDC and iShares U S  Consumer Goods ETF   These funds put about 5 6 5  of their assets in Altria  read    
Vector Group has an exposure of about 1 5 3 5  to PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF   TO PEY   and WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund   MNE DES   
BTI is invested about 3 5  to 4 3  in ETFs like BLDRS Europe Select ADR Index Fund  and BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR Index Fund  
Are Staples ETFs Really in Trouble Over the Long Run 
Most of the above mentioned ETFs lost in the last five days  as of August 4  2017   Normally  staple ETFs are known for safety due to their non cyclical business pattern  However  if tobacco companies continue to get hurt like this  consumer staples  ETFs may see some troubles  read    
Investors should note that these tobacco stocks offer decent levels of dividend too with Altria and Phillip Morris offering 3 72  and 3 63  yields  as of August 3  2017   So  investors  quest for dividend will also likely get burnt in tobacco woes 
But there is a bright side as well  Research house   does not expect regulatory changes to put tobacco company earnings at risk until at least 2019  as the FDA process is likely to be slow  The FDA is likely to be  considering a delay in implementing new rules for reduced risk products like e cigarettes  
As per Cowen  companies like Philip Morris and Turning Point Brands will actually benefit from the FDA s move as these are well positioned to boost their e cigarette businesses  However  not all players are shielded  so  over the long term  the impact is likely to be mixed

190693,412209,PM,Philip Morris Hits 52 Week High On Growth Initiatives,opinion,"Shares of Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   hit a 52 week high of  116 37 yesterday  though it closed a tad lower at  116 22  probably due to optimistic earnings guidance for 2017  In fact  shares have been gaining momentum on a year to date basis 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has gained 27  year to date  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s rise of 17 2   Notably  the industry is placed in top 37  of the Zacks Classified industries  94 out of 256   Further  the company boasts a long term earnings growth rate of 10 9   which boosts optimism 
Let s Take a Deep LookPhillip Morris commands a leading market position in the tobacco industry on the back of a solid brand portfolio  Further  the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke free products called reduced risk products as customers are shifting away from tobacco products  The company also remains focused on the growing e cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products such as heatsticks and iQOS products  It expects these products to deliver growth in 2017 Philip Morris has always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  Moreover  the price hikes helped the company to maintain margins at the desired level  Moving ahead  management continues to expect pricing to be the key growth driver Despite reporting weaker than expected results in first quarter 2017  the company remains optimistic about its earnings guidance for 2017 owing to a favorable tax item of 4 cents per share  Currently  it expects 2017 earnings in the band of  4 84  4 99 per share compared with the earlier guidance of  4 80  4 95  forecasted in Feb 2017  Notably  this guided range is also higher than the adjusted earnings of  4 48 delivered in 2016  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged within the guided range at  4 88 Further  the company expects revenue growth  excluding excise taxes  to be more than its present target growth in the range 4 6   annually  However  Philip Morris anticipates a combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume decline of 3  to 4  for the full year  We note that the company is struggling with declining cigarette volumes due to reduced demand of cigarettes  higher taxes  anti tobacco campaigns and illicit trade of cigarettes  Strict government regulations and currency headwinds are pressurizing the company as well Despite the headwinds  we believe the company s strong pricing power and focus on accelerating iQOS volume growth will help deliver upbeat results in 2017  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 23 for the second quarter has increased by a penny over the last seven days Stocks that Warrant a LookBetter ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples sector include SunOpta Inc    NASDAQ STKL    Aramark   NYSE ARMK   and Lamb Weston Holdings  Inc    NYSE LW   SunOpta  with a long term earnings growth rate of 15  has skyrocketed 189  in the past one year  The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Aramark carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 12 8  Lamb Weston  a Zacks Rank  2 stock has surged 47  in the past year  Also  it has a long term earnings growth rate of 4 2  Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/philip-morris-hits-52-week-high-on-growth-initiatives-200190944,200190944
190694,412210,PM,Altria  MO  Optimistic On FDA s Filing Of Heated Products,opinion,"Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   is encouraged by the fact that the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has filed Philip Morris International  Inc  s   NYSE PM   application for iQOS heated tobacco product  The FDA has started reviewing the Modified Risk Tobacco Product application  which was submitted on Dec 5  2016 
On Mar 31  2017  Philip Morris had applied for pre market approval of iQOS heated tobacco product with the FDA  Yesterday  the FDA published the executive summary and research summaries  In addition  the agency will publish additional modules of Philip Morris  MRTP application on a rolling basis  The timeframe for the review of Philip Morris  application is solely at the discretion of the FDA 
Upon regulatory authorization of the iQOS heated tobacco products  Philip Morris USA  a subsidiary of Altria  will have an exclusive license to sell these products in the United States  The tobacco industry is under pressure to replace cigarettes with other alternatives due to the dip in smoking rates in developed countries  Health hazards due to smoking have pushed consumers toward low risk or reduced risk products  To cater to the new consumer preferences  Altria has collaborated with Okono A S and developed innovative  non combustible nicotine containing products for adult smokers  Its flagship MarkTen e cigarette brand  launched in 2014  and Green Smoke e vapor products are some of the examples  MarkTen XL   a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 have been encouraging in lead markets 
At the end of 2016  MarkTen represented about 55  of the e vapor category volume in retail channels  including c stores  In Apr 2017  Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10 000 more stores  Further  it announced the availability of three more flavors for its adult papers   winter mint  summer fusion and smooth cream 
The agreement between Philip Morris Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies  Per the agreement  Philip Morris markets Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and Altria distributes two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products in the U S  The companies have also extended their technology sharing agreement signed in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research  development and technology sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes  Such collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Altria recently reported weaker than expected results in the first quarter of 2017 as both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company kept earnings guidance intact for 2017  The company s strong brand portfolio  shift to low risk  smokeless tobacco products and strong pricing remains encouraging  The company s flagship brand  Marlboro  has been performing well and has boosted its market share 
PM USA  Altria s smokeable subsidiary invests continuously in improving the brand architecture of Marlboro and has upgraded its shopping website   marlboro com   which provides engaging content directly to adult smokers through mobile devices  It is also trying to enhance the brand equity of the Marlboro brand and has offered Marlboro Slate  a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family  Further  it has acquired Nat Sherman  in order to augment the smokeable segment  Nat Sherman s premium  excellent and differentiated brand portfolio  complements the brands in Altria s smokeable products segment 
Further  the recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by Anheuser Busch InBev s   NYSE BUD   helped Altria to maximize the value of its SABMiller investment  It helped to reward shareholders with an expanded share repurchase program  and improved the company s position in the global market 
However  we believe strict anti smoking regulations in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties  along with declining cigarette volumes  remain major headwinds 
A glimpse of Altria s stock performance reveals that its shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized  sector since the past one year  The stock rallied 15 9  in comparison with the above mentioned sector s growth of 6 3  

Stocks to Consider
Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the consumer staple sector is SunOpta  Inc    NASDAQ STKL    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  SunOpta has a long term earnings growth rate of 15 0

190699,412215,PM,Is Altria Group  MO  Poised For A Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   is set to report first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on May 2  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this tobacco maker will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 2 46  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Altria is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 35  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 75 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 74 cents  This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Altria s Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  1 35  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way Are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has declined in the last 30 days  while remaining stable for 2017 
However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents per share for the first quarter reflects a year over year increase of 3 1   Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  4 68 billion for the said quarter  up 19 4  from the year ago period Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Influencing the Quarter
Altria has been reporting upbeat earnings results since the last four consecutive quarters  on the back of company s strong brand portfolio  shift to low risk  smokeless tobacco products and strong pricing  The company s flagship brand Marlboro has been performing well and have boosted market share of the company 
PM USA  Altria s smokeable subsidiary invests continuously in improving the brand architecture of Marlboro and has upgraded its shopping website   marlboro com   which provides engaging content directly to adult smokers through mobile devices  It is also trying to enhance the brand equity of the Marlboro brand and has offered Marlboro Slate  a bold menthol product in the Marlboro Black family 
Further  it has acquired Nat Sherman  in order to augment the smokeable segment  Nat Sherman s premium  excellent and differentiated brand portfolio  complements the brands in Altria s smokeable products segment 
In response to the changing market scenario  the company is also shifting toward low risk  smokeless tobacco products  Its flagship MarkTen e cigarette brand  launched in 2014  and Green Smoke e vapor products are some of the examples  MarkTen XL   a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 have been encouraging in lead markets 
Altria s agreement with another tobacco comany  Philip Morris International  Inc    NYSE PM    under which the latter markets Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and the Altria distributes two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products in the U S  is boosting business of both the companies 
Further  the recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by Anheuser Busch InBev s helped Altria maximize the value of its SABMiller investment  It helped to reward shareholders with an expanded share repurchase program  and enhanced position in the global brewing profit pool 
However  we believe strict anti smoking regulations in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties along with declining cigarette volumes remain major headwinds  Nevertheless  Altria has the potential to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes 
A glimpse of Altria s stock performance shows that its shares have been outperforming the broader  sector since the past six months  The stock rallied 12 4  in comparison to the above mentioned sector s growth of 4 4   Per the latest   the earnings growth for the sector looks decent  While total earnings for the Consumer Staples sector are estimated to rise 2 4   revenues are projected to improve 4 0  

Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Pinnacle Foods Inc    NYSE PF   has an Earnings ESP of  2 17  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

190701,412217,PM,Will Altria s  MO  E Vapor Products Help Lift The Stock ,opinion,"Altria Group Inc   NYSE MO   has been grappling with declining volumes of cigarettes  strict anti smoking regulations by governments globally and currency headwinds  While estimates have been stable ahead of the first quarter 2017 results  shares of Altria underperformed both the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader sector on a year to date basis  The stock gained 6 6  compared with the industry s gain of 14 5   Further  the Zacks categorized  sector rose 6 8  over the said time frame 

We note that the company has been witnessing lower than expected sales in five out of the past six quarters  due to sluggish performance in Smokeable Products segment as consumers are shifting away from traditional tobacco products  Declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti tobacco campaigns and price rise to offset the rising taxes is also hurting cigarette consumption  Moreover  consumers are opting for e cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes  in turn affecting cigarette volume  Governments around the world are also imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies  which are lowering cigarette consumption 
Despite these headwinds  the company s focus on unconventional tobacco products is likely to cushion the stock  Altria is offering several low risk tobacco products which is helping it to maintain share  Its flagship MarkTen e cigarette brand  launched in 2014  and Green Smoke e vapor products are some of the examples  MarkTen XL   a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 has been encouraging in lead markets  At the end of 2016  MarkTen represented about 55  of the e vapor category volume in retail channels  including c stores 
Altria also signed an agreement with another tobacco maker Philip Morris International  Inc    NYSE PM   under which the latter markets Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and distributes two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products in the U S  Additionally  the companies extended their technology sharing agreement in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research  development and technology sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes  The joint venture has made excellent progress on branding and go to market strategies for non conventional cigarettes in the U S  market  On Mar 31  Philip Morris has applied for pre market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which will be sold by Altria in U S   if the FDA grants Philip Morris  request  Such collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products 
Altria has also managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes 
For 2017  Altria remains optimistic and expects to maintain profit on the back of strong pricing power and brand building initiatives  Further  in order to augment its smokeable segment  Altria has taken over privately held Sherman Group Holdings  LLC and its subsidiaries  Nat Sherman  in Jan 2017  Nat Sherman specializes in super premium cigarettes and premium cigars  The takeover is in sync with Altria s growth strategy of expanding portfolio 
The recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   in Oct 2016 helped SABMiller s biggest investor   Altria maximizing the value of its shareholders  Altria received a 9 6  ownership of AB InBev  and approximately  5 3 billion in pre tax cash as per the terms of the acquisition which the company used to reinvest in its core businesses or and return value to shareholders 
The sinful nature of its products is also an advantage for the stock  Tobacco sector in particular has always been interesting for investors  as these sinful stocks always yield handsome returns for the portfolio  Since people smoke both during times of recession as well as economic growth  such stocks are sometimes valued at a higher premium than companies that are more sensitive to economic trends  As a result  these stocks always benefit from the addictive nature of their products Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Zacks Rank and Key Pick
 Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the consumer staple sector is Lamb Weston Holdings Inc    NYSE LW    Lamb Weston has long term earnings growth rate of 3 24  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

190704,412220,PM,Will Altria s  MO  E Vapor Products Help Lift The Stock   Revised ,opinion,"Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   has been grappling with declining volumes of cigarettes and strict anti smoking regulations  While estimates have been stable ahead of the first quarter 2017 results  shares of Altria underperformed both the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader sector on a year to date basis  The stock rallied 6 9  compared to the industry s gain of 15 8   Further  the Zacks categorized  sector rose 7 6  over the said time frame 

We note that the company has been witnessing lower than expected sales in the past five out of six quarters  due to sluggish performance in the Smokeable Products segment as consumers are shifting from traditional tobacco products  Declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti tobacco campaigns and price rise to offset the effect of rising taxes is also hurting cigarette consumption  Moreover  consumers are opting for e cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes  in turn affecting cigarette volume 
Despite these headwinds  the company s focus on unconventional tobacco products is likely to cushion the stock  Altria is offering several low risk tobacco products which is helping it to maintain share  Its flagship MarkTen e cigarette brand  launched in 2014  and Green Smoke e vapor products are some of the examples  MarkTen XL   a variant on MarkTen launched by the company in 2016 has been encouraging in lead markets 
Altria also signed an agreement with another tobacco maker Philip Morris International  Inc    NYSE PM   under which the latter markets Altria s MarkTen e cigarettes internationally and distributes two of Philip Morris  heated tobacco products in the U S  Additionally  the companies extended their technology sharing agreement in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research  development and technology sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes  The joint venture has made excellent progress on branding and go to market strategies for non conventional cigarettes in the U S  market 
On Mar 31  Philip Morris has applied for pre market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which will be sold by Altria in U S   if the FDA grants Philip Morris  request  Such collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products 
Altria has also managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes  Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption  it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes 
For 2017  Altria remains optimistic and expects to maintain profit on the back of strong pricing power and brand building initiatives  Further  in order to augment its smokeable segment  Altria has taken over privately held Sherman Group Holdings  LLC and its subsidiaries  Nat Sherman  in Jan 2017  Nat Sherman specializes in super premium cigarettes and premium cigars  The takeover is in sync with Altria s growth strategy of expanding portfolio 
The recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD   in Oct 2016  helped SABMiller s biggest investor Altria in maximizing the value of its shareholders  Altria received a 9 6  ownership of AB InBev  and approximately  5 3 billion in pre tax cash as per the terms of the acquisition which the company used to reinvest in its core businesses or and return value to shareholders 
The sinful nature of its products is also an advantage for the stock  Tobacco sector in particular has always been interesting for investors  as these sinful stocks always yield handsome returns for the portfolio  Since people smoke both during times of recession as well as economic growth  such stocks are sometimes valued at a higher premium than companies that are more sensitive to economic trends  As a result  these stocks always benefit from the addictive nature of their products Altria Group Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

 Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the consumer staple sector is Lamb Weston Holdings Inc    NYSE LW    Lamb Weston has long term earnings growth rate of 4 19  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

the end of 2013  Likewise  the production index plummeted  while the employment gauge fell slightly As services account for a major portion of the economy  weak growth in the sector  dims hopes of a rate hike in the near term  This led to a rise in treasury prices  dragging yields down  The yield on the 2 year Treasury note  which is most sensitive to rate hike expectations  fell 5 8 basis points

190744,412260,PM,Why No Amount Of Litigation Can Upend Exxon,opinion,"Activist Kenny Bruno thinks he has a plan to destroy Exxon  NYSE XOM  Mobile Corp 
In a January 2016 meeting attended by fellow activists and heavyweight trial lawyers like Matt Pawa  who last year extracted a  236 million verdict from the oil giant  the veteran environmental crusader laid out his precisely crafted mission to starve the  365 billion company of resources  influence  and ultimately  any meaningful hope for profits 
Millions of investors are understandably shaken and left wondering if they should bail under the circumstances  Many already have  judging from the fact that Exxon stock is down 15  from its June 2014 peak of  103 83 
I can t think of a bigger mistake 
The last time we saw this script it led to returns of at least 273  for savvy investors who followed along 
The opportunity could be even bigger this time around 
Exxon s Litigation Wars Remind Me of Big Tobacco s Legal Woes
If climate crusaders have their way   will be put on trial for  quite literally  letting the world burn 
A coalition of 17  and counting  State Attorneys General is taking their vendetta back to the 1970s  challenging Exxon s knowledge of climate science and the impacts of burning fossil fuels  At stake is whether the company a  actually knows what it is talking about and b  is culpable 
The same thing happened to big tobacco 
In 1998  anti smoking activists were convinced that the death knell for the industry had been sounded by the  206 billion that Phillip Morris  J R  Reynolds  Brown   Williamson  and Lorillard would be forced to cough up under a settlement spearheaded by a group of trial lawyers and Attorneys General in 46 states  Forced to curtail and substantially change their advertising  the giant tobacco companies bled billions for more than 25 years and continue to do so today 
For years I ve been hard pressed to think of a more demonized industry  Until Bruno came along  big energy was just a recreational target for fringe activists with a proverbial axe to grind 
But now the social meme has turned from merely one of casual dislike to pure hatred 
Clearly the stakes are getting higher 
As usual  though  there s a silver lining in all this  and it s one that not one in a million investors understands   but should 
The data show very clearly that it pays to ally yourselves with companies under siege  not run from them  for reasons I ll explain in a minute 
Let s return to Altria Group  NYSE MO  for a minute 
When I recommended the company to Money Map Report members in February 2010  Altria s operating companies included 
Philip Morris USA  NYSE PM   the largest tobacco company in the United States  controlling half of the country s cigarette market share 
U S  Smokeless Tobacco Co   which manufactures and markets smokeless tobacco products 
John Middleton  a leading manufacturer of machine made large cigars and pipe tobacco 
It was the poster child for public hatred and media vitriol  The headlines were absolutely terrible 

 Anti Smoking Campaign Announced for Los Angeles County    Santa Monica Mirror
 Teenage Smoking Rates Spur Calls to Renew Anti Tobacco Campaigns    The New York Times
 U S  Predicts Smoking Bans in Every State by 2020    Associated Press

You couldn t turn around without seeing something against smoking  Yet Altria didn t just survive bad publicity and multiple lawsuits   it thrived   and savvy shareholders who bought in as I suggested made bank 
They still are 
Activists  you see  rarely understand the concept of resiliency  What I mean by that is that they become so singularly focused on their agenda that they perpetually misjudge a company s will to survive 
Sure  they get their show trials and  as part of that  big payments and reparations if they re lucky  But  ultimately  public shaming never works on anything other than a short term basis 
Demand simply shifts  the activists achieve a moment of glory  the lawyers make a ton of money  and profits continue to roll in 
Big Tobacco  for example  ran head on into no smoking zones and intense public scrutiny in the developed world where activists controlled the media and anti smoking sentiment took off  For a while  executives acquiesced and played the unfortunate ones  much to public delight 
Then  they did a quick pivot and headed straight to the Third World 
Profits soared 

Source  TheSustainableInvestor net
I recommended Altria because I knew my history   social shaming ultimately fails  blame shifts to consumers  and demand continues unabated   and I believed that Altria s management knew how to court the investors who would make that possible 
How 
Good old fashioned cash 
Altria has increased dividends every year since 1970 with only two exceptions in 2007 and 2008  respectively  That makes it a  must have  for millions of income starved investors at a time when they desperately want yield no matter how it s generated 
The company has paid more than  1 billion in dividends in Q1 2016 alone  and plans to reward shareholders with a payout ratio target of 80  of adjusted diluted EPS  Factoring in double digit earnings growth year over year  this works out to a dividend boost this year of around 8  at a time when the Fed is squabbling about 0 25  0 5  and the 10 year treasury yield representing the so called  risk free rate  is stuck at 1 71  
No doubt you see the logic 
My point is that activists can demonize a sector all they want but as long as the public has to have what they make or the income it produces  the profits will continue 
Applying the same logic  Exxon is a logical buy 
The company has a powerful investment base  is a Dividend Aristocrat   meaning it s been increasing dividends consecutively for more than 25 years   and makes a product the world has to have 
That gives it a powerful investor base  In fact  XOM shareholders received yet another dividend hike at the end of April  up nearly 3  from the previous payout  At this rate  Exxon investors can expect annual payouts of  4 per share within the next five years  according to Dividend com 
That translates into an effective yield of 4 4  for investors who take a far sighted view on Exxon and make their move today while also representing a yield that s more than double that of the average S P 500 company

Like Altria  Exxon is set up for growth 
Exxon rolled out six acquisition and development projects in 2015 that together would bring in an extra 300 000 barrels of production per day   hardly the behavior of a company that s truly spooked by activists or even low oil prices

190747,412263,PM,Altria Versus Reynolds  Tobacco Stock On Fire In Volatility,opinion,"The U S  market is on a roller coaster ride with recent events spiking up volatility  Speculation surrounding the Fed rate hike and volatile gasoline prices triggered by  critical  gas supply are now accompanied by the debate on  Brexit  Uncertainties Persist  Brexit Fear and Fed Decision The recent buzzword in the global economy is Brexit or Britain s exit from the European Union  Recent polls indicate that the  Leave  campaign is stronger than  Remain   A Brexit will start a long and complicated process resulting in a fundamental change in U K  s relationship with the other EU members  This is also expected to increase the cost of trade and services for Britain across international borders  For the world economy  Brexit may be followed by prolonged uncertainty that could dent growth and trigger losses in the global financial market Meanwhile  the Fed did not increase interest rates in its recently concluded two day long meeting following lower than expected U S  non farm payroll data  Moreover  the upcoming Presidential elections are likely to stall Fed s decision of raising the interest rate until Nov 2016 The looming uncertainty has made investors jittery about investing in high risk profile stocks  Moreover  they are resorting to government bonds and gold  But little did

year backed by higher shipments and retail share gains by its flagship brand Marlboro  Supported by lower excise tax  gross profit and operating income increased year over year during the period Altria upgraded its shopping website   marlboro com   which provides engaging content directly to adult smokers through mobile devices  Further  in first quarter 2016  PM USA  the subsidiary of Altria expanded the distribution of Marlboro Midnight Menthol nationally  offering adult smokers a strong menthol flavor  The variant has already received favorable response in the test market  These initiatives helped Marlboro gain a leadership Further  during the quarter  Altria s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC  Nu Mark  stepped up the distribution of MarkTen XL and Green Smoke e vapor products across several lead markets  Altria s joint venture with Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   to develop a modified risk tobacco product is on track and the companies are scheduled to submit application for launching the product to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  by the end of 2016 How is 2016 Going for Reynolds  Reynolds also reported higher year over year earnings and sales in first quarter 2016 backed by increased cigarette and moist snuff pricing  It s impressive brand portfolio of tobacco products helps it to maintain strong business momentum and generate decent profits  Further  the company invests continuously in innovation and brand building  which have helped it to maintain its leading position in the industry What do the Numbers SayIn terms of share price  Altria is racing ahead with a 12 23  appreciation year to date in 2016 against Reynold s appreciation of almost 11 79  However  with regard to long term growth  Reynolds seems to have the lead

190753,412269,PM,White House Rejects FDA Plans For Flavored E Cigarettes,opinion,"Tobacco companies may heave a sigh of relief as the White House has reportedly decided to exclude e cigarettes from a recent anti tobacco regulation proposed by The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  
FDA had announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah and was expected to be effective from Aug 2016 
Per the initial proposal submitted by the FDA to the White House Office of Management and Budget  OMB   tobacco manufacturers were allowed a grace period of 90 days to put a ban on flavored products  The grace period also allows tobacco manufacturers to submit marketing applications  during which they can continue to sell their products 
As per the FDA  there has been a dramatic rise in smoking of typically flavored tobacco products like e cigarettes and waterpipe tobacco among the youth  which might be harmful  Hence  the FDA wanted to restrict flavored e cigarettes along with tobacco products 
If this plan would have been put into effect  flavored e cigarettes would have been removed from the market til its makers got authorization from the FDA 
However  the White House Office of Management and Budget  OMB  scrapped the FDA s planned policy of including flavored e cigarettes in the current law 
Tobacco companies like Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM    Reynolds American Inc    NYSE RAI   and Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   have been penalized for taking recourse to any kind of advertising or packaging that flouts the laws  The global tobacco industry has been facing severe advertising and packaging restrictions on their products for some time

190759,412275,PM,Put Selling  Get Paid To Buy Stocks You Want,opinion,"Forget everything you think you know about buying stocks 
If you re like most investors  you probably research a stock then go to your brokerage account and buy it 
That s fine  but there s a better way  In fact  this method will give you cash to buy whatever stock you want at the price you choose   and at a hefty discount to its current price 
Yes  you read that right  The market will give you cash to buy stocks 
How to Make Money the Second You Buy a Stock
You use a strategy known as put selling   selling  against stocks you want to buy 
And in doing so  you pocket cash in your trading account   immediately   without even having to own the underlying stock 
When you execute this strategy  you re obligating yourself to buy the stock you select for the  strike price  you ve chosen at a specific point in the future 
For that obligation  option buyers will give you cash while you wait  So you ll either make money  or own great stocks at bargain basement prices 
And given that most option buyers lose on their trades while sellers make money  it s a compelling reason to sell puts 
You just need to find a stock that boasts the following characteristics 
It s a solid  blue chip stock 
It s a stock that you d be comfortable owning at the price you select 
So let s take tobacco firm Philip Morris International Inc  N PM  as an example   which certainly fits the bill as a well established  blue chip company 
Grab  425 Just for Making a Trade
With Philip Morris currently trading at about  90 per share  the first job is to decide on a price and time frame for the puts you re going to sell 
This is precisely why you should always pick a stock that you d be comfortable owning in case you re obligated to buy the shares at options expiration 
With Philip Morris  you know you d be buying a stable company that also has the bonus of paying a dividend   4 08 per share annually  
In this example  we ll select the January 2016  82 50 put options  From a technical standpoint  there s some support here if the price drops from current levels  And January expiration gives sufficient time to make the sale worthwhile 
With one options contract equivalent to 100 shares and the  82 50 puts currently trading for around  0 85 per contract  let s say we sell five contracts worth 500 shares  That would instantly put  425 in your account   0 85 x 100 x 5    425  
With the  425 pocketed  you just let the position play out to options expiration 
Then what 
Your Need to Know Scenarios
If Philip Morris remains above the  82 50 strike price at that point  the options will simply expire 
You d keep the  425  you won t be obligated to buy Philip Morris  and the trade is closed  But you can repeat the process with a different strike price or expiration date 
If Philip Morris is trading below the  82 50 strike price by expiration  the scenario is different  You ll then be obligated to buy those 500 PM shares at the predetermined price of  82 50 per share 
You ll then simply own Philip Morris as if you d bought it directly  And you keep the  425 
Do you see now why it s important to select a stock that you d be comfortable owning at a lower price that you pre selected in advance 
Don t simply sell puts on random stocks in order to pocket cash  Make sure they re quality companies that you like 
It s also critical that you don t sell more options contracts than you can afford   Remember  one contract is worth 100 shares  
Also  keep in mind that your broker will need you to set aside a portion of the total share cost   a  margin requirement    while the trade is active in case the stock is assigned to you  The amount varies from broker to broker 
However  if you change your mind or don t want to be locked into owning the stock  you can buy back the put options at any point before expiration 
You d also do this if the options are trading below the price you sold them for   thus grabbing a profit 
Ultimately  put selling is a terrific way to buy stocks for less than their current prices  while earning money from the trades at the same time 
Pretty compelling  right

190760,412276,PM,2016 s Hottest Stocks So Far  Tobacco Is On Fire,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
It s been quite a while since cigarettes were considered glamorous  At least in the developed world 
With a population that grows more acutely aware of health concerns each day  who would have guessed that tobacco companies would be the next stock market buy  Especially because right now  one would be hard pressed to find a medical professional condoning  let alone recommending  tobacco products 
Nevertheless  Philip Morris International Inc  N PM   British American Tobacco PLC  N BTI   Altria Group  N MO  and Reynolds American Inc  N RAI  have all gotten recent thumbs up from investors amid the larger  bear market agitation over the past few months  So  is this a good time to invest in tobacco companies 
Performance
Since the beginning of the year each of the four companies mentioned above outperformed the S P 500  with three out of four posting nice gains for the first two months of the year  Quite a feat  considering market conditions 
Since the first trading day of 2016  Reynolds which owns Newport  Camel  Pall Mall and Kent  among other global brands leads the pack  with a gain of 11 24   Next is Altria Group whose brands include Chesterfield  Parliament  L M and Marlboro which increased by 7 2   The remaining company in the green  Philip Morris International which co owns Marlboro as well as other Altria properties rose 5 08  over the same period 
At the same time  British American Tobacco is down 0 01   while the S P 500 lost 3 24  

A look at each stock s individual performance over the past year  above  tells roughly the same story  Reynolds is the front runner with a 32 98  surge  Philip Morris and Altria grew by 10 07  and 9 45  respectively  while British American and the S P 500 both fell a little over 7   All this excludes dividends  which we ll look at next 
Dividends
One of the major benefits of tobacco company stocks is their handsome dividend payouts  And during a period when markets are turbulent and unreliable  and interest rates are low to potentially negative  a dividend s importance grows tenfold  Too often it can mean the difference between pocketing a gain or watching the value of your investment shrink 
It is worth noting that the average dividend yield for Consumer Goods stocks is 2 47   which isn t bad  But when a satisfactory yield is considered somewhere upward of 3   it isn t so good either 
Top performer Reynolds American hands out an annual dividend of  1 68  for a yield of 3 34  per share  35  higher than the average dividend  Altria gives back  2 26 annually  a yield of 3 67  per share  48  more than the average  Philip Morris pays out an annual  4 08 per share  for a 4 46  yield  That s 80  higher than the average 
However  the tobacco dividend king is  without a doubt  British American Tobacco  Every year  the company s investors enjoy a  5 82 dividend  making for a hefty 5 36  yield more than double the average for this sector 
Each of these companies is also dedicated to giving cash back to their shareholders  Over the past 10 years  each has reliably paid a dividend  Collectively they have a payout ratio of over 70   meaning more than 70  of their annual EPS is handed out to the company s stakeholders as a dividend 
Looking Ahead
Though the U S smoking rate is at an  a CDC study found only 16 8  Americans currently smoke  down from 20 9  in 2005 outside of the US  growth prospects for tobacco companies are considerably stronger  According to a   over half the adult male population in such emerging market countries as China  India  Russia and Indonesia are smokers 


Given that these four countries alone constitute about a third of the global population  there s still a lot of market share to go around 
Overall  tobacco companies are holding a strong position at the moment  Their products are relatively inexpensive  highly addictive  and in countries where alcohol is frowned on for religious reasons  tobacco is the legal  sin  of choice for public occasions  adding to its popularity 
With stocks that perform well  distribute a strong dividend  and are well positioned globally at least over the short term they look poised to succeed  The longer term outlook is muddier  however 
Scientific discoveries and more aggressive anti smoking legislation could cripple tobacco companies eventually  although this could take decades to play out  And ever mindful of the potential loss of market share that might be on the way  tobacco companies haven t been standing still  Fear of obsolescence has spurred them to create their own lines of electronic cigarettes  which now have their own  albeit smaller  niche 
Our conclusion  Right now  tobacco may be bad for your health  but it could be pretty good for your portfolio ",2016-02-29,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2016's-hottest-stocks-so-far-tobacco-is-on-fire-200119795,200119795

Reynolds American  NYSE RAI   last week by announcing the planned launch of the Revo  a  safe  cigarette that heats tobacco rather than burning it  Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  has a similar product in the works for sale overseas  which I highlighted earlier this year 
Yogi Berra  the Hall of Fame  New York Yankee catcher  might have called this a case of d j  vu all over again  Reynolds American launched a similar product two decades ago  but it never amounted to much   Yogi Berra  incidentally  was once  of Camel cigarettes  a Reynolds American brand  
E cigarettes work in roughly the same way  Tobacco is heated rather than burned  and the smoker inhales a relatively harmless nicotine infused vapor rather than a cloud of carcinogenic smoke  The benefit of the Revo is that it looks and feels more like a real cigarette than its electronic competitors do  And while it s far too early to be breaking down profitability  I think it s safe to say that Revo is a better profit model for Big Tobacco  Revo is a real  branded cigarette sold in a pack that can be sold at a premium  not a generic bottle of refill fluid 
I ve been skeptical of e cigarettes   Yes  they could relight Big Tobacco s prospects  But they are just as likely to speed the decline of traditional cigarettes  and Big Tobacco has no durable competitive advantage in the e cigarette marketing free for all 
So  are Revo and its competitors the answer for Big Tobacco 
Not so fast   One of the reasons that Revo s predecessor failed was that multiple states sued Reynolds American for claiming that it was less harmful than a traditional cigarette   Those claims were unsubstantiated by real studies  So  Reynolds will have to be careful in how it markets Revo this time around the wrath of regulators   But neutering the marketing will make it a lot harder to build a following among smokers 
In a best case scenario  Revo might steal a little market share from traditional cigarettes and slow down the long term decline of the industry   But that is the best case  and even under this scenario Big Tobacco volume sales would continue to decline   The more likely scenario is that Revo is a marketing flop that is forgotten in a year or two 
From the tone of this article  you might think that I m a dyed in the wool Big Tobacco bear  Nothing could be further from the truth  At the right price  industries in terminal decline can be great investments if management focuses on returning value to shareholders via dividends and buybacks  But the key is  at the right price    And right now  Big Tobacco stocks are expensive 
Reynolds American trades for 21 5 times trailing 12 month earnings and at a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio  the  CAPE  or  Shiller P E   of 26 0 times earnings   The numbers for domestic rival Altria  NYSE MO   are 22 5 and 24 3  respectively   As a point of reference  the S P 500 trades at 20 0 times trailing earnings and 26 6 times CAPE a valuation that is  
In other words  U S  stocks are very expensive by historical standards  and Big Tobacco stocks are only a hair cheaper that the broader market   And again  this is an industry in terminal decline which should be trading at a substantial discount to the market average 
Disclosure  In the interests of full disclosure  I have very small positions in Altria and Philip Morris International that I have held for years in    But I m not adding any new funds to either  and I recommend steering clear of Big Tobacco at current prices

190768,412284,PM,This Unloved Cigarette Stock Is A Dividend Growth Machine,opinion,"Don t let the rumors fool you   the cigarette industry s decline is greatly exaggerated  The tobacco industry is truly massive  and dominated by a few large players 
Altria  MO  is the 3rd largest publicly traded cigarette corporation in the world by market cap 
Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  market cap   126 billion
British American Tobacco  AMEX BTI  market cap   101 billion
Altria Group  NYSE MO  market cap   96 billion
Before 2003  Altria was known as Philip Morris  The company changed its name and spun off much of its portfolio  In 2007  the company  
Philip Morris International  PM  was spun off in 2008  Philip Morris International sells the same tobacco brands as Altria  but it sells them internationally  Altria sells its tobacco products only in the Untited States 
Toda  Altria owns the Marlboro  Skoal  Copenhagen  and Black   Mild tobacco brands  among others  In addition  the company owns 27  of beer giant SAB Miller  St  Michelle Winery  and Nu Mark e vapor 
Altria s Growth Can t be Stopped
Altria s  reaffirmed the company s growth target  7  to 9  annual earnings per share growth  Businesses in decline simply don t target earnings per share growth in the high single digits 
Since the Philip Morris International spin off in 2008  Altria has grown its earnings per share at a compound rate of 7 5  a year  Not bad for a  declining  business 
What makes this growth more impressive is the high payout ratio Altria has maintained since 2008  The lowest the company s payout ratio has been since 2008 is 75   Altria has managed to grow earnings per share while investing very little into growth 
Some people have the perception that Altria s growth is smoke and mirrors  Share repurchases are often cited as a source of  fake  growth for the company since 2008  In total  share repurchase have accounted for 0 8 percentage points of growth for Altria each year since 2008  That is meaningful  but not the company s growth driver 
Altria s Main Growth Driver
Altria s real growth driver since 2008 has been rising operating margins  The company had operating margins of 26 6  in 2008  Most businesses would be very happy with such high operating margins  but Altria has pushed to become more efficient 
By 2014  operating margins grew to 31 9   The company has squeezed out an extra 5 3 percentage points of margin from its operations over the last 6 years 
Paradoxically  heavy regulation may be causing rising margins  In the past  making money was easy for Altria  The company relied heavily on its advertising expertise to grow sales  Aiming for ever greater operating efficiency wasn t necessary 
Since heavy regulations and industry scrutiny  Altria has done everything it can to continue rewarding shareholders  The drive for higher margins is an integral part of the company s strategy 
Altria has managed to grow margins in two ways  First  the company sells a highly addictive product with excellent brand recognition 
Marlboro is the biggest cigarette brand in the United States   and it isn t close  The Marlboro brand sells more cigarettes than the next 10 brands combined  With severe advertising restrictions in place  the Marlboro brand is relatively safe from competition 
Strong brand awareness and nicotine addiction means consumers will pay higher prices for cigarettes  Price increases have been a significant source of margin gains for Altria 
The company has also streamlined its operations to become more efficient  A focus on cost has also helped boost margins 
How Cigarettes Pay Big Dividends and High Total Returns
Altria is the tobacco market leader in the United States  The company s focus on margins helps Altria grow with little money reinvested into the business 
This frees management to use the company s cash flows to return money to shareholders  Altria s management targets an 80  payout ratio  Every time someone buys a pack of cigarettes  80  of the profits go to Altria shareholders in the form of dividends 
It is no surprise that Altria is a high yield stock  The company currently has a dividend yield of 4 2    more than twice the S P 500 s dividend yield 
Altria s 7  to 9  target earnings per share growth rate combined with its 4   dividend yield gives investors expected total returns of 11  to 13  a year 
Altria Valuation and Final Thoughts
Altria is currently trading at a P E ratio of 18 6  using adjusted earnings   The S P 500 is currently trading at a P E ratio of 20 2  Altria is currently trading at a lower P E ratio than the S P 500  despite having a higher expected total return 
Altria is not a deep value stock  but the company s strong brand based competitive advantage makes it likely Altria will continue to reward shareholders with rising dividends  The company has paid increasing dividend payments for 45 consecutive years  excluding the effects of spin offs 
Altria sells tobacco and alcohol products  The company operates in slow changing industries  People will very likely continue to smoke Marlboro cigarettes and drink Miller beer  Altria s relatively inexpensive addictive products tend to do well during both recessions and times of prosperity 
The company s management is laser focused on rewarding shareholders  The company doesn t have many other uses for cash since it can t expand internationally and has severely restricted advertising possibilities 
The one area Altria is investing for future growth is in heated tobacco and e vapor products  E vapor growth has not met industry expectations  E vapor products tend to be used in addition to cigarettes  not instead of them  The newest attempt at a less harmful tobacco product is the heat not burn system  which heats tobacco and releases nicotine without burning it  thus releasing less carcinogens  Altria and Philip Morris International have partnered in researching heat not burn and e vapor products  Philip Morris  its heat not burn iQOS system in Japan and Italy  Altria will likely release similar products in the United States in the next few years 
Altria is currently a favorite of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing  The stock s 4   yield should appeal to income oriented dividend investors  In addition  the company should continue compounding earnings per share at 7  to 9  a year giving high yield investors solid growth as well  There is some possibility for more rapid growth if heat not burn products take off in the United States ",2015-07-07,Sure Dividend,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-unloved-cigarette-stock-is-a-dividend-growth-machine-257487,257487
190769,412285,PM,Tobacco Stocks Too Expensive To Provide Safety,opinion,"So much for the summer doldrums 
The Chinese stock market has crashed  Greece s ongoing crisis has once again roiled European markets  Puerto Rico is on the verge of default  And Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are getting divorced 
Naturally  investors are seeking safety  and the Pavlovian response to market volatility is to buy  defensive  stocks 
Owing to their relatively high dividend yields and non cyclical businesses  tobacco stocks do fit the bill  Over time  investors have been conditioned to expect a relatively high degree of protection in tobacco industry stocks 
For my purposes  I ll reference the S P 500 Tobacco Composite  a market capitalization weighted index of the following large cap tobacco stocks  Altria Group  NYSE MO   Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   and Reynolds American  NYSE RAI   Lorillard  Inc   NYSE LO  was also included prior to June 2015  when the company was acquired by Reynolds American 
Let s take a look at the performance of the Tobacco Composite during sizable broader market declines in recent history  As a result of the credit crisis  the S P 500 experienced a traumatic peak to trough decline of 57 7   Yet  from its high in 2007 to its low in 2009  the Tobacco Composite only fell 39 9   In other words  cigarette makers had a 31  smaller drawdown 
In 2011  the S P 500 suffered a drawdown of 21 6   The Tobacco Composite only declined 12 4   representing a 42 6  smaller drawdown 
Comparatively  the  sin stocks  held up rather well during both of these episodes  However  here s the catch  they ve now become very expensive 

As you can see from the chart above  both the price to cash flow and price to forward earnings ratios for the Tobacco Composite have risen to lofty levels in 2015  Given the low growth nature of this industry  the valuations for these cigarette makers call into question their risk reward proposition  Furthermore  don t expect e cigarettes to be a savior  as they re likely to cannibalize traditional cigarette sales 
Basically  Altria  Philip Morris  and Reynolds American offer more downside than upside potential 
These cancer stick makers may still be defensive in that they re likely to outperform during a vicious market drawdown  However  there s a difference between defense and safety 
Far too many investors are looking for safety in low beta equities  and  in the process  are pushing valuation ratios to historic levels  Because of these high valuations  I wouldn t expect these names to provide nearly the same degree of security during the next big broader market decline 
Slowly but surely  virtually every corner of the U S  stock market is becoming expensive  and that s very concerning  There s nowhere to hide 
If you re looking for safety  consider a bond fund run by a top notch manager  After all  even cheap  low beta equities aren t a substitute for well selected fixed income securities

190775,412291,PM,Pot Stocks  Sooner Or Later We ll Have To Talk,opinion,I ve been a big believer in vice investing    and particularly tobacco stock investing    for a long time  I turned bearish on tobacco stocks late last year  but this was based purely on price  In my view  tobacco stocks had simply gotten too expensive relative to other dividend paying options    and I would reiterate that view today But if ol  tobacky stocks are unattractive at current prices  what about wacky tobacky stocks Road To LegalityWith marijuana slowly becoming legalized in the United States  at least on a state by state basis   manufacturers and vendors of cannabis are evolving from enterprises of dubious legality into mainstream and regulated purveyors of vice So  if Big Tobacco has been a profitable investment despite its social stigma  might Big Weed get a haircut and get to work for investors Maybe  but I wouldn t count on it Still Just Small TimeTo start with  there is no  Big Weed   All of the players are small companies with names that few investors have ever heard of  Tobacco and marijuana are also vastly different industries with vastly different competitive dynamics  Yes  both could be lumped into the category of  sin stocks   but not all sin stocks are created equal  This requires a little explaining I recently wrote that Coca Cola and Pepsi were the New Big Tobacco  By this I meant that sugary drinks were evolving into a stigmatized industry that is regulated in the interests of public health in the same way that cigarettes are  But I also noted that the stocks of companies operating under that kind of scrutiny can still be wildly profitable to own under the right set of conditions There should be substantial barriers to entry for new competitors  what Warren Buffett likes to call  moats   The company should be financially healthy  strong balance sheet  manageable debt  etc  Management should be committed to rewarding shareholders with rising cash dividends and  to a lesser extent  share repurchases The stock must be cheap Big Tobacco names like Altria  MO   Philip Morris International  PM  and Reynolds American  RAI  easily pass the first three criteria  They just happen to bomb the fourth Weed vs  TobaccoSo  how do marijuana stocks look in comparison The first point is in a state of limbo  There were arguably barriers to entry under the old medical marijuana regime due to the legal hoops that growers and vendors had to jump through  But none of the existing players were big enough to crush new competition  and none had any real name recognition Virtually every human being alive today is familiar with Altria s Marlboro brand or Anheuser Busch InBev s    Bud Light  regardless of whether they smoke tobacco or drink alcohol  But how many have heard of Medical Marijuana Inc  Pink sheets     one of the largest suppliers of medical marijuana  Or Cannabis Science  Pink sheets     one of its biggest competitors  Or for that matter  how many have heard of Growlife  Pink sheets     a leading seller of hydroponic equipment I m betting the answer is not too many  At this stage in the game  there is no real brand recognition to speak of The FinancialsWhat about the other criteria  Are these companies at least financially sound  Do they reward shareholders via dividends and share buybacks Not exactly  All three companies are high risk penny stocks and none pays a dividend  Of the three  Medical Marijuana  Inc   the  blue chip  of the group  has the healthiest balance sheet  but you re talking about a company that generated only  5 million in revenue last quarter And price  Medical Marijuana  Inc  trades for 14 times book value and 24 times sales  To pay those prices for any stock well  let s just say you d have to be heavily under the influence of the company s products Target PriceAt time of writing  Medical Marijuana  Inc   Cannabis Science and Growlife trade for  0 17   0 05 and  0 04 per share  respectively  But a young analyst I interviewed on the matter told me he had a price target of  4 20 on all three I think there was a joke in there somewhere at my expense Bottom Linewhile marijuana stocks may indeed be vice investments  they have none of the qualities that have helped tobacco generate such fantastic returns over the past 50 years  Treat them as a risky speculation and nothing more Sizemore Capital has no positions in any stock mentioned This article first appeared on InvestorPlace ,2013-05-14,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pot-stocks:-sooner-or-later-we'll-have-to-talk-166919,166919
190776,412292,PM,Sprott  I Personally Believe That Gold Has Hit Bottom  Part 1,opinion,Patrick Montes de Oca  PM   This segment is brought to you by Equity Management Academy  Hello  everybody  this is Patrick Montes de Oca  We have the pleasure today of having with us Mr  Eric Sprott  Chief Executive Officer  Senior Portfolio Manager  Eric Sprott has more than 40 years of experience in the investment industry  After earning his designation as a chartered accountant  he entered the investment industry as a research analyst at Merrill Lynch in 1981  He founded Sprott Securities  now called Cormark Securities  which today is one of Canada s largest independently owned securities firms  In 2001 Eric established Sprott Asset Management Welcome to Trading Talk  Eric Eric Sprott  ES   Patrick  very happy to be back again and I look forward to our conversation PM  In testimony last week Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at the program of Quantitative Easing that has propped up the economy  the markets over the past three years might come to an end before Christmas comes around  What is your opinion  what do you make of it  Eric ES  I love the question  because we ve already It s very interesting what s going on in the world right now because here we have massive quantitative easing on a scale much larger in Japan than even we have in the USA and the bond yields have ratcheted up dramatically  Like the yields have gone up more than 200   They ve gone from 30 basis points to  I think  95 or 96  People are seeing through the printing  And the same thing s now happening in the US  where the bond rates  the 10 year bond rates  have gone from 160 to as high as 223 two days ago  I think they re currently around 215  and this is while the Fed is buying  And I  and I m sure the Fed  would have a total understanding that if they ever stop buying the bonds what would happen to interest rates  Because a lot of this stock market is built on the back of low interest rates and artificially low interest rates with the most important word being artificially low  We know that the zero interest rate policy is ridiculous  And one other thing I should say  you said it was helping the economy or some words to that extent  And I can tell you that the zero interest rate policy has had two noticeable and meaningful effects in the US market  one is housing recovered  a little  and auto sales have recovered  Both because they are very interest rate sensitive  The cost of each is very much a factor of the interest rates  With rates going back up here  people are going to find out that there s an immediate effect  a negative impact  on the housing market in the States  and it will also have a meaningful effect on the refinancing of automobiles  Because the interest costs have theoretically gone up by 33 percent as rates went from 160 to 215  So I don t think there s a hope in hell of the Fed tapering their purchases because it would have unbelievable consequences in the bond markets which we ve already seen manifested  both in Japan and in the States within the last month PM  Eric  just to follow that train of thought to quote Bill Gross from PIMCO company Chief Investment Officer on a recent interview   If bond prices go down  stock prices should go down as well  That s simply because the global leveraged trade is dependent on the stable Japanese Yen and the stable J GB yield  and a stable treasury yield and once you produce instability  then that leverage starts to unwind  The housing market starts to get affected  and stocks come down   You ve been singing the same song for the past couple of years  at least since I ve been talking with you  Do you still feel as strong now  I mean obviously  you seem to have very strong opinions on that  and where do you think we re going from here ES  It s always good to step back a little and whenever I m presenting in a room and when I m talking to you and your listeners  I always say to each one of them  do you  in your heart  think that a zero interest rate policy is appropriate  And do you  in your heart  believe that printing money is appropriate  Because if you don t  you shouldn t be playing the game that we re all playing  And the game we re all playing is basically trying to game the Fed  And so we all love buying bonds  As you know there s been this huge interest in bonds here  which I think is being completely misplayed  I mean I tell everybody  you should not own bonds in that environment  and a lot of people say  well  I gotta wait for a real sign that it s not working  Well  we re getting our first sign by the way  And you can t wait  because if you re a long term or even a medium term thinker  you know that interest rates shouldn t be where they are  And if you imaging that rates were where they normally would be  where would the economy be  It would be a basket case  Housing would plunge again  Car sales would plunge again  Government debt would skyrocket  It would just be the worst possible of all situations  We have totally masked the ability of governments to finance themselves with these low  these abnormally low interest rates  If they ever went back up  the interest costs to those countries would skyrocket and suddenly it s out of control  not that it wasn t out of control already  So it would just be a horrible scenario PM  You know  just recently  obviously the bond market has been in a tumble the past few weeks  down about 9 basis points  and obviously rates rising and the prices reflecting what they say is strong economic data  Is this real or   Are we going to see bubbles bursting in world markets  in stocks  bonds  especially in the US ES  We are seeing a bubble burst  The bubble that is bursting  is what s happening in Japan  They announced a good sized QE2 program and the bond market crashes because people see through it and therefore  once the Japanese bond market start going down  then people think  oh my goodness  the Bank of Japan has been buying all these bonds  yet interest rates are going up  How s that work  And then they start getting concerned that the same thing is going to happen here in the United States  And even though Bernanke s buying all the bonds  he still can t keep rates down  They ve gone up 50 basis points here in the last 6 or 8 weeks  and that s with him being almost the sole buyer in the bonds  What would happen if he wasn t buying the bonds  And the comment you made  you suggested  that Bill Gross made  and he goes right to the problem  there s so much leverage in the bond business that when it gets off side  everyone has to start doing things and it brings huge volatility into the bond market  So we saw the volatility in Japan  We re now seeing the volatility in the US bond market  where all of a sudden people are going to scramble because they own these things on a leveraged basis  which of course is ridiculous  as well  and in order to cover off  they re over leveraged  they have to sell the bonds  So as rates are going up  they become the seller and it almost becomes self perpetuating  if they re too leveraged PM  Are we looking at a top on the US dollar ES  You know  Patrick  what  so difficult with that question  I find it almost laughable that we have the Yen  we have the Euro  we have the pound and we have the dollar  and I have no idea  I mean  I wouldn t want to own any of those currencies  They all have their individual problems  I can say to you that it looks to me like the Yen is the worst of the bunch  but I could also say to you  I would say to you and I have written  that as far as I m concerned the US government is bankrupt already  so how would I possibly  in the long run  want to own dollars  You look at the carnage that is going on over in Europe  how would I possible want to own the Euro  And the only reason these currencies look good from time to time  is that they look better  One thing you and I know and most people may not appreciate  is that there is one other currency  and that s gold  And gold has gone up 500  against all currencies in the last 11 years  I grant you that it s gone down recently  but the fact is that it s been by far the best performing currency and if we pull ourselves out of this funk that we re in in the precious metals  that I think we re in the process of doing right now  gold will yet again reassert itself as the place that s way better than any fiat currency PM  Let s talk a little more about gold and silver for a minute  Eric  can you verbalize what you think is happening in the physical gold market as opposed to the vapor market ES  I d be happy to  I have my own views on things and I m  as you know  very much a student of the physical gold market and watching what people are doing in terms of buying and selling  because I wrote an article about gold about a year and a half ago  asking the question  do Western central banks have any gold left  Because you can see all this new demand coming in while at the same time the mining supply has been flat every year for thirteen years  In fact  it s even down last year and I suspect it s going to be down this year  by the way  So how s all this new buying coming in  How s China get an extra 700 tons and how do central banks  which used to be sellers of 400 tons get to buy 500 tons  all in a 4 000 ton market  I can identify 2 300 tons of new buying and that s without using the new data we re now seeing where all of a sudden demand for gold and silver products has been going up by  in April and May  by hundreds of percent greater than the previous year when you look at China  India  the US  the Canadian Mint  I don t think they have the gold they say they have  I was sensing pre the April crash that there were lots of anecdotal stories of delays and shortages and defaults on deliveries whether they be from commercial banks  from commodity exchanges  et cetera  And it was getting quite apparent that there was a problem  So along comes this take down of gold  which has been described as a eighth derivative event  and eight derivative events can only happen once every million years  which probably means it was perpetuated  I mean it didn t happen naturally  in other words  I think the intention of that smash was to have people  to make people  to convince people they should not own physical gold  Unfortunately  for the gold cartel  it totally backfired on them  The buyers came out in force and the volumes that we re seeing are unbelievably large and they re not going to be able to supply delivery ,2013-06-11,Patrick MontesDeOca,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sprott:-i-personally-believe-that-gold-has-hit-bottom,-part-1-170783",170783
190777,412293,PM, It Just Keeps Getting Worse For Big Tobacco,opinion,"The bad news just doesn t stop for Big Tobacco   The industry is no stranger to smoking bans  punitive taxation  and crippling lawsuits  particularly in the United States   But life continues to get more difficult in much of the rest of the developed world too   Let s take a look at new developments coming out of the UK 
In June  the British Medical Association   BMA   voted in favor of banning cigarette sales to anyone born after 2000  The BMA is a doctors  union  not an arm of the government  so its proposed ban has no legal teeth to it   But this is the same BMA that successfully lobbied the British government to ban smoking in public places   The UK s Health Act of 2006  supported by the BMA  made smoking illegal in all government buildings  workplaces  and restaurants 
Whether the ban on British would be future smokers passes or not  the handwriting is on the wall   Western governments  saddled with unaffordable health costs  will not be letting up the pressure on Big Tobacco any time soon  And it s starting to show up in earnings reports   Last week  Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  trimmed its earnings outlook for 2014  citing  among other factors  one of the most potentially devastating regulatory developments in decades  Australia s plain packaging rules  which require all cigarettes  regardless of brand  to be sold in plain  white boxes with standardized font on one side and a picture of a person dying of cancer on the other 
I wrote about Australia s new rules a year ago  see  Judge Tobacco Stocks by Their Cover    predicting that they would be very damaging to Big Tobacco s branding power   As I wrote then 

Longtime chain smokers light up for one very obvious reason  They are addicted to the nicotine  But for casual smokers   those who light up while drinking  for example   the experience matters  too 
I call it the  Rebel Without a Cause effect    the devil may care image that goes along with smoking is part of what makes it pleasurable 
There is a certain appeal to Altria s  NYSE MO  familiar Marlboro logo  But there is most certainly no romance in a plain white box with a picture of a diseased lung on the flip side 

 Sure enough  Philip Morris CEO Andre Calantzopoulos noted that the rules were having an ill effect on Australian sales    With plain packaging  adult smokers do not quit more or smoke less  They do  however  appear to down trade much more readily to lower price  lower margin brands and illicit products  
The UK and Ireland are also seriously considering plain packaging laws  and several other countries are reported to at least be toying with the idea 
Even  vaping   or the smoking of e cigarettes  is under attack   The U S  Food and Drug Administration announced in April that it would be begin regulating electronic cigarettes   And overseas  Britain s equivalent of the FDA will begin regulating e cigs as of 2016   E cigarettes which are safer than traditional cigarettes because of the absence of carcinogenic tar are actually illegal in Brazil  Norway and Singapore 
Remember  e cigs were supposed to  relight  Big Tobacco as the transformative product that saved the industry from secular decline   So much for that idea 
Where does Big Tobacco go from here 
I m not predicting wholesale bankruptcy any time soon  and in fact  I still own shares of PM and  MO in a few dividend focused portfolios I run  But I believe it s important to be realistic here   The industry s ace in the hole rising demand overseas to offset long term decline in the developed world   is looking less and less reliable   Even China the world s largest tobacco user by a wide margin   moved to ban indoor public smoking earlier this year   It is only a matter of time before the regulatory vice is tightened further 
If you own tobacco stocks as part of a diversified dividend portfolio  I think it s fine to continue holding your positions and to reinvest the dividends   But I wouldn t put significant new money into Big Tobacco any time soon  or at least not at today s prices   PM and MO trade for 16 and 19 times earnings  respectively  compared to an P E of about 20 for the S P 500   Given the lousy growth prospects and the virtual guarantee of continued regulatory attacks  I would only recommend making new purchases of Big Tobacco stocks at much wider discounts to the market

In fact  Altria has been one of the most successful large cap stocks all year    up more than 40  from the early February low  So is it immune to a pullback or is there a potential opportunity about to unveil itself  A quick look at the weekly chart below suggests the latter  From that February low at the bottom of the Bollinger bands  it had a long run higher through mid June before pulling back  this time to the center line of the Bollinger bands   also the 100 day SMA  That pullback started when the momentum indicator got overheated 
And that s exactly what s happening now  

The RSI is in overbought territory and the price action is showing some topping action as it has moved outside of the Bollinger bands   Even as a safe haven in a down market  this could pullback to the center line again for a 7 5  gain on a short trade  If you own the stock  it s time to protect it or tighten your stop loss ",2014-10-07,Gregory W.

190786,412302,PM,Rating Breakdown  Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds  By Style,opinion,This report identifies the  best  ETFs and mutual funds based on the quality of their holdings and their costs  As detailed in     there are few funds that have both good holdings and low costs  While there are lots of cheap funds  there are very few with high quality holdings  Without speculating on the cause for this disconnect  I think it is fair to say that there is a severe lack of quality research into the holdings of mutual funds and ETFs  There should not be such a large gap between the quality of research on stocks and funds  which are simply a portfolio of stocks  After all  investors should care more about the quality of a fund s holdings than its costs because the quality of a fund s holdings is the single most important factor in determining its future performance  My Predictive Rating system rates 7400  mutual funds and ETFs according to the quality of their holdings  portfolio management rating  and their costs  total annual costs rating   The following is a summary of my top picks and pans for all style ETFs and mutual funds  I will follow this summary with a detailed report on each style  just as I did for each sector  Figure 1 shows the best ETF or mutual fund in each investment style as of October 12  2012  Large Cap Blend is the only style with a Very Attractive fund  No Small Cap style receives an Attractive or better rating  Figure 1  Best ETFs and Mutual Funds In Each Style Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings GMO Trust  GMO Quality Fund  GQLOX  receives our Very Attractive rating  Four out of GQLOX s top five holdings are Very Attractive stocks  In addition  GQLOX s 0 51  Total Annual Costs place it in the 96th percentile of funds with the lowest Total Annual Costs  One of GQLOX s largest holdings is Phillip Morris  PM   PM earns by Very Attractive rating  This is driven by PM s ROIC of 35 5   placing it in the 96th percentile of our coverage universe  The past 3 years PM has increased its economic earnings margin from 21 6  to 24 4  to 29 6  in 2011  This growth in profitability is impressive on its own  but is especially impressive considering only about one third of our coverage universe has a positive economic earnings margin  In return for this profitability  the market has assigned PM a price to economic book value of  94  While there are legitimate concerns about the future of the tobacco industry  the market expects PM s NOPAT to decline permanently by 6   To place these expectations into perspective  PM has grown NOPAT by 12 4  and 19 0  the past two years  In this case  the market s expectations seem overly pessimistic  Strong profit grwoth and a valuation with expectations for profit decline add up to PM s Very Attractive rating  Figure 2 shows the worst ETF or mutual fund for each investment style as of October 12  2012  The Large Cap style is the only style without any Very Dangerous funds  Dangerous or worse rated funds have a combination of low quality portfolios  i e  they hold too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  and high costs  they charge investors too much for the  lack of  management they provide   Figure 2  Worst ETFs and Mutual Funds In Each Style Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Bhirud Funds  Inc  Apex Mid Cap Growth Fund  BMCGX  is our worst rated fund and receives our Very Dangerous rating  This is due to BMCGX s allocation  it allocates 42 32  of its value to Dangerous or worse rated stocks and only 12 04  to Attractive or better  In addition  this poor allocation comes at a cost  Its Total Annual Costs of 9 74  make it the costliest fund we cover  One of the stocks that makes BMCGX Very Dangerous is Rentech Inc   RTK   Rentech is a provider of clean energy solutions  RTK gets our Dangerous rating because of the incredibly high expectations baked into RTK s stock price  It currently trades at a price to economic book value of 6 89  In DCF terms  this mean RTK must grow NOPAT at nearly 20  compounded annually for 10 years and achieve an ROIC of over 30   versus 8  currently   RTK has never generated positive economic earnings in our thirteen years of coverage  In this case  the market s expectations of RTK s future performance are materially different than its past performance  While these expectations may come to fruition  we prefer stocks like PM with proven past performance and low future expectations  Traditional mutual fund research has focused on past performance and low management costs  The quality of a fund s holdings has been ignored  Our portfolio management rating examines the fund s holdings in detail and takes into account the fund s allocation to cash  Our models are created with data from over 40 000 annual reports  This kind of diligence is necessary for understanding just what you are buying when you invest in a mutual fund or an ETF  Figure 3 shows the best fund based on our Portfolio Management Rating for each investment style as of October 12  2012  Only three Styles earn Very Attractive Portfolio Management Rating  All Cap Blend  Large Cap Blend  and Mid Cap Blend  Attractive or better rated funds own high quality stocks and hold very little of the fund s assets in cash   investors looking to hold cash can do so themselves without paying management fees  Only 2 8  of funds receive our Attractive or Very Attractive ratings  so investors need to be cautious when selecting a mutual fund or ETF   there are thousands of Neutral or worse rated funds  Figure 3  Style Funds With Highest Quality Holdings Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 4 shows the worst funds based on our Portfolio Management Rating for each investment style as of October 12  2012  Actively managed funds rank as the worst fund for every investment style  except Large Cap Value   Investors pay mutual fund managers to pick stocks for them  Even ignoring costs  these mutual fund managers do a poor job investing money for their clients  making their funds dangerous investments for investors  Figure 4  Style Funds With Lowest Quality Holdings Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Investors should care about all of the fees associated with a fund in addition to the quality of the fund s holdings  The best funds have both low costs and quality holdings   and there are plenty of low cost funds available to investors  Figure 5 shows the best fund in each investment style according to our Total Annual Costs rating  An ETF ranks as the lowest cost for ten of the twelve style categories  Total Annual Costs incorporates all expenses  loads  fees  and transaction costs into a single value that is comparable across all funds  Passively managed ETFs and index mutual funds are generally the cheapest funds  Figure 5  Style Funds With Lowest Costs Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings The most expensive fund for each investment style has a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Rating  Investors should avoid these funds and other funds with a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Ratings because they charge investors too much  For every fund with a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Rating there is an alternative fund that offers similar exposure and holdings at a lower cost  We cover over 7000 mutual funds and over 400 ETFs  Investors have plenty of alternatives to these overpriced funds  Figure 6 shows the worst fund in each investment style according to our total annual costs rating  No ETFs rank as the most expensive for any style category  Figure 6  Style Funds With Highest Costs Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Disclosure  I own PM  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock

190787,412303,PM,Divided Stock Idea Of The Week  Philip Morris International ,opinion,Our weekly dividend idea is the global cigarette and tobacco stock Philip Morris International  PM   The Leading Tobacco Stock With 3 98  Yield And 7 7  Upside Potential Philip Morris International  PMI  is a leading international tobacco company  encompassing eight of the world s top 15 international brands which includes Marlboro  the number one cigarette brand worldwide  PMI has become the world s leading international tobacco company and the third most profitable international consumer goods company  While US sales revenues have been in decline as Altria struggles to cope with higher state tobacco tariffs and the tobacco industry s negative image in the US  international sales continue to grow for PMI Philip Morris International s subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America  Its products are sold in approximately 180 countries  The Company divides its markets into four geographic segments  The European Union  EU  Region  The Eastern Europe  Middle East   Africa  EEMA  Region  The Asia Region and The Latin America   Canada Region  In June 2011  it completed the acquisition of a cigarette business in Jordan  consisting primarily of cigarette manufacturing assets and inventories  January 1  2011  it established a business structure with Vietnam National Tobacco Corporation  Vinataba  in Vietnam  further developing its joint venture with Vinataba through the licensing of Marlboro and establishing a PMI controlled branch for the building of its brands  More on Reuters here Philip Morris International is a buy for all dividend growth investors  The company increased dividends over a period of 5 consecutive years with a double digit rate  Dividends grew faster than the earnings per share due to the fact that the company stock up its payout ratio to a current value of 63   After the spinn off from Altria  the company was nearly debt free and raised its loans to banks and other creditors to a current value of  22 4 billion  In relation to the strong operating cash flow  measured by an EBITDA of  14 58 billion  the leverage seems to be ok for a consumer goods company with a high degree of addictiveness  The valuations are not cheap especially if you look the disappointing Q3 figures  the slowing growth an Europe and the reinforcing legal restrictions  On September 12  2012 PMI increased its dividend by 10 4  to 0 85 quarter dividend or  3 40 full year dividend  Analyst s from Morningstar estimated the fair value of the company at  92 0 which include a current upside potential of 7 70   Philip Morris International

190796,412312,PM,A Value Investor s Classic  Phillip Morris,opinion,My last recommendation was new to the value investing club  see Buy CSCO  A Treat For Value Investors   This week  I bring back a classic value stock  Phillip Morris  PM   Focusing on the reported GAAP earnings of PM leads investors down the wrong path  Too many of my peers get lost in debt ratios  quick ratios or price to earnings ratios  These analyses miss the mark and do not capture the strength of PM s underlying cash flows  I recommend investors arbitrage the market s disconnect in valuing PM based on GAAP earnings instead of its true   My model shows that the marke st expectations for PM s future cash flows are lower than the consensus estimates for GAAP earnings  I believe this disconnect arises from the difference between PM s GAAP earnings and economic earnings  Figure 1 shows how PM s economic earnings over the past two years are growing faster than GAAP earnings  One of the differences in economic and GAAP earnings for PM is the hidden  unusual charges that we remove from the company s  marketing  administration and research costs  and  cost of sales   In 2010  we remove  97mm  in 2011  we remove  125mm  The adjustments come from careful review of the MD A section of the company s 10 K report  The biggest driver of the difference between economic and GAAP earnings is the company s improved capital efficiency  which manifests in our model as more revenue per dollar of   Phillip Morris  margins are rising  Everyone can see that  What other analysts are missing is that the company is getting more revenue out of each dollar of capital as well  Figure 1  More Profitable Than Meets the Eye   Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Rising margins and rising capital efficiency drive rising returns on invested capital     A rising ROIC is exactly what investors want to see  Figure 2 paints a pretty picture of PM s rising ROIC over the past couple of years  Note that PM s ROIC is not only rising  but it is also significantly higher than its weighted average cost of capital     which we currently estimate at 5 2   For profitable company s like PM  a high debt to capital ratio is good for equity investors because it lowers the company s WACC  Figure 2  ROIC Easily Exceeds WACC at 5 2   Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As my regular readers know  a profitable company is not always a good stock  To be a good stock  the market s valuation has to imply the company will generate lower cash flows than what I expect  see      PM fits the bill for a good stock  It s current price    90 share  implies a permanent 4  decline in the company s after tax cash flow     The stock is worth over  94 share if the company s profits never grow again  The take away is that market expectations for PM s future cash flows are quite low  Figure 3  Good Company and Good Stock Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings PM fits the bill for a good stock  It s current price    90 share  implies a permanent 4  decline in the company s after tax cash flow    from 2011  The stock is worth over  94 share if the company s profits never grow higher than 2011 s level  Consensus earnings estimates are currently forecasting 6  growth for 2012 and 11  growth for 2013  By focusing on economic earnings instead of GAAP earnings  we find an arbitrage opportunity and can exploit the misguided focus of the majority of investors on GAAP earnings  I am not a smoker and never will be  However  I cannot deny the profit advantage that addictive products tend to have over products that are not addictive  And addictive products not only deliver higher profit margins  they also maintain steadier revenues as large numbers of users are not likely to quit cold turkey even if they know the product is killing them  In other words  I doubt PM s profits will decline as the market price implies  On the contrary  I think PM s growth potential is solid  The company s focus on international markets means it is targeting less mature and less saturated audiences for its products  The Marlboro man is no longer a common sight domestically  but he looms large in foreign markets  Put simply  PM has the strongest brand in one of the world s most profitable products  And it is focused on markets where demand for its products is growing  I see great growth potential  It may be slow and steady  but that is often how the stock market race is won  PM s high profits and low valuation earn it my Very Attractive rating  PM was also recently added to my Most Attractive Stocks list for August  As my regular readers know  I also cover 7400  ETFs and mutual funds  My  leverage the deep research I do on all of the 3000  stocks covered by my firm  New Constructs  The ETFs and funds that allocate 8  or more of their portfolio to PM and get an Attractive rating are  Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP iShares Dow Jones U S  Consumer Goods Index Fund  iYK Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF  VDC Vanguard World Funds  Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund  VCSAX ICON Funds  ICON Consumer Staples Fund  ICLEX    ICRAX  and  ICLCX Disclosure  I am long PM  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector or theme ,2012-08-29,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-value-investor’s-classic:-phillip-morris-134518,134518
